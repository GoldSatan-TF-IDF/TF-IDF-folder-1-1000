phil rickman a crown of lights part one goddess worshippers are particularly concerned with creativity intuition compassion beauty and cooperation they see nature as the outward and visible expression of the divine through which the goddess may be contacted they have therefore more to do with ecology and conservationism than with orgies and are often gentle worshippers of the good in nature deliverance ed michael perry the christian deliverance study group the local people betty was determined to keep the lid on the cauldron for as long as possible which might just the way shed been feeling lately mean for ever the arrival of the old box was no help it turned up on the back step at st michaels only a few days after they had moved into the farmhouse and a week after betty turned twentyseven it wasnt her kind of present it seemed like a direct threat or at least confirmation that their new life was unlikely to be the idyll that robin expected for betty the first inkling of this if you could call such experiences inklings had already occurred only minutes before on that same weird evening the new year had been blown in battered and dripping and the wind and the rain still bullied the hills tonight though it looked like being clean and still and ironhard with frost and robin had persuaded betty to come with him to the top of the church tower their church tower to witness the brilliant winter sunset this was the first time shed been up there and the first time shed ever been into the church out of daylight hours it wasnt yet five pm but evening still came early to the radnor valley in late january the dark side of candlemas and robin was leaning over the cracked parapet to watch the final bloodrush over an otherwise unblemished sky i guess what we oughta do he murmured playfully is shake down that old moon the forest was laid out before them darkening storybook hills bearded with bracken there were few trees misleadingly it had been named forest in the medieval sense of a place for hunting betty wondered how much of that still went on the lamping of hares the baiting of badgers maybe some night robin would be standing up here and would see a party of silent men with guns and dogs and then the shit would fly so uh how would you robin straightened up slapping moss from his hands how would you feel about that you mean now dont you with both hands betty pushed back her wild blonde hair she backed away from the edge which had got her thinking about the death of major wilshire down below about six feet out from the base of the tower two flat tombstones had been exposed beneath a bush blasted back by the gales that was probably where hed fallen she shivered you actually mean out here he shrugged why not he wore his orange fleece and his ludicrous flattened fezthing with tiny mirrors around the side the way betty saw it robin thorogood having grown up in america had yet to develop a functioning sense of the absurd why not betty didnt remember exactly when shaking down the moon had become his personal euphemism for sex but she didnt altogether care for the term because this is you know january we could bring up blankets robin did his abandoned puppy face which no longer worked on betty mother of god i bet its not even safe look at the floor the walls we wind up down in the bloody belfry in a cloud of plaster dust with multiple fractures what happens then aw come on its been here for six eight centuries just because and probably falling apart for most of the last hundred years betty gripped one of the battlements then let go quickly in alarm convinced for a second that a lump of mortar or whatever medieval mixture those old masons used was actually moving underneath it the entire tower could be crumbling for all they knew their funds had run to only a cursory survey by a local bloke whod said oh just make sure it doesnt fall down on anybody and youll be all right they ought to bring in a reliable builder to give the place a goingover before they contemplated even having a picnic up here if they could ever afford a builder which seemed unlikely robin stood warriorlike with his back to the fallen sun and she knew that in his mind he was wearing animal skins and there was a short thick blade at his hip very like the figure dominating his paintinginprogress lord madoc the intergalactic celt hero of kirk blackmores sword of twilight seven hundred pages of total bollocks but it was misty cover designs for the likes of blackmore that were going to have to meet the mortgage premiums until betty dared come out locally as a herbalist and healer or whatever was socially acceptable just i had a sensation of what it would be like afterwards the great visionary artist burbled on unabashed lying here on our backs watching the swirl of the cosmos from our own whereas im getting a real sensation of watching the swirl of tomato soup with croutons betty moved to the steps took hold of the oily rope feeling about with a trainered foot for the top step come on well have years to do all that her words lingered in a void as hollow as these ruins betty could not lose the feeling that this time next year they would not even be here you know your trouble robin suddenly yelled youre becoming sensible before your time what she spun at him though knowing that hed spoken without thinking that it was just petulance that she should let it go well he looked uneasy you know no i dont ok ok making placatory patting gestures with his hands too late wrong word maybe no youve said it now in normal life were not supposed to be sensible because were living the fantasy like were really not supposed to bother about everyday stuff like falling to our deaths down these bloody crumbling steps because theres a guy over there robin said in the field down by the creek its a brook betty paused on the top step hes looking up robin moved back to the rim of the tower hes carrying something a spear of light perhaps betty said sarcastically a glowing trident a bag i think a carrier bag no hes not in the field i believe hes on the footway which of course is a public footpath which makes him entitled to be there naw hes checking us out the sunset made unearthly jewels out of the tiny round mirrors on robins fez hey he shouted down can i help you stop it sometimes betty felt she was a lot older than robin instead of two years younger whole lifetimes older he went away of course he did he went home to warm his bum by a roaring fire of dry seasoned hardwood logs youre gonna throw that one at me all night i can tell probably while were sitting with our coats on in front of a lukewarm stove full of sizzling green pine yeah yeah the wood guy ripped me off he wont do it again dead right he wont first rule of country living show them from the very start that youre not an urban innocent robin followed her down the narrow broken stone steps while being careful not to antagonize them right betty stopped on the spiral looked back up over her shoulder it was too dark to see his face sooner or later she said there is going to be antagonism from some of them at least its a phase were going to have to go through and come out the other side with some kind of mutual respect this is not islington this is not even shrewsbury in radnorshire the wheels of change would grind exceeding slow if theyd ever got around to inventing the wheel so what youre saying making converts could take time we wont live that long tolerance is what we aspire to the ultimate prize jeez youre soooo oh shit betty whirled round hed stumbled on a loose piece of masonry was hanging on to the handrope you ok thirddegree rope burn is all i imagine the flesh will grow back within only weeks she thought of major wilshire again and felt unsettled i was born just twenty miles from here she said soberly people dont change much in rural areas i dont want to cause offence and i dont think we need to you changed its not the same im not from yere as they say betty stepped out of the tower doorway and onto the frozen mud of what she supposed had once been the chancel my parents just happened to be working here when i was born they were from off i am essentially from off off what thats what they say its their word if youre an immigrant youre from off id forgotten that i was not quite eleven when we left there and then we were in yorkshire and yorkshire flattens all the traces curtains of cold red light hung from the heavens into the roofless nave when robin emerged from the tower entrance she took his cold hand in her even colder ones sorry to be a frigid bitch its been a heavy heavy day the church was mournful around her it was like a huge blackened sheep skeleton with its ribs opened out incongruously it actually came with the house robin had been ecstatic for him it had been the deciding factor betty let go of robins hand she was now facing where the altar must have been the english side and it was here on this frigid january evening that she had the flash a shivering sense of someone at prayer a man in a long black garment stained his face unshaven glowing with sweat and an unambiguous vivid fear hed discovered or identified or been told something he couldnt live with in an instant betty felt she was suffocating in a miasma of body odour and anguish no she hauled in a cold breath pulling off her woollen hat shaking out her sheaf of blonde hair go away dont want you cold damp nothing else shook herself like a wet dog gone this was how it happened always without warning rarely even a change in the temperature and its not officially a church any more robin was reminding her he hadnt of course sensed a thing so this is not about causing offence long as we dont knock it down we can do what we like here this is so cool we get to reclaim an old pagan sacred place and betty thought in cold dismay what kind of sacred is this but what she actually said surprised at her own calmness was i just think we have to take it slowly i know the place is decommissioned but therere bound to be local people whose families worshipped here for centuries and whose grandparents got married here and and buried of course there were still about a dozen gravestones and tombs visible around the church and although all the remains were supposed to have been taken away and reinterred after the diocese dumped the building itself betty knew that when they started to garden here theyd inevitably unearth bones and maybe robin said slyly just maybe there are people whose distant ancestors worshipped here before there was a christian church youre pushing it there i like pushing it yeah betty agreed bitterly they moved out of the ruined church and across the winterhard field and then over the yard to the back of the house shed left a light on in the hall it was the only light they could see anywhere although if they walked around to the front garden they would find the meagre twinklings of the village of old hindwell dotted throughout the high bare hedge she could hear the rushing of the hindwell brook which almost islanded this place when like now it was swollen thered been weeks of hard rain while theyd been making regular trips back and forth from their shrewsbury flat in robins cousins van bringing all the books and stuff and wondering if they were doing the right thing or at least betty had robin had been obsessed from the moment he saw the ruined church and the old yew trees around it in a vague circle and the mighty burfa camp in the background and the enigmatic four stones less than a couple of miles away and when hed heard of the recent archaeological discoveries the indications of a ritual palisade believed to be the second largest of its kind in europe it had blown him clean away from then on he needed to live here there you go he bent down to the back doorstep whatd i tell ya he lifted up something whitish whats that it is a carrier bag tesco looks like the individual by the river had one with him im guessing this is it he left it on our step housewarming present maybe its kinda heavy put it down betty said quietly huh im serious put it back on the step and go inside put on the lights jeeeeeeez robin tossed back his head and howled at the newborn moon i do not understand you one minute im over reacting which ok i do i overreact sometimes i confess and this is some harmless old guy making his weary way home to his humble fireside and the next hes like dumping ten pounds of semtex or some shit just put it down robin exasperated robin let the bag fall it clumped solidly on the stone robin unlocked the back door betty waited for him to enter first she wouldnt touch the bag it was knotted at the top she watched robin wrench it open a sheet of folded notepaper fell out he spread it out on the table and she read the type over his shoulder dear mr and mrs thorogood in the course of renovation work by the previous occupants of your house this receptacle was found in a cavity in the wall beside the fireplace the previous occupants preferred not to keep it and gave it away it has been suggested you may wish to restore it to its proper place with all good wishes the local people the local people robin let the typewritten note flutter to the tabletop all of them the entire population of old hindwell got together to present the newcomers with a wooden box with he lifted the hinged lid some paper in it the box was of oak it didnt look all that old maybe a century betty thought it was the size of a pencil box shed had as a kid narrow coffinshaped you could probably fit it in the space left by a single extracted brick she was glad there was only paper in there not well bones or something shed never seriously thought of semtex only bones why would she think that she found she was shivering slightly so kept her red ski jacket on robin was excited naturally a mysterious wooden box left by a shadowy stranger a cryptic note major major turnon for him she knew that within the next hour or so hed have found the original hiding place of that box if he had to pull the entire fireplace to pieces hed taken off his fleece and his mirrored fez the warrior on the battlements had been replaced by the big schoolboy innocent he flicked on all the kitchen lights just dangling bulbs as yet which made the room look even starker than in daylight they hadnt done anything with this room so far there was a belfast sink and a cranky old rayburn and under the window their pine dining table and chairs from the flat the table was much too small for this kitchen up against the wall under a window full of the days end it looked like well an altar for which this was not the correct place and anyway betty was not yet sure she wanted an altar in the house part of the reason for finding a rural hideaway was to consider her own future which soon shed have to confess to robin might not involve the craft the paper looks old robin said well the ink went brown gosh rob that must date it back to oh arguably pre he gave her one of those looks which said why have you no basic romance in you any more which wasnt true she simply felt you should distinguish between true insight and passing impressions between fleeting sensations and real feelings the basic feeling she had especially since her sense of the praying man in the church was one of severe unease she would rather the box had not been delivered she wished she didnt have to know what was inside it robin put the paper still folded on the table and just looked at it not touching experiencing the moment the hereness the nowness and the disapproval of his lady all right hed happily concede that he loved all of this the textures of twilight those cuspy numinous nearnesses hed agree that he didnt like things to be overbright and clear cut that he wanted a foot in two countries to feel obliquely linked to the old worlds and what was so wrong with that he looked at the wild and golden lady who should be rhiannon or artemis or titania but insisted on being called the ultimately prosaic betty this perverse need to appear ordinary she knew what he needed that he didnt want too many mysteries explained didnt care to know precisely what ghosts were nor did he want the parallel world of faerie all mapped out like the london underground it was the gossamer trappings and wrappings that had given him a profession and a good living he was robin thorogood illustrator seducer of souls guardian of the softly lit doorways the box then well sure the box had been more interesting unopened unless the paper inside was a treasure map he pushed it towards betty you wanna check this out she shook her head she wouldnt go near it robin rolled his eyes and picked up the paper it fell open like a fan well its handwritten he spread it flat on the tabletop dont count on it betty said you can fake all kinds of stuff with computers and scanners and paintboxes you do it all the time ok so its a scam kirk blackmore rigged it if it was kirk blackmore betty said the box would have ludicrous runes carved all over it and when you opened it thered be clouds of dry ice i guess oh no whats up its some goddamn religious crap like the jehovahs witnesses or one of those chain letters ok let me see betty came round and peered reluctantly at the browned ink in the name of the father son and holy ghost amen amen amen amen three times dogmatic hmmm betty read on in silence not touching the paper she was standing directly under one of the dangling lightbulbs so her hair was like a winter harvest robin loved that her hair seemed to have life of its own when she stepped away she swallowed he said hoarsely what read poison pen she shook her head and walked away toward the rumbling old rayburn stove robin bent over the document some of it was in latin which he couldnt understand but there was a row of symbols which excited him at once underneath the words in english began some of them he couldnt figure out the meaning however was plain in the name of the father son and holy ghost amen amen amen o lord jesus christ saviour salvator i beseech the salvation of all who dwell within from witchcraft and from the power of all evil men or women or spirits or wizards or hardness of heart amen amen amen dei nunce amen amen amen amen amen by jehovah jehovah and by the ineffable names lord jehovah and so by the virtue of these names holy names may all grief and dolor and all diseases depart from the dwellers herein and their cows and their horses and their sheep and their pigs and poultry without any molestation by the power of our lord jesus christ amen amen elohim emmanuel finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might that we may overcome all witches spells and inchantment or the power of satan lord jesus deliver them this day april robin sat down he tried to smile for bettys sake and because in one way it was just so ironic but he couldnt manage a smile hed have to work on that because this was a joke wasnt it it could actually be from kirk blackmore or one of the other authors or al delaney the art director at talisman they all knew he was moving house and the new address st michaels farm old hindwell radnorshire but this hadnt arrived in the mail and also as betty had pointed out if it had been from any of those guys it would have been a whole lot more extreme creepier more gothic less homespun and dated much further back than no it was more likely to be from those it said it was from the local people whatever that meant truth was they hadnt yet encountered any local local people outside of the wood guy and greg starkey the londonborn landlord at the pub where they used to lunch when they were bringing stuff to the farm and whose wife had come on to robin one time betty had her back to the rayburn for warmth and comfort robin moved over to join her he also for that moment felt isolated and exposed i dont get this he said how could anyone here possibly know about us livenight there were four of them in the hospital cubicle gomer and minnie and merrily watkins and death death with a small d no angel tonight merrily was anguished and furious at the suddenness of this occurrence and the timing gomer and minnies wedding anniversary their sixth cheap black joke unworthy of you indigestion gomer was squeezing his flat cap with both hands as if wringing out a wet sponge and staring in disbelief at the tubes and the monitor with that ominous wavy white line from a thousand overstressed hospital dramas its just indigestion her says like if she said it enough times thats what itd be see always works my min reckons you tells the old body whats wrong you dont take no shit pardon me vicar the greycurtained cubicle was attached to intensive care minnies eyes were closed her breathing hollow and somehow detached merrily had heard breathing like this before and it made her mouth go dry with trepidation its rather a bad one the ward sister had murmured you need to prepare him lets go for a walk merrily plucked at the sleeve of gomers multipatched tweed jacket she thought he glanced at her reproachfully as they left the room as though she had the power to intercede with god call in a favour and then from out in the main ward he looked back once at minnie and his expression made merrily blink and turn away gomer and minnie sixtysomethings when they got married the midlands widow and the little wild welshborderer it was love though gomer would never have used the word equally hed never have given up the single life for mere companionship he could get that from his jcb and his bulldozer he and merrily walked out of the old county hospital and past the building site for a big new one a mad place to put it everyone was saying thered be next to no parking space except for consultants and administrators even the nurses would have to hike all the way to the multistorey at night in pairs presumably with bricks in their bags merrily felt angry at the crassness of everybody the health authority and its inadequate bed quota the city planners who seemed bent on gridlocking hereford by and god for letting minnie parry succumb to a severe heart attack during the late afternoon of her sixth wedding anniversary it was probably the first time gomer had ever phoned merrily their bungalow being only a few minutes walk away it had happened less than two hours ago while merrily was bending to light the fire in the vicarage sitting room expecting jane home soon gomer had already sent for an ambulance when merrily arrived minnie was seated on the edge of the sofa pale and sweating and breathless yow mustnt go bothering about me my duck ive been through worse than this the tv guide lay next to her on a cushion an iced sponge cake sat on a coffee table in front of the open fire the fire was roaring with life two cups of tea had gone cold merrily bit her lip pushing her knuckles hard into the pockets of her coat janes old school duffel snatched from the newel post as merrily was rushing out of the house they now crossed the bus station towards commercial road where shops were closing for the night and most of the sky was a deep blackening rust gomers little round glasses were frantic with city light he was urgently reminiscing throwing up a wall of vivid memories against the encroaching dark telling merrily about the night hed first courted minnie while they were crunching through fields and woodland in his big jcb merrily wondered if he was fantasizing because it was surely minnie whod forced gomers retirement from the plant hire business she hated those diggers a few spare pounds on her sure to be had the ole warning from the doc about that bloody collateral but everybody gets that ennit gomer shuffled panting to a stop at the zebra crossing in commercial road merrily smiled faintly cholesterol yes everybody gets that gomer snatched off his cap his hair was standing up like a small white lavatory brush hers gonner die hers gonner bloody well snuff it on me gomer lets just keep praying how trite did that sound merrily closed her eyes for a second and prayed also for credible words of comfort in the window of a nearby electrical shop all the lights went out ar said gomer dismally through the holeinitssilencer roar of eirions departing car came the sound of the phone jane danced into mums grim sculleryoffice the light in here was meagre and cold and a leafless climbing rose scraped at the small window like fingernails but jane was smiling warm and light inside and like up there up there with the broken weathercock on the church steeple she had to sit down a quivering in her chest she remembered a tarot reader called angela who had said to her you will have two serious lovers before the age of twenty as she put out a hand for the phone it stopped ringing if mum had gone out why wasnt the answering machine on where was mum jane switched on the desk lamp to reveal a paperback new testament beside a newspaper cutting about the rural drug trade the sermon pad had scribbles and blobs and desperate doodles but there was no note for her jane shrugged then sat at the desk and conjured up eirion who wasnt conventionally goodlooking well actually he wasnt goodlooking at all in some lights and kind of stocky and yet ok it was the smile you could get away with a lot if you had a good smile but it was important to ration it bring it out too often and it became like totally inane and after a while it stopped reaching the eyes which showed insincerity jane sat and replayed eirions smile in slow motion it was a good one it always started in the eyes eirion the name remained a problem basically too much like irene didnt the welsh have some totally stupid names for men dilwyn that was another welsh womens names on the other hand were cool angharad sian rhiannon he was certainly trying hard though like no way had he just happened to be passing janes school at chuckingout time hed obviously slipped away early from the cathedral school in hereford through some kind of uppersixth privilege and raced his ancient heap nine or ten miles to moorfield high before the buses got in claiming hed had to deliver an aunts birthday present and ledwardine was on his way home total bullshit and the journey to ledwardine eirion had really spun that out having to go slow he said because he didnt want the hole in his exhaust to get any bigger in the end the bus wouldve been quicker but then as jane was climbing out of his car outside the vicarage hed mumbled maybe i could call you sometime which ok jane austen could have scripted better yeah ok shed said cool understated managing to control the burgeoning grin until shed made it almost to the side door of the vicarage and eirion was driving away on his manky silencer the phone went again mum had to be jane grabbed at it ledwardine vicarage how may we help you if you wish to book a wedding press three to pledge a tenthousandpound donation to the steeple fund press six is that the reverend watkins womans voice and not local not sophie at the office and not mum being smart uhoh im afraid shes not available right now jane said im sorry when will she be available the woman sounding a touch querulous but nothing threatening there was this deadly mor computer music in the background plus nonecclesiastical office noise ten to one some timewasting doubleglazing crap or maybe the church times looking for next weeks page three clerical temptress for dirty old canons to pin up in their vestries i should try her secretary at the bishpal tomorrow jane said im sorry the bishops palace in hereford if you ask for sophie hill most of the time it was a question of protecting mum from herself if you were a male vicar you could safely do lofty and remote part of the tradition but an uncooperative female priest was considered a snotty bitch look a bit ratty now it is important also important she doesnt die of some stressrelated condition i mean like important for me dont imagine youd have to go off and live with your rightwing grandmother in cheltenham who are you anyway could almost hear the woman counting one two three through gritted teeth my names tania beauman from the livenight television programme in birmingham oh hey seriously seriously tania beauman said grimly jane was like horribly impressed jane had seen livenight four times livenight was such total crap and below the intelligence threshold of a cockroach but compulsive viewing oh yeah livenight jane said correct where you have the wife in the middle and the husband on one side and the toyboy lover on the other and about three minutes to midnight one finally gets stirred up enough to call the other one a motherfucker and then fights are breaking out in the audience and the presenter looks really shocked although you know hes secretly delighted because itll all be in the sun again that livenight yes tania said tightly you want her on the programme yes and as it involves next weeks programme we dont have an awful lot of time to play with is she in no but im merrily watkinss personal assistant and i have to warn you she doesnt like to talk about the other stuff which is what this is about right the rev spooky watkins from deliverance tania didnt reply i could do it of course if the money was ok i know all her secrets id be very good and controversial ill call anyone a motherfucker thank you very much tania said drily we will bear you in mind when you turn twelve im sixteen just tell her i called have a good night jane grinned that was all eirions fault making her feel cool in the silence of the scullery the phone went again jane mum hey guess wh listen flower mum said ive got bad news loved like that so like how long will you be i just dont know flower we came here in gomers land rover it was all a bit of a rush she was never ill was she jane said like really never the kids voice was suddenly high and hoarse you cant count on anything can you not even you merrily sighed everybody thought she could pull strings gomer and minnies bungalow had become like the kids second home in the village minnie the closest shed ever had to an adopted granny flower ill have to go im on the pay phone in the corridor and ive no more change as soon as i get to know something shes not even all that old i mean sixtysomething whats that nobody these days jane broke off remembering perhaps how young her own father had been when his life was sliced off on the motorway that night but that was different his girlfriend was in the car too and the hand of fate was involved there in janes view minnies strong shell fight it merrily said she isnt going to win though is she i can tell by your voice wheres gomer gone back in to be with her hows he taking it well you know gomer you wouldnt want him prowling around in your sickroom gomer in retirement groomed the churchyard cleared the ditches looked out for merrily when uncle ted was doing devious seniorchurchwarden things behind her back and dreamed of the old days the great rampaging days of gomer parry plant hire hell just smash the place up or something if they let her die jane concurred bleakly meaning she herself would like to smash something up possibly the church how many hours had they been here hospitals engendered their own time zones merrily hung up the phone and turned back into the illlit passage teeming now visiting hours once shed had a dream of purgatory and it was like a big hospital a brightly lit brueghel kind of hospital with all the punters helpless in operation gowns and the staff scurrying around feeding a central cauldron steaming with fear merrily from a trio of nurses one detached herself and came across eileen i thought you were over at the other place you get moved around well all end up in one place anyway if they ever finish building it and wont that be a fockin treat eileen cullen put out a forefinger lifted merrilys hair from her shoulder youre not wearing your collar reverend you finally dump the auld feller or what were still together merrily said and its still hot jesus thats disgusting actually i had to leave home in a hurry merrily spotted gomer coming out of the ward biting on an unlit cigarette for comfort i came with a friend his wifes had a serious heart attack unexpected you wont say anything cynical will you whats his name sister cullen was crophaired and angular and claimed to have left ulster to escape from bloody religion gomer gomer parry well then mr parry cullen said briskly as gomer came up blinking dazedly behind his bottle glasses you look to me to be in need of a cuppa with a drop of something in there to take away the taste of machine tea am i right she beckoned one of the nurses over kirsty would you take mr parry to my office and make him a special tea stuffs in my desk bottom drawer gomer glanced at merrily she moved to follow him but cullen put out a restraining hand not for you reverend youve got your god to keep your spirits up spare me a minute a minute pity youre out of the uniform still its the inherent holiness that counts all it is weve got a poor feller in a state of some distress and itll take more than special tea to cope with him you know what im saying merrily frowned thinking inevitably of the first time shed met eileen cullen across town at hereford general which used to be a lunatic asylum and for one night had seemed in danger of reverting back ah no said cullen you only get one of those in a lifetime this isnt even a patient more like your man gomer here with the wife and i dont know what side of the fence hes on but id say hes very much a religious feller and would benefit from spiritual support for an atheist youve got a lot of faith in priests no ive got faith in women priests which is not much at all to do with them being priests what would you have done if i hadnt been here cullen put her hands on her narrow hips well yare here love so wheres the point in debating that one the corridor had cracked walls and dim economy lighting id be truly happy about leaving this dump behind cullen said if i didnt feel sure the bloody suits were building us a whole new nightmare whats his name this bloke mr weal first name we dont know hes not a man whos particularly forthcoming terrific he seen paul hutton the hospital chaplain maybe cullen shrugged i dont know but youre on the spot and he isnt what i thought was you could perhaps say a prayer or two hes welsh by the way whats that got to do with the price of eggs well he might be chapel or something theyve got their own ways youll need to play it by ear on that you mean in case he refuses to speak to me in english not welsh like that hes from radnorshire about half a mile over the border if that gosh almost normal then hmm cullen smiled merrily followed her into a better lit area with compact fourbed wards on either side mainly elderly women in them a small boy shuffled in a doorway looking bored and aggressively crunching crisps so whats the matter with mrs weal stroke bad one you might say that oh and when youve said a wee prayer with him you could take him for a coffee eileen its surely the christian thing to do cullen said lightly they came to the end of the passage where there was a closed door on their right cullen pushed it open and stepped back she didnt come in with merrily she was out of there fast pulling the door shut behind her she leaned against the partition wall her lips made the words nothing audible came out shes dead cullen shrugged seen one before have you not you couldve explained couldve sworn i did sorry and the rest of it ah quite what shed seen replayed itself in blurred images like a robbery captured on a security video the bedclothes turned down the white cotton nightdress slipped from the shoulders of the corpse the man beside the bed leaning over his wife heavy like a bear some ungainly predator he hadnt turned around as merrily entered nor when she backed out she moved quickly to shake off the shock pulling eileen cullen a few yards down the passage what in gods name was he doing ah well cullen said would he have been cleaning her up now on account of the nhs cant afford to pay people to take care of that sort of thing any more cullen tutted on seeing a tea trolley abandoned in the middle of the corridor yes merrily said cullen pushed the trolley tidily against a wall there now she said well the situation merrily is that hes been doing that kind of thing for her ever since she came in three days ago wouldnt let anyone else attend to her if he was around and hes been around most of the time he asks for a bowl and a cloth and he washes her very tenderly reverently you might say i saw and then hell wash himself his face his hands in the same water it looked awful touching at first hed also insist on trying to feed her when it was still thought she might eat and hed be feeding himself the same food like you do with babies to encourage her how longs she been dead half an hour give or take she was a bit young for a stroke plainly and he naturally couldnt come to terms with that at his age he was probably convinced shed outlive him by a fair margin but there you go overattentive overpossessive what you will and now maybe he cant accept shes actually dead i dunno it looked ritualistic almost like an act of worship or did i imagine that merrily instinctively felt in her bag for her cigarettes before remembering where she was eileen what do you want to happen here cullen folded her arms well on the practical side which is all youre concerned about naturally absolutely on the practical side goes without saying we need the bed so we need to get her down to the mortuary soon and that means persuading your man out of there first hed stay with her all night if we let him the other night an auxiliary came in and found him lying right there on the floor beside the bed fast asleep in his overcoat for heavens sake god merrily pushed her hands deep down into the pockets of janes duffel to be loved like that not altogether sure what she meant cullen sniffed so youll go back in and talk to him mumble a wee prayer or two apply a touch of christian tenderness and then employing the tact and humanity for which youre renowned and which were not gonna have time for just get him the fock out of there yeah i dont know if its all helping him deal with his grief youre wimping out right fair enough no problem merrily put down her bag on the trolley just keep an eye on that well she didnt know too much about rigor mortis but she thought that soon it wouldnt be very easy to do what was so obviously needed we should close her eyes merrily said dont you think she put out a hesitant hand towards mrs weal thumb and forefinger spread the times shed done this before were always in the moments right after death when there was still that lightsmoke sense of a departing spirit but oh god what if the womans eyelids were frozen fast you will mr weal said slowly leave her alone merrily froze he was standing sentrystiff a very big man in every physical sense his face was broad and he had a ridged roman nose and big cheeks reddened by broken veins a farmers face his greying hair was strong and pushed back stiffly without looking at her he said what is your purpose in being here madam my names merrily she let her hand fall to her side im the vicar of ledwardine so i was just i happened to be in the building and the ward sister asked me to look in she thought you might like to talk could be a stupid thing to say if there ever was a man who didnt like to talk this was possibly him between them his wifes eyes gazed nowhere not even into the beyond they were filmed over colourless as the water in the metal bowl on the bedside table and they seemed the stillest part of her hed pulled the bedclothes back up so that only her face was on show she looked young enough to be his daughter she had light brown hair and she was pretty merrily imagined him out on his tractor thinking of her waiting for him at home wife number two probably a prize mr weal look im sorry i dont know your first name his eyes were downcast to the body he wore a green suit of hairy heavy tweed mister he said quietly oh she stepped away from the bed right well im sorry i didnt mean to upset you any further there was a long silence the water bowl made her think of a font of last rites a baptism of the dying then he squinted at her across the corpse he blinked once which seemed curiously to release tension and he grunted jw weal my name she nodded it had obviously been a mistake to introduce herself just as merrily like some saleswoman coldcalling how long had you been married mr weal again he didnt reply at once as though he was carefully turning over her question to see if a subtext dropped out nine years near enough yerrs he said his voice was higher than youd expect given the size of him and brushed soft merrily said we never know whats going to come do we she looked down at mrs weal whose face was somehow unrelaxed or maybe merrily was transferring her own agitation to the dead woman who was perhaps her own age mid to late thirties maybe a little older shes very pretty mr weal why wouldnt she be dull light had awoken in his eyes like hot ashes raked over people probably had been talking jw weal getting himself an attractive young wife like that merrily wondered if there were grownup children from some first mrs weal a certain sourness in the hills she swallowed do you er belong to a particular church cullen was right he looked like the kind of man who would do if only out of tradition and a sense of rural protocol mr weal straightened up she reckoned he must be close to six and a half feet tall and built like a great stone barn his eyebrows met forming a stonegrey lintel that i think is my personal business thank you right well she cleared her throat would you mind if i prayed for her perhaps we could pray together she was about to say but mr weal stopped her without raising his voice which despite its pitch had the even texture of authority i shall pray for her merrily nodded feeling limp this was useless there was no more she could say nothing she could do here that eileen cullen couldnt do better well im very sorry for the intrusion he didnt react just looked at his wife for him there was already nobody else in the room merrily nodded and bit her lip and walked quietly out badly needing a cigarette no eileen cullen levered herself from the wall hopeless cullen led her up the corridor well away from the door id hoped to have him away before mennas sister got here im not in the best mood tonight for mopping up after tears and recriminations sorry whose sister mennas mrs weals the sisters mrs buckingham and shes from down south and a retired teacher and theres no arguing with her and no love lost between her and that man in there oh dont ask i dont know i dont want to know what was menna like i dont know except for what i hear she wasnt doing much chatting when they brought her in but even if shed been capable of speech i doubt youd have got much out of her lived in the sticks the whole of her life looking after the ole father like a dutiful childs supposed to when her older and wiser sisters fled the coop father dies she marries an obvious father figure sad story but not so unusual in a rural area wheres this exactly i forget the welsh side of kington sheepshagging country charming they have their own ways and they keep closed up the amiable voluble gomer parry of course was originally from the radnor valley but this was no time to debate the pitfalls of ethnic stereotyping how did she come to have a stroke do you know youre not on the pill yourself merrily er no that would be my first thought with menna still on the pill at thirtynine it does happen her doctor shouldve warned her wouldnt mr weal have known the dangers he look like he would cullen handed merrily her bag thanks for trying you did your best dont go having nightmares hes just a poor feller loved his wife to excess ill tell you one thing merrily said i think hes going to need help getting his life back on track thats the kind of guy who goes back to his farm and hangs himself in the barn if he had a barn i thought he was a farmer i dont think i said that did i whats he do then not a copper built like one sure no hes a lawyer as it happens listen im gonna have a porter come up and well do it the hard way a solicitor cullen gave her a shrewd look she knew sean had been a lawyer that merrily herself had been studying the law until the untimely advent of jane had pushed her out of university with no qualifications the difficult years preordination mans not used to being argued with outside of a courthouse cullen said you go back and find your wee friend well sort this now walking back towards intensive care shouldering her bag she encountered gomer parry smoking under a red no smoking sign in the main corridor he probably hadnt even noticed it he slouched towards her hands in his pockets ciggy winking between his teeth like a distant stoplight sorry about that gomer i was mays well get off home vicar keepin you up all night dont be daft ill stay as long as you stay ar well no point see gomer said he looked small and beaten hollow no point now the scene froze oh god shed left him barely half an hour to go off on a futile errand which she wasnt up to handling and in her absence in the scruffy silence of the hospital corridor she thought she heard minnie parry at her most comfortably brummy yow dont go worrying about us my duck were retired got all the time in the world to worry about ourselves instinctively she unslung her bag plunged a hand in but gomer was there first have one o mine vicar extrahigh tar see repaganization tuesday began with a brown fog over the windows like dirty lace curtains the house was too quiet they ought to get a dog two dogs robin had said after breakfast before going off for a walk on his own hed end up inevitably at the church just to satisfy himself it hadnt disappeared in the mist he would walk all around the ruins and the ruins would look spectacularly eerie and robin would think yes from the kitchen window betty watched him cross the yard between dank and oily puddles then let himself into the old barn where theyd stowed the oak box robin also thought it was seriously cool having a barn of your own hey how about i stash this in the barn when she was sure he wouldnt be coming back for a while betty brought out from the bottom shelf of the dampest kitchen cupboard the secret copy shed managed to make of that awful witch charm shed done this on robins photocopier while hed gone for a tour of old hindwell with george and vivvie their weekend visitors who for several reasons she could have done without betty now took the copy over to the window sill produced in high contrast for definition it looked even more obscurely threatening than the original first the flashvision of the praying man in the church then this o lord jesus christ saviour salvator i beseech the salvation of all who dwell within from witchcraft and from the power of all evil amen amen amen dei nunce amen amen amen amen amen ritualistic repetition a curious mixture of catholic and anglican and also by jehovah jehovah and by the ineffable names holy names elohim emmanuel jewish mysticism the kabbalah a strong hint of ritual magic and then those symbols planetary betty thought astrological it was bizarre and muddled a nineteenthcentury cobbling together of christianity and the occult and it seemed utterly genuine it was someone saying we know about you we know what you are and we know how to deal with you inside the barn the mysterious box was still there tucked down the side of a manger all the hassle it was causing with betty robin had been kind of hoping the local people would somehow have spirited this item away again it was cute it was weird but it was essentially a crock of shit a joke right the local people hed found he was beginning to think of the local people the way the irish thought of the little people shadowy mischievous willothewispish a different species robin had established that the box did originally come from this house or at least there were signs of an old hiding place inside the livingroom inglenook new cement where a brick had been replaced so was this the reason betty had resisted the consecration of their living room as a temple because it was there that the antiwitchcraft charm had been secreted bettys behaviour had been altogether difficult most of the weekend george webster and his lady the volatile vivvie craftbuddies from manchester had come down on saturday to help the thorogoods get the place together and hadnt left until monday afternoon it ought to have been a good weekend with loud music wine and the biggest fires you could make out of resinous green pine but betty had kept on complaining of headaches and tiredness which wasnt like her at all as a celebratory climax robin had wanted the four of them to gather at the top of the tower on sunday night to welcome the new moon but wouldnt you know it was overcast cold and raining and betty had kept on and on about safety like would that old platform support as many as four people what did she think that he was planning an orgy standing by the barn door robin could just about see the top of the tower atmospherically wreathed in fog one day soon he would produce a painting of it in blurry watercolour style of turner and mail it to his folks in new york this is a sketch of the church did i mention the ancient church we have out back and ancient was right this was the real thing the wedge of land overlooking the creek the glorious plot on which the medieval church of st michael at old hindwell had been built by the goddamn christians was most definitely an ancient pagan sacred site george webster had confirmed it and george had expertise in this subject just take a look at these yew trees robin still roughly forming a circle that one and that one could be well over a thousand years old redhaired beardy george running his hands down the ravines in those huge twisting trunks and then cutting some forks of hazel so he and robin could do some exploratory dowsing what you did you asked questions were there standing stones here was this an old burial place prechristianity how many bodies are lying under here and you waited for the twig to twitch in response admittedly a response didnt happen too often for robin but george was adept no thered been no stones but perhaps wooden poles a woodhenge kind of arrangement where the yews now grew and yes there had been prechristian burials here george made it plus bodies at one time but the area had been excavated and skeletons taken away for reburial before the church sold off the site so there was the possibility that some pagan people been taken away for christian burial the arrogance of those bastards what happened way back when the christians were moving into britain was some smartass pope had decreed that they should place their churches on existing sites of worship this served two purposes it would demonstrate the dominance of the new religion over the old and if the site was the same that might persuade the local tribes to keep on coming there to worship but that was all gonna be turned around at last boy was it robin stood down by the noisesome water lining up the church with burfa hill site of an iron age camp he couldnt remember when outside of a rite hed last felt so exalted sure it only backed up what hed already instinctively known from standing up top of the tower the other night but hell confirmation was confirmation he and betty had been meant to come here to revive a great tradition it was about repaganization they hadnt talked too much about longterm plans but especially after the weekends discoveries it was obvious these would revolve around in some way reinstating the temple which had stood here before there ever was a christian church physically this process had already begun the church had fallen into ruins if this continued one day only the tower would remain a single great standing stone beautiful so why wasnt betty similarly incandescent with excitement why so damn moody so much of the time was it that box hed wanted to tell george and vivvie about the box and what it contained but betty had come on heavy swearing him to silence its no one elses problem its between us and them we have to find our own way of dealing with it them like who she was paranoid and also he knew still spooked about what had happened to major wilshire from whose widow theyd bought this place the major had died after a fall from a ladder hed erected up the side of the tower hearing the story george webster whod drunk plenty wine by then had begun speculating about the site having a guardian and maybe needing a sacrifice every so many years maybe they could find out if anyone else had died in accidents here at which point robin had beckoned george behind the barn and told him to keep bullshit ideas like that to himself besides if there was any residual atmospheric stress resulting from that incident robin figured the best answer would be to do something positive on the tower itself to put things right and as soon as possible some kind of ritual betty would know back in the house he placed the oak box on the kitchen table bettys seagreen eyes narrowed in suspicion we have to deal with this bets robin told her then we forget about it for ever but not necessarily now betty said irritably but robin was already reading aloud the charm again the parts of it he could decipher he suspected betty could interpret some of those symbols as well as being more psychically developed her esoteric knowledge was a good deal deeper and more comprehensive than his own but she was not being overhelpful here to say the fucking least ok he conceded so its probably complete bullshit i guess these things mustve been real commonplace at one time like hanging a horseshoe on your gate yes betty said with heavy patience im sure if we make enquiries well find out that there was a local wise man they called them conjurors in these parts they were probably still going strong in the nineteenth century like a shaman something like that someone who dealt in spells and charms if a couple of dozen lambs went down with sheepscab or something the farmer would start whingeing about being bewitched and call in the conjuror it was usually a man probably because farmers hereabouts didnt like dealing with women the conjuror would probably write out a charm to keep in the fireplace and everyone would be happy there you go we just happened to be exposed to this one when we were overtired and stressedout and ready to leap to gross conclusions betty nodded noncommittally against the murk of the morning she was looking a little more vital in her big red mohair sweater and her moon talisman shed already gotten sweating piles of pine logs stacked up both sides of the rayburn yesterday she and vivvie had hung chinese lanterns on the naked bulbs and called down blessings but when george had suggested consecrating the temple in the living room itself betty had resisted that not something to be rushed into give the house spirits time to get to know them which had sounded unusually fey for betty you know if id followed my first instinct when i spotted that guy from the tower idve run down directly and caught him dumping the carrier bag betty shook her head if whoever it was had come face to face with you on the doorstep hed just have made some excuse like seeing lights in the house coming over to check everything was ok hed have pretended the bag was his shopping and just taken it away with him he didnt argue she was usually right he put his hands on the box closed his eyes imagined other hands on the box tried for a face i did that already betty said offhand nothing obvious robin opened his eyes if shed tried it and gotten nothing then there was nothing to be had he had no illusions about which of them was the most perceptive in that way he didnt mind he still had his creative vision put it back now huh rob in the fireplace in the barn dickhead lets not take any chances not till we know where its been ha he sprang back you just have to know dontcha id quite like to know betty said casually bets he walked over took her tenderly by the shoulders look at me listen what the fucks it matter if someone does know were pagans what kind of big deal is that these days no problem at all betty said if you live in islington or somewhere in a place like this still no problem is my guess bets this is not you its me does the overreacting me who wont leave the house if theres only one magpie out in the garden im telling you this is a good place were meant to be here we came at the right time meant right ordained making the church site into a sacred place again all of that betty gently disengaged his hands i thought i might go and see mrs wilshire the note says the previous occupant preferred not to keep it and gave it away so presumably theyre talking about mrs wilshire or more likely her husband he was an old soldier hed have thought this was pure bullshit before he died betty said whooo robin flung up his hands backed away as if from an apparition dont you start with that they didnt even get to live here did they they get the place halfrenovated and then the poor old major is gone crash bang robin spread his arms bets its like its an ill wind its a big pile of ifs if the wilshires had gotten all the renovation work done everything smoothed out and shiny and then put the place on the market itdve been way out of our price league if people hereabouts hadnt been put off by the tragic reasons for the sale there mightve been some competition if it hadnt gone on sale in november all the holidayhomeseekers from london woulda been down here if if if what can i say all the ifs were in our favour but if it makes you feel better ok lets go see her when what the widow wilshire oh no actually i thought id go alone she struck me as a timid kind of person and i would spook her we dont want to look like a delegation anyway youve work to do i do i have work the kirk blackmore artwork was complete and would now be couriered by special arrangement not to the publishers but to kirk himself but the idea of producing a painting of the church fogswathed had gotten hold of robin and if he mentioned it to betty shed be like if youve got time for that youve got time to emulsion a wall but while she was gone he could knock off a watercolour sketch of the church he was already envisioning a seasonal series a whatever you called a triptych when there were four of them besides betty walked to the door then turned back with a swirl of her wildcorn hair im sure there are lots of new things you want to play with without me on your back robin managed a grin with betty around it was sometimes like your innermost thoughts were written in neon over your head sometimes even for a high priestess this broad was awesomely spooky and so beautiful face it if he really thought there was an element of risk here any danger of it turning into an unhappy place they would be out of here no matter how much money they lost on the deal but that wasnt going to happen that wasnt a part of the package how theyd come to find this place was in itself too magical to ignore the prophecy the arrival of the house particulars within the same week the offer of the blackmore contract along with the possibility of a megadeal for the backlist it was like the road to down here had been lit up for them and if they let those lights go out well that would really attract some bad karma the local people assholes forget them every pillar in the cloister paganism the bishop spooned mustard on to his hot dog what do we have to say about paganism as little as possible merrily suggested the bishop put down his spoon on sophies desk exactly he nodded and went on nodding like she thought one of those brushedfabric boxer dogs motorists used to keep on their parcel shelves absolutely right the email on the computer screen concluded the programme will take the form of a live studio discussion and protagonists will probably include practising witches possibly druids and fundamentalist clergy would you please confirm asap with the programme researcher tania beauman in birmingham so its a no then fine merrily stood up relieved ill call them tonight ill say its not a debate to which we feel we can make a meaningful contribution and anyway its not something we encounter a particular problem with in this diocese how does that sound sounds eminently sensible merrily but the bishops large hairless face still looked worried good nobody comes out of an edition of livenight with any dignity left the pits of tabloid tv jerry springer off the leash who is jerry springer asked the bishop you really dont want to know one finds oneself watching less and less television he brushed crumbs from his generously cut purple shirt which is wrong i suppose it is after all ones pastoral duty to monitor societys drab cavalcade the excesses of the young the latest jargon the ubiquity of the word shag in a nontobacco context ill get my daughter jane to compile a glossary for you the bishop smiled but still appeared strangely apprehensive so this he peered at the screen livenight is not current affairs television not as you know it how would you describe livenight sophie like a rehearsal for armageddon a shudder from the bishops lay secretary now permanently based in merrilys gatehouse office sophie tucked a frond of white hair behind one ear and used a tissue to dab away a blob of english mustard which the bishop had let fall appropriately on the head of the burgergobbling homer simpson on the computers mouse mat they begin with a specific topic which is loosely based on a sunday paper sort of news item say you have a suburban husband who pimps for his wife merrily said is she being exploited or is it a valid way of meeting the mortgage premiums invariably sophie said they contrive to fill the studio with loudmouthed bigots and professional cranks merrily nodded and if youre insufficiently loudmouthed bigoted or cranky they just move on to the psycho sitting next to you whos invariably shaking at the bars to escape onto live television whole thing makes you despair for the future of the human race i dont really think spreading despair is what were about no the bishop said uncomfortably quite its just that if you dont do it we we have a problem merrily stiffened what are you saying exactly bernie bernie dunmore had taken to wandering down to the deliverance office on tuesdays for a snack lunch with merrily he always seemed glad to get away from the bishops palace which was understandable he was not actually the bishop of hereford although as suffragan bishop of ludlow in the north of the diocese the caretaker role had fallen to him in the controversial absence of the right reverend michael hunter in the end though mick hunters disappearance had not detonated the media explosion the diocese had feared coinciding as it had with the resignation of two other church of england bishops and the suicide of a third all of this following calls for an outside inquiry into their personal expenses exceeding a year and the acceptance of unorthodox perks questions had also been asked about hunters purchase of a land rover and a mercedes used by his wife and as neither the press nor the police had been able to substantiate anything more damaging the diocese had been happy to shelter behind any other minor scandal now the issue had been turned around four bishops had spoken out in a sunday times feature keeping the mitre on c of e executive stress about the trials of their job in an increasingly secular age there was inevitably a picture of mick hunter in his jogging gear escaping from the pressure was it better under the circumstances that the truth had not come out merrily wasnt sure but she liked bernie dunmore sixtytwo years old and comfortably lazy prepared to hold the fort until such time as the search for a suitably uncontroversial replacement for mick hunter could begin no one in fact could be less controversial than bernie the worst hed ever said about hunter was one would have thought the crown appointments commission would have been aware of michaels personality problems as micks appointee merrily had offered bernie her resignation from his deliverance role citing the seasoned exorcist huw owens warning that women priests had become a target for every psychotic grinder of the dark satanic mills who ever sacrificed a cockerel all the more reason for you to remain my dear bernie had told her though she couldnt quite follow his reasoning she hoped it wasnt just because he enjoyed his tuesday lunchtimes here sitting on the deliverance desk with a couple of hot dogs and a can of lager you explain sophie the bishop said his lay secretary sat up spry and elegant in a grey business suit with fine black stripes and consulted her memo pad well as you know this programme approached us some weeks ago with a view to merrily taking part in a general discussion on supernatural phenomena which merrily declined to do because merrily was afraid of what they might already know about recent events in hereford added merrily indeed i then received a personal call from ms tania beauman relating to this weeks proposed paganism programme again requesting merrily theyve obviously seen that understatedly sexy photo of you my dear said bernie merrily sighed looked at the clock she had to be back in ledwardine by three for minnie parrys funeral sophie said youll probably both recall the story in the papers last thursday about the pagan parents in somerset who demanded that their child be allowed to make her own religious observances at the village primary school the bishop winced livenights programme peg for this week sophie explained its now claimed there are over a hundred thousand active pagans in britain either belonging to groups covens or nurturing their beliefs independently complete nonsense of course the bishop sniffed but figures like that cant be proved one way or the other the programme will discuss the pagans claim that they represent the traditional old religion of the british isles and as such should be granted rights and privileges at least equivalent to those accorded to islam buddhism and other nonindigenous faiths bernie snorted most of their socalled traditions date back no further than the fifties and sixties theyre a sham these people are just annoyed because theyve been refused charity status in a secular state merrily said it could be argued that their superstitions are just as valid as ours im doing my devils advocate bit here the bishop jutted his chins and straightened his pectoral cross my question though is should we be actively encouraging people to strip off and have sex with each others wives under the full moon while pretending its religion i think not but neither do i think we should be engaging them in open battle boosting their collective ego by identifying them as representatives of the antichrist however sophie said that does reflect the general approach of one of our more outgoing rural rectors the reverend nicholas ellis oh merrily said in his sermons and his parish magazine articles hes tended to employ quite colourful terminology livenights own kind of terminology you might say sophie and the bishop both looked enquiringly at merrily she shook her head i know of him only through the press cuttings loosecannon priest who dumped his churches spent some years in the states charismatic direct intervention of the holy spirit prophecy tongues split the community bernie said when he expressed disdain for actual churches and offered to conduct his charismatic services in community halls barns warehouses whatever so mick hunter agreed to appoint a regular priestincharge in the area to appease the traditionalists and let ellis continue his roving brief merrily recalled that ellis now belonged to a fastgrowing anglican antichurch faction calling itself the sea of light awfully popular figure this nicholas im afraid bernie dunmore said since we cut him loose hes set up in some rundown village hall and hes packing it to the rafters with happyclappies from miles around which makes him somewhat unassailable and yet hes not a demonstrative bloke in himself quiet almost reticent apparently but came back from america with a knowledge of agriculture and farming ways that seems to have rather endeared him to the radnorshire people merrily grimaced recalling what eileen cullen at the hospital had said about the piece of wales just over the border they have their own ways and they keep closed up bernie flicked her a foxy smile the man was after your job did you know her eyebrows went up deliverance wrongly assuming youd be on the way out in the aftermath of michaels er breakdown soon as i showed my face in hereford there was nicholas requesting an audience did he get one showed him the door of course but tactfully good god hes the last kind of chap you want as your exorcist sees the devil behind every pillar in the cloister fortunately deliverance is rarely up for tender pressgang job in my experience he beamed at merrily and all the better for that is he currently doing any deliverance work she asked warily frankly my dear one doesnt like to enquire though if there are any complaints i suppose well have to peer into the pond meanwhile this livenight the bishop snapped back the ringpull on his can of lager and accepted a tall glass from sophie apparently he has been mentioned as a possible what do you call it frontrow speaker having already been approached by ms beauman sophie said and having apparently said yes but not on behalf of the diocese merrily said just a lone maverick surely the bishop shrugged spilling a little lager one cant stop the man appearing on national television and one cant be seen to try to stop him but if he starts shooting his mouth off about the invasion of sinister sects and child sacrifice and that kind of stuff its going to reflect on all of us in the wake of recent events here said the bishop we were all rather looking for a quiet life for a while merrily looked into the big generally honest face of the suffragan bishop of ludlow a lovely old town in south shropshire from which he was commuting and to which he clearly couldnt wait to get back well sophie folded a square of green blotting paper into a beer mat for the bishop giving herself an excuse not to look directly at merrily ms beauman did intimate to me that they might be prepared to consider rescinding their invitation to the reverend mr ellis if they could recruit for their programme the person they originally had in mind there was an uneasy silence the bishop drank some lager and gazed out of the window across broad street it was starting to rain shit merrily said under her breath unkind sky a box lizzie wilshire looked vaguely puzzled but more vague than puzzled betty thought inside the fireplace i did rather like that fireplace mrs wilshire recalled it had a wonderful old beam across the top it was the one emphatic feature of a rather drab room yes the living room you thought there ought to be beams across the ceiling too bryan said there still must be underneath all the plaster but i did like the fireplace if precious little else the fireplace to which mrs wilshires chair was presently pulled close was forlornly modern made of brownish dressed stone it surrounded a bronzeenamelled oilfired stove undernourished flames behind orangetinted glass mrs wilshire frowned it also had woodworm though the box the beam dear that worried me a little until bryan said lizzie it will take about three hundred years for the worms to eat through it i would still have wanted it treated though she blinked at betty have you had it treated yet not yet er mrs wilshire there was a box it was apparently found in the fireplace while you were having some repairs done to the walls it contained a paper with a sort of prayer i suppose youd call it a prayer oh understanding came at last to the bulging eyes of frail lizzie wilshire big eyes which made her look like an extraterrestrial or a wizened expensive cat you mean the witch paper yes betty said softly the witch paper it wasnt that she was particularly old early seventies betty reckoned but she had arthritis obvious in her hands and accepted her own helplessness clearly shed never been used to doing very much for herself or making decisions its so confusing now she said so many things i know nothing about things i dont want to have to know about why should i she was still living in this colonialstyle bungalow on the edge of new radnor the tiny town or big village where she and the major had lived for over fifteen years since his retirement just a stopgap the major always said until they found the right place an interesting place a place he could play with she told betty how she thought hed finally accepted that he was too old to take on something needing extensive refurbishment when out on a sunday drive theyd found not three miles away at old hindwell the house with which major bryan wilshire to the utter dismay of his wife had fallen hopelessly in love it was empty of course when we saw it it had belonged to two reclusive bachelor farmers called prosser the last surviving one had finally been taken into a nursing home so you can imagine the state it was in betty already knew all this from the estate agents and from their own searches also shed sensed a residual sourness and meanness in rooms left untouched by major wilshire but she let his widow talk and that awful old ruined church in the grounds some would say it was picturesque but i hated it who could possibly want a disused church except bryan of course the major had found the church fascinating and had begun to delve into its history when it had last been used as a place of worship why it had been abandoned meanwhile the house was to be auctioned and because of its poor condition the reserve price was surprisingly low this was when the market was still at low ebb just before the recent property boom and there was no rush for second homes in the countryside there was no arguing with bryan he put in an offer and it was accepted so the auction was called off bryan was delighted it was so cheap we didnt even have to consider selling this bungalow he said he could renovate the place at his leisure a reputable firm of contractors had been hired but major wilshire insisted on supervising the work himself the problem was that bryan was always so handson climbing ladders and scaffolding to demonstrate to the workmen exactly what he wanted doing lizzie couldnt bear to look up at him it made her quite dizzy but bryan had always needed that element in his life serving as he had with that regiment in hereford the sas betty presumed and she wondered how an allaction man like major wilshire had ended up with a wife who didnt like to look up at least that had spared lizzie an eyewitness memory of the terrible accident this had been brought about by the combination of a loose stone under a slit window in the tower a lightweight aluminium ladder and a freak blast of wind from the forest at first theyd told her it was simply broken bones and quite a number of them so it would have taken major wilshire a long time to recover many months but no internal injuries so it could have been worse hed at least be home in a matter of weeks mrs wilshire meanwhile had determined that he would never again go back to that awful place but bryan had never come home again the shock or something had brought on pneumonia for this energetic seemingly indestructible old soldier it was all over in four days there was one photograph of the major on the mantelpiece a wiry man in a cap he was not in uniform or anything but in the garden leaning on a spade and his smile was only a halfsmile so quick so bewilderingly quick there was no time at all for preparations mrs wilshire said querulously wed always made time to prepare for things bryan was a great planner nothing was entirely unexpected because he was always ready for it whenever he had to go away my sister would come to stay and bryan would always pay the bills in advance and order plenty of heating oil he always thought ahead how ironic betty thought that a man whose career must have involved several lifeordeath situations and certainly some gruelling and risky training exercises should have died after a simple fall from a ladder from a church was this ironic too when it started to rain harder robin packed up his paints and folded the easel a few stray drops on a watercolour could prove interesting they made the kind of accidental blurs you could use turned the painting into a raincolour but if it came on harder like now and the wind got up this was the elements saying to him uhhuh try again he stood for a moment down below the church ruins watching the creek rush into a small gorge maybe fifteen feet deep carrying branches and a blue plastic feedsack wild there was a narrow wooden footbridge which people used to cross to get to church the bridge was a little rickety which was also kind of quaint maybe this even explained why the church had become disused fine when the congregation came on foot from the village but when the village population had gotten smaller and the first automobiles had arrived in radnorshire well not even country ladies liked to have to park in a field the wrong side of the hindwell brook and arrive in church with mud splashes up their sunday stockings in the distance over the sound of the hurrying water robin could hear a vehicle approaching it was almost a mile along the track to reach the county road so if you heard any traffic at all it had to be heading this way most often it was gareth prosser in his land rover biggest farmer hereabouts a county councillor and also a nephew of the two old guys who used to own st michaels robin would have liked if the man stopped one time came in for a beer but gareth prosser just nodded never smiled to him never slowed country folk took time to get to know apparently but the noise wasnt rattly enough to be prossers land rover or growly enough to be his kids dirt bikes it was a little early to be betty back from the widow wilshires but who knew maybe she at last had developed the hots again for her beloved husband couldnt wait to get back to the hissing pine fires and into the sack in that wonderful dampwalled bedroom sure robin kicked a halfbrick into the hindwell brook lifting up his face to the squally rain it would come right the goddess would return to her just the wrong part of the cycle was all he offered a short silent prayer to the spirits of the rushing water that the flow might once again go their way winter was after all a stressful time to move house the vehicle appeared it was a cherokee jeep when the driver parked in the yard and got out robin stared at him and then closed his eyes and muttered holy shit he didnt need this he did not need this now but we dont believe in those things any more do we my dear witches i mean how on earth had the wife of an sas officer managed to preserve this childlike glazedeyed innocence betty smiled and lifted the bone china teacup and saucer from her knees in order to smooth her long skirt jeans would have been the wrong image entirely and after the assault on the house over the past few days she didnt have an entirely clean pair anyway clean was paramount here it was a museum of suburbia it had actual trinkets betty guessed that the majors wife had secretly been hoping that the renovation work at st michaels would never be completed that it would be simply a longterm hobby for him while they went on living here in new radnor which although it was on the edge of the wilderness and still dominated by a huge castlemound was pleasant and open with a wide main street neat cottages window boxes in the summer a nice shop unlike old hindwell it kept the forest at arms length mrs wilshire said it was silly it was slightly unpleasant and of course it wasnt even terribly old about as i recall oh said mrs wilshire have you found another one no i think its the same one betty said patiently someone brought it back you see who in the world would do that we dont know it was left on the doorstep what an odd thing to do yes it was odd which is why wed like to find out who did it i was hoping you might be able to tell me who you gave the box to when you gave it away do you remember by any chance well bryan saw to that of course bryan always knew where to take things you see would there perhaps have been i dont know a local historian or someone like that who might have had an interest in old documents hmmm mrs wilshire pursed her tiny lips theres mr jenkins at the bookshop in kington but he writes for the newspapers as well and bryan was always very suspicious of journalists perhaps it was the new rector he gave it to oh not that he was terribly fond of the rector either we went to one of his services but only once so noisy ive never seen so many people in a church well not for an ordinary evensong they must have come from elsewhere like football supporters and there were people with guitars and candles so many candles well i have nothing against all that but its not for the likes of us is it are you a churchgoer mrs thorogood er no not exactly and your husband what is it your husband does for a living im sure i did know hes an artist an illustrator he does book covers mainly bryan used to read lizzie wilshire said distantly hed go through periods when hed read for days in his sanctum her big eyes were moist betty thought of parboiled eggs look she said is there anything i can do while im here vacuum the carpet clean anything prepare you something for tea or is there anywhere you need to go you dont drive do you bryan never wanted me to use the car he always said rural roads were far more dangerous because of the tractors and trailers and we have a local man mr gibbins who runs a sort of parttime taxi service he takes me into kington twice a week and carries my shopping for me you mustnt worry about me my dear with all the work you must have on your hands getting that old place ready to move into we moved in last week actually mrs wilshires small mouth fell open but it was an absolute hovel when she stopped possibly remembering that her own estate agent had preferred phrases like characterful and eccentric its still got one or two problems betty said more cheerfully than she felt but it doesnt let the rain in well not in most of the rooms mrs wilshire is there anyone else apart from the rector that your husband might have handed that box to or even told about it mrs wilshire shook her head he brought it back here to examine it but he didnt keep it very long i know that because i wouldnt have it in the house so dirty i do rather remember something but betty sighed look let me wash up these cups and things at least no dear i can manage she fumbled her cup and saucer to the coffee table but the cup fell over and spilled some tea which began to trickle over the edge of the table onto the carpet betty snatched a handful of tissues from a box nearby and went down on her knees mopping she glanced up at lizzie wilshire and saw years of lowlevel pain there solidified like rock strata and then as sometimes happened when observing someone from an oblique angle she caught a momentary glimpse of lizzies aura it was not intact and vibrated unevenly this woman needed help betty gathered up the cups and saucers are you having treatment for the arthritis oh yes dr coll do you know dr coll betty shook her head dr coll says i shall need a new hip soon and perhaps a new knee but that may mean going all the way to gobowen sixty miles or more in the meantime im on a course of tablets cant have new hands unfortunately but dr colls been marvellous of course he steroids mrs wilshire looked vague again cortisone i believe and something else some different pills i have to take those twice a day i havent been taking them very long just since after bryan died it seems to have got so much worse since bryan died all the worry i suppose mrs wilshire i hope you dont mind me asking but have you ever tried anything alternative or complementary as some people prefer to say you mean herbs and things sort of i would be very wary my dear you never know quite what youre taking do you betty carried the cups and saucers into a large kitchen made pale rather than bright by wide windows tripleglazed with a limited view of a narrow garden a steep green hillside and a slice of unkind sky at the bottom of the garden was a shed or summer house with a small verandah like a miniature cricket pavilion bettys compassion was veined with anger lizzie wilshire was happily swallowing a cocktail of powerful drugs with all kinds of sideeffects an unambitious woman whod let her husband handle everything make all her decisions for her and was now willingly submitting to other people who didnt necessarily give a shit when betty came back lizzie wilshire was staring placidly into the red glow of the oil heater are you going to stay here betty asked well dear the local people are so good you see you youngsters seem to flit about the country at whim i dont think i could move id be afraid to mrs wilshire looked down into her lap of course i dont really like it at night its such a big bungalow so quiet couldnt you perhaps move into the centre of the village but i know bryans still here you see the churchyards just around the hillside i feel hes watching over me is that silly no betty gave her an encouraging smile its not silly at all she walked out to the car feeling troubled and anxious in a way she hadnt expected that unexpected glimpse of the damaged aura suggested she was meant to come here today prodding the little subaru out onto the long straight bypass under an already darkening sky betty decided to return soon with something herbal for mrs wilshires arthritis it would be a start and she was getting back that feeling of having come right round in a circle it was as a child in llandrindod wells fifteen or so miles from here that shed first become fascinated by herbs and alternative medicines perhaps because the bottles and jars containing them always looked so much more interesting than those from the chemist there was that alternative shop in llandrindod into which she was always dragging her mother then not that she was interested they were both teachers her parents her mother at the high school her dad in line for becoming headmaster of one of the primary schools betty was only ten when he failed to get the job and soon after that they moved to yorkshire where hed been born teaching until she left school she didnt know there was any other kind of job her parents treated it like a calling to which they were both martyrs and it was taken for granted that betty would commit her life to the same kind of suffering as for those flights of imagination of hers well shed grow out of all that soon enough a teachers job was to stimulate the imagination of others her parents were unbelieving anglicans their world was colourless odd really that neither of them was sensitive if it was in bettys genes it must have been dormant for at least two generations one of her earliest memories from a holiday up north when she was about four was her grandmas chuckled go way wi you when shed come up from the cellar of the big terraced house in sheffield and asked her who the old man was who slept down there betty drove slowly feeling the countryside the road from new radnor cut through an ancient landscape the historic church of old radnor prominent just below the skyline like a guardian lighthouse without a light behind her she felt the weight of the radnor forest hills muscular as though they were pushing her away at walton a pub farms cottages she turned left into the lowlying fertile bowl which archaeologists called the walton basin suggesting that thousands of years ago it had been a lake now there was only the small hindwell pool to which according to legend the four stones went secretly to drink at cockcrow an indication that the hindwell water had long been sacred to the goddess the goddess who was isis and artemis and hecate and ceridwen and brigid in all her forms it was at teachertraining college in the midlands that betty had been introduced to the goddess one of her tutors there was a witch this had emerged when betty had confessed she found it hard to go into a particular changing room where it turned out a student had hanged herself alexandra had been entirely understanding about her reaction and had invited betty home into a whole new world of incense and veils earth and water and fire and air where dreams were analysed the trees breathed past and present and future coexisted and the moon was the guiding lamp of the goddess the recent walton basin archaeological project had discovered evidence of a prehistoric ritual landscape here including the remains of a palisade of posts the biggest of its kind in britain being here at the centre of all this ought to be as exciting to betty as it was to robin who was now thanks to george totally convinced that their church occupied a site which too had once been very much part of this sacred complex so why had her most intense experience there been the image of a tortured figure frenziedly at prayer radiating agony and despair in the ruined nave of st michaels shed tried to drive it away but it kept coming back to her she could even smell the sweat and urine how sacred how euphoric was that three lanes met in old hindwell converging at an undistinguished pub across the road the former school had been converted into a health centre by the famous dr coll presumably the stone and timbered cottages had once been widely spaced but now there were graceless bungalows slotted between them in many cases it would be indigenous local people often retired farmers living in these bungalows freed at last from agricultural headaches while cityreared incomers spent thousands turning the nearby cottages into the period jewels they were never intended to be she didnt particularly remember this place from her radnorshire childhood and she didnt yet know anyone here it was actually pretty stupid to move into an area where you knew absolutely nobody where the social structure and pattern of life were a complete mystery to you yet people did it all the time lured by vistas of green the magic of comparative isolation but betty realized that if there was to be any hope of their longterm survival here she and robin would have to start forming links locally connecting with the landscape was not enough robin still had this fantasy of holding a mini fire festival at candlemas bringing in the celebrants from outside but throwing open the party afterwards to local people like a barbecue the locals getting drunk and realizing that these witches were ok when you got to know them candlemas robin preferred the celtic imbolc was barely a week away so that was madness lights in the old church chanting on the night air somebody would see somebody would hear too soon much too soon or was that an excuse because wicca no longer inspired her the way it did robin why had she found george so annoying last weekend why had his ideas truths and certainties to him seemed so futile to her when she got home robin was waiting for her in the cold dusk down by the brook he wore his fezthing with the mirrors no protection at all against the rain he looked damp and he looked agitated we have a slight difficulty he said robin was like those us astronauts he saved the understatements for when things were particularly bad possession even in embittered january the interior of ledwardine church kept its autumnal glow because of the apples this was an orchard village and when the orchards were bare merrily would buy red and yellow apples in hereford and scatter them around on the pulpit down by the font along the deep window ledges the biggest and oldest apple there was clasped in the hand of eve in the most dramatic of ledwardines stainedglass windows westfacing to pull in the sunset although thered been no sun this afternoon that old fatal fruit was still a beacon and its warmth was picked up by the lone bramley cooking apple sitting plump and rosy on minnies coffin um want to tell you about this morning merrily said how the day began for gomer and me she wasnt in the pulpit she was standing to one side of it in front of the rood screen of foliate faces and carved wooden apples viewing the congregation along the coffins shiny mahogany top somehow i never sleep well the night before a funeral especially if its someone i know as well as id got to know minnie so this morning i was up before six and i made a cup of tea and then i walked out intending to stroll around the square for a bit to think about what i was going to say here there must have been seventy or eighty people in the church and she recognized fewer than half of them as well as minnies relatives from the midlands there were several farmerlooking blokes who must have known gomer when he was digging drainage ditches along the welsh border you wanner know why most of them buggersve come yere hed hissed in merrilys ear you watch how high they piles up their bloody plates with pie and cake in the village hall afterwards now she looked across at gomer sitting forlorn in the front pew his glasses opaque his wild white hair brylcreemed probably as close to flat as it had ever been sitting next to him was jane looking amazingly neat and prim and solemn in her dark blue twopiece jane had taken the day off school and had helped prepare the tea now laid out at the village hall it was very cold merrily said nobody else in the village seemed to be up yet no lights no smoke from chimneys i was thinking it was true what they say about it always being darkest just before the dawn but then as i walked past the lychgate i became aware of a small light in the churchyard shed approached carefully listening hard remembering inevitably the words of huw owen her tutor on the deliverance course theyll follow you home theyll breathe into your phone at night break into your vestry and tamper with your gear crouch in the back pews and masturbate through your sermons little rateyes in the dark the light glowed soft in the mist it was down at the bottom of the churchyard where it met the orchard close to the spot where merrily had planned a small memorial for wil williams seventeethcentury vicar of this parish and the vicarages onetime resident ghost the light yellowed the air immediately above the open space awaiting minnie parry merrily had stopped about five yards from the grave and as she watched the light grew brighter and then there was another light a small red firefly gleam and she almost laughed in relief as gomer parry glowing ciggy clamped between his teeth reached up from below and dumped his hurricane lamp with a clank on the edge of the grave oh hell gomer heaved himself out dint disturb you nor nothing did i vicar dint think you could see this ole lamp from the vicarage dint think youd be up see i didnt see it from the vicarage i was i was up anyway got a lot of things to do before got to see the bishop stuff like that she was burbling half embarrassed ar said gomer merrily was determined not to ask what hed been up to down there in the grave if he was doing it under cover of darkness it was no business of anyone elses besides hed made himself solely responsible for minnies resting place turning up with his minijcb to attack the icehard ground personally laying down the lining fancy a cup of tea gomer gomer came over carrying his lamp bugger me vicar he said catch a feller pokin round your churchyard at dead of night and you offers him a cup o tea listen pal merrily said echoing the asphalt tones of the verger of the liverpool church where shed served as a curate im a bloody christian me gomer grinned a tired white gash in the lamplight so we went back to the vicarage merrilys gaze was fixed on the shiny bramley on minnies coffin and there we were gomer and me at six oclock in the morning sitting either side of the kitchen table drinking tea and for once i was at a bit of a loss she heard light footsteps and saw a stocky figure tiptoeing up the central aisle recognized young eirion lewis in school uniform he was looking hesitantly from side to side looking for jane he must be extremely keen on the kid to drive straight from school to join her at the funeral of someone he hadnt even known it was you had to admit a smart and subtle gesture but eirion had been raised to it his old man ran welsh water or something eirion though you wouldnt know it from his english accent had been raised among the welshspeaking cardiff aristocracy the crachach when he saw that jane was in the front pew a leading mourner he quietly backed off and went to sit on his own in the northern aisle which was where in the old days the women had been obliged to sit the ghetto aisle eirion was in fact a nice kid so jane would probably dump him in a couple of weeks merrily looked up then after his second mug of tea gomer began to talk all it was just buryin a little box o stuff fore my min goes down there like sos itll be underneath the big box kind of thing ent no church rules against that is there if there are merrily had said lighting a cigarette i can have them changed by this afternoon just bits o stuff see couple o little wedding photos them white plastic earrings er insisted on wearing cept for church nothing valuable not even the watches she had stared at him he looked down at his tea added more sugar she noticed his wrist was bare mine and mins they both got new batteries sos theyd go on ticking for a year or so two year mabbe dont smile merrily told herself dont cry she remembered gomers watch it was years old probably one of the first watches ever to work off a battery and so it really did tick loudly dunno why i done it really vicar dont make no sense do it i think somehow merrily looked into the cigarette smoke it makes the kind of sense neither of us is clever enough to explain and im not going to try too hard to explain it now she said to the congregation i think people in this job can sometimes spend too long trying to explain too much in the pew next to gomer jane nodded firmly i mean i could go on about those watches ticking day and night under the ground symbolizing the life beyond death but thats not a great analogy when you start to think about it in the end it was gomer making the point that he and minnie had something together that cant just be switched off by death way i sees it vicar by the time them ole watches dstop ticking well both be over this out the other side gomer had pushed both hands through his aggressive hair gotter go on see ennit gotter bloody go on yeah what was it like when your husband when he died a lot different merrily said if he hadnt crashed his car wed have got divorced it was all a mistake we were both too young all that stuff and we was too bloody old gomer said me and min problem is nothin in lifes ever quite whats that word synchronized cept for them ole watches and you can bet one o them buggers is gonner run down fore the other gomer smoked in silence for a few moments hed been minnie seagroves second husband shed been gomers second wife shed moved to rural wales some years ago with frank seagrove whod retired and wanted to come out here for the fishing but then had died leaving her alone in a strange town merrily still wasnt sure quite how minnie and gomer had first met gomers mouth opened and shut a couple of times as if there was something important he wanted to ask her but he wasnt sure how not seen your friend lol round yere for a while he said at last which wasnt it hes over in birmingham on a course ar psychotherapy had to give up his flat and then he got some money unexpectedly from his old record company and hes spent it on this course half of him thinks he should become a fulltime psychotherapist like what mental health needs is more exloonies the other half thinks its all crap but hes doing the course then hes going to make a decision good boy gomer said jane still insists she has hopes for lol and me gomer nodded then he said quickly dunno quite how to put this see i mean its your job ennit to keep us all in hopes of the hereafter e died so we could live on kinder thing which never made full sense to me but i ent too bright see merrily put out her cigarette ethel the cat jumped onto her knees she plunged both hands into ethels black winter coat the big one only theres gotter be times see vicar when you wakes up cold in the middle of the night and youre thinkin to youself is it bloody true is anythin at all gonner happen when we gets to the end from the graveside there came no audible ticking as minnies coffin went in gomer had accepted that his nephew nev should be the one to fill in the hole on the grounds that minnie would have been mad as hell watching gomer getting red herefordshire earth all over his best suit walking away from the grave he smiled wryly he may also have wept earlier briefly and silently merrily had noticed him tilt his head to the sky his hands clasped behind his back he was in unexpected ways a private person down at the village hall he nudged her indicating several tea plates piled higher with food than youd have thought possible without scaffolding give em a funeral in the afternoon some of them tight buggers goes without no bloody breakfast and lunch scuse me a minute vicar i oughter ave a word with jack preece and he moved off towards a ravagedlooking old man whose suit seemed several sizes too big for him merrily nibbled at a slice of chocolate cake and eavesdropped a group of farmertypes whod separated themselves from their wives and didnt for once seem to be discussing dismal sheep prices bloody whatdyoucallits pep pills ecstersee wannit boy gets picked up by the police see with a pocketful o these bloody ecstersee up in court at llandod dennis says thats it boy you stay under my roof you can change your bloody ways were gonner go an see the bloody rector ok mum merrily turned to find jane holding a plate with just one small egg sandwich was this anorexia or love what happened to eirion flower he had to get home wheres he live exactly some gloomy rotting mansion out near abergavenny it was quite nice of him to come wasnt it it was incredibly nice of him but then he is a nice guy yeah merrily tilted her head meaning hed be more attractive if he was a bit of a rogue kind of dangerous you think im that superficial no flower anyway i expect hell be going to university next year he wants to work in tv as a reporter not you know livenight good heavens no so youre going to do that after all then jane said in that suspiciously bland voice that screamed hidden agenda i was blackmailed can i come merrily raised her eyes do i look stupid see i thought we could take irene hes into anything to do with tv obviously like he knows his dad could get him a job with bbc wales on the old taff network but he wants to make his own way which is kind of commendable id have thought very honourable flower still never mind sorry sure you told that what was her name tania not yet shell be ever so pleased and jane slid away with her plate and merrily saw uncle ted the senior churchwarden elbowing through the farmers he was currently trying to persuade her to levy a charge for the tea and coffee provided in the church after sunday services she wondered how to avoid him she also wondered how to avoid appearing on trash television to argue with militant pagans mrs watkins she turned and saw a woman looking down at her a pale tall stylishly dressed woman fiftyfiveish with expertly bleached hair she was not carrying any food i was impressed she said with your sermon her accent was educated but had an edge it was compelling well it was just from the heart meant something to people meant something to me and i didnt even know er minnie parry yes the woman blinked twice rapidly a suggestion of nerves she seemed to shake herself out of it straightened her back with a puppetlike jerk sister cullen was right you seem genuine oh youre from the hospital not exactly the woman looked round especially at the farmers her eyes flicking from face to florid face evidently making sure there was nobody she knew within listening distance barbara buckingham i was at the hospital to visit my sister i think you saw her the other night before i arrived menna thomas menna her voice hardened menna weal oh right i did see her but but she was already dead yes she was im afraid mrs watkins the woman took merrilys arm may i talk to you not a request i rang your office in hereford sister cullen gave me the number she said you were probably the person to help me the person who deals with possession oh i rang your office and they said you were conducting a funeral here so i just came it seemed appropriate she broke off she was attracting glances its a bit crowded isnt it merrily said would you like ill come to the point would it be possible for you to conduct a funeral service for me merrily raised an eyebrow for my sister that is i suppose i mean a memorial service though actually i dont she should have she should have a real funeral in church a proper funeral im sorry im not getting this because i cant go you see i cant go to the interment why not because its going to take place in that bastards garden her voice rose he wont let her go its all about possession mrs watkins i dont several people were staring at them now over their piledup plates possession of the dead by the living explained barbara buckingham i think wed better go back to the vicarage merrily said the eword oh my god betty said the only time i go out on my own in walks number one on the list of situations i wouldnt trust you to handle robin couldnt keep still he was pacing the kitchen touching walls and doors the sink the fridge as if the permanence of this place in his life was no longer certain so hes in this old green cherokee right and he has on this wellworn army jacket with like camouflage patches and its unzipped and all the time im hoping whats underneath is just gonna turn out to be some kind of black turtleneck with like a thick white stripe around the neck betty took off her coat hung it behind the door and came to sit down it wasnt the vicar that worried her every newcomer sooner or later had a visit from the vicar it was how robin had dealt with him pretty damn clear from the start he wasnt just coming to ask the way to someplace robin went over to the kitchen table there were two halfpint glasses on it and four small beer bottles all empty guy wanted to talk he was waiting for me to ask him in i dont suppose he had to wait long soons we get inside its the firm handshake hi im nick ellis and im wondering do these guys drink beer so i offer him a michelob from the refrigerator normal practice is to offer them tea robin no wait transpires he spent some years in the states which became detectable in his accent and then what can i say we you exchanged history you drank beer together i confess im standing there pouring out the stuff and im like robin held up a glass with a trembling hand like all the time im halfexpecting him to leap up in horror pull out his cross slam it in my face like the guy in the dracula movies but he was fine she looked sceptical what did you tell him about us well this was hard for me im a straight person ive no time for deception you know that what did you tell him clenching her hands what did you say about us fucksake whaddaya think i said hey priest guess how we spent halloween robin went over and pulled out a chair and slumped down i told him i was an illustrator and that you were into alternative therapy i told him you were british and we met when we were both attending a conference in new england i somehow refrained from identifying the conference as the wiccan international moot in salem mass and although i did not say we were married i didnt mention handfasting either i said we had gotten hitched hitched uhhuh and when he brought up the subject of religion as priests are inclined to do when they get through with football and stuff i was quite awesomely discreet i simply said we were not churchgoers betty breathed out properly for the first time since sitting down all right im sorry i do trust you ive just been feeling a little uptight because youre not being true to yourself and your beliefs robin said severely so what was he like unexceptional at first friendly but also watchful open but holding back hes of medium height but the way he holds himself makes him look taller rangy you know looks like a backwoods boy looks fit he drank just one beer while i appear to have drunk three his hair is fairish and he wears it brushed straight back and in a ponytail which is cool i mean i have no basic problem with these guys as a spiritual grouping as a profession but robin got up and fed the rayburn some pine the rayburn spat in disgust robin looked up at betty his eyes were unsteady but if you want the truth babe i guess this is probably a very sick and dangerous example of the species robin had been anxious the priest remained in the kitchen he would have had problems explaining the brass pentacle over the livingroom fireplace would not be happy to have had the reverend nicholas ellis browsing through those books on the shelves he was glad his guest consumed only one beer and therefore would be less likely to need the bathroom and when ellis asked if he might take a look at the ancient church of st michael robin had the back door open faster than was entirely polite still raining out there the priest wore hiking boots and pulled out a camouflage beret they strolled back across the farmyard around the barn into the field where the ground was uneven and boggy and there it was on its promontory above the water its stones glistening its tower proud but its roofless body like a split gutted fish cool huh nick robin had told the priest about st michaels probably becoming disused on account of the hindwell brook the problem of getting cars close enough to the church in the wintertime the priest smiled sceptically thats your theory is it robin well that and the general decline in uh faith i guess some peopled started looking for something a little more progressive dynamic the reverend ellis stopped he had a wide loose mouth and though his face was a touch weathered it had no lines no wrinkles he was maybe forty what do you mean by that robin well uh robin had felt himself blushing he talked on about how maybe the church had become kind of hidebound same old hymns same old you know the minister had said nothing just stood there looking even taller watching robin sinking into the mud uh what i meant maybe they began to feel the church wasnt offering too much in the direction of personal development you know and then ellis went yeah i do know and youre dead right oh for a minute i was worried i was offending you the church over here has lost much of its dynamism dont suppose i need tell you that in most areas of the united states a far higher proportion of the population attends regular services than in this country so how come you were over there robin had grabbed his chance to edge the talk away from religion went over with my mother as a teenager after her marriage ended we moved around quite a bit mainly in the south really thats interesting my mom was english and she met my dad when he was serving with the air force in the north of england and she went home with him to new jersey so like and it was there nicholas ellis continued steadily that i first became exposed to what you might consider a more dynamic manifestation of christianity in the uh bible belt snakes and hot coals where i became fully aware of the power of god the priest looked up at the veiled church where if you like the power of the holy spirit reached out and touched me no robin did not like you notice how the mist winds itself around the tower as a painter that fascinates me the sheer fervour the electric momentum you encountered in little elliss hands forming fists for emphasis little clapboard chapels the living church i knew what that meant for the first time over here we have all these exquisite ancient buildings steeped in centuries of worship and were losing it losing it robin right robin had said neutrally ellis nodded toward the ruins poets eulogizing the beauty of country churches and they meant the buildings the surroundings man is that not beauty at its most superficial uh i guess robin considered how betty would want him to play this and so didnt rise to it but he knew in his soul that what those poets were evoking whether they were aware of it or not was an energy of place which long predated christianity the energy robin was experiencing right there right this minute with the tower uniting with the mist and the water surging below sure the christians picked up on that mainly in medieval times with all those soaring gothic cathedrals but basically it was out of their league because robin thought meeting the priests pale eyes this is a pagan thing man and this was when he had first become aware of an agenda sensing that whatever the future held for him and this casuallooking priest in his army castoffs it was not going to involve friendly rivalry and goodnatured badinage buildings are jewellery ellis had said baubles when i came home i felt like a missionary in my own land i was working as a teacher at the time but when i was subsequently ordained ended up here i knew this was where i was destined to be these people have their priorities right hows that ellis let the question go by he was now talking about how the states also had its bad side how he had spent time in california where people threw away their souls like candy wrappers where the devil squatted in shop windows like santa claus handing out packs of tarot cards and runes and i ching sets can you believe those people robin turned away to control a grin for albeit he was east coast raised he was those people over here its less obvious ellis shuddered suddenly far more deeply embedded like bindweed the worst of its underground robin hadnt reacted though he was unsure of whether this was the best response or not maybe some normal person bombarded with this bullshit would by now be telling this guy he had things to do someplace else to go calls to make nice talking with you reverend maybe see you around looking over at the rainscreened hills ellis was saying how the very week he had arrived here it was announced that archaeologists had stumbled on something in the radnor valley evidence of one of the biggest prehistoric wooden temples ever discovered in europe robins response had been yeah wasnt that terrific when ellis had turned to him there was a light in his eyes which robin perceived as like a gas jet he said it was a sign of something coming to the surface them finding the prehistoric site betty sat up pushing her golden hair behind her ears it was coming out like a rash was how he put it robin said like the disease under the surface the disease which you only identify when the rash starts coming out whats he talking about man with an agenda bets robin detected a halfinch of beer in one of the michelob bottles and drained it laid down the bottle with a thump if theres anything i can recognize straight off its another guy with an agenda robin you dont have an agenda you just have woolly dreams you wanna hear this or not sorry betty said frayed go on robin told her that when ellis had first come here before the church let him go his own way he looked after four small parishes on both sides of the border new radnor was the biggest all the parishes possessed churches except one of these was in ruins but dont take this the wrong way remember this is a guy doesnt go for churches hes into clapboard shacks now old hindwell is a village with no church any more not even a baptist chapel but one thing it does have is a clapboard fucking shack well not exactly clapboard more like concrete and steel the parish hall in fact is there one up some steps top of the village built not too well in the early sixties close to derelict when ellis arrived he hacks through the brambles one day and a big light comes down on him like that guy on the road to damascus and hes like this is it this is my church you recall that film witness where the amish community build this huge barn in like one day everybody mucking in brilliant yeah well what happens here is christians converge from miles around to help nick ellis realize his vision money comes pouring in carpenters plumbers sundry artisans giving their work for free no time at all the parish halls good as new better than new and theres a nice big cross sticking out the roof with a light inside the porch and every sunday the place is packed with more people than all the other local churches put together robin paused betty opened out her hands what do you want me to say triumph of the spirit you think i should knock that wait robin told her how come all this goes down in a place with so little religious feeling they abandoned the original goddamn church evangelism robin it spreads like a grass fire when it gets going hes a new kind of priest with all that american whatever if it can happen there it can happen here and obviously has which shows how right we were to keep a low profile because those bornagain people to put it mildly are not tolerant towards paganism robin shook his head ellis denies responsibility for the upsurge figures it was waiting to happen to deal with something that went wrong something of which old hindwell church is symptomatic betty waited so were both moving in closer to the church and im finding him a little irritating by now so i start to point out these wonderful ancient yew trees how the building itself might be medieval but im told that the yews in a circle and the general positioning of the church indicate that it occupies a prechristian site im talking in a this doesnt mean much to me but its interesting isnt it kind of voice robin betty said you dont possess that voice ellis was staring at him who told you that robin robin floundered oh the real estate agent i guess furious with himself that instead of speaking up for the oldest religion of these islands he was scuttling away like some shamed vampire at dawn allowing this humourless bastard to go on assuming without question that his own yearold cult had established a right to the moral high ground so how did they achieve that nick by waging countless socalled holy wars against other faiths by fighting amongst themselves with bombs and midnight kneecappings blowing guys away in front of their kids all right ellis had then said let me tell you the truth about this church robin this church was dedicated to st michael how much do you know about him robin could only think of marks and freaking spencer but was wise enough to say nothing the revelation of st john the divine chapter twelve and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought michael and his angels robin had looked down at his boots and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth uh right robin said id forgotten about that interestingly around the perimeter of radnor forest are several other churches dedicated to st michael not too much imagination in those days i guess ellis had now taken off his beret his face was shining with rain the archangel michael is the most formidable warrior in gods army therefore a number of churches dedicated to him would represent a very powerful barrier against evil what evil would this be precisely nick robin was becoming majorly exasperated by elliss habit of not answering questions like your questions are sure to be stupid and inexact so he was answering the ones you ought to have asked it also bugged robin when people talked so loosely about evil a coverall for fanatics ellis said i visit the local schools children still talk of a dragon in radnor forest its part of the folklore of the area theres even a line of hills a few miles from here they call the dragons back robin shrugged local place names that so uncommon nick not awfully satanic evil is ubiquitous yeah but is a dragon necessarily evil robin was thinking of the fantasy novels of kirk blackmore where dragons were fearsome forces for positive change ellis gave him a cold look it would seem to me robin that a dragon legend and a circle of churches dedicated to st michael is incontrovertible evidence of something requiring perpetual restraint im not getting this a circle of churches ellis spread his hands a holy wall to contain the dragon but the dragon will always want to escape periodically the dragon rears and snaps and is forced back again and again and keeps coming back ellis clawing the air a harsh light in his eyes until something yields now he was looking over at the ruins again like an army officer sizing up the field of battle this was one serious fucking fruitcake and the evil is now inside the legend says and youll find references to this in most of the books written about this area that if just one of those churches should fall the dragon will escape then he looked directly at robin robin said but this is a legend nick the circle of st michael churches is not a legend you think this place is evil its decommissioned it no longer has the protection of st michael in this particular situation i would suggest thats a sign that it requires attention attention robin put on a crazy laugh but his heart wasnt in it and betty didnt laugh at all what does he want he robin shook his head oh boy he was warning me that fruitcake was giving me notice of what what does he want he wants to hold a service here he believes this church was abandoned because the dragon got in because the frigging dragon lies coiled here and that god has chosen him ellis given him the muscle in the shape of the biggest congregations ever known in this area given him the power to drive the dragon out betty went very still all he wants bets all he wants is to come along with a few friends and hold some kind of a service what kind of a service you imagine that all these farmers in their best suits and the matrons in their sunday hats and nick in his white surplice and stuff all standing around in a church with no roof singing goddamn bread of heaven in a site that they stole from the old religion about eight hundred years ago and then fucking sold off jeez i was so mad this is our church now on our farm and we like dragons betty was silent the whole room was silent the rain had stopped the breeze had died even the rayburn had temporarily conquered its snoring robin howled like a dog whats happening here why do we have to wind up in a parish with a priest whos been exposed to the insane biblefreaks who stalk the more primitive parts of my beloved homeland and is therefore no longer content with vicarage tea parties and the organ fund so what did you say to him bastard had me over a barrel i say a flat no the cats clean out the bag so what i said to my shame i said nick i could not think of letting you hold a service in there look at all that mud look at those pools of water just give us some time like weve only been here days give us some time to get it cleaned up how sad was that just like ellis she didnt seem to have been listening robin what kind of service he said it would be no big deal not realizing that any kind of damn service here now was gonna be a big deal far as were concerned and if its no big deal why do it guy doesnt even like churches what kind of service betty was at the edge of her chair and her eyes were hard i dont know robin was a little scared and that made him angry a short eucharist did he say that what is that precisely im not too familiar with this christian sh its a mass huh an anglican mass and do you know why a mass is generally performed in a building other than a functioning church he didnt fully he could only guess to cleanse it betty said the eucharist is christian disinfectant to cleanse to purify to get rid of bacteria ok let me get this robin pulled his hands down his face in praying mode this is the eword right betty nodded an exorcism visitor theanswering machine sounded quite irritable mrs watkins tania beauman livenight ive left messages for you all over the place the programme goes out friday night so i really have to know whether its yes or no ill be here until seven please call me thank you sorry merrily came back into the kitchen hung up her funeral cloak i cant think with that thing bleeping barbara buckingham was sitting at the refectory table unwinding her heavy silk scarf while her eyes compiled a photoinventory of the room youre in demand mrs watkins the slight roll on the r and the barely perceptible lengthening of the a showed her roots were sunk into midborder clay but this would be way back many southern english summers since walking through black and white timberframed ledwardine across the cobbled square to the sixteenthcentury vicarage the dull day dying around them the lights in the windows blunting the bite of evening shed said how quaint and cosy it is here id forgotten and so close close to what merrily had made a point of not asking tea she still felt slightly ashamed of the kitchen must get round to emulsioning it in the spring or coffee barbara would have tea she took off her gloves like her late sister she was goodlooking but in a sleek and sharp way with a turnedup nose which once would have been cute but now seemed haughty the sisters a retired teacher and theres no arguing with her eileen cullen had said i didnt expect you to be so young mrs watkins going on thirtyseven young for what youre doing young to be the diocesan exorcist diocesan deliverance consultant you must have a progressive bishop not any more merrily filled the kettle mrs buckingham dropped a short laugh of course that man who couldnt take the pressure and walked out hunt hunter i try to keep up with church affairs i was headmistress of a church school for many years in this area the border god no got out of there before i was twenty couldnt stand the cold merrily put the kettle on the stove we can get bad winters here she agreed ah not simply the climate my father was a farmer in radnor forest i remember my whole childhood as a kind of perpetual february frugal merrily tossed tea bags into the pot mrs buckingham exhaled bitter laughter in our house those two tea bags would have to be used at least six times the fat in the chip pan was only renewed for christmas her face grew pinched at the memories you were poor not particularly we had in excess of acres marginal land mind always appallingly overgrazed waste nothing make every square yard earn its keep have you heard of hydatid disease vaguely causes cysts to grow on internal organs sometimes the size of pomegranates originates from a tapeworm absorbed by dogs allowed to feed on infected dead sheep or on our farm required to eat dead sheep human beings can pick it up the tapeworm eggs simply through stroking the sheepdog when i was sixteen i had to go into hospital to have a hydatid cyst removed from my liver how awful that was when i decided to get out i doubt my father even noticed i was gone had another mouth to feed by then a girl again unfortunately menna she would be ten months old when i left it was a long time before i began to feel guilty about abandoning her fifteen years or more and by then it was too late theyd probably forgotten id ever existed i expect he was even grateful id gone another opportunity to try for a son at no extra cost a farmer with no son is felt to be lacking in something any luck my mother miscarried apparently mrs buckingham said brusquely there was a hysterectomy she shrugged i never saw them again where did you go found a job in hereford in a furniture shop the people there were very good to me they gave me a room above the shop next to the storeroom rather frightening at night all those empty chairs i would imagine people sitting there silently waiting for me when i came back from night classes characterbuilding though i suppose i got two a levels and a grant for teachertraining college it all sounded faintly dickensian to merrily though it could have been no earlier than the s so you never went back the phone was ringing after college i went to work in hampshire near portsmouth then a husband kids grown up now no i never went back until quite recently a neighbours daughter judith kept me informed through occasional letters she was another farmers daughter from a rather less primitive farm please get that phone call if you want merrily nodded went through to the office as it happens closing the scullery door shes here now listen im sorry eileen cullen said i couldnt think what else to tell her showed up last night still unhappy about the sisters death and getting no cooperation from the doctor i didnt have much time to bother with her either i just thought somebody ought to persuade her to forget about mr weal and go home get on with her life and i thought shed take it better coming from a person of the cloth such as your wee self forgive me but that doesnt sound like you no well so she didnt say anything about holding a special service in church then merrily the problem is im on the ward in one minute bloody hell eileen aw jesus all the woman wants is her sister laid to rest in a decent holy fashion shes one of your fellow christians tell her youll say a few prayers for the poor soul and leave it at that there was an unexpected undercurrent here what happened with mr weal after i left the other night well he came out eventually eventually he came out when she did and he chose to accompany her down to the mortuary is that normal well of course it isnt fockin normal were not talking about a normal feller here it was a special concession merrily i really have to go if the sisters tardy how can you expect the nurses eileen thats all i can tell you just persuade her to go home shell do no good for herself whats that supposed to cullen hung up it was dark outside now and the thorns were ticking against the scullery window when merrily returned to the kitchen barbara buckingham was standing under a wall lamp her silk scarf dangling from one hand as if she was wondering whether or not to leave mrs watkins i dont want to be a pain merrily dont be silly sit down theres no i try to be direct you see in my childhood no one was direct theyd never meet your eyes keep your head down avoid direct conflict run neither with the english nor the welsh keep your head down and move quietly in darkness the woman had been too long out of it merrily thought as the kettle boiled shed turned her spartan childhood into something gothic tell me about the possession in essence i believe your job is to liberate them the possessed i mean merrily carefully took down two mugs from the crockery shelf milk through the open door she could still hear that damned rosebush scratching at the scullery window a little no sugar merrily brought milk from the fridge she left her own tea black and carried both mugs to the table its a big word barbara yes and often abused i have to say that we should both be direct and i should tell you ive yet to encounter a valid case of possession but then ive not been doing this very long it may be the wrong word perhaps i only used it to get your attention looking frustrated barbara tossed her scarf onto the table ive attended church most of my life much of the time out of habit i admit occasionally out of need i have no time for mysticism thats what im trying to say im not fey merrily smiled no but menna has been possessed for years do you know what i mean weal suffocated her in life now he wont let her go after death cullen he asks for a bowl and a cloth and he washes her very tenderly reverently you might say and then hell wash himself his face his hands in the same water and followed her down to the mortuary did barbara know about that merrily heard a key in the side door beyond the scullery and then footsteps on the back stairs jane coming in going up to her apartment they were our family solicitors barbara said everybodys solicitors in those days it seemed weal and son the first weal was jefferys grandfather the and son was jefferys father rt weal weal and son of kington and their gloomy old offices with the rolltop desks and a victorian chair like a great dark throne i first remember jeffery when he was fifteen going on fifty a lumbering sullen boy slowmoving slowthinking singleminded his future written in stone weal and son and son even unto the ends of the earth i hated them the complete unchangingness of them same chair same desk same dark tweed suits same dark car creeping up the track eileen cullen told me she thought he probably became a father figure merrily said after menna had spent some years looking after her own father your dad was widowed presumably sixteen or seventeen years ago i had a letter from judith my friend in old hindwell my father wouldnt have told me i no longer existed for him and he was ailing too later i learned that menna never had a boyfriend or any social life so she lost the best years of her life to her bloody father and the rest of it to weal who of course became the proverbial tower of strength when the old man died he looked after her then seized his chance with a weak unworldly girl i came to find her about two years ago id recently taken early retirement my daughter had just got married my husband was away i was at a very loose end one morning i simply got in my car and drove up here and knocked on their door she stared into space menna seemed unsurprised unmoved entirely incurious id forgotten what these people can be like she just stood there in the doorway didnt even ask me in talked in an offhand way as though i was a neighbour whom she saw occasionally but didnt particularly care for and you actually hadnt seen each other since she was a baby the woman shook her head there was distance now in her voice she wore no makeup she was pale in an unnatural etiolated kind of way like grass thats been covered up and quite beautiful but she didnt seem to either know or care who i was she might as well already have been dead jane nicked the cordless from mums bedroom and took it upstairs to the trio of attic rooms that now made up her apartment bedroom sitting roomstudy and a halffinished bathroom she put on the lights took off her jacket sat on the bed thinking about poor gomer going home on his own to a house full of minnies things it made her cry fucking death jane dried her eyes on a corner of the pillowcase gomer wouldnt cry gomer would get on with it but how much in life was really worth getting on with where was it leading was minnie any closer now to knowing the answer oh god jane picked up the phone and looked at it and shrugged if this didnt work it didnt work she rolled up her sleeve the livenight number was written in fibretip on the inside of her left arm jane pushed in the numbers asked for tania beauman the switchboard put her on hold and made her listen to dire straits which could have been worse though jane would never admit it she leaned back against the headboard and contemplated the mondrian walls wondering if anyone else had ever had the idea of painting the squares and rectangles between sixteenthcentury beams in different colours she wondered what eirion would think of it if she was ever to bring him up here if time was running out if she was going to fit in two serious lovers before she hit twenty serious could mean six months longer tania beauman oh hi jane sat up you know who this is oh said tania hey dont be like that i may have cracked it for you cracked what jane swung her feet to the floor im telling you tania it wasnt easy she really didnt want to know livenight pff but im like look merrily being elitist is what put the church of england in the hole its in today you cant just turn a blind eye to paganism and pretend it isnt happening all over again or before you know it therell be more of them around than you thats a very cogent argument tania said but why arent i talking to your mother because ive like nearly got her convinced but im not quite there yet well i have to tell you you dont have much time but do i have the incentive tania thats the point i wondered if thered be a point to be blunt jane said i need a very very small favour home burial it was becoming if not exactly commonplace then less of an upperclass phenomenon than it used to be merrily tried to explain this to barbara buckingham that it was a secular thing or sometimes a green issue that you often didnt even need official permission the main drawback for most people is the risk of taking value off their house if and when its sold no one wants a grave in the garden hes not barbara had picked up her scarf again she began to wind it around her hands he is not going to bury menna thats the worst of it shes going into a tomb she pulled the scarf tight a mausoleum oh to be loved like that he has a victorian house at old hindwell barbara said the former rectory do you know old hindwell not really is it in this diocese i cant remember possibly its very close to the border about three miles from kington on the edge of the forest radnor forest weals house isnt remote but it has no immediate neighbours in the garden theres a structure wine store ice house airraid shelter i dont know precisely what it is but thats where shes going to be like a family vault its sick i went to see a solicitor in hereford this morning he told me there was nothing i could do a man has a perfect legal right to keep his dead wife in a private museum and as a solicitor himself your brotherinlaw is going to be fully aware of his rights dont call him that barbara turned away whole things obscene he loved her merrily said uncertainly he doesnt want to be parted from her he wants to feel that shes near him thats the usual reason no its a statement of ownership possession is what is it nine points of the law that word again do you mind if i smoke go ahead merrily lit a silk cut pulled over an ashtray what about the funeral itself is it strictly private i mean are you kind of barred my dear barbara dropped the scarf its going to be a highly public affair a service in the village hall not the church they dont have a church any more the minister holds his services in the village hall ah and the minister is father ellis nick ellis merrily nodded this explained a lot i dont know why so many anglicans are choosing to call themselves father now as if theyre courting catholicism you know this man i know of him hes a charismatic minister which means not happyclappy barbaras eyes narrowed in distaste everybody hugging one another thats one aspect of it nick ellis is also a member of a group known as the sea of light its a movement inside the anglican church which maintains that the church has become too obsessed with property keepers of buildings rather than souls they claim the holy spirit flows through people not stones so a sea of light minister is more than happy to hold services in village halls community centres and private homes of course and the same goes for burial i would guess so so jeffery has an accomplice in the clergy barbara buckingham stood up he would have wouldnt he its such a tight little world look merrily said i know how you feel but i really dont think theres anything you can do about it and if nick ellis is conducting a funeral service at the village hall and a ceremony in jw weals back garden im not sure i can hold another one in a church however mrs watkins merrily shed failed with the solicitor now she was trying the church merrily said awkwardly im really not sure this is a spiritual problem oh but it is barbara splayed her fingers on the table leaned towards merrily she comes to me you see the bereavement ghost the visitor maybe sitting in a familiar chair or walking in the garden or commonly like menna in dreams barbara buckingham staying at a hotel near kington had dreamt of her sister every night since her death menna was wearing a white shift or shroud with darkness around her youd prefer no doubt to think the whole thing is a projection of my guilt barbara said perhaps of your loss even though you didnt know her perhaps an even greater loss because of all those years you might have known her and now you realize you never will is your husband in france on a buying trip he has an antiques business how do you feel when you wake up anxious barbara drank some tea very quickly and drained exhausted and debilitated have you seen a doctor yes as it happens a mild snort ive seen mennas doctor collard banksmorgan we were at the same primary school dr coll they all call him now but if you were suggesting that a little valium might help to relax me i didnt go to consult him about myself you wanted to know why shed suffered a stroke i gatecrashed his surgery at the school in old hindwell made a nuisance of myself not that it made any difference bloody man told me i was asking him to be unethical preempting the postmortem he was like that as a child terribly proper if theyd had a head boy at the primary school it wouldve been collard banksmorgan did you find out if there was a longterm blood pressure problem no barbara buckingham put on her scarf at last but i will look merrily said why dont we say a prayer for menna before you go for her spirit why dont we pop over to the church ive taken too much of your time i think it might help fifth rule of deliverance whether you believe the story or not never leave things without at least a prayer i would like to help if i can and there was more to this merrily was curious now everything suggested there was more why should this woman feel robbed of a sister shed never really known then come to the funeral barbara said me is that too much of an imposition well no but you were at the hospital with her merrily agonized then about whether she should tell barbara buckingham what shed witnessed in the side ward it was clear cullen hadnt or barbara would have mentioned that she remembered the feeling shed had then of something ritualistic about the way weal was putting dabs of water on mennas corpse and then himself refusing to let the nurses try to feed her refusing to let merrily pray for her wanting to do everything himself it was she supposed a kind of possession but she decided to say nothing it might only inflame an already fraught situation ok ill try to come what day saturday threethirty old hindwell village hall that should be ok if something comes up where can i get a message to you doesnt matter if you arent there you arent there ill do my best have you spoken to mr weal im not ready for that yet barbara said but i shall do thank you merrily nightlife of old hindwell robin had the map spread out under a winebottle lamp on the kitchen table after theyd finished supper come take a look bets holding his thick black drawing pencil the way he held his athame in a rite whole bunch of churches around the forest the lamplight sheened his dense dark ages hair betty leaned over him he smelled sweet and warm like a puppy she felt an unexpected stirring he was so lovably uncomplicated and so simplistic sometimes in his thinking why since theyd arrived here had any physical desire always been so swiftly soured by irritation she gazed around the stillgloomy farmhouse kitchen why with the stove on for over a week was there still an aura of damp always worse after sunset she felt clammy and uncomfortable as though she had the curse if robin had said lets give this place up and leave now tonight she wouldnt have hesitated but since that mention of the eword his attitude had unsubtly altered a couple of seconds of trepidation then the male thing was kicking in robin wanted to find out precisely where ellis was coming from then get in his face it hadnt been helped betty guessed by ellis wearing army gear combat gear she was appalled to think that she might even once have shared robins zeal if only this had been someone elses house the home of a fellow pagan in need of moral support if only she wasnt already growing to hate their church too much to want to defend it shed tried to remember her reaction on first seeing it and couldnt probably because she was being practical at the time and paying more attention to the farmhouse leaving robin to moon over the ruins take dozens of photographs hed now finished ringing churches on the landranger map although it didnt identify individual ones except by symbols nearby place names sometimes would give a clue to the dedication betty could help him out there a little from childhood knowledge of welsh she put a thumbnail to the southernmost symbol that one the village is llanfihangel nant melan llanfihangels welsh for the church of st michael cool robin drew an extra ring around the church and then tracked around the others with the tip of his pencil until he came to the northern part of the forest perimeter whats this same word right llanfihangel rhydithon thats another yeah and then ours of course three st michael churches around the forest he was right i suppose gotta be more three doesnt make a circle with swift firm pencil strokes he redrew the plan on his sketchpad graphics were important to robin making a picture made things real of course betty said theres nothing to suggest all these churches were built at the same time i vaguely remember going to llanfihangel rhydithon as a kid and i dont think its even medieval its the site that counts come on bets what are you agnostic now look through elliss eyes guy thinks hes fighting an active devil or more specifically in the absence of people actually sacrificing cockerels and abusing children on his doorstep against us betty said bitterly im still not sure he knows ellis was fishing like who couldve told him who else knows or couldve seen anything we didnt even use removal men betty said it scares me i dont want this aw come on he said youre a witch hey you know damn near all these churches have just gotta be on older sites when you see how close they are to standing stones and burial mounds he leaned back in satisfaction this valleys a damned prehistoric ritual freaking wonderland which explains everything it does you got all these sacred sites right its a good bet most of them were still being used by surviving pagan groups well into medieval times and probably long after that this was a remote area with a small and scattered population closed in secretive i think its fair to assume that even when theyd been brutally eradicated from most of the rest of the country the old ways were still preserved here possibly the archangel michaels the hard guy of the church its them saying to the pagans you bastards better come around or else ellis as a fundamentalist relates to all of that plus hes been influenced by insane bible belt evangelists who persecute snakes plus his egos already been blown up sky high by the size of congregations hes pulling when all the neighbouring churches are going down the tubes ive decided the guy sucks the only remaining question is how long we keep stalling before we tell him that he and his exorcism squad can go screw themselves i was going to say that if we dont make an issue of it if we let it go quiet then hell probably forget about us betty said lamely not gonna happen believe me this guys on some kind of crusade under the banner of st michael hey would that explain the army surplus stuff shit robin smiled at his own flawed logic betty saw with a plummeting heart that he wanted to be a target of christian fanaticism when we look at those ruins he said we see a resurgence of the true indigenous spirituality whereas he sees a naked tower giving him and his religion the finger he so wants to be the guy who killed the dragon and claimed it all back its an ego thing you and him both the smile crashed meaning what you have a few beers together you size each other up and now youre both flexing your muscles for the big fight you cant wait can you you love it that hes got this huge mass of followers and theres just the two of us here newcomers isolated now listen lady robin was on his feet furious my instinct was to kick his ass right from the off but no i play it the way i figure you would want me to mr nice guy mr dont frighten the horses mr take a faceful of shit and keep smiling kind of guy no you didnt you thought you could play with him lead him around the houses take the piss out of him a little when in fact he was playing with you you werent even there and youve never given a thought to where this could leave us we have to live here whatever happens we have to live here afterwards and we will have to live here because in case you havent thought about this who is going to buy a rundown house along with a ruined church which the local minister insists is infested with demonic evil she spun away from him you shithead robin snatched in a breath that was halfway to a sob then threw his pencil down on the table i need some air you certainly do he turned his back on her strode across the kitchen like lord bloody madoc and tore open the back door before he slammed it behind him she heard the rushing of the rainswollen hindwell brook in the night like a hiss of glee betty let her head fall into her hands on the tabletop what have we done what have we walked into robin stomped across the yard hit the track toward the gate and the road it was cold and the going wasnt so easy in the dark but he was damned if he was going back for a coat and flashlight why why was whatever he said whatever he did whatever he tried to do always the wrong fucking thing four years he and betty had been together and sure they were different people raised in different cultures but theyd previously come through on shared beliefs a strong respect for natural forces and each others destiny and hed thought the road to old hindwell was lit for them both all the portents had been there just as soon as they decided they would look for a place in the countryside where they might explore the roots of the old spirituality theyd let it be known on the pagan network that they were looking for something rural and it didnt have to be luxurious the shrewsbury coven had worked a spell on their behalf and before that week was out theyd received anonymously but with a wellwishers symbol and the message thought you might be interested in this blessed be the estate agents particulars of st michaels farm and in the very same post a letter from al delaney at talisman to say that kirk blackmore was impressed with robins work and would like him to design the new cover with the possibility of a contract for the soontoberejacketed backlist of seven volumes even betty had to agree it was like writing in the sky robin joined the lane that led first past the prosser farm and then on to the village the farm was spread across the council roadway like it owned it sheds and barns on either side mud from tractor wheels softening the surface of the road a land rover was parked under an awning it had a big yellow sticker in the back window and even at night you could read christ is the light in luminous yellow robin gave a moan stifled it he hadnt known about this if ellis denounced them theyd have no support from their neighbours when he got clear of the farm he surveyed the night ahead of him the moon lay on its back over a long hill bristling with ranks of conifers a hedgehogs back a dragons back robin held out his arms as if to embrace the hill then let them fall uselessly to his sides and walked on down the middle of the narrow lane with ditches to either side and banks topped by hedges so savagely pleached they were almost like hurdles gareth prosser was clearly a farmer who liked to keep nature under his thumb his farm his land robin wondered how prosser had reacted to the team of archaeologists whod moved in and sheared the surface from one of his fields to uncover postholes revealing that four thousand years ago the farm had been a key site of ritual pagan worship maybe prosser had gotten ellis in to sanctify the site whatever there was virtually nothing to see there now robin had sent off to the council for british archaeology for the report on the radnor valley dig a couple of weeks ago when he and betty had driven down with a vanload of books hed checked out the site but found just a few humps and patches where the soil had been put back and reseeded the team had taken away their finds the flint arrowheads and axes and hundreds of photos and given the temple back to the sheep and to the pagans well why not the night before they moved in theyd agreed there should be a sabbat here at imbolc which betty preferred to call by its old christian name candlemas because it was prettier theyd agreed there should be the traditional crown of lights which betty would wear if there was no more suitable candidate at the old church above the water it was all going to be totally beautiful robin had had this fantasy of the village people coming along to watch or even join in and bringing their kids this atmosphere of joy and harmony at imbolc candlemas the first day of celtic spring the glimmering in the darkness but that had not been mentioned since and he was damned if he was gonna bring it up again robin walked on uphill now presently the hedge on the right gave way to a stone wall and he entered the village of old hindwell as if to mock the word old the first dwelling in the village was a modern brick bungalow a few yards further on was the first streetlight a bluish bulb under a tin hat on a bracket projecting from a telephone pole older cottages on either side now at the top of the hill the road widened into a fork on the corner was the pub the black lion the utility bulkhead bulb over its porch clouded with the massed corpses of flies it was an alehouse not much more the licensee greg starkey had come from london with big ideas but not pulled enough customers to realize them tonight robin could have used a drink jacketless therefore walletless he dug into his pockets for change came up with a single fiftypence piece could you get any kind of drink for fiftypence he figured not robin hi jeez he jumped shed come out of an entrance to the black lions back yard uh marianne gregs wife she moved out under the bulb so he could see she was wearing a turquoise fleece jacket over a lowcut black top standard landladywear in her part of london maybe but not so often seen out here but marianne made no secret of how much shed give to get back to the city havent seen you for days and days robin oh well lot of work the house move you know the last time hed seen her was when hed driven down on his own with a vanload of stuff grabbing some lunch at the lion shed seemed hugely pleased that he was moving in with or without a wife anything you wanna know about the place you come and ask me wednesdays are best thats when greg goes over to hereford market yeah well bored already robin i did warn you she was late thirties disillusion setting up permanent home in the lines either side of her mouth robin said i uh i guess i just like the night robin love she said this aint night this is just bleedin darkness she did this cackly laugh he smiled so uh you still dont feel too good about here give the boy a prize off the top shelf her voice was too loud for this village at night it bounced off walls she moved towards him he could smell that shed been drinking she stopped less than a foot away there was no one else in sight robin kind of wished hed turned around at the bottom of the street this is the nearest i get to a night out you know that we got to work we got to open the boozer every lunchtime and every bleedin night of the week and we dont get the same day off cause we cant afford to pay nobody and we wouldnt trust em to keep their fingers out of the bleedin till anyway aw come on marianne they all hate us well always be outsiders come on nobody hates you so we take our pleasures separately greg whoops it up at hereford market on a wednesday me i just stand in the street and wait for a beautiful man to come along who dont stink of sheep dip marianne i think oh sorry i forgot except for this saturday when im going to a funeral because it is potilic whatd i say politic thats what greg says politic im pissed robin putting out her hands as if to steady herself gripping his chest and youre very appealing to me i been thinking about you a lot youre a different kind of person aincha im an american kind of person is all otherwise just a regular now dont go modest on me for gawds sake i tell you what she started to rub her hands over his chest and stomach you can kiss me mr americankindofperson think of it as charity to the third world cause if this aint the third bleedin world uh call me oldfashioned robin gently detached her hands but i really dont think that would be too wise well if anybodys watching mariannes voice rose if anybodys spying from behind their lace bleedin curtains they can go fuck themselves robin panicked no way he wanted to be associated with this particular attitude he backed off so fast that marianne toppled towards him clawed vaguely at the air and fell with her hands flat on the cindered surface of the pubs parking lot where she stayed on all fours looking down at the road oh shit robin moved to help her she looked up at him and bared her teeth like a cornered cat you pushed me no no i really didnt you know i didnt marianne staggered to her feet hands waving in the air for balance how about we get you inside robin said you pushed me backing towards the yard entrance holding up her scratched hands like she was displaying crucifixion scars if the people of old hindwell hadnt been watching from behind their curtains before they sure were now fuck you marianne said fuck you she screamed and flew at him like a crazy chicken robin backed off and spun around and found himself running any which way until he was out of breath he stopped apart from his own panting the place was silent again he looked around saw only night the buildings had gone he didnt know where he was and then he looked up and there set into the partially afforested hillside was the tip of a golden light a shining ingot in the dense damp conifered darkness it was by far the brightest light in old hindwell village and as he stepped back it lengthened and branched out became a cross in golden neon nick elliss clapboard church the cross hung there as if unsupported like a big improbable star the truth was robin found it kind of chilling it was like hed been driven into a trap away in the darkness he heard footsteps he froze was she coming after him too heavy too slow and the steps were receding robin walked quietly back the way hed come and presently the light above the pub door reappeared he moved cautiously into the roadway in case marianne was still around claws out a few yards ahead of him passing the entrance to the schoolturnedsurgery was a man on his own a man so big he was like an outsize shadow thrown on a wall must be a head taller than most of the farmers hereabouts but he hadnt come out of the pub he was not drunk he had a steady stately walk and as he passed the pub robin saw by the bulkhead light that the man was dressed in a dark suit and a white shirt and tie the kind of attire farmers wore only for funerals the guy walked slowly back down the street the same way robin was headed after a dozen or so paces he stopped and looked over his shoulder for two three seconds robin saw his face clearly stiff grey hair and kind of a hooked nose like the beak of an eagle the guy turned and continued on his way down the street robin having to take the same route hung around a while to put some distance between them he didnt feel too sociable right now but he did feel cold he stood across from the pub shivering and hugging himself the big guy was a shambling shadow against curtained windows lit from behind halfway down the street he stopped again looked back over his shoulder looked not glanced robin only saw his face in silhouette this time he was surely looking for someone but there was no one there robin shook his head uncomprehending a little more spooked the nightlife of old hindwell no ghosts no god huddled in janes duffel coat she walked past the village square where the cobbles were glassy with frost the moon was in the west still hard and brighter than the security lamp beside the front door of the swan it was fivethirty am she clutched the church keys in a gloved hand she planned to pray before the altar for barbara buckingham and for the soul of her sister menna merrily walked in through the lychgate somewhere beyond the orchard a fox yelped down in the churchyard she saw a soft and now familiar glow last time vicar honest to god gomer i dont mind really unnatural sure tbe be thinkin im some ole pervert ennit merrily smiled he was crouching by minnies grave an area of raised earth an elongated moletump with the hurricane lamp on it no memorial yet no sound of underground ticking i was just thinking like gomer said i dont want no bloody stone i got to have a stone dont see why wood i likes wood ent no good with stone but i could carve out a nice piece of oak see he looked up at merrily lamplight moons in his glasses ent nothing to do with the money like be a proper piece we never talked about it but her liked a nice bit of oak my min ill put on it about frank as well see whatever you like gomer whatever you think shed have wanted summat to do ennit long ole days see vicar long ole days merrily sat on a raised stone tomb tucking her coat underneath her what else will you do gomer oh gomer sniffed meditatively bit o this bit o that will you stay here never thought about moving jane thought you might go back to radnorshire what for roots gomer sniffed again abruptly people talks a lot of ole wallop bout roots roots is generally gnarled and twisted best kept buried my experience yeah you could be right she had a thought you ever know a family called thomas down on the border knowed bout half a dozen families called thomas over the years danny thomas up by kinnerton hes a good ole boy keeps a lectric guitar and amplifiers in his tractor shed on account his wife greta she hates rock and roll they was at mins funeral around old hindwell i was thinking ole hindwell gomer accepted a silk cut from merrilys packet gareth prosser hes the big man in ole hindwell laid some field drainage for him years back then he inherits another two hundred acres and a pile o cash and the bugger buys isself a secondhand digger at a farm sale always thought theirselves a cut

be wed otherwise you know weal always avoided lawyers gomer said thieving bastards pardon me vicar weals olefashioned mind but that dont make him any less of a thieving bastard looks after his wife though cordin to what they says mennas dead gomer never gomer was shocked enough to whip the ciggy out of his mouth died in the county same night as minnie but her was no moren a kiddie thirtynine a stroke bugger me gomer stared down at the soil big weal must be gutted could say that gomer put his ciggy back shook his head ole hindwell eh you know what they says about that place dont you vicar tell me merrily managed to get her cigarette going before the breeze doused the zippo place as god give up on explained gomer lot of places like that with the church see lets their church fall into ruin and never had another until now ar theres a kind of missionary minister whos holding services in the parish hall father ellis oh hell aye gomer puffed on his ciggy nutter thats what they say about him is it nutter had two or three proper solid ole churches under his wing and they says he favoured ole hindwell village hall above the lot of em an all this clappin and huggin and chantin and stuff mind in ole hindwell they wouldnt notice another bloody nutter if he was stark naked in the snow how do you mean inbreedin gomer chuckled we always says that some places gets that kind o reputation for no reason at all othern being a bit off the beaten track and havin its church falled into ruins why did it fall into ruins apart from god giving up now theres a can of ole worms ennit is it last but one vicar they reckoned he went mad like ellis no mad mad all kinds o rumours there never come out proper you got a problem out there vicar well erm mr weal seems to be set on putting mrs weal into some kind of tomb in his garden well well gomer said noncommittally and barbara doesnt think thats a good idea she doesnt think weals quite grasped the need to let go of the dead and she wants me to go to the funeral with her to hold her hand or maybe to restrain her and i think theres something odd about that whole situation would er would you happen to know anybody who might know the score there gomer nodded slowly i reckon and maybe a bit about barbara and why she hates that area so much likely anythin else father ellis seems to me that for everybody who thinks hes a nutter there must be another five cant get enough if you see what i mean no accountin for the way folks is gonner go them parts seen it before oh hell aye gimme a day or two this time gomer declined the offer of tea and breakfast said hed got himself a nice crusty cob needed using up she could tell he was pleased to have something to occupy his time and digging was what gomer did best merrily went into church and prayed for barbara and menna and asked the boss about another matter kind of hoping shed get a strong negative response back at the vicarage just before seven she punched out tania beaumans livenight number waited for the answering machine to kick in oh this is merrily watkins at the hereford diocese sorry for not getting back to you last night ill be in the office from about half nine if you want to talk about what i might be able to contribute to your programme thanks no backing out now be something different anyway bright lights hitech hardware the fast chat the tat the trivia the complete glossy inconsequentiality of it jane came down for breakfast all fresh and schooluniformed been up long mum couple of hours couldnt sleep so you rang livenight then not much gets past you does it flower itll be fun be fun for you watching at home er yeah jane said airily that night after a wedding rehearsal at the church for a couple whose chief bridesmaid would be their own granddaughter merrily phoned eileen cullen from the scullery i just got the feeling you might have heard from barbara buckingham again and why would you be thinking that reverend cullen sounded more than usually impatient as if she was carrying an overflowing bedpan in her other hand shes keen to find out why menna died high blood pressure well yes sure but why did she have high blood pressure at her age i told you why and i havent changed my mind i reckon shed been on the pill for longer than she ought tove been years longer thats my guess prolonged ingestion of synthetic oestrogen bad news but then youd know all that eileen i live the life of a nun ive forgotten all that well its not your problem and its not mine either and its not poor mennas any longer a pause then she came back a little softer listen if youve got the buckingham woman on your back in a big way im sorry im sorry i sent her over so i am you must have felt at the time that she had a valid problem just wanted her out of me hair you know what im like mmm thats why i dont think youre being entirely upfront jesus christ im always upfront nobody in this fockin jobs got time to go round the side any more did you by any chance tell her about weal and that business with the water you mean so they could have a big row and disturb all my patients are you kidding did you tell her no well good confidentially merrily when the hell do we ever talk any other way barbaras getting troubled dreams troubled how says she sees menna a pause does she night after night stress cullen said look ive got to well you would say that no ghosts no god you think my whole lifes a sorry sham aye but youre a wellmeaning wee creature listen i really do have to go so you havent seen her then of course i havent fockin seen her cullen snapped what the hell dyou think i am merrilys head spun she stared at the circle of light thrown on the holy bible the rosebush chattered at the dark window i meant barbara merrily said i have to go cullen hung up part two witchcraft may be underestimated by christians on the grounds that it is phoney and synthetic and that its covens are completely eclectic and belong to no national organization there are however dangers deliverance ed michael perry the christian deliverance study group bear pit she first became aware of him in the green room her initial thought was that he must be a priest because he was wearing a suit though not a dog collar well how many did these days outside working hours and then because he was so smooth and assured and perhaps she thought afterwards because his shirt was winecoloured she even wondered if he might be a bishop he brought her a coffee this stuff could be worse he said bbc coffee is much worse you do this kind of thing fairly often then she said god that wasnt quite do you come here often but it was dangerously close when i must he said edward bain by the way merrily watkins i know he said he was of course attractive lean pale features and dark curly hair with a twist of grey over the ears hed made straight for merrily across the green room it sounded like some notoriously haunted country house bedchamber but was simply the area where all the participants gathered before the show it was long and narrow and starting to look like a pantomime dressing room because of some of the costumes dark age chic meeting retropunk in a tangle of braids and bracelets the producer and his team mingled with the main guests and the support acts observing and listening picking out the potential starsforanhour meanwhile the guests drank tea and coffee and spring water no alcohol and nibbled things on sticks talking a lot losing inhibitions unblocking their adrenal glands developing that party mentality as if most of them hadnt brought it with them lord edward bain murmured do they really want to be taken seriously he looked at merrily with a faint pained smile the smile chilled her it was seans smile her dead husbands boyish disarming seans smile when accused she turned sharply away as though distracted by an argument in progress between a tightfaced security officer and a gingerbearded man wearing a short white cloak over a red tunic with a belt into the belt was stuck a knife with a black handle its my fucking athame man its a religious tool you wouldnt ask a fucking bishop to hand over his fucking crozier edward bains smile became a wince wiping away the similarity to sean if it had ever really been there merrily swallowed the security man turned to tania beauman for support tania wrinkled her nose oh leave it grant i suspect it looks more dangerous than it actually is tania its a knife if we start allowing weapons in the studio we may as well its a f the ginger guy blew out his cheeks in frustration turned to tania this doorman is really hacking me off you know this is religious persecution sure tania was a short capable bottleblonde of about forty if we just agree that its purely ornamental yeah sorry religious and that you wont be taking it out of of course i wont be fucking taking it out and if you use that word on camera before midnight you realize youll be excluded from the debate yeah the ginger man subsided in a surly kind of way a semichastened schoolboy thats his card marked edward bain told merrily hell be used purely for decoration now wont get asked a single question unless it starts to slow up and theyre really desperate for confrontation i dont see that happening somehow merrily said do you the boys an idiot anyway if the athame is to have any potency at all it should hardly be displayed like some sort of cycling club badge he smiled down at merrily instant sean once more and glided away leaving her feeling clammy and she thought oh my god hes one of them ooooooooh tania went into a sinuous shudder magnetic and more over by the door edward bain was into an intense conversation with a woman in a long loose classical kind of dress like someone from rentamuse merrily saw now that one of bains middle fingers wore a silver ring with a moonstone she saw him and the woman clasp hands lightly and smile and she imagined tiny blue electric stars crackling between their fingers she wondered if theyd even met before tonight who is he merrily muttered i mean what is he dont you vicars ever read the news of the world only if were really desperate for a sermon hes the man tania said if you call him something like king of the witches hell look pained he doesnt like the word witch hes a champagne pagan if you like works as a publishing executive and would rather be profiled in the observer than the news of the world and yeah hes getting there by way of livenight tania frowned dont take this programme too lightly merrily you can get deeply shafted out there and we are watched by all kinds of people you wouldnt expect especially this week by the acting bishop of hereford this week and probably half of lambeth palace take it lightly shed had to put down her glass of spring water because she couldnt hold it still ridiculous she conducted services every sunday she talked to hostile teenagers she talked to god she sean was there smiling in her mind in getting here shed had to drive past where he died on the m in flames go away she said too loudly tania can you give me a rundown who else is here ok tania nodded briskly well we get the programme peg out of the way first right the couple who want their kid to be allowed to do his pagan prayers and whatnot at school she nodded towards a solemn bearded man in a homemadelooking sweater his partner had a waistlength plait they might have been muslims they might even have been christians merrily said am i right in thinking youre not going to be spending very long on them dead right boring boring boring actually the headmaster of the schools going to be better value bornagain christian actually talks like sir cliff like hes got a boiled sweet in his cheek ok over there patrick ryan long hair velvet jacket cambridge professor whos done a study of pagan practices and shagged half the priestesses in the home counties by all accounts but i doubt hell be discussing that if ryans too heavy the little guy with the shaven heads tim fagan exhack from the sun was sent out to do an expose on some sexy coven and wound up joining them now edits a popular witchy magazine called ha ha the moon edward bain excepted they all looked fairly innocuous what about the other side right well weve got a really angry mother who claims paganism turned her daughter into a basket case she is very strong the kid got drawn into white witchcraft and ended up peeing in churches which leads neatly into you i think thanks you know what i mean mmm tania had revealed on the phone that she had seen news cuttings on last years herefordshire desecration case involving the sacrifice of a crow in a country church not entirely appropriate in merrilys view i mean i cant say that was your orthodox paganism if there is such a thing which i doubt it was a peculiar kind of black magic it was a oneoff tania beauman shrugged by the other side merrily said i actually meant us the church you said i wouldnt be on my own here how pathetic did that sound tania looked mildly concerned i didnt say that did i im sure i didnt say that you did tania oh well what happened the other bloke let us down i think his wife had a miscarriage or something she was blatantly improvising but if youre looking for backup the headmasters brought along a few members of his church see the guy in the white which church would that be well christian obviously but i suppose youd probably call it more of a cult wonderful theyll be doing some heavy apocalyptic stuff about the antichrist walking the earth disguised as hang on looks like steve wants to do his pep talk a bald man of about thirty in white jeans and a crumpled paisley shirt strode into the centre of the green room lifted up his arms for silence and went merrily guessed into autopilot ok listen up everybody my names steve ewing im the editor of livenight id like to welcome you all to the programme and point out that well be on the air in about fifty minutes youve all seen the show if not then thats your problem for sticking with boring old paxman or the dirty movie on channel ok now what i mainly want to stress to you is that livenight is like life you dont get a second chance a woman cackled all you know mate yeah very good steve ewing smiled thinly what im trying to get over here is that we dont hang around and neither should you if you have something to say dont hold back because itll be too late and well have moved on to another aspect of the debate and youll be kicking yourself all the way home because you missed your chance of getting your argument across on the programme merrily looked around for any exit sign wasnt too late to get the hell out of here what im looking for said steve is straight talking and above all quick snappy responses theres a lot of choice material to get across and we want to help you do that so its straight to the point no pussyfooting and if its going to take longer than about thirty seconds save it for your phd thesis john fallons the ringmaster you wont meet him until you go in but youve all seen john hes a smart guy a pro and his bullshit threshold is zero any questions there was some shuffling but no direct response why dont we get to meet fallon before the programme merrily whispered tania beauman hardly moved her lips youd know more about this than me but i dont imagine theyd normally introduce the christians to the lion they called this the gallery it was a narrow room with a bank of tv monitors through which the director and the sound and vision mixers could view the studio floor from different angles once the show was on the air the director would be in audio contact with the producer and the presenter john fallon down in the bear pit they actually called it that in fact jane had found it a little disappointing at first it was much smaller than it looked on the box like a little theatreintheround with about six rows of bankedup seating does the whole audience have some angle on the debate she asked a whitehaired bloke called gerry an exdaily star reporter who was the senior member of tania beaumans research team nah he said weve got a decent enough budget now but its not that big the audience are just ordinary punters bussed in tonights bunch is from a paint factory in walsall packers cleaners management a cross section of society gerry glanced at eirion who looked awfully young and innocent and not happy he had no stomach for subterfuge jane was realizing hed been appalled to discover that her mum down there did not know they were up here or indeed within sixty miles of livenight even in eirions car with the patchedup silencer it hadnt taken long to get here the warehouse studio complex had been quite easy to find on the edge of a new business park under a mile from the m and ten miles out of the central birmingham traffic hell it was not until theyd actually left the motorway that jane had revealed to eirion the faintly illicit nature of this operation irene im doing this for you this could be your future this is like cuttingedge telly its an in ok you might even get a holiday job eirion had looked appalled like a taxi driver whod just discovered he was providing the wheels in a wages snatch hed thought they were only driving up separately because janes mum might have to stay the night he did not know how jane came to have tania beauman in her pocket and would probably not be finding out neither would mum the plan was theyd clear off about two minutes before the programme ended go bombing back down the motorway and jane would be up in her apartment with the lights out by the time mum got home tania beauman had turned out to be actually ok shed told both gerry and the grizzled director maurice that jane was her cousin doing a media studies college course which could well be true one day how old is she maurice had enquired suspiciously nineteen next month jane said crisply eirion looked queasy stone me gerry muttered when the nineteenyearolds start looking fourteen you know youre getting too old for it maurice took off his cans see the problem with this particular programme is that were not songs of praise and this is not the god slot what we do not want is a religious debate we dont want the history of druidism we want to know what they get up to in their stone circles when the film crews gone home we dont want to hear about the people the witchesve healed we want to know about the ones theyve cursed and the virgins theyve deflowered on their altars this is latenight tv our job to put it crudely is to send you off to bed with a hardon ill be interested to see how the little priest handles it gerry said thoughtfully shes got enough of her own demons jane stared at him marital problems gerry said husband playing away though what the hell possessed him with that at home you never know what goes on behind bedroom doors maurice shook his head smiling sadly you turned all that up did you gerald and then when its all looking a bit messy bang the husband goes and gets killed in the car with his girlfriend merrily wakes up a widow and soon after that shes become a priest interesting do i detect guilt in there somewhere or do i just have a suspicious christ jane snarled she didnt become a bloody nun she she felt eirions hand on her arm and shook it off and bit her lip gerry grinned my my women do stick together dont they lay off gerald maurice slipped on his headphones flipped a switch on his console you there martin speak to me son so gerry leaned against the edge of the mixing desk there you are jane now you know how easy it is to get people going you just watch the monitors within about seven minutes everybodys forgotten there are cameras he pencilled a note on a copy of the programmes running order jane made out the word merrily be a lot of heat tonight i think when it gets going its very possible one of those weirdos is gonna try some spooky stuff eirion stiffened spooky stuff i dunno son a spell or something i suppose something to prove they can make things happen i dunno basically its all cobblers anyway jane looked at eirion she was still shaking they had a little file on mum if the show lost momentum shafting her became an option a surreal memory bettys day clearly hadnt been too great either you could tell not so much from her face as from her manner no bustle you dont tell me yours and i wont tell you mine robin didnt even lift his head from the kitchen table where hed fallen into a sleep of dismay and frustration well call it a shit amnesty tenfifteen on this cold misty moonless night betty had been out since midafternoon shed been to see the widow wilshire in new radnor again taking with her an arthritis potion involving burdock and honeysuckle garlic and nettle and a little healing magic betty was good with healing plants after pissing off her parents by walking out of teacher training shed worked at a herb garden and studied with a herbalist at nights for two and a half years shed gone to a whole lot of trouble with this potion driving over to a place the other side of hereford yesterday to pick up the ingredients how is she now oh more comfortable and happier i think around six shed phoned him to say she was hanging on there a while seemed mrs wilshires home help had not made it this week and she was distressed about the state of her house and her inability to clean it up so betty would clean up sure she would wherever she went betty added to her collection of aunts ok robin said if shes so much better i give up wheres the bad stuff come in it isnt necessarily bad just odd betty took off her coat hung it behind the back door went to get warm by the stuttering rayburn so you first its ellis isnt it no havent heard a word from ellis this is blackmore he faxed he doesnt like the artwork oh betty pushed her hands through her hair letting it tumble i did say it was a mistake dealing with him directly you should have carried on communicating through the publishers if he can get hold of you any time he wants hell just keep on quibbling it was what he wanted and he is kirk blackmore and frankly quibbling doesnt quite reach it not something you can alter easily robin laughed bleakly what the asshole doesnt like is everything he doesnt like my concept of lord madoc his face is wrong his hair is wrong his clothes are wrong his freaking boots are wrong oh and he walks in the wrong colour of mist im sorry betty came round the back of his chair put her hands on his shoulders began to knead all that work what does it mean what happens now means i grovel or i take the oneoff money and someone elses artwork goes on the book theres no way betty ok i am a wellregarded illustrator any ordinary midlist fantasy writer theyd have to go with it blackmore however is now into a oneandahalfmillionpound threebook deal he walks with the gods different rules apply betty scowled doesnt change the fact that he writes moronic crap tell him to sod off its just one book he sat up its not moronic the guy knows his stuff and its not just one book his whole backlists gonna be rejacketed in the sword of twilight format whoevers artwork that should be which is seven books a lot of work face it i need blackmore i need to have my images under his big name also we need the money if were gonna make a start on getting this place into any kind of good condition we were counting on that money were we not i suppose right end of story back to the airbrush she bent and kissed his hair youve gone pale yeah well i didnt expect it it was a kick in the mouth do me good getting too sure of myself all right go ahead regale me with the unglad tidings you bring back from the big metropolis theyd taken to calling new radnor the big metropolis on account of it having three shops well betty sat down next to him mrs wilshire was all worked up because she remembered shed promised to get the home help to hunt out some of the majors papers relating to this place he kept them in a wooden summer house in the garden and of course the home help didnt show up anyway she gave me the key thats why im so late i was in there for over an hour quite a little field hq the major had there lighting electric heater kettle steel filing cabinet and she let you loose in there almost a stranger she needs somebody to trust yeah people trusted betty on sight it was a rare quality and she wanted it sorting out but quite clearly couldnt face going down there because of the extra responsibility it might heap on her which shes never been good at and also because theres a lot of him still there you can feel him a clean precise sort of mind and frustration because he couldnt find enough to do with it so when he was buying a house he was determined to know everything get the very best deal not like me huh betty smiled youre the worst kind of impulse buyer you even hide things from yourself you and the major wouldnt have got on at all so what did you find mrs wilshire said i could bring anything home that might be useful ive got a cardboard box full of stuff in the car but you didnt bring it in tomorrow betty leaned her head back ive read enough for one night no wonder he kept it in the shed what are you saying i mean in one respect major wilshire was like you once hed seen this place he had to have it but it also had to be at the right price and of course he wasnt remotely superstitious an old soldier he wasnt afraid of anything that couldnt shoot him but i suppose that if he happened to come up with certain information that might upset any other potential buyers betty stopped and rolled her head around to ease tension its funny the first time i ever went in those ruins i thought this is really not a happy place this is something the agent shouldve told us we get to sue the agent how very american of you no i rather doubt it all too long ago anyway they told us about major wilshires death which was the main drawback presumably as far as they were concerned so what is this the ruins are haunted we jumped to conclusions we assumed the church was abandoned because of flooding or no access for cars or at least you did i assumed yeah assuming is what i do all the time ok robin stood up i cant stand it gimme the car keys ill go fetch your box of goodies when he arrived back with the stuff she had cocoa coming up he slammed and barred the door he was tingling with cold and damp whooo its turned into fog was it like that when you were driving home some of the way just as well hed fallen asleep earlier and hadnt known about the fog hed have been worried sick about her with the ice on the roads and all he dumped the cardboard wine box on the table best not to go out at night this time of year living in a place like this suppose it was so thick you drove into the creek brook betty said whatever robin unpacked the box mostly it seemed to be photocopies the top one evidently from some official list of historic buildings church of st michael old hindwell ruins of former parish church mainly c and c with later south porch and chancel embattled threestage tower of late c rubbleconstruction with diagonal buttresses to northwest and southwest and so on there were a couple more pages of this stuff which robin put aside for further study like you said looks like the major built up a fairly comprehensive background file he turned up some sale particulars similar to the one he and betty had received same agent and same wording give or take a characterful historic farmhouse with outbuildings and the picturesque ruins of a parish church in a most unusual location all true enough as far as it went next robin found several pages ripped out of a spiralbound notebook and bunched together with a bulldog clip there was handwriting on them not too intelligible and a string of phone numbers whats this dont know couldnt make it out theres all kinds of junk in there mrs wilshire told me to take it anyway i think she just wanted to get rid of as much as she could right there you are thats the start of it he lifted out a news cutting pasted to a piece of a the item was small and faded rector resigns due to ill health it said little more than that the reverend terence penney had given up the living of old hindwell and had left the area a replacement was being sought when was this a date had been scrawled across the newsprint but he couldnt make it out nineteen seventyseven that late you mean the old hindwell church was still operational until seventyseven seventyeight actually why did i have it in mind it must have been abandoned back in the thirties or forties because you were sold on the idea that it was due to motor vehicles and the brook read the letter underneath its from the same woman who wrote the piece in the newspaper it had been typewritten on an old machine with an old ribbon lower lodge monkshall leominster herefordshire may dear major wilshire thank you for your letter yes you are quite right i did have the dubious honour of being appointed radnor valley correspondent of the brecon and radnor express for a few years in the s receiving if i recall correctly something like one halfpenny a line for my jottings about local events of note my reports on the departure of the reverend penney were not i must say the ones of which i am most proud amounting as they did to what i suppose would be termed these days a cover up but my late husband and i were comparatively recent incomers to the area and i was walking on eggshells and determined not to cause offence to anyone however i suppose after all this time there is no reason to conceal anything any more especially as there was considerable local gossip about it at the time yes the reverend penney was indeed rather a strange young man although i am still inclined to discount the rumours that he took drugs there were some hippy types living in the area at the time with whom he was quite friendly so i suppose this is how the rumour originated in retrospect i think mr penney was not the most appropriate person to be put in charge of st michaels he was a young man and very enthusiastic full of ideas but the local people were somewhat set in their ways and resistant to any kind of change the church itself was not in very good condition even before mr penneys arrival and the parish was having difficulty raising money for repairs there were not the grants available in those days and it was a big responsibility for such a young and inexperienced minister yes i am afraid that what you have been told is broadly correct though i must say that i never found any signs of mental imbalance in mr penney in his first year at least he was always friendly if a little remote my memories of that day remain confused perhaps we should have suspected something after the small fire the slippage of tiles from the roof and the repeated acts of apparent vandalism i realize no charges ever resulted from these continued occurrences so i hope i can trust you as a soldier to treat this correspondence as strictly confidential but no one could really have predicted the events of that particular october morning it would not have seemed so bad had it not been raining so hard and the brook in such spate naturally quite a crowd for hindwell gathered and there was much weeping and wailing although this was quickly suppressed and after that day i do not remember anyone speaking of it quite extraordinary it was as if the whole village somehow shared the shame no as you note the big newspapers never got on to the story small communities have always been very good at smothering sensational events almost at birth and what was i the village correspondent supposed to write i was not a journalist merely a recorder of names at funerals and prizewinners at the local show furthermore later that day i received a visit from mr gareth prosser snr together with mr weal his and our solicitor who stressed to me that it would not be in the best interests of the local people for this to be publicized in any way mr prosser was the county councillor for the area and served on the police committee and was a personage of considerable gravitas it was not for me a newcomer to cross him over an issue of such sensitivity the church of england the village is in wales but the parish is in the diocese of hereford chose not to take any proceedings against mr penney after his departure another minister was appointed but did not stay long and thereafter the parish became part of a cluster which is not so uncommon these days i suppose one could say old hindwell lost heart after the extraordinary behaviour of mr penney i do hope i have been able to help you but i am rather out of touch with events in old hindwell although i live no more than half an hours drive away i seem never once to have revisited the village since we moved house in old hindwell is one of those places which it is easy to forget exists except as a rather surreal memory with very best regards juliet pottinger mrs the local people robin said whoooeee those local people sure like to wield power no more than in any small community betty brought over cocoa for them both she knew hed go for the coverup aspect first rather than the significance of the event that had been covered up she almost wished she could have censored the papers before letting him see them the idea of this panicked her it was like the wilshires in reverse until they came here shed never even thought of keeping secrets from robin and who is this weal he said was the plan that they might have to lean on this old broad legally she wouldnt have been an old broad then she was probably quite a young broad whatever this smells of real redneck intrigue prosser senior that would be gareth prossers old man sounds like it betty said and then came to the point but the main issue is what happened to the reverend penney what did he do that day that scandalized the community so much that he had to resign on socalled health grounds didnt the widow wilshire know any of this shed never even seen the letter bryan would not have wanted to worry the little woman well robin said its clear that the reverend penney was under a lot of pressure and it drove him a little crazy she talks about him feeling isolated maybe he came from some english city couldnt cut it in the sticks and the local people resented him gave him a hard time to the extent of vandalizing his church starting a fire you dont think that sounds a little innercity for a place like this sounds like he was getting some hassle sounds like there could be something the local people are a tad ashamed about wouldnt you say he looked pleased about this he would make a point now of finding out precisely what had happened and what if anything the community had to hide betty on the other hand could sympathize with juliet pottingers lowprofile approach yes it would be necessary to find out what had happened on what was now their property but not to go about this in a conspicuous way they were incomers and foreigners and had a different religion which may somehow have become known to certain people unspoken opinion might already be stacked against them they must not be seen to be too nosy or too clever they must move quietly after penney left she said the church appeared to lose heart it was in full use until nineteen seventyeight and now its a ruin in just over thirty years not exactly a slow decay aw buildings go to pieces in no time at all when theyre left derelict she implies in the letter that it was already falling apart and maybe in those days the authorities werent so hot on preserving old buildings im more curious about what the local people did to this penney wheres he now i dont know and were the last people to know anyone in the clergy who might be able to find out we look ill go find out the truth tomorrow ill go see prosser were gonna need more logs real logs ill go find out if prosser knows a reputable log dealer and at the same time ill ask him about reverend penney see if he tries to lean on me do the rural menace stuff ill go if you like betty said without thinking robin put down his cocoa mug because i will rub him up the wrong way because i will be gauche and loud and unsubtle because i will say you cant touch me pal i got the old gods on my side of course not im sorry youre right you should go men around here prefer to deal with other men what i thought he looked at her and grinned this is nothing to worry about no betty said far from representing her and robins destiny and the beautiful future of the pagan movement in this country she was now convinced that the old church of michael was a tainted and revolting place that should indeed be left to rot but how could she lay all this on him now after his crushing disappointment over the blackmore illustrations lets go to bed she said armageddon no way could she ever have imagined it was going to be like this shed thought that it could never be worse than the pulpit that first time up in liverpool when those three creaking wooden steps were like the steps to the gallows and may god have mercy on your soul shed drunk very little of the spring water on offer in the green room never once thinking of the fierce heat from the studio lights and what it might do to the irrigation of the inside of her mouth with ten minutes to go shed popped outside for a cigarette sharing a fireescape platform with two slysmiling new age warriors and their seveninch spliff shaking her head with a friendly liberal smile when theyd offered it to her never really imagining that the nerves wouldnt just float away once they were on the air because well because this was trivial trash tabloid television forgotten before the first editions of tomorrows papers got onto the streets this really mustnt be taken too seriously merrily froze two thousand years of christianity setting like concrete around her shoulders the light was merciless and hotter than the sun she was in terror she couldnt even pray merrily watkins hed said youre a vicar a woman of god lets hear how you defend your creator against that kind of logic isnt there really a fair bit of sense in what neds saying he was slight not very tall his natural expression was halfway to a smile the lips in a little v he was light and nimble and chatty he earned probably six times as much as a bishop the shinysuited eellike nonstick omnipotent john fallon well merrily he said isnt there and yet there were no tricks no surprises it had started exactly as tania beauman had said it would with the parents jean and roger gillespie goddessworshippers from taunton somerset who wanted their daughters religion to be formally accepted at her primary school theyd have a second child starting school next year later a third one they wanted new data programmed into the education machine respectful references to new names isis artemis aradia roger was an architect with the county council he maintained that his beliefs were fully accepted on the executive estate where the gillespies had lived for three years they were both so humourless merrily thought as jean demanded parity with islam and boring old christianity and special provision for her familys celebration of the solstices and the equinoxes the inclusion of pagan songs at least once a week at the school assembly fallon had finally interrupted this tedious monotone and what do you do exactly jean do you hold nude ceremonies in your garden what happens if the neighboursve got a barbecue going well thats just the kind of attitude we dont get for a start jeans single plait hung like a fat hawser down her bosom our rituals are private and discreet and are respected by our neighbours who fine sure ok john fallon had already been on the move away from jean who carried on talking although the boommic operator had moved on fallon had spun away through ninety degrees to his next interviewee the elegant mr edward bain nothing so vulgar as king of the witches were here to talk about religious belief fallon had read from the autocue at the beginning of the show and the right of people in a free society to worship their own gods some of you might think its a bit loony even scary but the thousands of pagan worshippers in britain maintain that theirs is the only true religion of these islands and they want their ceremonies which sometimes include nudity simulated and indeed actual sex to be given full charitable status and full recognition from the state and the education system when he had his back to merrily she saw the wire to his earpiece coming out of his collar like a ruched scar on the back of his neck relaying instructions or suggestions from the programmes director in some hidden bunker ned bain fallon said youre the high priest of a london coven can we use the word coven and also a publisher and an expert on ancient religions of all kinds i want you to tell me simply and concisely why you think paganism is today more relevant and more important to these islands than christianity and edward bain had sat one leg hooked casually over the other like like sean had sat sometimes a tv natural expounding without pause his eyes apparently on fallon but actually gazing beyond him across the studio his eyes in fact were lazily fixed on merrilys and they she clutched her chair seat tightly they were not seans well for a start theyve had their two millennia he said reasonably two thousand years of war and divison repression and persecution torture genocide in the name of a cruel despotic deity dreamed up in the middle east from the seats tiered behind merrily came the swelling sound of indrawn breath like a whistling in the eaves part awe part shock part admiration at such cool convincing blasphemy two thousand years of the cynical exploitation by wealthy men of humanitys unquenchable yearning for spirituality the milking of the peasants to build and maintain those great soaring cathedrals created to harness energies they no longer even understand two thousand years of christianity a tiny but ruinous period of earths history a single dark night of unrelenting savagery and rape there was a trickle of applause he continued to look at merrily his mouth downturned in sorrow but a winners light in his eyes the space between them seemed to shrink until she could almost feel the warm dusting of his breath on her face on a huge screen above him was projected the image of a serene barebreasted woman wearing a tiara like a coiled snake now its our turn he said softly we who worship in woods and circles of rough stone we who are not afraid to part the curtains to peer into the mysteries from which christianity still cowers screaming shrilly at us to come away come away to us and to the rest of you if you care to give it any thought christianity is at best a dull screen a block it is antispiritual it was forcefed to the conquered and brutalized natives of the old lands who practised as we once did when we still had sensitivity a natural religion in harmony with the tides and the seasons entirely beneficent gentle pacific not rigid nor patriarchal the old religion has always recognized the equality of the sexes and exalted the nurturing spirit the spirit which can soothe and heal the earth before it is too late the trickle of applause becoming a river john fallon standing with folded arms and his habitual halfsmile someone had dimmed the studio lights so that ned bain was haloed like a christ figure and when he spoke again it might have been sean there being reasonable logical merrily began to sweat the clock of the earth is running down weve become alienated from her we must put the last two thousand years behind us and speak to her again and the river of applause fanned out into a delta among not only the myriad ranks of the pagans but also the shopfloor workers and the wages staff and the middle and upper management of the paint factory in walsall the claps and cheers turned to an agony of white noise in merrilys head and she closed her eyes and when she opened them there was the fuzzy boommic on a pole hanging over her head and the camera had glided silently across like an enormous floorpolisher and john fallon legs apart hands behind his back was telling her and the millions at home really a fair bit of sense in what neds saying well merrily isnt there shes frozen jane thought in horror as two seconds passed two entire seconds on livenight a hush in the bear pit come on love gerrys hands were chivvying at the monitors youre not in the bloody pulpit now maurice the director said into his microphone john why dont you just ask her very gently if shes feeling all right jane wanted to haul him from his swivel chair and wrestle him to the ground among the snaking wires but then thank christ mum started talking it just wasnt her voice that was the problem she sounded like shed just been awakened from a drugged sleep well all right it was going to be a tough one ned bain was a class act a cool cool person undeniably sexy and jane admittedly felt some serious empathy with what he was saying like hadnt she herself had this same argument with mum time and again pointing out that paganism witchcraft was a european thing born in dark woodland glades married to mountain streams it was practical and jane didnt even see it as entirely incompatible with christianity the camera was tight on mum so tight that oh no you could see the sweat and she was gabbling in that strange cracked voice about christianity being pure selfless love while paganism seemed to be about sex at its most mechanical and feelingless feelingless jesus jane thought is that a real word oh god this is bloody trite crap especially after the pagan guy maurice told john fallon lets come back to her when and if she gets her shit together all right john fallon spun away a flying smirk thats the ah church of england angle someone jeered oh god when she was sure the camera was away from her merrily dabbed a crumpled tissue to her forehead knowing immediately what she should have said how she could have dealt with bains simplistic generalizations now wanting to jump up and tug fallon back but it was of course too late from halfway up an aisle between rows of seats she caught a glance from steve ewing the producer his mouth hidden under a lipmicrophone as used by ringside boxing commentators it was as if he was ironically rerunning his preprogramme pep talk youll be kicking yourself all the way home because you missed your chance of getting your argument across on the programme from the adjacent seat to her left a hand gently squeezed her arm patrick ryan the sociologist who was supposed to have shagged half the priestesses in the southern counties while compiling his thesis on pagan ritual practice youll get used to it he whispered she nodded she sought out the eyes of ned bain but they were in shadow now he seemed to be looking downwards he appeared very still and limp as though his body was recharging she thought he was staring at me the whole time and afterwards i couldnt do a thing gonna talk to maureen now john fallon was saying back on the other side of the studio floor just across the aisle from ned bain maureen your teenage daughter was into all this peaceful new age nature worship but that was only the start because gemma ended up i believe in a psychiatric unit oh sure blame bain for your own deficiencies merrily shook herself furious blame poor dead sean shes still attending the unit john maureen was a bulky woman early fifties south london accent apart from that she wont hardly leave the house any more poor kid she became a witch right she became a witch when she was about seventeen when she first went to the tech college there was a lecturer there like him maureen jerked a thumb at ned bain who tilted his head quizzically smooth goodlooking guy on the make ned chuckled really nothing like sean how could she have but lets just make it clear fallon said that this was not ned bain here so this other man recruited gemma into a witch coven maureen described how her daughter had been initiated in a shop cellar converted into a temple and within about six months her personality had completely changed shed broken off her engagement to a very nice boy who was a garage mechanic and then they found out she was into hard drugs but i never knew the worst of it till her mate come to see me one day this was the mate shed joined the coven with and she told me gemma had got involved with this other group what was doing black magic she said gemma went with the rest of them to st anthonys church and i know this happened cause it was in the papers and they desecrated it desecrated how well you know did did their dirt the big face crumpled things like john let me say ned bain was leaning forward the camera pulled back the boommic operator shifted position this is satanism and satanism is a specifically antichristian movement it is entirely irrelevant to wicca or any of the other strands of paganism we do not oppose christianity we the hell you dont merrily was half out of her seat but well offmic we are an alternative to christianity bain stressed and also i should perhaps point out at this stage a precursor of the tired politicized cult of jesus and i say precursor because theres evidence that christianity itself is no more than a fabrication a modification of the cult of dionysus in which the story of the mangod who dies and is resurrected yeah yeah fallon stopped him fascinating stuff ned but i want to stay with satanism for a moment as you would merrily muttered now ned you would say that satanism is as much anathema to pagans as it is to the christian church and yet young gemma graduated or descended to some kind of devil worship after being initiated as a witch i want to come back fallon wheeled to merrily watkins merrilys hands tightened on the arms of her chair please god now what we didnt say before about merrily is that as well as being one of the new breed of female parish priests shes also the official exorcist i believe deliverance minister is the correct term these days for the diocese of hereford thats right yes ignore the camera the lights dont look at bains eyes so what i want to ask you do people like maureen often come to you with this same kind of story i she swallowed how could she say she hadnt been in the job long enough to have accumulated any kind of client base i have to say john that what you might call real satanism is uncommon what you have are kids whore playing old black sabbath albums and get a perverse buzz out of dressing up and doing something horribly antisocial quite often youll find that these kids will join a witch coven in the belief that its far more extreme if you like than it actually is that theyre entering a world of sex rites and blood sacrifice which is your fault one of the pagans shouted because thats how the church has portrayed us for centuries shes saying maureen shrilled extending a finger at merrily that my daughter only joined the witches because she thought they were evil no what im shes sitting on the fence a heavy man bounded down one of the aisles thats what shes doing two security heavies moved in from different directions fallon blocked the mans path you are the reverend peter gemmell he was greybearded and big enough to take on either of the two security men you wont find me on your list im an industrial chaplain and i came with the factory group from walsall but thats beside the point what i want is to tell you all the truth that my colleague here is too diplomatic too delicate too wishywashy to introduce and that is to say that satan himself is present in this studio tonight oh hell jane said glumly a fruitcake just when i thought she might be really cooking lovely gerry leaned back in his canvas chair with his hands behind his head voicecrackle from maurices cans he nodded scanning the monitors to make sure gemmell was alone ok steve thanks will do john lets see where this one goes ok eirion looked shellshocked anything could happen down there couldnt it suppose that guy had a gun probably wouldnt be that much use against satan anyway jane reasoned why dont you tell them the rev peter gemmell hissed at merrily why dont you tell them that satan is in our midst that hes here now why dont you stand up and denounce him fallon saved her well you tell us peter since youre here you point him out where exactly is satan sitting i shall tell you gemmell didnt hesitate hes sitting directly behind you fallon stepped aside to reveal ned bain smiling and shaking his head pityingly that man gemmell glared contemptuously at bain that man speaks from the devils script from his lips spews the slick rhetoric of satan the seducer sea of light merrily wondered the satyr shall cry to his fellow gemmell roared yea there shall the night hag alight and find for herself a resting place isaiah merrily thought of the number of interpretations you could put on that in fact she was sure there was a rather more innocent translation in the revised english bible she just couldnt remember what it was couldnt remember anything tonight the satyr gemmell explained is the socalled horned god of the witches the god pan the night hag is the demon lilith and so the bible tells us quite plainly that paganism invites the demonic to share its bed and that is as true today as it was when it was written the old testament bain said wearily this guy comes down here and quotes at me from a hotchpotch of myth and legend and old wives tales the voice of satan gemmell snarled and merrily was aware of steve ewing to her right putting the bouncers on alert thank you peter john fallon placed an arm on the big priests shoulder were grateful for that but i dont think were quite ready for the battle of armageddon tonight i have made my point gemmell said with dignity and with a baleful glance at merrily walked back up the aisle and then stopped and turned and before the security men could reach him roared out we must and will put out the false lights in the night of filth good man fallon said well ned bains either the saviour of our planet or hes the antichrist but before that interruption merrily you were saying socalled satanists are just a bunch of delinquent kids no what i said was that real satanism is uncommon i do know it exists i have encountered the use of occult practices for evil purposes and i think neds being a bit optimistic if he thinks all pagans are in it to heal the earth her mouth was dry again she swallowed go on fallon said well i know for a fact that pagan groups are infiltrated by people with less altruistic aims whether its money or drugs or iffy sex black propaganda a woman screeched fallon held up a hand for quiet i do know a young girl merrily said carefully thinking of jane watching at home shes a girl who was very nearly ensnared by the people who were secretly running what appeared to be a fairly innocent mystical group for women its a minefield in the glamorous world of goddesses and prophecy and and nude dancing at midnight its very hard to distinguish between the people who truly and sincerely believe all this will heal the earth and free our souls and the ones who are into personal power and gratification of their what group the woman shouted shes making it up john you make her tell us where it was ssssh fallon said ok where was this merrily it was around hereford around the welsh border obviously im not going to name anybody who all right fallon turned to the young woman whod shouted out its vivienne right and youre the priestess of a coven in manchester how do you know what kind of people youre initiating how do you vet them you just know vivienne had cropped hair and earrings that seemed to be made from the bejewelled bodies of seahorses the initiation process itself weeds out the scum bags and the weirdos its a psychic thing you learn to pick up on it and the goddess herself that is rubbish merrily interrupted vivienne paused john fallon smiled merrily said people dont get vetted before theyre allowed to mess with other peoples minds you dont have any real organization or any fixed creed your rituals dont go back to prechristian times they were all made up in the last half century youre a complete ragbag of halftruths and good intentions and bad intentions and and thats any different from your church vivienne reared out of her seat half of you dont believe in a virgin birth half of you dont believe in the resurrection and you call us a ragbag im telling you lady youll have come to bits long before we do its happening right now and you youre part of the decay we look at you and the blokes see a pretty face and nice legs and thats just the churchs latest scheme to deflect attention from the rot in its guts a buildup of cheers among the pagan ranks john fallon stepped back to let the camera catch it all your church is dying on its feet vivienne grinned triumphantly its not gonna see the new century out you took our sacred sites from us and were gonna take them back your fancy churches will fall and honest grass will grow up through their ruins and towers will stand alone like megaliths whoah fallon stepped back into the action what are you banging on about all right vivienne said shes from the welsh border yeah i can show you a church on her actual doorstep where thats already happened i can show you a church with a tower and graves and everything which is now a pagan church you dont know whats happening on your own doorstep you dont know nothing fairground move it jane raced along the bright corridor trailing her fleece coat over a shoulder the building appeared to be still only half finished there were lumps of plaster everywhere and the panes of many windows still had strips of brown tape across them irene move i was just trying to thank maurice and gerry well write them a letter come on believe me she is not going to hang on here shes going to be out of that bear pit before any of them can pin her in a corner shell be driving like a bat out of hell down the motorway swearing that shell never never never again i thought she did ok eirion said blundering behind her in the end she got that woman very annoyed you thought she did ok i think she just about managed to rescue the situation shell think she was absolutely crap and like disgraced the church and the bishop and jesus christ jane hit a pair of swing doors still running cant you move any faster i thought you were in the rugby team the chess team eirion caught the doors on the rebound you know it was the chess team in the old nova with jane leaning back panting against a peeling headrest eirion said i wonder what gerry meant when that woman was going on about the pagan church huh he said thatll flog if im quick and made a note on his script that church you mean no the story i suppose eirion drove out of the parking area past a red and white striped barrier which was already raised he means sell the story who to who would you normally sell a story to to the papers he was a tabloid journalist wasnt he and john fallon didnt even follow it up on the programme so he doesnt follow up anything thatll take longer than thirty seconds or wont lead to a fight irene was that crass meaningless and totally inconclusive or what bit like the welsh assembly without a vote you still want to do tv one day what oh well not quite that obviously not exactly that i want to be a tv news reporter so did those guys at one time i expect i mean nobody starts out wanting to shovel shit for a living do they that was you wasnt it eirion slowed for a roundabout were looking for m south arent we huh yeah this one eirion hit the slip road that girl your mother was talking about the girl who nearly got ensnared by those people running that womens mystical group in hereford you already know it was me you saw how it ended i wasnt sure well it was and yet youre still interested in paganism and all that because thats why were here isnt it i mean i know you did think i might get something out of it careerwise but you are kind of drawn to all that arent you i mean still jane snorted a laugh a big motorway sign loomed up wreathed in tendrils of mist worcester the south west so many options the motorway was romantic at night despite those dark blurred nightmare memories that were more nightmare than memory but fading like despite everything eirion persisted youre still turned on by weird mystical stuff irene its not weird mystical stuff its about what we are and where were going do you never lie in bed and wonder what were part of and where it all ends i could lie awake all night and agonize about it but it wouldnt make any difference would it i dont like the look of this fog jane but suppose it would suppose you could i mean suppose you could go places deep into yourself and into the heart of the universe at the same time but i know i couldnt i wouldnt have the what is it the application neither would most of those people there tonight they think they can discover enormous eternal mindblowing truths by summoning gods and spirits and things but theyre just fooling themselves i mean they were just kind of sad tossers ned bain wasnt sad course he was he was just the tosser in the suit eirion drifted onto the motorway it wasnt too foggy but you couldnt see the sky jane hoped mum wasnt feeling too choked about her performance to drive carefully she said he was making the point that paganism is no longer a crank thing that it has to be taken seriously as a major continuing tradition in this country and a genuine valid force for change he was like very controlled and eloquent id guess hes quite a way along the path you mean the garden path you know exactly what i mean hes manipulative you couldnt trust him because hes kind of goodlooking well eirion said thats obviously a small plusfactor with you sod off if i was that superficial would i be going out with you are you superficial going out with me possibly i dont know i might be too weird for you yeah thats my principal worry too eirion said deadpan bastard jane leaned her shoulder into his i wish thered been time to wait and grab that vivienne when she came out she wouldnt have told you where that church is you notice how quick she clammed up as though she knew shed said too much because if some witchcraft sect are secretly practising at a christian church well i dont know if they havent actually broken in is that some kind of crime probably not well there you go your mothers going to have to find out about it though isnt she probably and what will she do when she does find out go in there with a big cross how should i know you could be more sympathetic to her i am sympathetic youre also sympathetic to paganism im interested ive had experiences odd psychic things i cant explain like what i dont want to talk about it really oh eirion drove in silence yellow fogwarning lights signalled a forty mph speed limit im not being funny jane said this just isnt the time no havent you had things happen to you you cant explain feelings about places things you thought you saw times when your emotions and your like sensations are so intense that you feel youre about to burst through into something else some other level i mean the welsh are supposed to be like my grans a bit spooky tell me in what way no you tell me about your mum tell me about your dad that bloody gerry jane said eirion was hesitant was what he said the rest of it was lost under the rattling of a lorry passing them in the centre lane a lowloader without a load fast and free in the night yeah jane said he had it more or less right my dad met my mum at university where they were both studying law and she got pregnant with me and left the university and he carried on and became a bent solicitor there was a special course for bent solicitors ha ha they were both going to do legal aid stuff and defend people who couldnt afford solicitors and all kinds of liberal crusading stuff like that according to mum but dad wanted money because of me maybe hed have said because of the responsibility though mum says she was already learning things about him she didnt like and anyway he got into iffy deals with some clients and mum found out about it and there was this big morality scene not helped by him screwing his clerk jane paused for breath around this time mum had been helping the local vicar with community work and also she had this quite heavy experience of her own what sort of experience this was when things were really really bad and she was desperately trying to sort things out in her own head she drove off into the sticks and came across this tiny little church in a wood or something and there was like a lamplit path it was night no it was daytime dickhead the lamplit path was like metaphorical or in her head or a visionary thing and listen if she ever asks i didnt tell you this because she hates cant you go any faster theres a speed limit i cant even see any fog now because if she catches us up theres still a speed limit and so your dad was killed he hit a motorway bridge they were both killed i mean karen too i read some newspaper cuttings i wasnt supposed to find it was horrible a ball of fire im sorry it was years ago jane said without emotion which motorway the m i suppose this is the m isnt it its a long motorway well it wasnt on this stretch i dont think i dont quite know where it was i didnt read that bit you dont want to keep looking out for a certain bridge all your life do you no you dont what gerry said about a guilt trip thats bullshit i mean why should she feel guilty she was never mixed up in any of those crooked deals well all right its easier for a widow to get into the church than a newly divorced woman maybe she did feel guilty at the way that decision was so neatly taken out of her hands how do you feel about your dad he was kind of fun jane said but i was very little your dads always fun when youre little what was your home like did you all speak welsh i mean do you only when we have certain visitors as everybody can speak english and english is a much bigger language and more versatile you dont have to speak welsh to anybody but there are some people its more correct to speak welsh to if you see what i mean wow minefield its a cultural minefield yeah but i like welsh its not my first language but its not that far behind do you swear in welsh i mean you could swear in welsh at school in front of the teachers and nobody would know thats an interesting point eirion said actually most welsh people when they swear revert automatically to english theyre walking along the street conversing happily in welsh then one trips over the kerb and its like oh shit oh shit jane whispered it was sudden like a grey woollen blanket flung over your head oh dear god jane said it was like theyd entered some weird fairground red lights in the air also white lights at skewed angles intersecting across all three carriageways she heard eirion breathe in sharply as he hit the brakes and spun the wheel spun into a carnival of lights lights all over the place false lights in the night of filth grabbed by her seatbelt jane heard screams dipping and rising like the screams of women on a roller coaster the engine stalled the car slid and juddered and stopped had they stopped under the fuzzed and shivering lights there was a moment of massive stillness in which jane registered that eirion had managed to bring the car to a halt without hitting anything she breathed out in shattered relief oh jesus its a pileup eirion said i dont know what to do should we get out we might be able to help someone yeah there was fog and there was also steam or something and the silhouettes of figures moving even inside the car there was a smell of petrol jane scrubbed at the windscreen saw metal scrunched twisted stretched and pulled like intestine the fog swirled like poison gas alive with shouting and wailing and the waxy solidified beams of headlights jane screamed suddenly and thudded back into the passenger seat eirion frenziedly unbuckled his seatbelt leaned across her jane i saw an arm in the road an arm sticking out with a hand and fingers all splayed out and white just an arm it was just brakes shrieked behind them behind you never thought about behind jane actually turned in time to see it the monster with many eyes before it reared and snarled and crushed them lurid bit gareth prosser was loading hay or silage or whatever the hell they called it in these parts onto a trailer for his sheep out on the hills he was panting out small balloons of white breath he didnt even look up when robin strolled over just muttered once into the trailer owre you robin deduced that his neighbour was enquiring after his health im fine he said although he still felt like shit after the blackmore putdown nice morning specially after all that fog last night not bad gareth prosser straightened up he wore a dark green nylon coverall and an old discoloured cap behind him you could hardly distinguish the grey farmhouse from the barns and tinroofed shacks there was a cold mist snaking amongst a clump of conifers on the hillside but the sun had risen out of it the sun looked somehow forlorn and out of place like an orange beachball in the roadway it was around eightfifteen am wonder if you can give me some advice robin said gareth prosser looked at him well not in fact at him but at a point just a couple degrees to his left which was disconcerting made you think there was someone behind you with an axe firewood robin said we need some dry wood for the stove and i figured you would know a reputable dealer gareth prosser thought this over he was a shortish thickset guy in his fifties and now well overweight his face was jowly the colour and texture of cement eventually he said mansel smiths your man ah robin was unsure how to proceed on account of if his recollection was accurate the dealer who had sold them the notorious trailerload of damp and resinous pine also answered to the name of mansel smith you get your own wood from uh mansel prosser slammed up the tailgate on the trailer we burns anthracite he said right if mansel smith was the only wood dealer around robin could believe that and yet somehow he thought that if gareth prosser did ever require a cord of firewood from mansel it would not be pine and it would not be wet well thanks for your advice no problem prosser said right now if this situation was the other way about robin figured he himself would be asking his neighbour in for a coffee but prosser just stood there up against his trailer like one of those monuments where the figure kind of dissolves into uncarved rock no particular hostility chances were this guy didnt know or didnt care that robin was pagan well this was all fine by robin who stayed put stayed cool if there was one thing hed learned from the craft it was the ability to become still part of the landscape like an oak tree prosser stayed put because maybe he was part of the landscape and robin figured they could both have stood there alongside that trailerload of winter fodder until one of them felt hunger pains or he unlikely to be prosser burst out laughing but after about five seconds the farmer looked up when a womans voice called out gareth who was that prosser didnt reply and she came round the side of one of the sheds onto the halffrozen rutted track oh she said hi there robin said the woman was a little younger than gareth maybe fifty and a good deal better preserved she wore tight jeans and boots and a canvas bomber jacket she had a strong lean face and clear blue eyes and short hair with possibly highlights good morning the woman said distinctly im councillor prossers wife hi robin thorogood from uh next door judith prosser they shook hands she had a firm grip she even looked directly into his eyes ive got some coffee on she said that would be wonderful ill be in now gareth said robin had learned from betty that when they said now they meant in a short while so he smiled and nodded at gareth prosser and gratefully followed judith up the track toward the farmhouse complex in the middle distance their two teenage sons were wheeling their dirt bikes out to the hill there was a sound like a chainsaw starting up and one of the boys splattered off be an international next year our richard judith prosser said proudly had his first bike when he was four all wales schoolboy scrambling champion at eleven perfect country for it see doesnt it mess up the fields messes up the footpaths a bit mrs prosser smiled ruefully we gets complaints from some of the rambling groups from off but not from the local people robin nodded councillor prossers boys see mrs prosser said like it was perfectly reasonable that being a councillor should automatically exclude you from certain stifling social impositions robin didnt detect any irony but maybe it was there i see he said this is juliet pottinger an efficient and authoritative scottish voice im afraid i am away this weekend but you may wish to leave a message after the tone if you are a burglar uninterested in thousands of books which are essentially old rather than antiquarian then i can tell you that you are almost certainly wasting your time betty thought she sounded like a woman who would at least give you a straight answer if not until monday bugger she cleared away the breakfast things ran some water for washingup whatever robin learned about the reverend penney from the prossers she didnt trust him not to put some paganfriendly spin on it and it was important to her now to find out the truth what had penney done to cause weeping and wailing in the village why had the local people hushed it up did the priest ellis know the full story and did this explain why he was so determined to subject the site to some kind of exorcism shed never settle here until she knew the phone rang had her reaching for a towel before the answering machine could grab the call oh my dear im sure its working already mrs wilshire i have had what without doubt was the best nights sleep ive had in months thats er wonderful betty said hesitantly because the likelihood of her arthritis remedy kicking in overnight was remote to say the least i can bend my fingers further than oh i must show you will you be in this area today well i suppose marvellous i shall be at home all day er you didnt stop taking your cortisone tablets did you because steroids do need to be wound down slowly oh i wouldnt take any chances no it was psychological of course and betty felt a little wary mrs wilshire was a woman who could very easily become dependent on people if betty wasnt careful shed wind up having to call in to see her every other day still if it hadnt been for mrs wilshire they would never have got onto the penney affair ok ill drop in later this morning if thats all right er mrs wilshire the papers you kindly let me take about the church there was one from a mrs pottinger relating to the reverend penney do you know anything about that oh there was a lot of trouble about him my dear everyone was very glad when he left so im told even though the church was decommissioned and sold soon afterwards that was a pity although i believe it was always rather a draughty old place er do you remember when you bought the house and the church did the reverend ellis come to visit you there oh i dont know i was hardly ever there it was bryans project bryans house until it was finished which i confess i really rather hoped it never would be so you dont know if the reverend ellis went to see bryan there im afraid i dont though im sure he would have mentioned it he never mentioned mr ellis in connection with that house i dont remember him ever mentioning mr ellis no suggestion of mr ellis wanting to conduct a service in the church a church service er yes oh no my dear im sure i would have remembered that just us then the first thing mrs judith prosser asked him was if they would be keeping stock on their land robin replied that farmers seemed to be having a hard enough time right now without amateurs creeping in under the fence which led her to ask what he did for a living and him to tell her he was an artist thats interesting mrs prosser said though robin couldnt basically see how she could find it so there wasnt a painting on any wall of the parlour just photographs mainly of men some of the photos were so old that the men had wing collars and watch chains as well as chairmans chains robin wondered if councillor was some kind of inherited title in the prosser family like even if you had all the personality of a bag of fertilizer they still elected you on account of the prossers knew the way to county hall in llandrindod mrs prosser went through to the kitchen leaving the door open there was a black suit on a hanger behind the door we have a funeral this afternoon she explained i guess councillors have a lot of funerals to attend she looked at him in this case its for a friend im sorry we all are sit down mr thorogood the furniture was dark and heavy and highly polished the leather chair he sat in had arms that came almost up to his shoulders when you put your hands on them you felt like a dog begging funerals was this an opening so its uh local this funeral boy how soon you could grow to hate one simple little word in the village yes so you still have a graveyard despite no church mrs prosser didnt reply he heard her pouring coffee it occurred to him she hadnt commented on him being american maybe from off was allinclusive how far off was of no major consequence he raised his voice a little i guess there mustve been problems with funerals when the old st michaels church was in use what with the creek and all ok it might not be in the best of taste to keep on about funerals but it was his only way into the reverend penney and he wasnt about to let go because of the brook no ones been buried there in centuries she came back with two brown cups and saucers on a tray thank you uh judith hey i met the vicar he came round mr ellis is a good rector but not local robin said you dont get local ministers anywhere any more do you but he brings people in very popular he is quite an attraction you like to see new people coming in she laughed a goodlooking woman in her weathered way depends what people they are isnt it nobody objects to churchgoers and the collections support the village hall theyre always very generous just nick doesnt seem your regular kind of minister robin said he suits our needs said mrs prosser father elliss style of worship might not be what weve been used to in this area but a breath of something new is no bad thing were always told jog us out of our routine isnt it i guess he tasted the coffee it was strong and surprisingly good judith prosser put the tray on a small table and came to sit on the sofa opposite she was turning out to be unexpectedly intelligent not so insular as hed figured he felt ashamed of his smug preconceptions about rural people local people so he went for it from what i hear this area seems to attract kind of offthewall clergy this guy uh penney my she said you have picked up a lot of gossip in a short time not everybody finds themselves buying a church you feel you oughta find out the history or the lurid bits at least uh i guess he gave her his charming sheepish smile terry penney judith sipped her coffee whats to say quiet sort of man scholarly you know had his study floortoceiling with books not an unfriendly person mind not reclusive particularly not at first he didnt live at the farmhouse our house oh no that was always a farm no the rectory was just out of the village on the walton road mr weal has it now the solicitor robin recalled the name from someplace juliet pottingers letter so he put down his coffee on a coaster resting on the high chair arm the uh lurid bit restrain yourself mr thorogood im getting there robin grinned she was ok he guessed the christ is the light sticker was just the politically correct thing to do in old hindwell well it was my husband see who had the first inkling of something amiss through the county council every year old hindwell church would apply for a grant from the welsh church acts committee or whatever they called it then which allotted money to old buildings for preservation although the church was in the hereford diocese its actually in wales as you know however this particular year there was no request for money she turned on a wry smile she was he hadnt expected this enjoying telling this story the reverend penney had been yere oh must have been nearly eighteen months by then thought he must have forgotten we did so councillor prosser goes to see him and mr penney bold as you please says oh no he hasnt forgotten at all he doesnt want a grant he doesnt think the church should be preserved robin widened his eyes the church is wrong says mr penney its in the wrong place it should never have been built where it is the waters not healthy the fabrics rotten parkings difficult oh a whole host of excuses he says hes written to the diocese and whoever else suggesting that they dispense with st michaels at the earliest possible opportunity robin was fazed he called for them to get rid of his own church just like that just like that no one could believe it wow robin was thinking furiously had penney realized this was a powerful pagan site was it that simple had he made some kind of discovery he tried to hide his excitement was he mad perhaps hed always been a little mad said mrs prosser but we just never saw it until it was too late so like what did he do judith prosser put down her coffee no one likes to talk about it but as the owner now i suppose you have a right to be told one of the few good things about living here was that the post usually arrived before nine in some rural areas you couldnt count on getting it before lunchtime todays was a catalogue from a mail order supplier of garden ornaments how quickly these people caught up with you and a letter addressed to mrs thoroughgood with a hereford postmark that mrs told her what this was going to be she sat down at the table with the letter in front of her usual cheap white envelope theyd received two when they were living in shrewsbury they said things like we know about your dirty nude ceremonies worshipping heathen gods the lord will punish you how had they found out whod told them had robin been indiscreet betty felt gutted the sick irony of this was that she hadnt practised as a witch since they moved here and the way she was feeling now never would again at least not in any organized way she contemplated tossing the letter in the stove unopened but if she did that it would dwell in her would be twice as destructive with contempt betty slit the envelope she read the note three times usual capitals usual poor spelling but otherwise not quite what shed expected you had better tell that long haired lout that if he wants to go helping himself to the favours of the biggest hore in the village he ought to be more discreat about it revelations it was incredible so wonderfully bizarre that walking back to st michaels farm robin forgot all about agonizing over that asshole blackmore who thought bestsellerdom had conferred upon him an art critics instincts on the footbridge over the hindwell brook he stopped a moment evoking the incredible scene on that october morning back in the sixties when the brook was in flood had anyone photographed it could there be pictures still around naw anyone whod pulled out a camera would probably have been compelled by some local bylaw to hand over the film to councillor prosser whichever prosser happened to be the councillor at the time judith prosser had let him out the front way through a darkbeamed hallway with some nice oak panelling up against the panelling there had been an outsize chair with a leather seat and a brass plate on the back the chairmans chair judith had explained when he asked about it from the old hindwell community council disbanded some years ago under local government reorganization and yes gareth had been its chairman twice robin wondered if judith prosser called her husband by his title maybe got a little bedtime buzz out of it oh oh give it to me harder councillor he grinned at the winter sun he felt a whole lot lighter holy shit hed actually spoken in a meaningful way to a local person it was a seminal thing indeed when he looked across at the church on its promontory he even had the feeling that the imbolc sabbat could go back on the schedule he could see it now using his visualization skills to cancel the brightness and paint the sky dark he could see lights awakening in the church its ruins coming alive he conjured the sound of celtic drums and a tin whistle son et lumiere he saw in the foreground bettys graceful silhouette betty in her pale cloak and a headdress woven from twigs and in the headdress a ring of tiny flames a sacred circle of candlespears a crown of lights he came in through the back door of st michaels farmhouse so much happier than when hed gone out of it returning with the breeze behind him siddown babe he told her you should hear this should i she was already sitting down robin halted on the stone flags his mood fell like a cooling meteor to earth her voice was flat as nan bread at gone ten in the morning she was still in her robe she looked pale and swolleneyed sitting at the kitchen table with a glass of the hot water she sometimes drank early in the day you ok her hair also looked flat like tired barnstraw shed been sleeping when hed slipped out of bed around seven hed first made some coffee and toast for himself not keeping especially quiet and left a note for her on the table before he went over to the prosser farm he was half suspecting then that it was going to be one of those days the kind hed hoped there wouldnt be any more of after they moved to the country in fact since theyd moved here those days had accumulated one after the other sure as sunrise it was now reaching the point where it seemed they could never simultaneously be in a good mood like the sun would only shine on one of them at any one time is this a psychic malaise could this be solved bets he was burning to bring her comfort but he didnt know how there were always going to be areas of her he could not reach he accepted this he also accepted that in some ways he was no more than her attendant this was not necessarily sad was it im sorry time of the moon she gave him the palest smile he could recall tell me what you learned at the farm she was evidently not going to talk about whatever it was he sat down opposite her and in a voice from which the oil of narrative enthusiasm had now been well drained told her what hed learned about the reverend penney it was obviously his change of mood but now he saw beyond the bizarre he saw the sadness of it all its like early in the morning still only half light and a mist down by the water so not everyone sees it just the prossers thats the two brothers who lived here and their older brother gareths father and his wife and gareth himself whod have been in his twenties back then and this mrs pottinger she was there soon enough in her role as the eyes and ears of old hindwell for the brecon and radnor express because shed seen a what do you call that thing they kneel on to pray hassock betty said i think yeah pottinger was out for an early walk with the dog and shed seen a hassock floating down the brook maybe her first thought was that this was the vandals she talked about in her letter to major wilshire seems she wanted to call the cops but she ran into the prossers and the prossers stopped her they knew it was an inside job yes betty said like she knew it would have to be well the brook was already high with all the rain and close to bursting its banks and thats what they thinks happened at first its overflowed into the field by the barn and its halfway up the promontory where the church is its like theres a dam like a tree or something fell into the brook but as the day gets lighter they can see the full extent of whats going down here while he told her he was seeing it so clearly hearing the voices over the rushing and roaring of the water shrieks of shock from the women pottingers dog barking in excitement judith prosser hadnt been there of course it would be another fifteen years before she and gareth were married but she must have heard the story many times since everything robin said everything that wasnt part of the fabric or nailed down all the pews the lectern a big tapestry from the wall the choir stalls all floating down the hindwell brook until the first stuff reaches the bend and gets snagged on some branches and it all starts to pile up he could see the great dam one of the pews on end wood groaning and splintering like the wreck of a sailing ship on the rocks the water rising all around he wanted so much to paint it like turner would have painted it all mist and spray betty said the altar oh yeah that too hed stripped off the cloth and dragged it out through the doors and out to the end of the promontory like hed done with all the pews and just just tipped it into the water visualizing the great spout of water as the altar crashed into the brook he was apparently a big guy played rugby very strong his most impressive feat was to rip out the stone font he mustve rolled it out the double doors they found it sticking out of the water like a big rock betty glanced bleakly across at him then picked up her glass and drank the rest of the warm water like it was a double scotch and where was he where was penney gone they never saw him again the prossers and some other guys they could trust salvaged what they could took about four of them to get the font out they waited nearly a week till the water level dropped down and draped tarpaulin and stuff over it meantime couple of weeks later the diocese gets a cheque for several thousand whole damn thing was hushed up they never found out why he did it just hed grown to hate the church was all there was no further explanation hed cleaned it out musta taken him hours working at it through the night by the oil lamps no electricity in there trashing his own church like a maniac when they went inside it was all bare just the bible from off of the lectern the bible lying there in the middle of the nave lying open betty waited a long time before she asked him open at robin smiled shaking his head the book of revelations wouldnt you guess about michael and his angels taking on the devil and his angels the great dragon getting cast out into the earth all of this underlined in ink i see betty stood up shows us where ellis is coming from doesnt it hes clearly heard about penney and the dragon fixation that gets him so screwed up he trashes his own church well ok maybe the poor guy experiences some prechristian energy on that site which is so awesome it shakes his christian faith scares the shit outa him to penney its devilish it blows his mind he wrecks the joint thereby becoming a vehicle for this energy i suppose betty said wearily holy shit a big light came on in robins head hey thats so cool the priest is unwittingly helping the church to cast off christianity to revert betty took her glass to the sink not looking at him like she didnt want to hear what was coming next but hell he had to say it it was staring them right in the face bets its down to us now isnt it to like finish the job it puts us hard against ellis but like is this fate or what he was tingling with excitement this was their clear future at the sink betty put down the glass turned both taps on full she was staring into the water running out of the taps i doubt this is as simple as you imagine or maybe it just is maybe its also fate that the local people werent so attached to the church the way it was that they wanted to fight to save it it was in a poor state anyway it was going to cost a fortune in repairs thats what the pottinger woman said and maybe ellis was right about something coming to the surface bad news for him but not for us babes oh dont be so bloody simplistic just for a moment stop trying to make everything fit into your dream scenario well sure ok he felt hurt i mean lets talk this thing through i have to go out i have to go and see mrs wilshire again what the fuck is this its not your problem oh really hell this needed saying this was long overdue well what is my problem is why you always have to find excuses to get out of here like going in the car why dont you ever even go into the village the place we live next to why dont you get to know the people here people like judith prosser next door ok gareth might be a dumb bastard but shes ok not what i imagined maybe we were wrong to start condemning the local people as total redneck bigots purely on your flawed fucking childhood memories betty didnt flare up she just stared hard at him for a couple of seconds and he stared back and then she said i never said that im sure there are some decent liberal perceptive outwardlooking people down there she went to the table picked up a piece of white notepaper pushed it at him like for instance the person who sent that cold earthly rational the gothic letter d was still on the office door but hanging loose now at an angle d for deliverance bishop hunters idea as had been the reverend watkins becoming deliverance consultant she stood on the stone stairs in front of the closed door and decided after all to go back home her head ached what the hell was she doing here as she turned to creep back down the stairs the office door opened i thought it was merrily stopped and slowly and sheepishly turned around again i thought it was your car sophie was expensively casual in a blue and white alpine sweater what on earth are you doing here nobody would have expected you to come in today shed spoken briefly to sophie on the phone asking her to put the bishop in the picture merrily you look yeah i know starved sophie stood aside for her merrily slung janes duffel coat on the back of her chair and slumped into it if i hadnt come in today i might never have come in again sophie frowned and began making tea through the gatehouse window above broad street the late morning sun flickered unstably in and out between hard clouds the air outside had felt as though it was full of razor blades the weather forecast had said there might be snow showers tonight which was better than fog the bishop tried to ring you sophie laid out two cups and saucers he said if i spoke to you to tell you there was no need to phone back ever dont be silly merrily on reflection im glad you did come in are you listening to me im listening you cannot drive to worcester ill be perfectly you will not i shall drive you leave your car here i dont want an argument about this do you understand well i can take a bit of a rest this afternoon theyre not releasing her until after five she should stay there another night sophie said stiffly concussions unpredictable i think on the whole i can probably do without her discharging herself and stalking the streets of worcester at midnight i should have thought that shed be sufficiently penitent not to dare to sophie merrily cradled her face in cupped hands looked up sorrowfully this is jane were talking about if she were my daughter dont give yourself nightmares merrily dropped her hands trying not to cry from exhaustion anxiety confusion and a terror which seemed to be lodged deep inside her which every so often would pulse hotwiring her entire nervous system delayed shock merrily if you tell me i need trauma counselling ill put this computer through the window sophie brought over a chair sat down opposite merrily tell me then the sun had put itself away again sophie added two sugars into merrilys tea and switched on the answering machine sophie sophie in her incredibly expensive alpine sweater sophie who served the cathedral and all it represented yeah why not when you really contemplate the nature of this job merrily said you can start to think youre more than half mad when the line between reality and whatever else there is is no longer distinct when its no longer even a line and when you swerve around a crashed lorry in the fog and theres a figure staggering in the road that you just know youre going to hit and in the last second while youre throwing yourself around the wheel you see her face im starting actually to understand the churchs conservatism on the supernatural shut the door and bar it block the gap at the bottom with a thick mat let no chink of unnatural light seep in because a chinks as good as a whatever you call a big blast of light that renders you blind as in paul on the road to damascus sophie said not exactly paul was sure you are tired i mean im sure im just not quite sure what im sure of its only by being dull and conservative that the church remains relatively intact bricks and mortar and songs of praise leave the weird stuff to deliverance its a dirty job and theyve never been totally convinced someone has to do it i did watch the livenight programme sophie said i didnt really see how else you could have handled it without coming over as a crank or a bigot both of which are probably better than a drowning wimp merrily drank her tea both hands around the cup like someone pulled out of the sea and wrapped in a blanket you spend an interminable hour making a fool of yourself on tv you walk out thinking all religions a joke youre unhappy and ashamed and cynical all at the same time you get in your car you drive maybe not quite as carefully as you ought to given the ubiquitous fog warnings and the fact that your husband just happened to have died horrifically on this same stretch of motorway you drive into a fog bank you become aware of two dull specks of red that you think must be a hundred yards away and which turn out to be this bloody great crashed lorry dead in your path you spin the wheel in panic you become aware of a figure dragging another figure across the road in front of you the second figure stares full into your headlights and you see you see the face of your daughter who you know for a fact is at home in bed fiftyodd miles away your daughters face blank white expressionless like the face of a corpse sophie shuddered it must have been i cant imagine what that must have been like like nemesis merrily said you know what i was thinking about in the few minutes before i was thinking about this woman who believes shes seeing her sisters ghost i was just deciding she really didnt have a psychiatric problem oh no whats the matter i told her id go with her to her sisters funeral its this afternoon its in about two hours or less oh merrily nobody could possibly expect ive got to youve had no sleep oh ive had had an hour on the sofa fed the cat grabbed a slice of toast rung worcester infirmary twice to make sure janes not worse no look ive got to go because because if i dont and something awful happens because its something i cant just leave in the air then you must lie down for a while first ill find somewhere in the palace look at you youre trembling are you saying this pileup actually happened in the same area where your husband was killed well that was on the other side the northbound lanes he was i suppose he was on my mind when when shed walked into that studio was sean stalking her then was he already deepharboured in her head when shed entered the tv building having driven along the same stretch of the m under the very same bridge against which his car had balled on impact and bounced in its final firedance while he and karen were torn and roasted couldnt tell sophie any of that couldnt tell her about the eloquent pagan ned bain sitting there with his lazy knowing seanlike eyes and even his legs crossed a la sean just stay with the main event and you think what you think is that this cant be happening and if it cant be happening then its a hallucination and you know youre not hallucinating therefore click click it has to be a paranormal experience just like all the paranormal experiences other people have told you about and youve nodded sagely and given your balanced opinion but only you would think that only someone in your only someone in my weird cranky job but you didnt hit her sophie said intensely did you you did not hit jane no there was no impact i didnt hit anyone but still a complete nightmare i mean dreamlike you havent physically driven into your daughter therefore it must be a premonition a vision of killing your own child but it wasnt was it i could see sean in her face that little bump in the nose the twist of the lips i could see sean in her like id never seen him there before juxtaposition of ideas sophie said or something i swerved violently stopped the car and got out terrified out of my mind only to discover sophie reached across the desk squeezed merrilys cold right hand that this really was jane the actual jane being pulled away by a terrified eirion after being very nearly killed when this speeding lowloader smashed into the back of his car she was pale and expressionless not because she was dead but because she was semiconcussed this is the mindblowing perversity of it that there is an absolutely cold earthly rational explanation for everything for every aspect of it why do i find that even more frightening the most horrifying moment in my life and there is in the end a simple rational explanation youre afraid that youve stopped looking for simple rational explanations is that what you mean maybe how many people were killed sophie asked in the end three and one critical in hospital i think about four slightly hurt including jane there were about six cars involved and a couple of lorries seemed like the parameds and the fire brigade were on the scene before i was out of my car there was one poor woman merrily shook her head blinked away the unbelievably horrific image of a tornoff arm on the central reservation you were very lucky both of you and the boy eirion his car was a writeoff hes not injured thats all that matters some whiplash they kept him in for the night too but i think his father picked him up this morning or his fathers chauffeur i talked to his stepmother on the phone eirion seems to be blaming himself for what happened nice kid so altogether what i keep coming back to is suppose id arrived one second earlier suppose id killed her in one of those oneinabillion freak family tragedies what would i have done with the rest of my life what would any of it be worth but you didnt someone didnt want to lose you and didnt want you forever damaged either merrily leaned back shook out a cigarette you ever thought of getting ordained sophie god forbid sophie stood up put that thing away and get your coat its janes coat what for janes coat then im going to drive you to this funeral you can perhaps sleep on the way if we leave now we might even stop for a sandwich sophie its saturday you cant you have things to do oh sophie said i think hereford united can manage without me for one week merrily blinked sophie unhooked a long sheepskin coat and a woollen scarf from the door it did rather look like the sort of outfit you would wear to a football match in january bizarre this is above and beyond soph merrily got unsteadily to her feet i should be grateful if you didnt smoke in my car sophie said abracadabra the main road from old hindwell to new radnor passed through the hamlet of llanfihangel nant melan the church of st michael was right next to the road and although it didnt actually look very old there were indications of a circle of ancient yew trees which suggested it had been rebuilt although there were a number of other cars nearby betty stopped the subaru she was in no mood to talk to mrs wilshire or anybody else right now she would check out the atmosphere of the church it might even calm her down she was still furious with robin if hed been accosted the other night by the drunken wife of greg starkey feeling him up in the street why hadnt he told betty when he arrived home old hindwell wasnt exactly known for its redlight quarter so why had he kept quiet why because theyd just had a goddamn row over his handling of nick ellis because hed slammed out of the house and didnt think shed be speaking to him anyway because he was cold and tired because so why hadnt he mentioned it the next day even because jeez was it important did she think he enjoyed it did she think hed snatched this chance to feel mariannes tits actually she didnt think that what she thought was that robin hated to tell her anything that might make her think less of old hindwell why dont you get to know the people here like judith prosser shes ok not what i imagined dickhead betty walked over to the church the stonework suggested extensive victorian renovation did anything remain of the church built as part of some alleged st michael circle how would this one feel inside sooner or later when robin was not around she would have to go back into the old hindwell ruins to face the question now looming large the stained and sweating fearridden man at prayer was that him was that the reverend terry penney was he dead now but this wasnt an exercise in psychic skills before she went back there she wanted to know all there was to be known about all the churches in the st michael circle however in llanfihangel church she was immediately accosted by a man in a light suit who asked her if she was on the bride or the grooms side so much for standing there in the silence and feeling for the essence of the place betty apologized and escaped with a handful of leaflets which she inspected back in the subaru and just couldnt believe it one apparently produced as a result of a community tourism initiative was blatantly entitled where sleeps the dragon on the trail of st michaels churches betty slumped back in her seat broke into a peal of wild stupid laughter a tourist leaflet was that how all this had started the text explained that there were four st michael churches around radnor forest at llanfihangel nant melan llanfihangel rhydithon cefnllys and cascob it presumably didnt mention old hindwell because it was a ruin now on private land an inside page was headed st michael and the dragon of radnor forest it referred to the introduction by jewish christians of angelology angels guarded nature and local communities st michael guarded israel and was named in the book of revelations etc etc most welsh churches dedicated to him had appeared in the tenth and eleventh centuries the specific radnor reference had been pulled from a book called a welsh country parson by d parryjones who recounted a legend that the last welsh dragon slept in radnor forest and to contain it local people had built four st michael churches in a circle around the forest it was said that if any of these churches was destroyed the dragon would awaken and ravage the countryside once more this was it this was the source of nicholas elliss paranoia crazy still it did look as though robin and ellis were right assuming there was no firebreathing elemental beast locked into the landscape this appeared to be a simple metaphor for paganism the old religion if any one of these churches is destroyed old hindwell had been virtually destroyed and initially by its rector which didnt make any obvious sense why would a clergyman make a gesture which was bound to be adversely interpreted by anyone superstitious enough to give any credence to the dragon legend unless penney had been a closet pagan was that likely not really something was missing for a moment betty smelled again the rich sickening stench from the praying man in the skeletal nave she drove off too quickly the subaru shuddering lizzie wilshire greeted her with a spindly embrace i dont know whether its your herbal mixture or just you my dear but i feel so much better holding out her right hand and making it into a claw the fingertips slowly but effectively closing on the palm gosh betty said i havent been able to do that for months those et eyes shining like polished marbles youre a wonder my dear i wouldnt quite say that psychological the potion couldnt possibly have had such a spontaneous and dramatic effect unless her problem was essentially or to an extent psychosomatic and yet betty caught an unexpected sidelong glimpse of lizzies aura it was without a doubt less fragmented and she was talking constantly garrulous rather than querulous now were you originally called elizabeth like me a long time ago betty admitted as they sat down a long time ago my dear you werent even born lizzie wilshire laughed hoarsely now were those papers useful if not just throw them away im in a clearingout mood clutter frightens me im even thinking of selling the summer house every time i look out at it i expect to see bryan walking across the garden do people buy summer houses secondhand like that can they take them away i should think so you could advertise it in the paper i could do that for you if you want oh would you thats terribly kind yes i told dr coll i hope you dont mind about the summer house about you of course about your wonderful herbal preparation he called in this morning even though its saturday such a caring caring man and said how much better i was looking and naturally i told him about you oh in bettys experience the very last thing a doctor liked to be told was that some cranky plant remedy had had an instantaneous effect on a condition against which powerful drugs had thus far failed to make a conspicuous impact he was delighted lizzie said he was far be it from him he said to dismiss the old remedies indeed hes often suggested i might benefit from attending one of the reverend elliss services but thats all too brash and noisy for me he must be a very unusual doctor simply a very caring man i didnt realize how pastoral country doctors could be until bryan died bryan had a thing about the medical profession refused to call a doctor unless in dire emergency hed have liked you oh yes his army training involved finding treatments in the hedgerows a great believer in natural medicine was bryan although one does need to have a fully qualified medical man in the background dont you think yes betty said i suppose so shall i make some tea she knew now where everything was kept she knew on which plate to arrange which biscuits on which tray to spread which cloth all of which greatly pleased mrs wilshire when it was done betty sat down with her and they smiled at one another youve brightened my life in such a short time betty youve been very helpful to me too i wont forget it you know i never forget a kindness oh look we never had children ive no close relatives left at my age with my ailments one doesnt know how long one has left come on thats daft im quite serious my dear i said to dr coll some time ago is there anything i can do to help you after my death is there anything you need new equipment an extension to the surgery of course he brushed that aside but i think when youve been treated so well by people by a community its your duty to put something back well in the end the most he would do was give me the name of a local charity he supports but oh dear ive embarrassed you im so sorry well change the subject tell me how youre getting on with that terrible old place have you been able to do anything with the damp these things take time betty said careful not to mention the need for money getting into the car she felt deeply uncomfortable it might be better if she didnt return to mrs wilshires for a while the old girl probably wasnt aware of trying to buy attention even if it was only with compliments about a very ordinary herbal preparation but oh why was everything so bloody complicated suddenly she leaned back in the seat rotating her head to dispel tension she noticed the dragon leaflet on the passenger seat where out of interest was the next church on the list cascob nestles in the hills near the head of the cas valley village appears in the domesday book as casope the mound overlooking the river cas promising she supposed and was about to throw the leaflet back on the seat when another word caught her eye it was exorcize a couple of miles into radnor forest betty became aware of an ominous thickening of cloud and under it a solitary signpost she must have passed this little sign twenty times previously and never registered it perhaps because it pointed up that narrow lonely lane a lane which didnt seem to lead anywhere other than cascob strange name perhaps some choppedoff mangled anglicization of a welsh phrase which meant obscurechurchattheendofthenarrowroadthatgoesonforever or so it seemed perhaps because this was the kind of road along which no stranger would dare travel at more than twenty mph it was deserted sullen and moody robin would be enchanted there wasnt much to cascob a bend in a sunken shaded lane a lone farmhouse and opposite it a few steep yards above the road the wooden gate to the church itself tied up with orange binder twine betty left the subaru in gear parked on the incline untied the twine around the gate sheep grazed the sloping circular churchyard among ancient haphazard gravestones and tombs that were crumbly round the edges like broken biscuits there was a wide view of a particularly lonely part of the forest and the atmosphere was so dense and heavy that betty couldnt for a while go any further some places it was instantaneous the old man in the cellar at grandmas place in sheffield that had probably been the first none of them had frightened her for quite a while not until shed learned from other kids that you were supposed to be afraid of ghosts until then shed been affected only by the particular emotions specific to each place where something similar happened fear hatred greed and the one emotion she hadnt at first understood lust she steadied her breathing cascob church squatted under low grey cloud it looked both cosy and creepy to what extent had the present sensations been preconditioned by what shed read in the leaflet to exorcize a young woman she walked on towards the church the stone and timbered building like many this old seemed to have grown out of the site organically there were oak beams in its porch and under the pyramidcap of the tower it snuggled against an earthmound which was clearly not natural possibly a bronze age tumulus from the base of the mound grew an apple tree spidery winter branches tangled against the cold light there was a gate across the porch more twine to untie betty stepped inside there were recent posters on the wall and a framed card invited all who entered to say a prayer before they left she would not be so crass as to offer a prayer to the goddess when she put out a hand to the oak door cascob church seemed to settle around her not unfriendly certainly ancient and comfortably mysterious and locked she wondered for a moment if this was a sign that she was not supposed to enter this place but then all churches were kept locked these days even perhaps especially in locations this remote she walked back across the churchyard and the narrow road to the farmhouse to enquire where she might borrow a key the bloke there was accommodating and presented her with a highly suitable one about six inches long it made her right hand tingle with impressions and she twice passed it quickly to her left hand and back again before reaching the porch the lock turned easily she went in and stood tensely with the door open behind her the church inside was dark and basic betty stood poised to banish anything invasive but there was nothing it was quiet so far removed from the foetid turmoil swirling in the old hindwell ruins that she banished that from her thoughts lest she somehow infest cascob the place was tiny and probably little changed since the fourteenth or fifteenth century a farmers church with a font for christenings but no room for gentry weddings there was a wooden table with literature on it including the sleeping dragon leaflet and a similar one about cascob church itself a collection box had betty fumbling for a fiver an offering to appease the god of the christians she stood for a moment behind one of the back pews not touching its dark wood her head hanging down so as not to face the simple altar it was not her altar it faced the wrong direction and shed turned away from all this eight years ago betty closed her eyes it had been her decision shed turned from the east to face the north a witchs altar was always to the north there was no turning back was there when she reopened her eyes she was facing the whitewashed north wall where a document hung in a thin black frame betty looked at it breathed in sharply the breathing came hard the air around her seemed to have clotted she stared at the symbols near the bottom of the frame and saw with an awful sense of deja vu she felt almost sick now with trepidation there was nothing coincidental about this at the top of the document under the funeral black of the frame was something even more explicit abracadabra abracadabr abracadab abracada abracad abraca abrac abra abr ab a betty spun away from the wall snatched up one of the leaflets about the church and ran outside under the zeppelin cloud she opened the leaflet to a penandink drawing of the church and a smaller sketch of the archangel michael with wings outstretched and a sword held above his head under the drawing of the church she read the abracadabra charm dated from the seventeenth century purported to have been used to exorcize a young woman heaven knows what she went through but it sheds an interesting light on the state of faith in radnorshire at the time betty stilled herself with a few minutes of chakra breathing then went back into the church and up to the document itself again leaving the door open for light what shed read was a transcript of the original charm produced it said in a tiny footnote by an expert from the british museum the original was at the bottom a scrap of paper with the ink faded to a light brown and now virtually indecipherable there were no details about exactly how or when it had been found in the church but there was no inglenook fireplace where a box might be placed hands clenched in the pockets of her ski jacket betty read the transcript the two charms might be a century or more apart but the similarities were obvious in the name of the father son and of the holy ghost amen x x x and in the name of the lord jesus christ i will delive elizabeth loyd from all witchcraft and from all evil spirites and from all evil men or women or wizardes or hardness of heart amen x x x it went on with a mixture of roman catholic latin pater noster ave maria and cabbalistic words of power like tetragrammaton the name of god at the bottom were two rows of planetary symbols the sun the moon and venus were obvious the one that looked like a was jupiter wizards spirits hardness of heart all too similar another solid link apart from st michael between the two churches there was more obsessive repetition i will trust in the lord jesus christ my redeemer and saviour from all evil spirites and from all other assaltes of the devil and that he will delive elizabeth loyd from all witchcraft and from all evil spirites by the same apower as he did cause the blind to see the lame to walke and that thou findest with unclean spirites to be in thire one mindes amen x x x as weeth jehovah amen the witches compassed her abought but in the name of the lord i will destroy them amen x x x x x x x it was signed by jah jah jah poor elizabeth loyd a young woman how old twenty seventeen was she really possessed by evil or was she schizophrenic or more likely simply epileptic heaven knows what she went through but it sheds an interesting light on the state of faith in radnorshire at the time had it been carried out here in the church if so betty wasnt picking up anything what kind of minister had mixed this bizarre and volatile cocktail of anglicanism roman catholicism paganism cabbalism and astrology or was it the local wise man the conjuror or were they one and the same betty was glad the charm lay behind glass that she wouldnt have to force herself to touch it where it had been held by the exorcist didnt even like to look too hard at the original manuscript was glad that the ink had faded to the colour of soft sand she walked back outside into the churchyard and was drawn back felt she had no choice to that spot amongst the graves where shed previously felt the weight of something she wondered what had happened if after the exorcism the epilepsy or whatever persisted there was something deeply distasteful about the whole business and there had probably been villagers at the turn of the eighteenth century who also found it disturbing but theyd have to keep quiet especially if the exorcism was performed by the minister she was gazing out towards the forest yellowed fields a wedge of conifers when the pain came it was so sudden and so violent that she sank to her knees in the long wet grass both hands at her groin there was an instant of shocking cold inside her and then it was over and she was crawling away sobbing to the shelter of a nearby gravestone she stayed there for several minutes her breathing rapid and her heart rate up she pushed her hair back out of her eyes and found that it was soaked with sweat when she was able to stand again she was terrified there might be physical damage she stumbled back to the church wall and trembling wrote a huge banishing pentagram clockwise on the air and then followed it with the sign of the cross blessed beneath the wings of angels been a while since he was here last but it might as well have been yesterday nothing changed see a new bungalow here a fancy conservatory there a few new faces that started out bright and shiny and open and gradually closed in grew cloudyeyed and worried like this boy in the pub londoner sounded like gomer had seen it before they came with their catering certificates and visions of taking over the village inn and turning it into a swish restaurant with fiddly little meals and vintage wine fifty quid a time year or so later it was back to the ole steak pie and oven chips and a pint of lager three diners a night if they was lucky at a fiver apiece gomer sucked the top off his pint of guinness ole hindwell he thought where city dreams comes to die not seen you around before the london boy said thats on account you ent been around yourself moren a week or two gomer told him two years actually two years in march the boy had dandruffy hair receding a bit greying a bit you could tell those two years had felt to him like half a lifetime hed be about forty years old time to start getting anxious bought the place off ronnie pugh is it thats right ar gomer nodded spying the creeping damp already blackening walls they must have rewhitewashed when they moved in tryin to get rid for six year or more ole ronnie so it appears the boy said regrets showing through like blisters as well they might never fashionable the forest no real old money see radnorshire always was a poor county six times as many sheep as people and you could count off the mansions on one hand not much new money neither the real rich folk film stars pop stars stockbrokers retired drug dealers and the like went to the cotswolds and the mediumrich bought theirselves some rambling black and white over in herefordshire while radnorshire no swish shops no public schools no general hospital no towns with much over people collected the pioneertypes trading in the semi in croydon or solihull for two scrubby acres a dozen sheep and a crumbly old farmhouse with rotting timbers loose slates and stonelice and the pensioners radnorshire got them too by the thousand couples like minnie and frank buying up the old farm cottages and the cheap bungalows and then one of them dies and the others stuck all alone in the middle of nowhere on account of radnorshire property prices dont rise much year to year and the poor buggers cant afford to move away not going up the funeral the boy said though the car park was full there was only himself and gomer in the black lion mourners for menna weal had parked up outside stopped in for one drink and trailed off to the village hall funny old setup doing church services at the village hall but that was radnorshire lose your church and you makes do gomer shook his head well i never knowed her that well see truth was with min only days in the ground he couldnt face it could he good to help the little vicar but he realized the vicar was only giving him something to do to take his mind off his own loss she wouldnt want him attending no funeral nor me the boy said mrs weal never came in here her husband comes in occasionally picks up his business in the pub what i yeard folks from off friendly local lawyer sort o thing gomer had heard this from a few people he didnt say much big weal played his cards close but he put himself about in all the right places the boy came over bashful he picked us up actually he was in here when we were looking over the place knew the agent wound up doing the conveyancing he laughed a bit uncomfortably blokes so big you dont feel you dare refuse know what i mean likely it was the same with poor mrs weal gomer said hed gathered a fair bit of background about menna from danny thomas the rockandroll farmer at kinnerton who it turned out was a distant cousin danny had fancied her himself at one time but merv thomas kept her out of the way of men selfish bastard old merv especially after his wife passed on he had to have another woman around doing the things women had been put on gods earth to do frail pale little person menna it seemed all right for washing and cleaning but too frail for farming definitely too frail for merv thomass farm sons was what merv had needed but never got so now the thomas farm had gone to folk from off the deal sorted by jw weal who then married the profits what a bloody waste danny thomas had said guitar on his knee in the barn crunching gomers eardrums with something called smoke on the water like i said he never brought her in here the boy leaned over his bar confidentially you never saw her round the village neither we used to wonder if she had agoraphobia or somefing but i never liked to ask ar wise attitude nobody liked a new landlord nosing into the affairs of local people her never had no friends yere then mrs prosser councillor prossers wife she used to go there once or twice a week apparently judy prosser this figured judy prosser was born and raised the other side of the quarry no more than half a mile from merv thomass farm shed have known the thomas girls likely barbara better than menna being nearer her age judy prosser would know the score smart girl that one not much got past her whereas most everything got past that dull bugger gareth well gomer had always got on well enough with judy in the days before gareth bought his own digger likely hed hang around here see if she came in the pub after the funeral my missus went across there once the boy continued to visit menna theyd be about the same age near enough and she reckoned maybe they could be friends but she got short shrift never got furthern the doorstep this is the ole rectory blooming great big place for just the two of them never seemed to have guests to stay or anyfing even in the summer never went on holidays either solicitor see gomer said gotter have isself a big house status in the community plus his ole man likely got a good deal on it when they ditched the church you drinking greg fanks very much the boy said ill have a half so you were from round here originally mr gomer parry plant hire gomer said radnor valley born an bred used to run a bunch o diggers and bulldozers we done drainage soakaways put roads in all over the valley my nephew nev he does it now see oh yeah i know he was filling in after the archaeological digs yeah used to come in for a sandwich and a pint at lunchtime sure tbe they were digging all over the place we all got excited when it came out theyd found an old temple we fought it was gonna be like stonehenge and wed get thousands of tourists but all it was it was just a few holes in the ground where thered been like wooden posts what rotted away centuries ago noffing to see apart from all the stone axeheads and stuff they dug up terrible disappointment ar typical radnorshire tourist attraction that is gomer took out his tin to roll a ciggie sounds good till you sees it crossing the welsh border you came unexpectedly out of darkness into light merrily thought raising herself up in the passenger seat of sophies saab the last english town kington with its narrow streets and dark surrounding hills had been more like a welsh country town the hills beyond were densely conifered until the trees thinned to reveal a rotting cathedral of fissured rocks and then suddenly the radnor valley opened up and the whole landscape was washed clean under a sandy sky and merrily sank back again just wanting to go on being driven through the winter countryside not having to make any decisions not having to answer difficult questions with a boommic hanging over her like a club sophie took a left and the car began to burrow under high banks and high naked hedges as the lanes narrowed old hindwell began to be signposted but by now they might just as well have followed any vehicle on that road every car and land rover seemed to contain people dressed in black one forgets sophie mused that rural funerals are such social events the lanes seemed to have brought them in a loop back into conifer country the official old hindwell sign was small and muddied just beyond it set back into a clearing sat a wellbuilt stone victorian house with a small conical turret at one end in most of its windows curtains were drawn the others probably didnt have curtains the old rectory do you think sophie said weals house you could be right theres obviously nobody about if it is the rectory we ought to be able to see the old church nearby she peered among the trees an uneasy mixture of leafless twisted oaks and dark thrusting firs i suppose it must have occurred to you sophie said that the old church here might have been the one referred to by that woman on your tv programme the pagan church mmm the road took them through a farm layout windowless buildings on either side but lets not worry about that until someone asks us to the first greybrown cottages appeared up ahead and the cars the village was clogged with cars the pub car park was full as was the yard in front of what had once been a school cars and land rovers also lined the two principal lanes blocking driveways and entrances until the roads became so narrow that another parked vehicle would have made them impassable could it possibly be like this every sunday sophie slowed for a drab posse of mourners they crossed the road and filed into a tarmac track between two big leylandii the village hall merrily said unnecessarily it stood on what she judged to be the western edge of the village partly concealed a little way up a conifered hillside and was accessed by a footpath and steps sophie wondered aloud how they got any wheelchairs up there for all the disabled people who thought nicholas elliss prayers might cure them so its true then merrily said he does healing too i copied cuttings from the local papers onto your computer file sophie reversed into a field entrance to turn round again in the hope of finding a space i dont suppose you had time to read them yet i dont know how many people hes actually supposed to have healed you dont usually get statistics on it sophie frowned that sort of thing is just not anglican somehow no what about the shrine of st thomas in the cathedral not the same thing what because ellis spent some time in the states my information is that he learned his trade with the more extreme kind of bible belt evangelist sophie shuddered would you like to borrow my coat it may not be exactly funereal but its at least respectable im sorry sophie said i didnt mean of course you didnt when merrily smiled her face felt so stiff with fatigue that it hurt if anyone does notice me i could pretend to be a poor singleparent whom mr weal defended on a shoplifting charge when the strangers came in gomer was getting the local take on the planting of menna weal in the rectory garden most people couldnt equate it wiv him being a lawyer and into property greg said whos gonna wanna buy a house wiv a bleedin great tomb they say hell leave it to his nephew whos started in the firm but would you wanna live in a house wiv your dead auntie in the garden gomer wondered how hed feel if his min was buried in the back garden and decided it wouldnt be right for either of them in the churchyard she wasnt alone see not meaning the dead it was the coming and going of the living but what i reckon greg said that buildings right down the bottom of the garden ok you could lop it off make it separate a little park with a footpath to it the weal memorial garden i reckon thats what hes got in mind nobody ask him blimey you dont ask him nothing not even the time youd get a bleedin bill its like theres a wall around him wiv an admission charge and no first names its mr weal or jw if youre a friend he got many friends he knows a lot of people thats the main fing in his profession greg turned to his two new customers yes gents they wore suits but not funeral suits both youngish fellows in their thirties one was a bit paunchy with a halfgrown beard he ordered two pints not here for the funeral greg said ah thats what it is the plump bearded one paid for their drinks must be somebody important all those cars oh thats not unusual theres a mass of cars every sunday popular man our minister you get people coming from fifty miles away gomer looked up gobsmacked most of these folks were not here for menna at all but part of some travelling fan club for the rector bloody hell hang on the plump feller with the beard said are there two churches then kind of greg said our minister uses the village hall for his services but the old one the old church thats disused right long time ago its a ruin can you still get to it you probably can greg said but its on private land its privately owned now only my mate wanted to take some pictures with permission of course we dont want to go sneaking about who would we ask who owns it well its new people actually only been moved in a week or so theres a farmhouse st michaels if you go back along the lane past the post office and on out of the village youll see a big farm both sides of the road then theres a track off to your left if you go over a little bridge and you get to the old rectory on your right youve gone too far they all right the people sure greg said young couple hes american an artist book illustrator yeah theyre fine whats the name gomer was suspicious by now gomer was always suspicious of fellers in suits asking questions not greg though suspicious landlords didnt sell many drinks oh blimey let me think goodfellow goodbody somefing like that the paunchy bloke nodded thanks mate well go and knock on their door you can take a picture of my pub if you like greg said what is it magazine holiday guide the two men looked at each other swapping grins something like that said the one who did the talking the village hall was like one of those roadside garages built in the s with a greywhite facade and a stepped roof from its summit projected a perspex cross which would obviously light up at night conifers crowded in on the building so you had the feeling of a missionary chapel in the jungle it was coming up to pm the sky turning brown the air raw as sophie drove away merrily felt unexpectedly apprehensive from inside as she walked up the steps came the sound of a hymn she didnt recognize below her old hindwell was laid out in a vshape beyond one arm arose the partly afforested hump which sophie had told her was topped by the iron age hill fort burfa camp the northern horizon was broken by the shaven hills of radnor forest the small falling sun picked up the arc of a thin river around the boundary like an eroded copper bangle across the village divided from it by a fuzz of bare trees she could see the tower of the old church she wondered if nicholas ellis would have made old hindwell his main base if that church had still been in use arguably not since using the community hall was a good demonstration of his personal creed the church was people ancient churches were museums the hymn she didnt know sung unaccompanied by organ or piano came to an end and then there was the sound of a communal subsidence into rickety chairs merrily pushed open the double doors and went in into darkness into a theatre with the house lights down but the stage she stifled a gasp was lit as though for a nativity play just not anglican somehow gently she pulled the doors together behind her and stood under a cracked green exit sign there was a row of shadowed heads and shoulders no more than four feet in front of her the chairs were arranged like theatreintheround under the girdered ceiling the industrial window blinds were all lowered it was alarmingly like the livenight studio and the audience must have been at least as big maybe two hundred people some on wooden benches pushed back to the walls spotlights in the ceiling lit the stage where stood a man in a white monkish robe head bowed eyes cast down to hands loosely clasped on his stomach merrilys first disappointing glimpse of the reverend nicholas ellis was a definite sowhat moment is a particularly poignant occasion for me she heard its only weeks since menna came to me with her loving husband to be baptized again to pledge herself to the lord jesus in the presence of the holy spirit i wonder if somehow she knew his face was bland and shining his mouth wide like a letter box his light brown hair was brushed straight back a modest ponytail disappearing into the folds of his monks cowl monastic gear was less unorthodox than it used to be for church of england ministers but in dazzling white this was hardly a sign of humility too messianic for merrily his words rang coldly in the factory acoustic i conducted the solemn but joyful service of rebaptism at their home and on that day the very air was alive with hope and rejoicing and these two souls were blessed beneath the wings of angels from the shadows someone a man cried out involuntarily it seemed like a hiccup praise god as though the heavenly host had suddenly burst through the ceiling nicholas ellis was silent for a moment merrily couldnt make out his expression because the spotlights in the ceiling were aimed not at him but at the uncovered coffin lidless in the american style menna weal lay in an open casket wrapped in her shroud her face looked like marble under the lights a curtain of shadows surrounded her merrily didnt like this found it eerie she looked for barbara buckingham in the congregation but in this light it was hopeless how could barbara wherever she was stand this performance how could any of them eerie what a funeral should never be nicholas ellis said and it is to that same loving home that in a short time mennas body will return the final laying to rest of these earthly remains will be a small private ceremony which in the context of that loving relationship is as it should be merrily saw the seated figure of jw weal hunched like a big rock gazing steadily at the body of his wife her thoughts were carried back to the county hospital that first sight of him with his bowl of water and his cloth an act of worship let us thank god for love ellis said when the black dragon wings of evil beat above our heads and the night air carries the stench of satan merrily wrinkled her nose let us remember that only the strong light of love can bring us through the long hours of darkness now let us all rise and with menna and jeffery together in our hearts sing number two on our hymn sheet take me lord to your golden palace the lights blinked on so that they could all read the words everyone rose with a mass scraping of metal chair legs that was almost a shriek and merrily saw at the front one broad head thrust above all the others jw looking down on the remains of his wife a statement of ownership barbara had said possession is nine points of the law merrily found herself outside in the cold again feeling slightly shocked she stopped about halfway down the steps with her back to a scots pine tree the sand colour in the sky had all but disappeared washed under the rapid grey estuary of dusk below her old hindwell settled into its umbered shadows merrily stood watching for the lights of sophies saab listening for its engine just not anglican somehow you could say that again she sank her hands far into her coat pockets it had been a singalong gospelly countryandwestern hymn it was cloying trite no worse but certainly no better than the stilted victorian hymns which merrily had been trying for months to squeeze out of her services shed had no hymn sheet but the dipping of the house lights told her when the last verse had finished then words that were not on the hymn sheet took over when in the darkness the tune and the rhythm disappeared but the singing itself did not stop merrily stood silent not having been exposed for quite some years to this phenomenon the language of the angels according to some evangelists nonsense words bubbling and flowing and ululating between slackened jaws tongues the gift of the sign that the holy spirit was here in old hindwell village hall right now she was in no position to dispute this it wasnt the hymn or its ghostly coda which had brought her out here nor the sight of the silent sombre jeffery weal his gaze still fixed on his wife while the congregation summoned angels to waft her spirit into paradise it was just that during the hymn while the lights were on shed had an opportunity to investigate the congregation row by row and barbara buckingham was definitely not there and while that meant she hadnt had to listen to elliss gothic nonsense and stand in fuming silence while all around her sang themselves into a religious stupor it did raise a possible problem barbara was a determined woman she had a serious grudge against this area arising from a deprived childhood which had become narrowed and focused into a hatred of the lumbering sullen slowmoving singleminded jeffery weal suppose she was already at weals house outside somewhere waiting for the mourners at the small private ceremony that would follow merrily hurried down the rest of the steps after what shed seen in there she too wanted very much to know how this was going to end lord madoc robin its al but this was not al al was so cheerful that if he called you too early in the morning it hurt and this was not early morning it was late afternoon and betty had gone to see the goddamn widow wilshire again and the voice on the phone was like the voice of a relative calling to say someone close to you was dead as art director handling talisman the fantasy imprint of the multinational publisher harveycalder al delaney did not know any of robins relatives he kept his dealings strictly to artists and writers and editors so robin was already feeling sick to his gut hi he said hows it going with the light failing fast he stood by the window in his studio or at least the northfacing room that was to go on serving as his studio until theyd gotten enough money together to convert one of their outbuildings the room had two trestle tables one carrying his paints and his four airbrush motors only two of which now worked airbrushes seemed to react badly to robin must be all that awesome psychic energy haw im calling you from home al said that would be because its saturday and the offices are closed right and because ive just heard from er kirk blackmore uhhuh robin moistened his lips and id rather say what i want to say from home like that blackmores an insufferable egomaniac whod stand there and tell botticelli he couldnt draw arses and that there are a few of us whod like to use the sword of twilight to publicly disembowel him but tragically tragically he is also the hottest fantasy writer in britain so it would be unwise to say that to his face yeah yeah ok al just listen for one minute since i got blackmores fax ive been giving it a whole lot of thought and ive come up with something which i think hes gonna like a whole lot more i accept that the purple mist was too lurid the lettering too loud so what i propose for starters robin he now doesnt want you to do it at all on the second table the work table lay robins preliminary watercolour drawings for the proposed new kirk blackmore format the one which would run down the backlist like gold thread the one in fact which would launch the fund which would finance the restoration of the outbuildings providing betty with her own herbal haven and robin in a year or two with the most wonderful inspiring sacred studio he just he just said he didnt like the painting robin said his whole body seemed very light he said he he said there were elements of the painting he didnt like was all al said he wants someone else to do it robin who robin couldnt feel his hands it doesnt matter who nobody in particular but not you mate im sorry i was so convinced you were the man for this i wouldve i had to tell you today i didnt want you spending all weekend working out something that wasnt even going to get and the backlist the backlist what im saying this isnt just the one cover he doesnt like it is the one cover he doesnt like obviously and youll get paid in full for that no problem at all but its also how many ways can i put this he wants he wants another artist he doesnt want you robin held up the core design which blackmore should have loved took a last look into the eyes of lord madoc who in times of need would stand in his megalithic circle and summon the celtic ray robins madoc who would not now be blackmores madoc a lean noble beardless face its hairstyle or glorious neglect of style shamelessly modelled on bettys own delicious profusion sympathetic magic madocs hair was full of electricity and pulsed in the mist around him madoc the hack fantasy hero had been permitted to reflect the bright essence of bettys holy power how could frigging blackmore have failed to respond to that and what were they gonna live on now maybe not love he recalled bettys face before she had gone out the light gone from her eyes the shine from her skin and her hair all brushed shed brushed her hair flat she also wore a skirt he didnt even remember her owning a dark midlength skirt a very ordinary skirt this was the true horror of it when she left the house she was looking like an ordinary person and it was his fault ever since they got here everything he did was wrong and everything he didnt do or say jeez hed never even thought much about what had happened with marianne outside the pub that whole sequence was like a dream the glowing cross in the sky the big weird guy looking over his shoulder at no one right behind him robin had gone home and hed slept and tomorrow had been another lousy day he felt cold to his gut lately betty had lain with her back to him in bed feigning sleep a psychic wall between them very tired she would say with the move and all fuck robin tore the madoc drawings end to end and let the strips fall to the floorboards fuck oh fuck oh fuck trying to picture blackmore as he was ripping them but hed never seen the guy the face that came to him was the smug unlined holy face of the reverend nicholas ellis ellis had done this ellis who had made robin his devil focused his smug holy christian hatred on the ruins of st michaels the lair of the dragon ellis had brought down bad luck on them and they were innocent he broke down and wept in frustration and despair his head among the scattered paint tubes robin thorogood illustrator seducer of souls guardian of the softly lit doorways what a fucking joke by seed by root by bud and stem by leaf and flower and fruit by life and love in the name of the goddess i robin take thee betty to my hand my heart and my spirit at the setting of the sun and rising of the stars a handfasting none of this tilldeathdouspart shit in the fullness of time we shall be born again at the same time and in the same place as each other and we shall meet and know and remember and love again it made you cry every time you thought of that it made you cry how much of the prosaic christian marriage ceremony could do that to you robin cried some more he saw her in her wedding dress he saw her slipping out of the dress when they were left alone for the consummation the great rite how could it be that their souls were sailing away from each other how could this happen in the sacred place which it had been prophesied it had been fucking prophesied was their destiny robin rose from the table he figured what he would do now was take a walk down to the barn and from the barn he would retrieve the box containing the charm which promised to protect this house and all the chickens and pigs and local people therein from the menace of the old religion and he robin thorogood guardian of the softly lit doorways would take this box and carry it to the edge of the promontory on which the christians had built their church and with due ceremony and acknowledgement to the reverend penney hurl the motherfucker into the hungry torrent of the hindwell brook robin wiped his eyes with a paint cloth he thought he heard a knocking at the front door local people it was probably only local people like the deeply local person who wrote the anonymous letter to his wife shafting him good well these local people could just remove themselves from off of his and the building societys property robins fists bunched they could very kindly evacuate their asses from said property right now the guy said mr thorogood not a local person even robin was getting so he could separate out british accents and this was kind of london middle class two of them and one carried a biggish metaledged case when robin saw the case he thought sourly whaddaya know its another local person bringing us another box with another charm to guard us against ourselves and thus turn our idyllic lives into liquid shit mr thorogood my names richard prentice this is stuart joyce robin flicked on the porch light overweight guy with a beard and a thinner younger guy in a leather jacket doubleglazing robin figured or travelling reps from some company that would maximize your prospects by investing the contents of your bank account in a chain of international vivisection laboratories we both work for the daily mail newspaper prentice said if its convenient id like a chat with you about your religion about my robin glanced at the case of course a camera case i understand you and your wife are practising witches robin went still how would you have come to understand that relax no camera around the thin guys neck prentice smiled you didnt happen to watch a tv programme called livenight by any chance we dont have a tv oh the man smiled that would certainly explain it well mr thorogood you and your wife were referred to on that programme what not by name but your situation was mentioned now it sounds as though were the first media people to approach you and thats a good thing for both of us because hold on a moment robin said if as you say we are witches which in these enlightened times im hardly gonna deny why are you interested there are thousands of us its like the fastest growing religion in the country right now what im saying is what kind of big deal is that for a paper like yours well ill be straight with you robin its primarily the church how many witches have actually taken over a christian church for their rituals well richard robin said if i can reverse that question how many christian churches have taken over pagan sites for their rituals richard prentice grinned through his beard that my friend is an excellent point and wed like to give you the opportunity to amplify it i dont think so richard could we come in and talk about it its perishing out here i really dont think so for starters my wife look prentice said you were more or less outed if i can use that term on a tv programme watched by millions of viewers id guess youre going to be hearing from a lot of other journalists over the next few days and i mean tabloid journalists isnt that what you are we like to call ours a compact paper theres a difference dont make me laugh richard robin look what we have in mind and this would be for mondays paper so wed have a whole day to get it absolutely right is a serious feature explaining exactly what your plans are for this church and why you believe youre no threat to the community somebody say were a threat to the community here you know what local people are like robin out robin said im sorry go richard robin i think youll find that we can protect you from the unwanted intrusion of less responsible leave now or ill like turn you into a fucking toad thats not a very sensible attitude look this was probably a bad time i can tell somethings happened to upset you were going to be staying in the area tonight i suggest we come back in the morning all right robin stepped out of the porch through the trees he could hear the racing of the hindwell brook ok prentice said thats your decision and if theyd gone at that moment things might all have been so much less fraught unfortunately at this point the porch and robin were lit up brightly and robin realized the younger guy suddenly had a camera out the rushing of the brook filled his head cold white noise robin thought of silent betty with her back to him in the sack he thought he heard somewhere on the ether the rich sound of kirk blackmore laughing at his artwork robin made like lord freaking madoc wisp merrily could see the battlemented outline of old hindwell church tower over the bristle of trees and the spiteful voice cawed in her head i can show you a church with a tower and graves and everything which is now a pagan church you dont know whats happening on your own doorstep if these pagans had been around for a while it would explain why ellis had adopted old hindwell extremes attract extremes the only other abandoned anglican church she could think of in the diocese was at llanwarne down towards rossonwye and that was close to the centre of a village and open to the road a tourist attraction but whether this was or wasnt the alleged neopagan temple was not the issue right now what she needed to make for was the former rectory which was not ruined far from abandoned but about to accommodate its first grave she would probably encounter sophies car along the way and barbara buckingham that grumbling foreboding in her stomach that was subjective right merrily walked faster aware that the only sound on the street was the soft padding of her own flat shoes she walked into the centre of the village where there was a small shop and post office closed already and the pub had frosted windows and looked inviting only compared with everywhere else in one of the cottages a dog howled suddenly a spiralling sound maybe it had picked up a distant discordant wailing emanating from the village hall something which was not perhaps quite human the pub car park was still full with the cars of course of outsiders the singing in tongues should have given it away many people in todays congregation were not in fact family mourners or friends or longtime clients of jw weal but core members of nicholas elliss church and the tongues was not a spontaneous phenomenon for them it had become routine a habit almost an addiction a christian trip shed learned that while at theological college when a bunch of students well into the bornagain thing had persuaded her to join them at a weekend event known as the big bible fest held in a huge marquee near warwick two long days of everybody smiling at everybody else and doing the praise him routine like kids with a new schoolyard catchphrase and by the end of the first day merrily had been ready to swing for the next person who addressed her as sister it had been jeremy one of the faithful whod told her that the cynical bitch persona was simply concealing her fear of complete surrender to the holy spirit he was challenging her to go along that night with an open mind without prejudice without resistance praise him so ok shed attended a service where all the hymns had been simple rhythmic pop anthems sung by happy people in hawaiian shirts and sweatpants and all ending in tongues tongues was the gift of christ originally granted to a select few the bible did not spell out what tongues actually sounded like its linguistic roots its grammatical structure but modern evangelical christians insisted it was a way of talking directly to god who himself did not necessarily speak english not entirely convincing but for the first two hymns shed held out after all hadnt her own formative mystical moment occurred in total silence lit by the blue and the gold alone in a little hermits cave of a church and then praise him praise god her mouth had been open like everyone elses and out it all came like those flimsy coloured scarves produced by conjurers words which were flowing and lyrical and meant nothing but sounded as if they ought to lush liquid worship dynamic wordless prayer a disconnecting of the senses a transcendent experience up there around the marquees striped roof she could in fact still bring it on when she wanted to could summon that wild christian high simple as popping a pill as though just doing it that once had been a lifetimes initiation it was easy maybe too easy she wondered to what extent the locals had joined in were slowspeaking farmers now singing in tongues did they say praise god when they met by the sheep pens on market day instead of the timehonoured owre you you couldnt rule that out after all it was in wales that traditional church worship had been massively abandoned in the rush to build stark spartan noncomformist chapels so how far down the charismatic road did old hindwell go was it like the toronto blessing with people collapsing everywhere were they discovering galilean sand in the palms of their hands and gold fillings in their teeth but how appropriate was this at a funeral merrily scanned the cars by the pub was one of them barbaras what make had barbara been driving merrily didnt know she turned and walked on down the darkening street a headache coming on although it was dulled by the cold beyond the village shop and a lone bungalow with a sstyle rainbowstone porch the grass verge came to an end so merrily walked in the road down into a conifered valley which would eventually open out to the hill country of radnor forest soon afterwards she heard the low mutter of approaching vehicles and then dipped headlights began to cast a pale light on the road and she pressed close to the hedge as the cortege came past as the mourners had started coming for their cars gomer had moved to the pub window to look out for gareth and judy prosser chances were the prossers would be on foot but theyd still have to come this way most of the people picking up their vehicles gomer didnt recognize there a funeral tea up the hall he asked greg if there is we werent asked to provide it nah they say father ellis dont go for eating and drinking in church its a bloody village hall not when hes there it aint gomer looked over his shoulder at greg polishing glasses for the customers that didnt come in youre not a churchgoer then boy never was but the bloody pressures on now the anxious look flitted across gregs face again lot of peopleve started going he dont look much ellis but they reckon you come out feeling on cloud nine i mean whatever it is im not sure i wanna catch it the wifes gone to this funeral and i let em use the car park all his fans from miles around not that many of em drop in for a pint or anyfing afterwards dont need drink when youre high on god you got a few yere now boy gomer observed stand by your pumps two men and three women came in all in black one of the men was tony probert farmer from evenjobb gomer knew him to speak to just about and one of the women was gomer parry greta gomer said owre you greta thomas wife of danny the rockandroll farmer from kinnerton she was little and busty with a voice nash rocks couldve used for blasting used to be receptionist for dr coll i hope youre lookin after yourself gomer greta yelled not goin back to the wild never one to make a meal of the ole condolences once the funeral was over greta believed it was time to start cheering you up im doing fine gret cause if min thought you was on the bevvy moderation in all things you know me girl i dunno i seen bloody danny earlier he never said you was goin to see menna off never remembers nothing cept his bloody chords tony and julie was coming so i had a lift greta pulled gomer towards a table reckoned somebody ought to represent dannys side of the family nothin to do with wantin to see the famous reverend ellis in action without goin to a reglar service like greta looked sheepish no harm in that is there worth it was it well strange it is actually gomer ar specially the funny singing like a trance beautiful really when it gets going the voices are like harmonizing natural the men and the women really gets you its quite i dont know sexy thats a stupid thing to say ennit better get you a drink gret he went to greg at the bar bought greta a brandy he might learn something here and it beat going home to an empty bungalow with no fire no tea nothing but crap saturday night telly and then a cold bed greta looked up at him from under a fringe of hair dyed the colour of hereford clay i didnt mean that how it sounded gomer i mean ive never been that religious but it makes you think a lot of peoples saying that dr coll even dr coll reckons mr ellis is the best thing ever happened to this area why do he reckon that clergy in gomers experience came and went and never got noticed much unless they started messing with peoples wives or they were little and pretty the way its bringing the community together greta said youd never get that with an ordinary parson and an ordinary church when did you ever see local people and folk from off hugging each other ent natural gomer conceded and they also reckons you can get a private consultation what for anything really sickness emotional problems whats he do for that fetches them out of you gomer lays his hands on you fetches it all out bloody hell gret theres folk swears by it bloody hell he leaned back and thought for a bit doctors receptionist for what ten years herd have been no more than a young girl when her first went to work for dr colls old feller still how well did you actually know menna thomas gret doctors receptionists it was easier for them to talk about the dead than the living and greta thomas was still talking when tony probert and his wife and the other couple had finished up their drinks and looked a bit restive so gomer told them it was ok hed take greta home himself on the way he said and how well did you know her sister barbara which was how he found out the truth about the hydatid cyst behind the hearse came an oldfashioned taxi like a london black cab merrily saw brake lights come on about a hundred yards down the lane and she moved quietly towards them stone posts stood stark against the last of the light and she heard the grating of metal gates silhouettes now someone in a long overcoat pushing a bier merrily watched the coffin sliding onto it under the raised tailgate of the hearse saw the bier pushed through the gates it was followed by several people fused into one moving shadow against the band of light below the grey roller blind of evening she could see the roof of the old rectory no lights on there the taxi started up rolled away down the lane no sign of another car no sign of barbara buckingham suppose barbara had accosted weal made a nuisance of herself and weal as a solicitor able to expedite these things had responded with some kind of injunction to restrain her in which case why hadnt barbara told merrily why hadnt she left a message at the gates peering down an alley of laurels merrily was pulled sharply back by the realization that this whole situation was entirely ridiculous only jane would do something like this but then more headlights were glaring around the bend behind her and she slipped inside the gates to avoid them the vehicle went past on full beams not sophies saab but a fat fourwheel drive with two men in it leaving merrily standing on the property of jw weal as somewhere beyond the laurels a single warm light was anointing the bruised dusk with an amber balm she followed the laurel alley towards the house now only half expecting the dramatic eleventhhour appearance of barbara buckingham like the dissenting wedding guest with just cause for stopping the service by the house the drive split into a fork one prong ending at a concrete double garage the other dropping down a step and narrowing into a path its tarmac surface fragmenting into crazy paving to cross the lawn which was wedgeshaped and bordered by spruce and scots pine at the narrow end of this wedge stood a conical building the source of the light the wine store the ice house mennas waiting tomb merrily stood by the last of the laurels on the edge of the lawn and looked up at the victorian house substantial grey and gabled three storeys high the light from the open door of the tomb maybe forty yards away was bright enough to outline the regular stone blocks in the back wall of the house she could see the shadows of heavy lumpen furniture in the room immediately behind a bay window on the ground floor this house was very jw weal at its end of the lawn the mausoleum was a squat palladian temple victorian kitsch its interior was creamed with electric light from two wroughtiron hanging lanterns then the light was suddenly blocked and diffused two men looming merrily backed up against the house wall laurel leaves wet on her face mind the step george he could use a light knows his way down yere in his sleep i reckon the undertakers maybe must be the departure of the last outsiders feeling very much on her own now merrily moved down the lawn stopping about fifteen yards from the door of the mausoleum from an oblique angle she could see inside to where mourners were grouped around a stone trough set into the middle of the floor she saw ellis in his white robe she saw a wiry bearded man a squat bulky man and a woman they were still as a painted tableau faces lit with a rembrandt glow and she thought aghast this is intrusion this is voyeurism this is none of my business this was about a man not an affable man not an immediately likeable man but a man who had loved his wife who had treated her with great tenderness till the last seconds of her life who had whatever you thought of rebaptism rebirth in the faith come with her to christ who could not bear to be entirely parted from her who had chosen to gaze out every morning from their bedroom window probably for the rest of his life across to where she lay thats it im going she turned abruptly away and walked into the man himself her face was suddenly buried in the cold crisp shirtfront in the v of his waistcoat it smelled of camphor for a moment she was frozen with shock let out a small oh before his big arms came around her lifting her off her feet for a flowing second she was spun in space through the path of light from the tomb and then put down in shadow and held menna he breathed the great body rigid compressing her camphor carbolic she was gripped for a toolong moment like a captured bird and then the arms sprang apart im sorry she whispered he was silent neither of them moved a small night breeze had arisen was rippling the laurels and sighing in the conifers the firs and pines were like sentries with spears jw weal was just another shadow now she didnt feel that he was looking at her the line of light shivered and merrily saw figures standing in the doorway of the mausoleum nobody spoke nobody called to her it was dreamlike slowmotion she turned and walked away trying not to run across the lawn in and out of the path of light her arms pressed into her sides as though his arms were still around her the strong light from the mausoleum haloed the old rectory illuminating the inside of the baywindowed room on the ground floor and then as she was looking up at that same window it became dark all round the door of the mausoleum had been closed theyd been waiting for jeffery weal to return from the house and now theyd shut themselves away for the finale leaving darkness outside the lawn was black the track of light from the tomb having vanished merrily felt small and bewildered and ashamed like a child who should be in bed but had peered through the bannisters into an unknown unknowable grownup world menna what was he thinking then she searched for the entrance to the drive without light she would need to go carefully yet there was light a dull diffused haze behind the bay window where the backs of chairs threw rearing shadows up the interior walls she now hated that room she knew it was very cold in there colder than it was out here she didnt want to be looking in she didnt want to see the pale figure flitting across the wide windows from pane to pane the slight mothlike thing the wisp of despair she didnt want to see it she couldnt see it but as the room came out to her enclosing her in its pocket of cold she could almost hear the flimsy flightless jittering thing beating itself against the glass in its frenzy with a noise like tiny crackling bones merrily flailed and stumbled into the laurels slipped on numbed legs and grabbed handfuls of leaves to keep from falling only these werent the laurels they had thorns wintervicious still she clutched them in both hands almost relishing the entirely physical pain then she scrambled up and onto the drive hobbling away towards the gateposts part three the vast majority of charismatic churches are aware of the dangers of confusing demonic attack with psychological problems there are however some charismatic groups which are inclined to carry out a ministry of deliverance which concerns most other charismatic churches and which leads to casualties deliverance ed michael perry the christian deliverance study group tango with satan since coming home to her apartment at the vicarage jane had well just slept actually longer probably than shed ever slept before she woke up briefly thought of something crucially important went back to sleep forgot about it just like that for most of a day it was the hospitals fault hospitals were like totally knackering unless you were drugged to the eyeballs you never slept in a hospital be more relaxing bedding down on a factory floor during the night shift naturally jane had tried telling them this but no theyd insisted on keeping her in in case her skull was fractured or something worse which she knew it wasnt and they knew really but it was like yawn yawn procedure to forestall people suing the health service for half a million on account of her having gone into a coma on the bus sleep was all you really needed real sleep home sleep sleep was crucial because it gave the body and the brain time to repair themselves and because it was a natural thing and also in this particular case because it postponed that inevitable long talk with mum the long talk had not taken place as expected in the car coming home from worcester royal infirmary last night because it was sophies car and sophie was driving it and sophie to janes slight resentment seemed more concerned about mum who had herself at one point fallen asleep in the passenger seat and awoken with a start like a really seismic start which made sophie judderingly slam on the brakes going down fromes hill mum had shaken herself fully awake and said in that flustered halfembarrassed way of hers when lying that something must have walked over her grave and like trod on her hands why were both her hands clumsily crisscrossed with broad strips of elastoplast like she was the motorway pileup casualty fell among thorns was all mum would say when they finally got home must have been around ten bewilderingly shed hugged jane for a long time before theyd staggered off to their respective bedrooms without mention of the impending long talk odd jane slept through most of sunday morning venturing dowstairs just once for a bite to eat from the fridge lump of cheese handful of digestive biscuits while mum was out doing the weekly pulpit gig then leaving her plates conspicuously on the draining board so that mum would know shed eaten and wouldnt come up to ask about lunch and initiate the long talk she vaguely remembered awakening to see mum standing by the bed in her clerical gear like a ghost but she must have fallen asleep again before either of them could speak she kept half waking to hear the ting of the phone a lot of calls a lot of calls was this about the accident or livenight mum apologizing to half the clergy for screwing up on tv for sunday lunch alone with ethel the cat merrily had just a boiled egg and a slice of toast which was just as well because before two pm the bishop was on the phone enquiring after jane and revealing himself to be a worried man the daily mail had phoned him at home did he know that a former church in his diocese had become a temple for the worship of pagan gods well of course he did hed seen the damned tv programme like everyone else but he was hoping that either nothing more would be heard of it or it would turn out to be safely over the border in the diocese of swansea and brecon not that hed told the mail that hed told the mail he was concerned and would be making enquiries and this was one of them as it happens merrily said i was in old hindwell yesterday bernie dunmore went quiet for a couple of seconds thats an extraordinary coincidence he said it is but nothing more than that did you see the church only the tower above the trees i didnt see any naked figures dancing around a fire didnt hear any chanting is it really true who are they witches apparently people called thorogood ironically enough young couple came from shrewsbury i think but hes american in parts of america witchcraft is awfully respectable these days merrily this is radnorshire er quite as for the church well strictly speaking it isnt a church at all any more did all the right things when they let it go took away the churchyard bones to a place of suitable sanctity virtually gave it to the farming family whose land had surrounded it for generations stipulating naturally that relatives of people whose names were on the graves should be able to visit and lay flowers by arrangement why did they let it go its not as though the village has an alternative church usual reasons economics coupled with a very convenient period of public apathy you could dump half the parish churches in britain on that basis also this isnt a building of any great architectural merit bernie said old certainly but the only history it seems to have is one of more or less continuous major repairs and renewals dating back to the fifteenth century or earlier the dear old place never seems to have wanted to stay up if you get my meaning close to a river or something so perhaps built on ground prone to subsidence things apparently came to a head when the rector at the time actually suggested it should be decommissioned really anyway all thats irrelevant the unfortunate fact is if its got a tower or a steeple and a handful of gravestones the general public will still see it as holy ground and therell be protests but theres nothing you can do about that is there you cant actually vet new owners the church can vet them obviously when the church is the vendor and the church does were not going to sell one to someone who wants to turn it into st cuthberts casino or st marys massage parlour but when its being sold on for the second or in this case third time youre right its more or less out of our hands so is there any reason for this to escalate into anything merrily this is nicholas elliss patch this is where he holds his gatherings in the village hall i know i was there for a funeral the congregation was singing in tongues over the coffin the bishop made a noise conveying extreme distaste but the point i was about to make bernie is that ellis is sea of light he doesnt care about churches oh merrily you dont really believe the bugger isnt going to start caring very deeply as of now youve spoken to him never spoken to the man in my life but the press have they didnt tell us what he said but i expect well all be reading about it at length in the morning oh anything i can do bernie dunmore chuckled aridly youre the deliverance consultant merrily so what do you think you could do thats not fair look im sorry i messed up so badly on tv if thats what not at all no indeed you were fine as well as being probably the only woman on that programme who looked as if she shaved her armpits was that sexist what im trying to say youre the only one of us who officially knows about this kind of thing and is able to discuss it in a balanced kind of way not like ellis thats what i mean obviously i cant forbid the man to speak to the media but id far rather it were you the only problem bishop and if all future requests for information could be passed directly to our deliverance consultant as the official spokesperson for the diocese on matters of this kind merrily felt a tremor of trepidation and recalled the whizz and flicker the crackle and taptap on the window of a room full of shadows but bernie this job deliverance i know i know its supposed to be lowprofile he paused to weight the punchline but you have after all been on television now havent you ah i wont dress it up bernie said youll probably have problems as a result extremists on both sides the pagansll have you down as a jackboot fascist while ellis is calling you a pinko hippy doing the tango with satan still itll be an experience for you she stripped off the plasters sophie had bought from the pharmacy at tesco on the way to worcester last night a fraught journey from the moment shed stumbled into the saabs headlight beams somewhere on the outskirts of the village she then changed out of her clerical clothes and went up to the attic to check that jane was ok the kid was asleep in her double bed under the famous mondrian walls of vermilion prussian blue and chrome yellow merrily found herself bending over her like she hadnt done for years making sure she was breathing janes eyes fluttered open briefly and she murmured something unintelligible merrily quietly left the room theyd assured her at the hospital that her daughter was absolutely fine but might sleep a lot downstairs the phone was ringing she grabbed the cordless it was gomer hed just been to the shop for tobacco for his rollups and learned about the motorway accident hers all right fine sleeping a lot but thats good bloody hell vicar one of those things bloody hell anythin i can do see i know thanks gomer so you wouldntve gone to mennas funeral then i never went to look for you one funerals enough enough for a long time you were in old hindwell yesterday reckoned it might be a good time found out a few things you might wanner know see no rush mind you look after the kiddie in the morning sure tbe gomer said good old gomer mum flower jane was standing in the kitchen doorway in her towelling dressing gown she looked surprisingly ok you wouldnt notice the bruise over her left eye unless you were looking for it you hungry not really i just went to the loo and looked out the window and i think youve got the filth what hes outside in his car talking on his radio or his mobile overweight guy in a dark suit ive seen him before i think its that miserablelooking copper used to tag around after annie howe the belsen dentist ill go for another liedown now but just thought id warn you merrily let him in dc mumford ds mumford vicar amazingly enough congratulations they have accelerated promotion for young graduates like di howe mumford said heavily for plods like me it can still take twentyodd years hows your little girl youre just a late starter merrily assured him youll whizz through the ranks now janes doing ok thanks but thats not why youre here andy mumfords smile was strained as he stepped into the kitchen another two or three years and hed be up for retirement merrily had coffee freshly made and poured him one shed left the door open for jane for once hoping she was listening a strong indication of recovery youve been in contact with mrs barbara buckingham mumford said we traced her movement back through the hospital sister cullen says she referred her to you merrily stiffened whats happened shes been reported missing mrs watkins barbara by whom arranged to phone her daughter in hampshire every night while she was here but hasnt rung for two nights does not appear to have attended her sisters funeral oh my god checked with hampshire before i came in no word there its an odd one mrs watkins teenagers nine times out of ten theyll surface after a while a woman mrs buckinghams age middle class we start to worry mumford sipped his coffee you saw her last when tuesday evening here it was the only time how much did eileen cullen tell you she said mrs buckingham was very upset not only over her sisters premature death but the fact that she wouldnt be getting buried in the churchyard like normal people she said she thought youd be the minister most likely to give the woman a sympathetic hearing im just the only one eileen knows mumford smiled almost shyly to be honest mrs watkins i got the feeling there might have been another reason she put the lady on to you apart from this objection to the burial but that might just be promotion making me feel i ought to behave like a detective of course if you dont think that would throw any light on our inquiry well there was another reason relating to my other job you can put this down to stress if you like but dont go thinking she was nuts because i dont think she was is not my place reverend she was having troublesome dreams anxiety dreams probably about her sister barbara left home in radnorshire when menna was just a baby and theyd hardly seen each other since anybody would feel regrets in that situation shes a christian she was headmistress at a church school eileen thought she might appreciate some spiritual er counselling she explain why she was alone why her husband wasnt with her she said he was away in france i think he deals in antiques didnt say anything about him leaving her then oh god really for france read winchester mumford pulled out his pocketbook richard buckingham moved out two months ago another woman thats the information we have from the daughter so were you able to ease mrs buckinghams mind i mean if i was to ask you if you thought there was any possibility of her taking her own life oh no she was too angry angry yeah id say so at anybody in particular at jw weal i suppose know him paths have crossed in court once or twice he used to do quite a bit of legal aid work maybe still does i dont get out that way much these days really shed made a joke out of it to sophie but she couldnt imagine weal defending smalltime shoplifters and car thieves and dope smokers that would mean hed have to talk to them i had him down as a wills and conveyancing man place like that a lawyer has to grab what he can get said mumford mrs buckingham didnt care for her brotherinlaw i take it not a lot you have a situation where menna spends her young life looking after her widowed father and then gets married to a much older bloke in the same area no life at all in barbaras view and then cant even get away when she dies you dont like him either then mrs watkins i dont know him mumford considered youd wonder does anybody so when you spoke to her did mrs buckingham give you any idea what she was going to do next she wanted me to go to the funeral with her i went along but she apparently didnt you were there we were supposed to meet seems an unusual arrangement if you dont mind me saying i thought she needed somebody you didnt know mrs weal then well i was actually at the county hospital with a friend just after she died but no i didnt actually know her i dont really know why i said id go along its not like i dont have enough to do maybe why did coppers always make you feel unaccountably guilty maybe i thought barbara might do something stupid if i wasnt there which i might have been able to prevent its hard to explain stupid how maybe cause some kind of scene start hurling accusations at jw weal or something at the funeral but you didnt find her there to be honest it was a difficult day i had jane to pick up from hospital in worcester if id known barbara had been reported missing id have tried harder she returned from seeing mumford out to find jane at the kitchen table the kid was dressed in jeans and her white fluffy sweater she looked about ten until of course she spoke he thinks shes dead police always think that flower i think you think shes dead too i dont think that but i do feel guilty you always feel guilty jane said against the world old hindwell post office was a brickbuilt nineteenthcentury building a little way down from the pub on the opposite side of the street betty was there by eightfifteen on this dry but bitter monday morning the newsagent side of the business opened at eight there were no other customers inside daily mail please the postmistress mrs eleri cobbold glanced quickly at betty and went stiff none left im sorry youve only been open fifteen minutes betty eyed her steadily it was the first time shed been in here she saw a thinfaced woman of about sixty she saw a woman who had already read todays daily mail only got ordered copies isnt it mrs cobbold swallowed besides two extras which weve sold betty was not giving up she glanced at the public photocopier at the other end of the shop in that case could i perhaps borrow one of the ordered papers and make a copy of one particular page mrs cobbold blinked nervously well i dont betty sought her eyes but mrs cobbold kept looking away as though her narrow godfearing soul was in danger she glanced towards the door and seemed very relieved when it was opened by a slim tweedsuited man with a neat beard oh good morning doctor a sharp day eleri yes yes indeed mrs cobbold bent quickly below the counter and produced a daily mail she didnt look at betty you had better take mine thirtyfive pence please are you sure yes mrs cobbold whispered this was ridiculous thank you betty also bought a bottle of milk and a pot of local honey she took her purse from her shoulder bag she didnt smile and if i could have a carton of bats blood as well please this and the presence in the shop of the doctor seemed to release something take your paper and dont come in here again please mrs cobbold said shrilly the doctor raised a ginger eyebrow betty started to shake her head i really cant believe this and mrs cobbold looked at her at last you can tell that husband of yours that if he wants to conduct affairs with married women we dont want to have to watch it on the street at night you tell him that bettys mouth fell open as mrs cobbold stared defiantly at her the doctor smiled and held open the door for her robin paced the freaking kitchen she wouldnt let him fetch the paper she didnt trust him not to overreact if there were any comments to behave in fact like a man whod been coldshouldered by his wife told his artwork was a piece of shit and then stitched up by the media shed been awesomely and unapproachably silent most of yesterday like she was half out of the world sealing herself off from the awful implications of the whole nation worse still the whole village knowing where they were coming from implications like what implications a lynch mob the stake their house torched was this the twentyfirst century or like later in the day hed actually found her sunk into a book on the seventeenthcentury witchhunts the chapter was headed suckling demons it was about women accused of having sex with the devil but she wouldnt talk about it he just wanted to snatch away the book and feed it to the stove shed hardly moved from the kitchen for the rest of the morning drinking strong herbal tea and smoking robin counted eleven cigarettes and still he hadnt told her the truly awful news about blackmore because things were bad enough hed just spent the entire day trying to persuade her just to talk to him which was like trying to lure a wounded vixen from her lair was she blaming him for the truth leaking out like hed been down the pub handing out invitations to their next sabbat and the journalists well how was he supposed to have handled them invite the bastards in to watch them perform the great rite on the hearthrug some chance if hed had the brains he was born with shed told him her voice now inflected with hard yorkshire this was while they were still speaking hedve kept very quiet not answered the door there was no car there so they could quite easily have been away from home what this had made him actually start pulling at his hair like how the fuck was he supposed to know it was the goddamned media at the door might have been insurance salesmen the jehovahs freaking witnesses how could he have known no reply no reply either when hed twice called george webster and vivvie up in manchester to see if they knew anything about this damn tv show hed left two messages on their answering machine and then yesterday after a lunch of tomato soup and stale rolls betty had said she needed time to think and went outside to walk alone leaving robin eking out the very last of the sodden pine wood maybe she went to the church to try and communicate with the reverend freaking penney robin wasnt interested any more when she came back she started moving furniture around and drinking yet more herbal tea maybe there was something on her mind he didnt know about dare he ask what was the damn use it was like she was waiting for something even worse to happen this was all down to ellis no question there it was ellis sicked the press on them goddamn christian bastard she came in from the post office and laid a newspaper on the kitchen table she didnt even look at robin im going to change she said and went out he heard her going upstairs the room felt cold the colours had faded this was bad wasnt it it was going to be worse than he could have imagined although he accepted that he maybe hadnt endeared himself to the mail hacks by going for their camera like that he looked at the paper at least it wasnt on the front nervously he turned over the first page holy shit just the whole of page three was all down the righthand side was a long picture of st michaels church in silhouette against a sunset sky the tower starkly framed by winter trees it was a good picture black and white the headline above it however was just crazy witches possess parish church nightmare evil in our midst warns rector evil robin shouted they really listened to that crazy motherfucker but it was the big picture in colour that made him cringe the most it was a grainy closeup of a snarling man eyes burning under long shaggy black hair on his sweatshiny cheeks were streaks of paint diluted if you wanted the truth by bitter tears but who was ever gonna think that this was blue paint it had obviously come off the cloth hed used to wipe his eyes in the picture it looked like freaking woad the guy looked like he would cut out your heart before raping your wife and slaughtering your children aligned with the picture the story read this is the face of the new priest at an ancient village church robin thorogood is a professional artist he and his wife betty are also practising witches now the couple have become the owners of a medieval parish church while the local rector has to hold his services in the village hall this is my worst nightmare come true says the rev nicholas ellis it is the manifestation of a truly insidious evil in our midst now the acting bishop of hereford the rt rev bernard dunmore is to look into the bizarre situation it concerns me very deeply he said last night it is more than thirty years since the church at old hindwell powys was decommissioned by the church of england for most of that time it stood undisturbed on the land of farming brothers john and ifan prosser when the last brother john died two years ago it passed out of the family and was bought by the thorogoods just before christmas robin thorogood who is americanborn says he and his wife represent the fastestgrowing religion in the country he claims that many of britains old churches were built on former pagan ritual sites one of which he says he and his wife have now repossessed however when invited to explain their plans for the church mr thorogood became abusive and attacked daily mail photographer stuart joyce screaming ill turn you into a fing toad now villagers say they are terrified that the couple will desecrate the ruined church by conducting pagan rites there they say they have already seen strange lights in the ruins late at night the thorogoods nearest neighbour local councillor gareth prosser a farmer and nephew of the former owners said this has always been a godfearing community and we will not tolerate this kind of sacrilege these people sneaked in pretending to be just an ordinary young couple although this is a community of oldestablished families newcomers have always been welcome here as long as they respect our way of life but we feel these people have betrayed our trust and that is utterly despicable trust robin exploded what did that fat asshole ever trust us with jeez hed hardly even spoken to the guy till a couple days ago and then it was like robin was some kind of vagrant he sat down beating his fist on the table it was a while before he realized the phone was ringing by that time betty had come down and answered it when she came off the phone she was white with anger who robin said she didnt answer please she said in low voice vivvie good of them to call back after only a day did they know anything about that programme for all it matters she was on the programme he sat up what they were both there in the studio but only vivienne got to talk bettys voice was clipped and precise it was a latenight forum about the growth of dark age paganism in twentyfirstcentury britain they had wiccans and druids odinists also some christians to generate friction its a friction programme robin snorted tv was a psychic drain vivienne was one of a group of experienced civilized wiccans put together by ned bain for that programme jesus robin said if she was one of the civilized ones i sure wouldnt like to be alone with the wild children of odin and ned bain who as well as being some kind of rich society witch just happened to be an editorial director at harveycalder proprietors of talisman books robin had already felt an irrational anger that bain should have allowed blackmore to dump a fellow pagan although realistically in a big outfit like that it was unlikely bain had anything at all to do with the bastard betty said she claims she lost her cool when some woman priest became abusive she doesnt have any freaking cool this priest was from hereford ned bain had argued that after two thousand years of strife and corruption the christian church was finally on the way out and vivienne informed the hereford priest that the erosion had already started in her own backyard with pagans claiming back the old pagan sites taking them back from the church that had stolen them robin froze you have got to be fucking kidding she didnt reply she jeez that dumb bitch she named us right there on network tv no some local journalist must have picked it up and tracked us down and sold us to the mail the paper that supports suburban values betty said the phone rang robin went for it mr thorogood hes away robin said calmly he went back to the states he hung up that the way to handle the media betty walked over and switched on the machine thats a better way theyll only show up at the door well i wont be here he saw that she was wearing her ordinary person outfit the one with the ordinary skirt and this time with a silk scarf around her neck it panicked him look he cried listen to me im sorry im truly sorry about that picture im sorry for looking like an asshole i just i just lost it you know id just had id just taken this really bad call from your friend betty said huh from your friend in the village the phone rang again from al he said al at talisman the machine picked up this is juliet pottinger you appear to have telephoned me over the weekend i am now back home if you would like to call again thank you look robin waved a contemptuous hand at the paper this is just complete shit like are we supposed to feel threatened because the freaking bishop of hereford finds it a matter warranting deep concern because loopy nick ellis sees us as symptoms of some new epidemic of an old disease what is he the witchfinder freaking general now he leapt up moved toward her bettys hair was loose and tumbled her face was flushed she looked more beautiful than hed ever seen her she always did look beautiful and he was losing her hed been losing her from the moment they arrived here he felt like his heart was swollen to the size of the room were not gonna let them take us down are we betty this is this is you and me against the world right betty detached her car keys from the hook by the door please robin said please dont go betty said quietly im not leaving you robin he put his head in his hands and wept when he took them down again she was no longer there cyst ledwardine sat solid firmly defined in black and white under one of those sullen shifty skies that looked as if it might spit anything at you just before nine merrily crossed the square to the eighttilllate to buy a mail a spiky white head rose from the shops freezer its glasses misted seems funny diggin out the ole frozen pasties again vicar they ended up as usual in the churchyard where gomer gathered all the flowers from minnies grave into a bin liner bloody waste never liked flowers at funerals never liked cut flowers at all let em grow they dont ave long true she knotted the neck of the bin liner spread the daily mail on the neighbouring tombstone and they sat on it barbara buckinghams missing gomer didnt show up for mennas funeral never got back to me and hasnt been in touch with her daughter in hampshire either well gomer said ent like its the first time is it she just go off without a word when she was sixteen been talkin to greta thomas vicar no relation well her man dannys second cousin twice removed whatever small gene pool ar also greta used to be secertry at the surgery dr colls ent much they dont find out there barbara thomas told you why her was under the doctor back then hydatid cyst barbara had talked as though the cyst epitomized all the bad things about her upbringing in the forest all the meanness and the narrowness and the squalidness so that when she had it removed she felt she was being given the chance to make a clean new start a radnorectomy gomer did his big grin getting out his rollup tin merrily said youre going to tell me it wasnt a hydatid cyst at all right gomer shoved a readyrolled ciggy between his teeth in affirmation i never thought of that merrily said i suppose i should have what happened to the baby dint go all the way vicar her miscarried whether her had any help mind i wouldnt know even greta dont know that but there was always one or two farmers wives in them parts willin to do the business and nobody liked merv much hang on remind me merv merv thomas barbaras ole feller oh god gomer nodded see mervs wife glenny her was never a well woman bit like menna delicate havin babbies took it out of her hard birth menna hear the screams clear to glascwm greta reckons after that glenny her says thats it thats me finished slams the ole bedroom door on merv merrily stared up at the sandstone church tower breathed in gomers smoke shed come out without her cigarettes well merv coulder gone into a particlar pub in kington gomer said even over to hereford herd have worn that no problem long as he dint go braggin about it but merv thought a man was entitled to have his needs met in his own home it explained so much why barbara left home in a hurry also why she had such a profound hatred of radnor forest and why menna had invaded her conscience so corrosively to the extent perhaps that after she was dead her presence was even stronger when menna no longer existed on the outside in a fixed place in radnorshire she became a permanent nightly lodger in barbaras subconscious but the bedroom door musnt have stayed closed gomer barbara said her father was determined to breed a son but her mother miscarried and then there was a hysterectomy gomer shrugged but then his wife died hang on this friend of yours merrily was appalled if she knew about barbara then she mustve known what might have been happening to menna difference being vicar that menna had protection there was a good neighbour kept an eye on menna specially after her ma died judy rowland judy prosser now judy judith barbara said she had letters from a friend called judith who was looking out for menna that eased her conscience a little smart woman judy i reckons if judy was lookin out for menna mennad be all right herd take on merv would judy sure to she still around oh hell aye hers wed to gareth prosser councillor magistrate on this committee that committee big man dull bugger mind lucky hes got judy to do his thinkin for him point i was gonner make though vicar i reckon judy was still lookin out for menna seein as both of em was living in ole hindwell you mean after her marriage no moren five minutes apart boy at the pub told me so if she also still kept in touch with barbara maybe barbara went to see her too while she was here dunno bout that but her went to see greta askin questions bout dr coll gatecrashed his surgery made a nuisance of myself not that it made any difference bloody man told me i was asking him to be unethical preempting the postmortem what did barbara want to know about dr coll whether he was treatin menna fore she died that kind o stuff whats he look like dr coll oh skinny little bloke bout my build spose youd say scrappy bit of a beard he was at mennas funeral the private bit ar would be so wheres barbara then gomer where is barbara thomas i could go see judy prosser mabbe anybody knows the score its her ill sniff around a bit more what else i gotter do till the ole grass starts growin up between the graves again it was colder now the mist had dropped down over the tip of the steeple gomers rollup was close to burning his lips he took it out and squeezed the end he looked sadly at the grave his bag of frozen pasties on his knees and his head on one side like a dog as if he was listening for the ticking of those two watches under the soil ive got to go back there today she told him about old hindwell seemingly metamorphosed into salem mass you er dont fancy coming along gomer was on his feet just gimme three minutes to put these buggers in the fridge vicar jane was not happy jane was deeply frustrated she telephoned eirion from the scullery theyve found out where that church is the pagan church i had completely forgotten about it the one that woman was going on about on livenight id forgotten about it like you apparently lose all these brain cells when you have a bump and i just didnt remember that stuff and then bits started coming back and i knew there was something vital but i couldnt put my fing anyway its all over one of the papers its somewhere just your side of the border and shes just raced off over there on account of theres this major scene going down major scene eirion said and im like i have got to check this out but would she let me go with her like shes even taken gomer with her but not me the person who is profoundly interested in this stuff and like because of the other night there is of course not a thing i can do about it she just puts on this calm sorrowful expression and she looks me in the eyes and shes like youre going to stay here this time arent you flower i am completely totally utterly stuffed eirion said calmly so how are you now eirion hows the whiplash is there any chance your car isnt a complete writeoff ah jane sat down at the desk right sorry irene you have to understand that selfpity is like my most instinctive and dominant emotion you ok yeah slept a lot still feel a bit heavy when i first get up but no headaches or anything no scars at all like i said some things i cant remember too clearly about that programme and stuff but yeah yeah im ok my stepmother spoke to your mother ive been feeling i ought to ring her too do you think shed be ok about that with you shed be fatally charming so is it a writeoff interesting you should ask about the car before asking about me i know youre ok your stepmother told mum you were ok i might have subsequently suffered a brain haemorrhage in the night did you eirion paused yes it is a writeoff a car that old if you break a headlamp its a writeoff im sorry i loved that car i worked all summer at a lousy supermarket for that little nova i should get just about enough on the insurance to replace it with a mountain bike irene im really really sorry jane felt tears coming its all my fault everything i touch these days i screw up i dont suppose you want to see me ever again but one day i swear this on my mothers altar ill get you another car what you mean in fifteen years time ill come home one day in my porsche and find a thirtyyearold vauxhall nova outside my penthouse in my scenario jane said youre actually trudging home to your squat lets forget the car eirion said you can sleep with me or something instead ok silence eirion said listen im sorry that just came out that was a joke i said it was ok you dont understand eirion said i dont want it to be like that you dont want to sleep with me i mean i dont want it to be like like you shag first and then you decide if you want to know the person better i dont want it to be like that it never lasts most of the time thats where it all ends youve done a lot of this well erm i was in a band you get around meet lots of people hear lots of stories its just not how i want it to be with us ok wow you dont mess around on the phone do you yeah im good on the phone eirion said listen its been weird i cant stop thinking about that stuff ive just been walking round the grounds and turning it all over and over oh the grounds i cant help my deprived upbringing no i was thinking how close we came to being like dead well yeah it really bloody shakes you up when you start thinking about it brings your life into hard focus unless youve had concussion when it seems to do the opposite most of the time i started thinking about your mum what that wouldve done to her with both her husband and her daughter and it doesnt matter what kind of shit he was he was still her husband and your dad like both her husband and her daughter wiped out on the same bit of road and maybe her too if she hadnt stopped in time these pileups can just go on and on in a fog and i dont know what im trying to say jane i do it was like when i said to you in the car i remember this because it was just before it happened i said do you never lie in bed and think about where we are and how we relate to the big picture i just dont lie in bed and think about it i tramp around the grounds and the hills and think about it thats cool jane said and i was thinking how when we were talking to gerry earlier you remember gerry the researcher gerry and maurice thats right you remember gerry saying before the show started that he wouldnt be surprised if one of them one of the pagans in the studio tried some spooky stuff just to show they could make things happen he said that he said spooky stuff and i said what what would they do and gerry said a spell or something just to prove they could make things happen it was just after he was going on about your mum and how your dad was killed and maybe she felt guilty oh yeah the bastard and you jumped down his sure i mean where did he get that stuff he got it from that guy ned bain ned oh the really cool the smoothtalking git eirion said but that whole thing was getting to me because they didnt do anything did they there was no spell no mumbojumbo no pyrotechnics they were all actually quite well behaved but somehow gerry had got it into his head that they were going to pull some stunt so anyway i rang him this morning you know how im that bloke who wants to be a tv journalist so im writing a piece on my adventures in the livenight gallery for the school magazine youre not of course im not its just what i told gerry to get him talking i told him i was explaining in my piece how the programme researchers get their information and there were things i didnt have a chance to ask him there on the night and where do they get it cuttings files obviously but they also talk to the guests beforehand like this tania talked to your mum and gerry talked to ned bain and a few others but gerry reckoned it was bain had provided all this detailed background on the church of englands first woman diocesan exorcist gerry just told you that it took a bit of digging actually jane after which gerry said how he thought i had a future in his profession said to give him a call when i get through college wow big time sod off so he was genned up on mum like know thine enemy but is that sort of stuff about your dad going to be readily available from the hereford times or something she wont do interviews about herself so where did he get it its no big secret irene maybe its all floating around on the internet exactly im going to check it out i think who told gerry they were going to pull a stunt that from ned bain too gerry claimed hed never said that he said i mustve misunderstood but he bloody did say it jane he just didnt want it going in a school magazine that they were happy for stuff like that to happen on a live programme stuff like what i dont know it just i mean ok lets spell it out bottom line are you suggesting the evil ned bain and his satanic cronies did some kind of black magic resulting in a fog pileup which caused the deaths of several people is that what youre saying not exactly that what are you some kind of fundamentalist welsh chapel bigot unfair jane so what are you suggesting i dont know i just i mean no it would be ridiculous to suggest that those tossers in fancy dress could do anything like that even if they were evil and i dont think they are not evil just totally irresponsible theyre like oh can we work hand in hand with nature to make good things happen and save the earth how the fuck can they know that what theyre going to make happen is going to be good necessarily you sound like mum well maybe shes right dont meddle with anything metaphysical throw yourself on gods mercy unless you know what youre doing maybe yes and they dont they cant know what theyre doing how can they jane it never occurred to you that by working on yourself for like years and years and studying and meditating you can achieve wisdom and enlightenment but most of those people havent have they its just oh lets light a fire and take all our clothes off that is a totally simplistic news of the world viewpoint janes head was suddenly full of a dark and fuzzy resentment you havent the faintest idea at least im not naive about it so im naive i didnt say that there was a moment of true sickening enlightenment youve been talking to her havent you who my esteemed parent the reverend watkins she didnt just speak to your stepmother on the phone she spoke to you as well didnt she no well only at the hospital i mean you were there some of the time thats why theres been no big row why she hasnt asked me what the hell i was doing on the m at midnight why shes so laidback about it look jane im not saying gwennan didnt also fill her in on some of the details but ive never even ive been really really stupid havent i it really must have destroyed some of my brain cells while im sleeping it off youre all having a good chat you told her how id rigged the whole trip making you think she knew all about us going then shes like oh you have to understand jane found it hard coming to terms with me being a priest has to go her own way this cosy vicartocathedralschoolchoirboy teteatete gosh what are we going to do about that girl jane that is totally and youre like oh im trying to understand her too mrs watkins if you think im just one of those reprehensible youths who only want to get inside her pants let me assure you for christs sake jane that is just so demeaning it would be if it you are fucking well dead in the water irene j demonstration of faith merrily pulled the old volvo up against the hedge im sure that wasnt there on saturday a cross standing in a garden mabbe not gomer said it wasnt any big deal no more than the kind of rustic pole available from garden centres everywhere with a section of another pole nailed on as a horizontal it had been sunk into a flowerbed behind a picket fence in the garden of a neat roadside bungalow about half a mile out of walton on the road leading to old hindwell there were three other bungalows but this was the only one with a cross although it was no more than five feet high there was a white light behind it leaking through a rip in the clouds and the fact that it was out of context made you suddenly and breathlessly aware of what a powerful symbol this was the bungalow looked empty no smoke from the chimney merrily drove on you know who lives there retired folk from off i reckon mmm retired incomers were always useful for topping up your congregation if the affable local minister turned up to welcome them just when they were wondering if they were going to be happy here among strangers they would feel obliged to return the favour even if it was only for the next few sundays but if the friendly minister was the reverend nicholas ellis drifting away after a month or so could be more complicated this was what bernie dunmore had been afraid of shed received a briefing on the phone from sophie before they left apparently there was something of a record turnout at the village hall yesterday the bishop understands that a number of people were out delivering printed circulars last night and bulletins were posted on christian websites warning of pagan infestation today theres to be whats been described as a demonstration of faith which the bishop finds more than a little ominous i wonder what he said to them in his sermon you know any regular churchgoers in the village gomer well find somebody for you vicar no problem the bishops in conference all day unsurprisingly but what he wants you to do initially merrily is to offer advice and support to the reverend mr ellis by which i understand him to mean restraint what was she supposed to do exactly put him under clerical arrest but if merrily felt a seeping trepidation about this exercise it clearly wasnt shared by gomer who was hunched eagerly forward in the passenger seat chewing on an unlit ciggy his white hair on end like a mat of antennae describing him to someone once jane had said you need to start by imagining bart simpson as an old man the lane dipped darkening into a channel between lines of forestry the old rectory appeared on the left in its clearing merrily kept her eyes on the narrowing road how would she have reacted if shed turned then and seen a pale movement in a window she gripped the wheel forestalling a shudder not a soul vicar gomer observed ambivalently right her voice was huskier than she would have liked the towering conifers were oppressive this must be the only part of britain where you plunge into the trees when you leave the forest ar we all growed up never thinkin a forest had much to do with trees merrily slowed at the mudflecked old hindwell sign a grey poster with white lettering had been attached to its stem christ is the light that hadnt been there on saturday either she accelerated for the hill up to the village halfway up to the right the tower of the old church suddenly filled a gap in the horizon of pines it was like a grey figure standing there the manifestation of a truly insidious evil in our midst a seriously inflammatory thing to say ellis playing it for all it was worth shed read the daily mail story twice robin thorogood sounded typical of the type of pagan recruited for livenight primarily political and an anarchist what they used to call in liverpool a teararse but not necessarily insidiously evil she wondered what his wife was like no picture of her in the paper sophie had said the bishop would like you to point out to whoever it might concern that while this might have previously been a church it is also now this couples private property and they do not appear to be breaking any laws which the reverend ellis and his followers might well be doing if any of them sets foot inside it merrily slowed to a crawl at the side road to the church and farm this was where you might have expected to find a lychgate there was a small parking area and then an ordinary barred farm gate she saw that while st michaels church had never been exactly in a central position trees and bushes had been allowed to grow around what was presumably the churchyard hedging it off from the village somewhere in there also was the brook providing another natural barrier they moved on up the hill i wouldnt mind taking a look at that place without drawing attention would that be possible gomer sure tbe theres a bit of an ole footpath following the brook from the other side they opened him up a bit for the harchaeologists last summer so we oughter be able to park a good way in you know everything dont you ah well reason i knows this vicar is my nephew nev he got brought in to shovel a few tons o soil and clay back when the harchaeologists was finished i give nev a bell last night good money he reckoned but a lot o waitin around bugger me vicar look at that merrily braked there was a cottage on the right almost on the road it had small windows lacecurtained but in one of the downstairs ones the curtains had been pushed back and a candle was alight although the forestry was thinning it was dark enough here for the flame to be visible from quite a distance power cut not exactly the candle was fixed on a pewter tray which itself sat on a thick black book almost certainly a bible christ is the light annie smith lives there gomer said shes a widow percy smith he had a little timber business died ten year ago their boy mansel he took it over but he ent doin too well deals mostly in firewood now for woodburners and such merrily stopped the car just past the cottage she overtly religious this annie smith never made a thing of it if she is but local people sticks together on things see gareth prosser goes along with the rector say then the rest of em ent gonner go the other way its a border thing when the welsh was fightin the english the border folkd be on the fence till they figured out which side was gonner be first to knock the ole fence down see and that was the side theyd jump down on but theyd all jump together see border logic dont matter they hates each others guts the rest o the time they jumps together all about survival vicar and does gareth prosser go along with the rector they dsay hes got one o them christ stickers in the back of his land rover what does that mean then means hes got a sticker gomer said before they reached the village centre theyd passed five homes with candles burning in their windows and two of them with bibles stood on end gilt crosses facing outwards a fat church candle gleamed greasily in the window of the post office merrily usually at home with bibles and candles found this uncanny we dont do this kind of thing any more its medieval gomer one couple one pagan couple ok young confrontational but still just one couple then its like theres a contagious disease about and you put a candle in the window if its safe to go inside is this village i mean is it normally normal just a village like any other yereabouts he pondered a moment no that ent right ole hindwell was always a bit set apart not part o the valley not quite in the forest seen better times used to ave a little school an a blacksmith same as there used tbe a church ennit but villages around yere they grows and wanes i never seen it as not normal a big whitehaired man was walking up the hill carrying something on his shoulder they dsay he does a bit o healin gomer said ellis laying on of hands at the end of the services at the big bible fest in warwickshire the spiritual energy generated by power prayer and singing in tongues would often be channelled into healing members of the congregations stepping up with various ailments and chronic conditions and often claiming remarkable relief afterwards it was this aspect merrily had most wanted to believe in but she suspected that when the euphoria faded the pain would usually return and she hated to hear people who failed to make it out of their wheelchairs being told that their faith was not strong enough they reckons he does a bit o housetohouse and it ent just normal sickness either know any specific cases a snatch of conversation came back to her from minnies funeral tea at ledwardine village hall boy gets picked up by the police with a pocketful o these bloody ecstersee up in court dennis says thats it boy you stay under my roof you can change your bloody ways were gonner go an see the bloody rector when the big man stepped into the middle of the road and swung round the item on his shoulder was revealed to be a large grey video camera he took a step back to take in the empty sloping street where the only movement was the flickering of the candles he stood with his legs apart recording the silent scene looking like the sheriff in a western in the seconds before doors flew open and figures appeared shooting no doors opened clouds hung low and heavy there was little light left in the sky the weather was cooperating with the candles the cameraman shot the scene at leisure tv news merrily said therell be a reporter around somewhere too im supposed to make myself known to them gomer nodded towards the cameraman least that tells you why theres no bugger about nobody yeres gonner wanner explain on telly about them candles even if they could merrily thought what you wanner do vicar its not what i want to do merrily said but i do have to talk to the reverend nick ellis he lives on the estate would that be past the pub about a hundred yards out of the village centre were eight semidetached houses on the same side of the road thats the estate gomer pointed as they approached merrily parked in front of the first house though these were once council houses fancy gates double glazing and new front doors showed that most of them had been purchased they all had candles in the windows only one house fairly central kept its maroon standardissue front door and flaking metal gates it was the only one still looking like a council house except for the cross on the door wood painted gold and nailed on there was a large jeep crowding the brief drive a sticker over a nameplate on the gate announced that christ was the light in the single downstairs window two beeswax candles burned in trays on bibles merrily had heard that ellis was living in a council house because when hed given up his churches hed also given up his rectory the church paid the rent on this modest new manse a small price to pay per head of congregation and it wouldnt do elliss image any harm at all and he would know that she felt a pulse of fury from singing in tongues to erecting a wall of silence this man had turned a whole community dozens maybe hundreds of people against a couple who hadnt yet been here long enough for anyone really to know them the thorogoods would need to be very hardfaced to survive it spirit of salem this is no coincidence george said on the phone this is fate we all know what tomorrow is probably the last day of my freaking marriage you have to go with it robin we can turn this round we can make it a triumph robin wanted to scream that he couldnt give a shit about imbolc he just wanted things to come right again with his wife some work to bring in some money his religious beliefs no longer to be national news he just wanted to become a boring obscure person in the background the old fax machine huffed and whizzed he watched the paper emerge thou shalt not suffer a witch to live poison faxes creepy bible quotes someone had unleashed the christian propaganda machine the spirit of salem living on its all our fault man george said not your fault vivvies fault i share the blame i was there too i also now share the responsibility for getting you and betty through this we could maybe get through this george if people would just leave us the fuck alone he wasnt so sure about that though the way betty was behaving by nine am the answering machine had taken calls from bbc wales radio hereford and worcester htv central news bbc midlands and live and from some flatvoiced kid who said he was a pagan too and would like to pledge his support and his magic already they were starting to come to the front door by eleven am thered been four people knocking he hadnt answered instead hed closed the curtains and sat in the dimness hugging the rayburn hed listened to the answering machine intercepting just this one call from george the whole damn story was truly out it had been on all the radio stations and breakfast tv was also out on the world wide web with emails of support according to george coming from native americans in canada and pagans as far away as india george claimed that already this confrontation was being seen as a rallying flashpoint for ethnic worshippers of all persuasions strength and courage were being transmitted to them from all over the world we dont want it robin told george we came here for a quiet life pretty soon im gonna take the phone off the hook and unplug the fax in that case george said surely its better that the people you know you mean people you know listen george just hold off can you do that i would need to talk to betty whens she going to be back i dont know when shes gonna be back shes mad at me she thinks i screwed up with the mail guys i think i screwed up with the mail guys im mad at me you need support man and theres a lot of craft brothers and craft sisters who want to give you some i tell you theres an unbelievable amount of strong feeling about this itll be very much a question of stopping people coming out there well you fucking better stop them plus the opposition of course george said we dont know how many they are or where theyre coming from robin peered round the edge of the curtain at the puddles in the farmyard and along the side of the barn it looked bleak it looked desolate in spite of all the courage and strength being beamed at them it looked lonely as hell sure he felt vulnerable how could he not when he sighed it came out rough with a tremor underneath it how many were you thinking well we need a coven george had said ill find eleven good people which with you and betty makes the right number we could be there by nightfall dont worry about accommodation well have at least two camper vans well bring food and wine and everything we need to deck out the church for imbolc be the greatest imbolc ever robin well set the place alight i dunno i dunno what to do for george this was cool this was exciting if youd put it to robin even just a few days ago hed have said yeah wow great it was what hed envisaged from the start the repaganized church becoming a centre of the old religion at the heart of a prehistoric ritual landscape the idyll but this was not bettys vision any more if it ever had been leave it with me yeah george said blessed be man im quite psychic you know juliet pottinger had what betty regarded as a posh lowland scottish accent i was about to go into town and then i thought no if i go out now i shall miss something interesting which was a better opening than betty could have hoped for lower lodge was an extended georgian cottage on the edge of a minor road about two miles out of leominster and a good twentyfive miles east of old hindwell once away from old hindwell bettys head had seemed to clear the day was dull but dry the temperature no worse than you could expect in late january out here she felt lighter less scared less oppressed mrs pottingers house was full of books six bookcases in the hall with two piles of books beside one of them propped up by an umbrella stand in the long kitchen where she made betty tea the demands of reading and research seemed to have long since overtaken the need for food preparation books and boxfiles were wedged between pans on the shelves and under cups and plates on the dresser the only visible cooker was a microwave and an old amstrad word processor with a daisywheel printer took up half the kitchen table there was small blessing no sign of a daily mail juliet pottinger was about sixtyfive with a heavy body layered in cardigans and what you could only call wide hair her seat was a typists chair which creaked when she moved she was working she said on a definitive history of the midborder im sorry i didnt phone first betty said i just happened to be passing but you live at old hindwell you say at st michaels oh said mrs pottinger oh it meant betty didnt have to spend too long explaining her interest in the church and no need to make reference either to her religion or the ruined buildings palpable residue of pain the widow sold it then said mrs pottinger thought she would it was in the hereford times about major wilshire old regiment man the sas he wrote to me as you know of course mrs wilshire passed over to me some documents relating to the house and the church and your letter was one of them thats how we learned about mr penney oh i feel such a terrible wimp about that mrs thorogood i wanted to write up the whole story but i doubt the brecon and radnor would have printed it for legal reasons also i ramble so become overabsorbed in detail always been more of a historian than a journalist and of course the local people were against anything coming out why do you think that was in case it reflected poorly on them i suppose in case it drew attention to their affairs gareth prosser the elder was the councillor then upholding the familys local government tradition of conserving the community in whatever ways are most expedient and saying as little as possible about it in open council my brief as local correspondent for the paper was to report nothing that everyone didnt already know except of course in the case of poor terry when i was instructed not to report what everyone already knew oh dear it really has not been a happy place im afraid you felt that i always knew that however i dont want to depress you you do after all have to live with it thats why i need to know about its true history it oppresses me otherwise does it mrs pottingers eyes became in an instant shrewdly birdlike yes it i bettys banging heart was confirming that it was too late for subterfuge im i suppose youd say sensitive to atmosphere acutely sensitive are you indeed the first time i saw that ruined church i had a very negative reaction which i kept to myself because my husband loved it was enraptured for some time i kept trying to tell myself we could you know do something about it you mean feng shui or something or something betty said carefully the place upsets me it unbalances me in ways i cant handle after we moved in that became stronger until i could feel it almost through the walls of the farmhouse i hope i dont sound like an idiot to you mrs pottinger she was amazed at what shed just said all the things she hadnt been able to say to robin mrs pottinger did not smile she pulled off her halfglasses and thought for a few moments tapping one of the arms on a corner of the amstrad while we were living in old hindwell she said at last we acquired for ourselves a dog it was a cocker spaniel we called hopkins my husband would take him for walks morning and evening by using the footpath which follows the brook past the church it was possible almost to circumnavigate the village have you walked that particular path yet i havent but i think my husband has its a round trip of about a mile and a half a perfect evening walk but would hopkins follow it he would not within about twenty yards of the church approaching from either direction that dog would be off disappeared for a whole night once well after this had happened two or three times pottinger tried putting him on a lead but when they reached some invisible barrier as i say about twenty yards from the church where the yew trees began hopkins would start tugging in the opposite direction with such force that he almost strangled himself pottinger used to say he was afraid the poor creature would choke himself to death rather than continue along that path mrs pottinger replaced her glasses as you can imagine thats another story i didnt write for the brecon and radnor express betty found the story chilling but not surprising the only time shed ever seen anyone on that path was the night the witch box was delivered did you try to find out what might have scared your dog naturally i did i was fascinated so i went to visit terry betty registered that penney was the only male not even her own husband whom mrs pottinger had referred to by his first name it was the first time id actually been up to the rectory as he never seemed to invite people there normally id collect his notes and notices for the b and r at the church on sundays after morning service the rectory was far too large for a bachelor of course or even for a married clergyman with fewer than four children one can understand why the church is now shedding so many of its properties but in those days it was still expected that the minister should have a substantial dwelling terry however was well it was quite bizarre betty remembered how mrs pottingers letter to major wilshire had ended with the suggestion that old hindwell existed for her now as little more than a surreal memory his appearance i suppose was becoming quite hippyish hed seemed quite normal when he first arrived in the village but after a time it began to be noticed that he was allowing his hair to grow and perhaps not shaving as often as he might and when i arrived at the rectory that day it was about this time of year perhaps a little later terry showed me into a reception room so cold and sparsely furnished that it was clear to me that it could not possibly be in general use i remember i put my hand on the seat of an old armchair and it was actually damp good god terry i said we cant possibly talk in here i dont know about you mrs thorogood but i cant even think in the cold betty smiled the bookstuffed kitchen was stiflingly warm and so with great reluctance terry took me into his living room and when i say living room it contained not only his chair and his writing desk but also his bed which was just a sleeping bag he told me he was repainting his bedroom but i wasnt fooled this single room was terrys home he was camping in this one room like in a bedsitter and apart from the kitchen the rest of the rectory was closed off i doubt he even used a bathroom washed himself at the sink instead id guess when he even remembered to not terribly is there something the matter mrs thorogood betty shook her head please go on well hed chosen this room i guessed because of the builtin bookshelves he might not have had much furniture or many private possessions but he had a good many books i always examine peoples bookshelves and terrys books included a great deal of theology as one would expect but also an element of what might be termed the esoteric do you know the kind of thing i mean the occult that word of course merely means hidden there was certainly a hidden side to terry he was perfectly affable kind to the old people good with children but his sermons i suppose they must have been beyond most of the congregation including me occasionally they were sometimes close to meditations i suppose as though he was still working out for himself the significance of a particular biblical text when i told him about our dog hopkins he didnt seem in the least surprised he asked me how much i knew about the history of the area at that time not a great deal i admit he asked me particularly if i knew of any legends about dragons betty cleared her throat dragons in the radnor forest and did you no theres very little recorded folklore relating specifically to radnor forest the only mention i could find was from hold on a moment mrs pottinger jumped up her hair rising like wings an outstretched finger moving vaguely like a compass needle ah she crossed the room and plucked a greencovered book from the row supported by tall kitchen weights on a window ledge you are enlivening my morning no end mrs thorogood so few people nowadays want to discuss such matters especially with a garrulous old woman she laid the book in front of betty it was called a welsh country parson by d parryjones it fell open at a muchthumbed page parryjones records here if you can see that a dragon had dwelt deep in the fastnesses of the forest and he records this would be back in the twenties or thirties a conversation with an old man who insisted he had heard the dragon breathing all rather sketchy im afraid and somewhat fanciful anyway it soon became clear to the people he was involved with on a daytoday basis that terry was becoming quite obsessed betty looked up from the book shaken as a symbol of evil mrs pottinger said a satanic symbol the dragon from the book of revelation represents the old enemy my impression was that terry thought he was in some way being tested by god by being sent to old hindwell where the dragon was at the door that god had a mission for him here well english people who come to wales sometimes do pick up rather strange ideas mrs pottinger put on a rather superior smile as though scots were immune to such overreaction ignoring this betty said did he believe there were socalled satanic influences at work in the forest i mean is there a history of this of witchcraft say if there was not much is recorded no famous witchcraft trials on either side of the border in this area but of course a thin sly smile that doesnt mean it didnt go on quite the reverse one would imagine it may have been so much a part of everyday life something buried so deep in the rural psyche that rooting it out might have been deemed impractical what about cascob cascob oh the charm mrs pottinger beamed that is rather a wonderful mixture isnt it do you know some of those phrases are thought to have been taken from the writings of john dee the elizabethan magus who was born not far away near pilleth do you know anything about the woman elizabeth loyd some poor child could she have been a witch i mean the wording of the exorcism suggests she was thought to be possessed by satanic evil suspected witches around that time were often thought to have relations with the devil some women are known to have boasted of it betty had read yesterday the devils member was described as being long and narrow and cold as ice nothing is known of her mrs pottinger said or where her exorcism took place or who conducted it the historian francis payne suggests that the charm was probably buried to gain extra potency for the invocation buried it was apparently dug up in the churchyard betty sat very still and nodded and tried to smile and felt again the weight of a certain section of cascobs circular churchyard and the chill inside the building mrs pottinger she said quickly what finally happened to terry penney well hed virtually destroyed his own church an unpardonable sin he had effectively resigned hed already left the village before the crime was even discovered taking with him his roomful of possessions in that old van he drove you suggested in your letter to major wilshire that thered been previous acts of vandalism did i yes minor things a small fire in a shed outside spotted and dealt with by a churchwarden other petty incidents too as though he was building up to the main event where did he go after he left no one knows or much cared at the time except perhaps for me for a while but the church was very quickly compensated for the damage done so perhaps terry had more money than it appeared perhaps his frugal lifestyle was a form of asceticism a monkish thing anyway he just went away after setting in train the process which ultimately led to the decommissioning of old hindwell church and the village then erased him from its collective and wonderfully selective memory you really didnt like the place much did you betty said bluntly you may take it that i did not feel particularly grateful to some of the inhabitants we left in eightythree my husband had been unwell so we thought we ought to live nearer to various amenities that was what we told people at least and thats mrs pottingers voice became faint thats what ive been telling people ever since she sat back in her typing chair blinked at betty then stared widely as if she was waking up to something betty returned the stare youre really rather an extraordinary young woman arent you mrs pottinger said in surprise as though shed ceased many years ago to find young people in any way interesting i wonder why it is that i feel compelled to tell you the truth the truth tell me mrs pottinger said whos your doctor a humble vessel there was no doorbell so she knocked twice three times she was about to give up when he answered the door ah he said reverend watkins registering her only briefly before bending over the threshold apparently to inspect the candles in the neighbouring windows good meaning the candles she guessed im sorry to bother you mr ellis they told me youd be dropping in he shrugged i accept that i feel a bit awkward yes he said you must do do you want to come in she followed him through a shoebox hall which smelled of curry into a small square living room which had been turned into an office there was a steelframed desk two matching chairs a computer displayed red and green standby lights on a separate desk and there was a portable tv set on a stand with a video recorder underneath the war room nicholas ellis said with no smile his accent sounded far more transatlantic than it had during mennas funeral service he wore a light grey clerical shirt with pectoral cross and creased grey chinos his long hair was loosely tied back with a black ribbon his face was windreddened but without lines like a mannequin in an oldfashioned tailors shop he waved her vaguely to one of the metal chairs not much time im afraid ill help you all i can but i really dont have much time today as you can imagine events kind of caught up on me when he sat down behind his desk merrily became aware of the aluminiumframed picture on the wall behind him over the boardedup fireplace it was william blakes the great red dragon and the woman clothed with the sun sexually charged awesomely repulsive ellis noticed her looking at it revoltingly explicit isnt it shining with evil i live with it so that when they look in my window they will know im not afraid they the war room merrily sat down kept her coat on so he said as if he was trying hard to summon some interest you are the uh im sorry i did write it down diocesan deliverance consultant it had never sounded more ludicrous and the suffragan bishop of ludlow has sent you to support me well here i am he opened his arms a humble vessel for the holy spirit have you ever truly experienced the holy spirit merrily in my way no in other words he said it doesnt happen in your way it happens in his way damn merrily said prickling youre right he looked at her with half a smile on his wide lips diocesan deliverance consultant i guess youre like one of those young female mps what did they call them blairs babes i suppose it was only a matter of time before we had them in the church like woodworm he didnt reply hed lost the halfsmile meaning i look vaguely presentable merrily said even though i must know bugger all and you feel you must throw in the odd swear word to show that the clergy doesnt have to be stuffy and pious any more gosh merrily said it doesnt take you long to get the measure of a person does it ellis smiled at last my we really arent getting along are we you arent going to want to support me at all are you well other priests tend not to as im a fundamentalist thats what the anglican church calls someone who truly believes in the living god he leaned back im sorry lets start again how do you propose to support me how would you like to be supported by being left alone i guess thats what i guessed youd say arent you clever he was looking not at her but through her as though she was for him without substance or at least insufficiently textured to engage his attention it made her annoyed but then it was designed to she pressed on um you said war room yes and obviously quite a few people here seem to agree with you on that yes and it all looks quite dramatic and everything you make it sound like a facade its an initial demonstration of faith in the lord it will spread youll see twice as many candles on your way out isnt it a bit premature to call this a war zone one story in a newspaper two amateur witches in a redundant church unless he gave her just a little more attention unless unless this goes back rather further than this mornings daily mail it goes back well over two thousand years merrily the satyr shall cry to his fellow yea there shall the night hag alight and find for herself a resting place isaiah merrily remembered the taunts of the industrial chaplain the rev gemmell in the livenight studio inviting her to stand up and denounce ned bain as an agent of satan in front of seven million viewers meaning that whether they accept it or not all followers of pagan gods are actually making a bed for the devil in this case ellis said to reflect the imagery of the radnor forest a nest for the dragon because the former church here is dedicated to st michael merrily glanced up at the blake print in which the obscene and dominant dragon viewed from behind was curlyhorned and not really red but the colour of an earthworm it was hard not to believe that william blake himself must have seen one one of five churches positioned around radnor forest and charged with the energy of heavens most potent weapon cefnllys cascob llanfihangel nant melan llanfihangel rhydithon old hindwell the forest is supposed to be a nest for the dragon is that a legend no legend is simply a legend ellis said we have the evidence of the five churches dedicated to the warrior angel if one should fall it creates a doorway for satan you see merely two misguided idiots i see the beginnings of a disease which unless eradicated at source will spread until all christendom is a mass of suppurating sores this is what the devil wants will you deny that hold on you say theres a legend that if one of the churches falls et cetera yet youre not interested in preserving churches are you i mean as i recall when the sea of light group was inaugurated someone said that the only way faith could be regenerated was to sell off all the churches as museums and use the money to pay more priests to go out among the people correct and in the village here a resurgence of faith has already restored a community centre which had become derelict a home for rats look at it now eventually the church will move out put up its illuminated cross somewhere else but in the meantime god has chosen old hindwell for a serious purpose i can see you still dont understand trying you see a ruined church i see a battleground look he stood up and strode to the computer touched the mouse and brought up his menu clicked on the mailbox icon his inbox told him he had two unread emails one was from warlock subject war in heaven he clicked the message read i am a brother to dragons and a companion to owls book of job merrily said ellis reduced and deleted it theres one every day since when they like to use that internet provider demon todays is a comparatively mild offering you reported this to the police the police this is beyond the police they can trace these people through the server itll only turn out to be some fourteenyearold who received his instructions anonymously in a spirit message from cyberspace and the police are gonna laugh i would hardly expect them to understand that theres a chain of delegation here leading back eventually to hell that of course he nodded at the computer is satans latest toy i keep one here for the same reason i have that repulsive picture on the wall masochism merrily thought a martyrdom trip im a defiant man merrily dont go thinking this began with the arrival of the thorogoods ive been set up for this ive been getting poisonpen letters for months and phone calls cackling voices in the night recently had a jagged scratch removed from my car bonnet a series of vertical chevrons like a dragons back maybe you do need support he hit the metal desk with an open palm i have all the support i will ever need what do you plan to do god shall cast out the dragon through michael i made a civilized approach to thorogood i told him i wanted to perform a cleansing eucharist in the church he put me off he cant do that now he faces the power of the holy spirit and the cold shoulder from the people of old hindwell you mean our demonstration of faith you disagree with that she shrugged candles are harmless i just hope thats where it ends my dear merrily ellis walked to the door this is where it begins and with respect its not your place to hope for anything in relation to my parishioners arent the thorogoods also your parishioners he expelled a mildly exasperated hiss and if theyre trying to make a point about reclaiming ancient sites hasnt it occurred to you that youre just helping to publicize their cause and whats bernard dunmores policy on the issue ellis demanded say nothing and hope they wont be able to maintain their mortgage repayments try to forget theyre there is that perhaps why the church is no longer a force in this country while evil thrives unchallenged perhaps you should find out for yourself what kind of people the thorogoods really are maybe you could visit their property under cover of darkness again damn she stood up ok im sorry it was a private funeral and i had no right but i was looking for someone someone who as it happens has now been reported missing from home oh for the first time he was thrown off balance barbara buckingham nee thomas mennas sister ive never heard of her i didnt even know menna had a sister merrily blinked didnt you ever talk to menna about her background why should i have probed into her background just that when i have kids for confirmation we have long chats about everything rebaptism i mean id have thought that was something much more serious merrily i dont have to talk about this to you she followed him into the hall its just i cant believe youre one of those priests who simply goes through the motions nick i do have an appointment im sorry splish splash youre now baptized when he swiftly lifted a hand she thought for an incredible moment that he was going to hit her and she actually cringed but all he did was twist the small knob on the yale lock and pull open the front door but when he noticed that momentary cower he smiled broadly and his smooth face lit up like a jackolantern she didnt move i still dont fully understand this nick i know he said and you must ask yourself why i mean i dont understand why youre using the enviable influence youve developed in this community to put people in fear of their immortal souls you didnt have to make that inflammatory statement to the mail he looked at her as if trying for the first time to bring her into focus and then finding she was too flimsy to define turned away i cant believe he said that you have somehow managed to become a priest of god she walked past him through the doorway glanced back and saw a man with nothing much to lose a man who had stripped himself down to the basics cheap clothes a small council house a village hall for a church and even that impermanent there was something distinctly medieval about him he was like a friar a mendicant of course she said from the step theyre also helping to publicize you and maybe the villagers arent afraid for their immortal souls at all theyre just assisting their rector to build his personal reputation if you were in a town virtually nobody would think this was worth the candle this is a waste of time nick ellis said i have people to see the door closed quietly in her face merrily stood on the path she found she was shaking she hadnt felt as ineffectual since the livenight programme dark glamour as merrily got back into the car gomer pointed to the mobile on the dash bleeped twice third time i figured out how to answer him andy mumford it was that copper jane gived him your number he asked could you call back he say what about not to me she picked up the phone entered the hereford number gomer had written on a cigarette paper having to hold the thin paper close to the window because it was beyond merely overcast now and not yet one pm three fat raindrops blopped on the windscreen this was she told herself going to be positive news ds mumford its merrily watkins ah has she turned up afraid not mrs watkins oh she heard elliss front door slam and saw him coming down the path he was carrying a mediumsized white suitcase he walked past her volvo without a glance and carried on towards the village centre but im afraid her car has mumford said you know the elan valley big area of lakes reservoirs about thirty miles west of kington theyve pulled her car out of one of the reservoirs oh god some local farmer saw the top of it shining under the water been driven clean through a fence dyfedpowysve got divers in there when i checked about ten minutes ago they still hadnt found anything else dont know what the currents are like in those big reservoirs im sorry to have to tell you this reverend but i thought youd want to know yes thank you if i hear anything else ill get back to you or of course if you hear anything its been known for people to what you think she might have faked her own death no im a pessimist mumford said i tend to think theyll pull out a body before nightfall it began as a forestry track then dropped into an open field with an unexpected vista across the valley to the radnor forest hills of grey green and bracken brown most of which gomer knew by name and strange names they were the whimble the smatcher the black mixen evocative englishsounding names though all the hills were in wales merrily and gomer sat for a moment in the car and took in the view not a farm a cottage or even a barn in sight there were a few sheep but lambing would come late in an area as exposed as this hill farming country marginal land she remembered barbara buckingham talking about her deprived childhood the teabags used six times the chip fat changed only for christmas as they left the car at the edge of the field she paused to say a silent prayer for barbara she caught up with gomer alongside a new stile which he said had been erected by nev for the archaeologists this was where the track became a footpath following the line of the hindwell brook which was flowing unexpectedly fast and wide after all the rain it had stopped raining now but the sky bulged with more to come gomer pointed across the brook shouting over the rush of the water used to be another bridge by yere one time but now the only way you can get to the ole church by car is through the farm see where was the excavation back there see them tumps nevs work he squinted critically at a line of earthmounds where tons of soil had been replaced boy coulder made a better job o that bit bloody uneven ennit she went to stand next to him youd like to get back on the diggers wouldnt you minnie never liked it gomer said gruffly her still wouldnt like it sides which im too old you dont think that for one minute gomer sniffed and turned away and led her through an uncaredfor copse where some of the trees were dead and branches brought down by the gales had been left where theyd fallen prossers ground all of this inherited from the ole fellers but he dont do nothin with it nmore muster been glad when the harchaeologists come likely got compensation for lettin em dig up ground the dull buggerd forgotten he owned whys he never done anything with it thats why gomer said as they came out of the copse and there on a perfect promontory a natural shelf above the brook on the opposite bank was the former parish church of st michael old hindwell gomer merrily was transfixed its beautiful the nave had been torn open to the elements but the tower seemed intact a bar of light in the sky made the stones shimmer brown and grey and pink between patches of moss and lichen its the kind of church townsfolk dream of going to on a sunday i mean what must it be like on a summer evening with its reflection in the water how could they let it go gomer grunted rolling a ciggy reverend penney ennit i tole you went off is trolley went off his trolley how exactly she remembered that bernie dunmore had made a brief allusion last night to the rector at the time actually suggesting that old hindwell church should be decommissioned now with a certain relish gomer told her what the reverend terence penney rector of this parish had done with all that ancient and muchpolished church furniture on an october day in the mids wow she stared into the water imagining it foaming around the flotsam of the ministers madness why drugs gomer said there was talk of drugs where is he now gomer shrugged she gazed appalled at the ruin i bet we can find out when we get back to the car ill call sophie sophie knows everybody in a dog

christ is the light placard you could tell by their outward boundtype clothing that they were not local merrily found herself thinking that some people just didnt have enough to do with their lives she was confused she didnt know this place at all it was like one of those complicated watches that did all sorts of different things and you had to get the back off before you could see how the cogs were connected problem was she didnt even know where to apply the screwdriver to prise off the back black lion gomer suggested ill buy you a pint and a sandwich vicar at the black lion there were no visible candles no lights at all in fact merrily saw gomer glance at his wrist before remembering hed buried his watch about a quarter to two she said gomer frowned whats the silly bugger playin at shuttin of a lunchtime with all these tv fellers in town merrily followed him up a short alley into a yard full of dustbins and beer crates there was a door with a small frostedglass window and gomer tapped on it kept on tapping until a face blurred up behind the frosted glass looking like the scrubbedover face of one of the suspects in a police documentary were closed dont give me that ole wallop greg boy open this bloody door whos that gomer parry plant hire sounding like he was planning to take a bulldozer to the side of the pub if he couldnt gain normal access bolts were thrown the licensee was probably not much older than merrily but his eyes were bagged his mouth pinched his shirt collar frayed hed shaved but not well gomer regarded him without sympathy bloody hell greg we only wants a pot o tea and a sandwich the man hesitated all right just dont make a big fing about it they followed him through a storeroom and an expensive fitted kitchen with a tomatored doubleoven aga and the sound of extractor fans busy night boy yeah but he didnt sound happy about it go frew there to the lounge bar i wont put no lights on longs we can see what were eatin the lounge bar greylit through more frosted glass looked to have been only half renovated as if the money had run out new brass light fittings on walls too thinly emulsioned also a vague smell of damp i can make you coffee but not tea greg said without explanation well take it gomer pulled out bar stools for merrily and himself greg threw out the dregs of a smile hope this is your daughter gomer ent got no daughter gomer said gruffly this is the vicar of our church as gregs smile vanished gomer sat down leaned both elbows on the bar top who made you close the pub then boy the wife and who made her close it look greg said

other things in what the reverend ellis is getting up to you know greg snorted merrily unwound her scarf to let him see the dog collar this seems to be one of the few places without a candle in the window greg pushed fingers through his receding hairline he looked as if there wasnt much more he could take you wanna know what hes getting up to like apart from destroying marriages no lets include that merrily sat down greg said thered been a full house last night first time in ages folks i aint never seen before not big drinkers but we got frew a lot of cokes and shandies and if you know

this is back in london when we was managing a pub in fulham she was getting difficult to handle merrily said nothing wiv men and and that greg waved it away with an embarrassed shake of the head aint a nympho or noffink like that it was just the depression we had a holiday once and she was fine said she was sure shed be fine the whole time if we went to live somewhere nice like in the country he snorted country aint cheap no more not for a long time cept yere mabbe gomer said yeah its a trap greg boy tell me about it ive had people in here incomers you can pick em out from the nervous laughter still lookin for strawberries and cream on the village green and the blacksmith taptappin over his forge be funny if it wasnt so bleedin tragic that was you was it merrily said softly when

difference so your wife went to church again yesterday merrily prompted yeah off again up the village hall couldnt get out this place fast enough i didnt want this sure i wanted her to make friends but not this way i said come on we aint churchgoers and itd be hypocritical to start now without the hypocrites all our congregations would be sadly depleted merrily admitted but she went anyway and came back all aglow right greg didnt smile made lots of new instant friends merrily said people shed only nodded to in the village shop hugged her as she left she realized shed never felt quite so much at home in the community before dead on greg said sourly and she wants you to close the pub and go to church with her next week says its the only way were gonna have a future and i dont fink she meant the extra business it wont he looked scared it wont last will it miss merrily it cant last can it shes not a religious person i mean yeah i coulda foreseen this soon as people starting whispering about the new rector what a wonderful geezer he was how their lives was changed how hed i dunno helped them stop smoking straightened out their kids this kind of stuff all this talk of the holy spirit and people fainting in church and marianne kind of saying makes you fink dont it never had no luck to speak of since we moved in wouldnt do no harm would it greg looked at merrilys collar not your style then all this holy spirit shite not my style exactly gomer said dont do any good to let your feet get too far off the ground my experience why did they want you to close the pub today merrily asked aaah shook his head contemptuously you seen the paper he told em all yesterday this was coming off got bloody devilworshippers in the village and they gotta be prepared bleedin huge turnout standing room only up the hall cording to marianne when i could get any sense out of her people hanging out the doors lining the bloody steps this is local people or newcomers mainly newcomers i reckon a few locals though no question and apparently ellis is going greg threw up his arms theres a great evil come amongst us we got to fight it we are the chosen ones in the battle against satan satan is this robin thorogood all right a yank a bit loud in your face but satan you credit that you know him then he shrugged americans talk to em for half an hour you know em his wifes more down to earth i didnt know they was witches though they never talked about that but why should they you were going to tell us why youd closed the pub he dont want any distractions he wants concentration of faith i dont understand merrily said why mondays he holds his healing sessions greg said up the village hall so there was a lot of pain and bewilderment in his eyes i can help merrily said just tell me greg breathed heavily down his nose last night she says to me im unclean just like that like out the bible ive been tempted by satan she says ent we all boy gomer said by thorogood suddenly shes being frank all the time shes telling me stuff i dont wanna know like she was tempted sexually by robin thorogood agent of satan she was possessed by his dark glamour she wanted to sh sleep wiv him she comes out wiv all this to me wanted to sleep with him ah noffink bleedin happened im sure of that he aint been here two minutes plus shes ten years older than what he is gotta be and if you seen his wife nah i doubt he even noticed marianne its just shite greg shook his head gutted ill go get your coffee greg hang on possessed by his dark glamour this wasnt his wife speaking this was ellis did she actually use the word possessed i reckon yeah to be honest i couldnt take no more i was knackered out i went to bed this is totally stupid this dont happen in places like this this is city madness innit and shes up at the hall now merrily slid from her stool picked up her scarf handmaiden out in the pub car park she was ambushed mrs watkins martyn kinsey bbc wales i gather youre speaking for the diocese today well i am but wed like to knock off a quick interview if thats ok hed probably recognized her from livenight she asked him if there was any chance of doing this stuff later from where she stood she could see the top of the cross on the village hall and it was lit up and it hadnt been lit before actually kinsey was a plump shrewdeyed guy in his thirties if we dont do it now i suspect we could be overtaken by events nick ellis is over there in the hall having a meeting with some people were expecting him to come out and announce plans for a march to st michaels church probably tonight thats what hes doing in there is it the cross was lit up for a policy meeting i dont think so isnt that going to be too late for your programme oh sure much too late we might get a piece in the half nine slot though thatll be only about forty seconds but i think its going to be a damp squib anyway with no one there to protest at the thorogoods have been smart enough to vacate the premises youve not been able to speak to them kinsey shook his head thats why were going to have to make do if you dont mind me putting it like that with people like you just tell us where the church stands on this issue a straightforward response wont take more than a couple of minutes of course it wasnt straightforward and with the positioning and the repositioning and the cutaways and the noddies it took most of twenty minutes kinsey asked her if the diocese was fully behind ellis merrily said the diocese was concerned about the situation so would she be joining in tonights protest not exactly but shed be going along as an observer so the diocese is actually sitting on the fence merrily said personally i dont care too much for witchhunts so you think thats literally what this is i just wouldnt like it to turn into one the reverend ellis has a perfect right well its his job in fact to oppose whatever he considers evil but do you think its evil i havent met the thorogoods i wouldnt on face value condemn paganism any more than id condemn buddhism or islam but i would like everyone else be interested to find out what theyre proposing to do in old hindwell church youd see that potentially as sacrilege the significant point about old hindwell church is that its no longer a functioning church its been decommissioned what about the graveyard though wouldnt relatives of dead people buried there there never were all that many graves because the proximity of the brook caused occasional flooding what graves there were are quite old and only the stones now remain obviously were concerned that those stones should not be tampered with what about the way the village itself has reacted all the candles in the windows how do you feel about that merrily smiled i think they look very pretty what do you think theyre saying well lots of different things probably why dont you knock on a few doors and ask kinsey lowered his microphone nodded to the cameraman it was a wrap out of interest martyn merrily said what did people have to say when you knocked on their doors sod all said kinsey either they didnt answer or they backed off or they politely informed us that mr ellis was doing the talking and in some cases not so politely off the record why is ellis doing this whys he going for these people these socalled pagans you tell me i cant hes not your usual evangelical all praising god and bonhomie hes quiet he chooses his words carefully also he gets on with the locals which is unusual theyre canny round here not what youd call impressionable anyway not my problem you going to be around if we need anything else for the duration merrily said well good luck thanks she ran all the way to the village hall meeting nobody on the way bounding up the steps and praying she wasnt too late because if it was all over well hearsay evidence just wasnt the same at the top she stopped for breath and to assess the man in the porch obviously guarding the closed doors to the hall slumped on a folding chair like a sack of cement he was an unsmiling flatcapped bloke in his fifties she didnt recognize him he didnt quite look at her owre you im fine ok if i just pop in no press thank you father ellis will be out in a while im not press i still cant let you in merrily unwound her scarf he took in the collar his watery eyes swivelling uncertainly youre with father ellis every step of the way merrily said shamelessly he ushered her inside be very quiet he said sternly and closed the doors silently behind her suddenly she was in darkness she waited close to the place where shed stood at mennas funeral service until her eyes adjusted enough to reassure her there was little chance of being spotted here at the end of the hall she stood alone all the window blinds had been pulled down tight and it seemed to have a different layout no longer a theatreintheround whatever was happening was happening in a far corner and all she could see of it was a whitegold aura like over a nativity scene a distant holy grotto and all she could hear was a sobbing hollow slow and even merrily slipped off her shoes carried them to the shelter of a brick pillar about halfway down the hall it was cold no heating on she waited for about half a minute before peering carefully around the pillar the glow had resolved into two tiers of candles the sobbing had softened into a whispery panting merrily could make out several people seemed like women some sitting or kneeling in a circle the others standing behind them all holding candles on small tin or pewter trays like the ones in the windows of the village women only this was why the guy on the door had let her in without too much dispute the scene with its unsteady glow and its umber shadows had a dreamlike period ambience seventeenth or eighteenth century you expected the women to be wearing starched puritan collars in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost elliss voice was lowlevel with that transatlantic lubrication userfriendly and surprisingly warm but only momentarily for then he paused merrily saw him rise up in his white monks robe in the centre of the circle the only man here next to him stood a slender table with a candle on it and a chalice and something else in shadow probably a bible his voice rose too became more distinct the american element now clipped out o god the creator and protector of the human race who hast formed man in thine own image look upon this thy handmaiden who is grievously vexed with the wiles of an unclean spirit whom the old adversary the ancient enemy of the earth encompasses with a horrible dread and blinds the senses of her human understanding with stupor confounds her with terror and harasses her with trembling and fear merrilys feet were cold she bent and slipped on her shoes she wouldnt be getting any closer from here she could see and hear all she needed and she was fairly sure this was a modified version of the roman catholic ritual elliss voice gathered a rolling energy drive away o lord the power of the devil take away his deceitful snares at some signal the women held their candles high wafting out the rich and ancient aroma of melted wax with a glittering flourish elliss arm was thrust up amid the lights behold the cross of the lord behold the cross and flee thou obscene spirits of the night his voice dropped became intense sneering most cunning serpent you shall never again dare to deceive the human race and persecute the holy church cursed dragon we give thee warning in the names of jesus christ and michael in the names of jehovah adonai tetragrammaton merrily stiffened what she leaned further out to watch nick ellis standing amongst all the women brandishing his cross like a sword in the light brandishing words which surely belonged originally to the roman church to jewish mysticism to the candles lowered again to reveal a single woman crouching more like cringing ellis laid the cross on the tall table and bent down to the woman do you embrace god his voice had softened the woman looked up at him like a pet dog you must embrace god he explained gently at first you must embrace god embrace him embrace him his right arm was extended palm raised the loose sleeve of his robe falling back embrace him shadows leaping a short expulsion of breath hoh and a sound of stumbling merrily saw hed pushed the woman away she lay half on her back panting say it ellis roared i embrace him and do you renounce the evil elements of this world which corrupt those things god has created yes she came awkwardly to her feet she was wearing a white shift of some kind possibly a nightdress she must feel very cold do you renounce all sick and sinful desires which draw you away from the love of god she began to cry again her london accent said this had to be greg starkeys wife marianne the sometime sufferer from clinical depression not a nympho in the normal sense but tempted by the dark glamour of the witch robin thorogood was that it was that really the extent of her possession and oh god even if there was a whole lot more this was not right not by any stretch say it her head went back she started to sniff say i so renounce them i s so renounce them and do you therefore wish with all your heart to expel the lewd and maleficent spirit coiling like a foul serpent within you her head was thrown right back as if she expected to be slapped again and again i ask you once more softly do you wish with all your heart yes then lie down father ellis said what merrily moved away from the pillar she could see now that ellis was pointing at a hessian rug laid out on the boarded floor marianne drew an unsteady breath and went to stand on the rug the watching women kept still but she caught a movement from a darkened doorway with a toilets sign over the top and moved back behind her pillar there was a man in that doorway shed swear it ellis said dont be afraid he turned to the table and took up another cross from a white cloth merrily saw it clearly about nine inches long probably goldplated he held it up to the candlelight then lowered it again one of the women leaned forward handed him something involuntarily merrily moved closer the woman held up her candle for ellis merrily saw a yellow tube then an inch of pale jelly was transferred to elliss forefinger she saw him smearing the jelly along the stem of the crucifix what ellis nodded once marianne starkey crumpled to her knees then went into an ungainly squat holding the nightdress up around her thighs be calm now ellis said sit relax the woman sat still ellis raised his eyes from her o god of martyrs god of confessors we lay ourselves before thee he glanced at marianne whispered lie back merrily watched mariannes body subside onto the rough matting her knees up the nightdress slipping back ellis knelt in front of her i ask you again he whispered is it your hearts wish that the unclean spirit might be expelled for ever yes and do you understand that a foul spirit of this nature may effectively be purged only through the portal of its entry yes marianne hesitated then let her head fall back over the edge of the mat and onto the boarded floor with a dull thump she closed her eyes yes ellis began to pray a long rolling mumble slowly becoming intelligible let the impious tempter fly far hence let thy servant be defended by the sign ellis rose and put the cross swiftly on mariannes forehead of thy name he placed the cross against her breast do thou guard her inmost soul merrily thought he wont he cant it isnt possible not with all these women here ellis reared over marianne do thou rule then he bent suddenly her inmost parts marianne gave a low and throaty cry then ellis sprang up kissing the cross tossing it to the table and it was over and women were hugging marianne and merrily was frozen in horror and could no longer see a man in the doorway jewel the converging lanes were filling up with vehicles like last saturday when ellis and the women but not marianne came down the steps they were joined by more people by the time they all reached the road there were about thirty of them with ellis seeming to float in their midst glowingly messianic in his white monks habit the sick bastard merrily turned away found her hands were clenched together shame fury when she could stand to look again she saw that someone was bearing a white wooden crucifix aloft in front of ellis at the apex of the village hall roof the neon cross became a beacon in the rain like it was all a crusade she didnt recognize anyone in elliss group but why should she she guessed they were not locals anyway a couple of the men wore suits but most others were casually but warmly dressed like members of a serious hiking club nobody was speaking shouldnt they be singing some charismatic anthem swaying clapping killing the shakes merrily walked erratically along the lane to the corner where a bunch of reporters stood under umbrellas and gomer was waiting for her in the rain an unlit ciggy drooping from his mouth vicar you all right girl following her behind a range rover parked under some fir trees he regarded her gravely you looks a bit pale dont fuss gomer merrily dropped a cigarette in the process of trying to light it gomer straightened his glasses sorry she touched his arm its me im furious with me thats all happened in there vicar exorcism of sorts i ought to have stopped it i just she thumped her thigh with a fist stood there let it happen hexorcism gomer said bewildered thisd be gregs missus mustve been the bugger hexorcized gregs missus for fancyin a feller for embracing the dark merrily said with unsuppressible venom for letting herself become possessed by most unholy and blasphemous lust load of ole wallop you gonner tell greg perhaps not boy oughter know said gomer whatever it was he nodded towards a man getting into the range rover dr coll he observed the cameramen were backing away down the street ahead of ellis and his entourage dr coll drove away in his range rover leaving merrily and gomer exposed i cant believe i let it happen she said i couldnt believe it was happening i cant tell greg you saw the state he was in hed go after ellis with a baseball bat that bastard ellis walked without looking to either side when a couple of the reporters tried to get a word with him his anoraked minders pressed closer around him the holy man merrily and gomer walked well behind merrily turning things over and over internal ministry it had been called when the phenomenon had first been noted in the north of england mostly it was for supposed incidents of satanic child abuse a number of allegations but not much proven it was a charismatic extreme an evangelical madness the warped and primitive conviction that demonic forces entered through bodily orifices and could only be expelled the same way it had all happened too quickly clinically like a doctor taking a cervical smear the fact that it was also degrading humiliating and as it happened amounted to sexual assault would not be an issue for someone who had convinced himself of it being a legitimate weapon in the war against satan someone invoking the power of the archangel michael against a manufactured dragon when in fact he was the monster got to stop him but if she spoke out there would be a dozen respectable women ready to say she was a liar with a chip on her shoulder about a dozen women who had watched the ritual in silence then afterwards tears and hugs and praise god gomer those women over there who are they gomer identified mrs eleri cobbold the village subpostmistress mrs smith whose cottage theyd passed linda llewellyn who managed a riding stables towards presteigne the others he didnt know mostly from off he reckoned marianne wasnt among them no back way out of the hall is there yes but not without comin down them steps vicar less you wants to squeeze through a fence and lose yourself in the forestry so she was still up there that made sense theyd hardly want to bring her out looking like a road casualty not with tv crews around ellis had reached the car park of the black lion he was evidently about to hold a press conference gomer could you kind of hang around and listen to what he says i need to go back in there all eyes were fixed on ellis as merrily walked inconspicuously back through the rain towards the steps nobody on the door this time inside the hall all the blinds were now raised the chairs were spread out and a plain wooden lectern stood in the centre of the room this time one corner looked very much like another and only a vague smell of wax indicated that anything more contentious than an ad hoc meeting of the community council had taken place no there was something else the atmosphere you often caught in a church after a packed service tiny shivers in the air like dust motes waiting to settle a black coat slung over one of the chairs suggested someone was still around if only a cleaner presently merrily became aware of voices from beyond the door with the toilets sign above it where that solitary man had stood she crossed the hall not caring about the sound of her shoes on the polished floorboards the door opened into an anteroom leading to separate womens and mens lavatories it contained a sink and one of the chairs from the main room marianne sitting in it a woman was bending over her with a moistened paper towel patting her brow marianne didnt react when the door swung shut behind merrily but the other woman looked up at once clear blue eyes unblinking we can manage thank you the voice echoed off the tiles cold white tiles floor to ceiling reminding merrily of the stark bathroom at ledwardine vicarage how is she shes much better thank you had problems at home havent you my love the woman wore jeans and a black and orange rugby shirt she had a lean windroughened face bleakly handsome a face which had long since become insensitive to slaps from the weather and the world a face last seen lit by the lanterns in mennas mausoleum the woman dabbed at mariannes cheek screwed up the paper towel and looked again at merrily in annoyance you want the lavatory is it no id just like a word with marianne when youve finished merrily unwound her scarf merrily watkins hereford diocese oh come to spy on father ellis is it were not stupid we know what the diocese thinks of him marianne looked glassyeyed she didnt care one way or the other and anyway the woman said mrs starkey hasnt been through anything she didnt personally request father ellis doesnt do a soft ministry obviously not practical man who gets results shell be fine if people will let her alone if you want to talk to anybody you can talk to me judith prosser my name councillor prossers wife come outside she gave mariannes shoulder a squeeze then went and held open the door for merrily ushering her out and down the central aisle of the hall past elliss lectern she picked up the black quilted coat from a chair back and they went out through the main doors the rain had stopped at the top of the steps judith prosser didnt turn to look at merrily she leaned on the metal railings and gazed over to the village centre where ellis and his entourage were assembling for the media and was it the diocese sent you to mennas funeral too reverend watkins above old hindwell a hopeless sun was trying vainly to burn a hole in the clouds mist still filigreed the firs on burfa hill but the tower of the old church was clear to the north i didnt think youd recognized me merrily said well of course i recognized you this was the intelligent woman who gomer seemed to admire who did her husbands thinking for him who could sit and watch another woman physically invaded in the name of god for what its worth that was nothing at all to do with the diocese merrily told her id arranged to meet barbara buckingham at her sisters funeral you remember barbara judith prossers head turned slowly until her eyes locked on merrilys had you now she was referred to me by a nurse at hereford hospital after her sister died there i do counselling work in certain areas didnt come to the funeral though did she shes disappeared merrily said she spent some days here and now shes disappeared the police are worried about her safety oh her safety an eyebrow arched under judiths stiff short hair and what are we to assume they mean by that we both know what they mean mrs prosser the sun had given up the struggle was no more than a pale grey circle embossed on the cloud poor barbara judith said merrily did some thinking while she hadnt come up here to discuss barbara and menna as soon as the conversation had been diverted away from ellis himself judith prosser had become instantly more forthcoming barbara told me you used to write to her for many years we were best friends for a time as girls so you know why she left home do you i know it wasnt a hydatid cyst ha good informants you must have what else did they tell you that you were looking out for menna and keeping barbara informed menna was a source of disquiet for barbara especially after their mother died ah judith prosser nodded so thats it she leaned back with her elbows against the railings well let me assure you right now mrs is it mrs let me assure you emphatically that mervyn thomas never touched menna i know that because i warned him myself what would happen to him if he ever did but youd have been just a kid or not much more this was not when menna was a child good heavens merv was never a childmolester hed wait till they filled out ha no there was never anything for barbara to worry about there nothing she could go on living her rich soft english life without a qualm hasnt she been to see you in the past week or so judith sniffed i heard she was around pestering people including you it seems evidently she couldnt face me wasnt it you who told her about mennas stroke i sent her a short note somebody had to but not her husband mrs prosser smiled and nodded let me also tell you mrs watkins that jeffery weal was the best thing that could have happened to menna if you knew her which barbara lest we forget never really did menna was a wispy flimsy little thing insubstantial see like a ghost sheare you all right yes merrily swallowed im fine why was mr weal so good for her if you knew her you would know she would always need someone to direct her life and while he was not the most demonstrative of men he adored her kept her like a jewel in a padded box merrily thought in a private vault anyway judith said i do hope the diocese of hereford is not going to interfere with father ellis he suits this area very well he meets our needs really how many other people has he exorcized judith prosser sighed in exasperation as far as local people are concerned hes giving back the church the authority it used to have time was when we had a village policeman and troublesome youngsters would get a clip around the ear now they have to go up before people like my husband councillor prosser and receive some paltry sentence a conditional discharge or a period of community service if theyre very bad time was when sinners would be dealt with by the church isnt it they werent so ready to reoffend then the way father ellis deals with them judith smiled thinly the way god deals with them he would say isnt it excuse me i must go back and minister to mrs starkey halfway down the steps merrily encountered gomer coming up there were now a lot of things she needed to ask him but behind his glasses gomers eyes were luridly alive its on vicar the march oh hell aye tonight no stoppin the bugger now somebody been over to st michaels and they reckons thorogoods back ent on his own neither merrily felt dejected all she wanted was to get home do some hard thinking ring the bishop to discuss the issue of internal ministry she didnt want to even have to look at nicholas ellis again tonight bunch o cars and vans been arrivin at st michaels since bout half an hour ago one of em had like a big badge on the back cordin to eleri cobbold like a star in a circle pentagram merrily said dully ar said gomer they figured it wasnt the bloody rac hows ellis reacted oh dead serious heavy grim for the cameras man called upon to do gods holy work kind o thing yeah i can imagine but underneath underneath pardon me vicar like a dog with two dicks i dont need this merrily said potion betty left mrs pottingers lodge in weak sunshine wanting nothing more than to collapse in front of that cranky farmhouse stove and pour it all out to robin except that robin would go insane she called for a quick salad at a supermarket cafe on the outskirts of leominster by the time she reached the welsh border it was approaching an early dusk and raining and in her mind she was back in the shop with mrs cobbold and the slender man with the pointed beard oh good morning doctor a sharp day eleri dr coll she needed to tell somebody about dr coll and the hindwell trust she wished it could be robin wished she could trust him not to go shooting his mouth off and have them facing legal action on top of everything else the hindwell trust juliet pottinger had explained was a local charity originally started to assist local youngsters from hardpressed farming families to go on to higher education to become for instance doctors and lawyers so that they might return and serve the local community a local peoples charity juliet pottinger had come to old hindwell because of her husbands job stanley had been much older an archaeologist with the clwydpowys trust who had continued to work parttime after his official retirement he was in fact one of the first people to suspect that the radnor basin had a prehistory as significant as anywhere in wales his parttime job became a fulltime obsession he was overworking he collapsed dr collard banksmorgan was like a small bearded ministering angel mrs pottinger had said wryly whisked poor stanley into the cottage hospital those were the days when anyone could occupy a bed for virtually as long as they wished stanley practically had to discharge himself in the end to get back to his beloved excavation and while stanley was trowelling away at his favoured site a round barrow at harpton dr coll paid mrs p a discreet visit he informed her in absolute confidence that he was more than a little worried about stanleys heart that stanley not to dress up the situation had just had a very lucky escape and he could one day very easily push the enfeebled organ just a little too far oh dont tell him that good heavens dont have him carrying it around like an unexploded bomb said dr coll jovially i shall keep tabs on him myself chuckling he added i believe im developing a latent interest in prehistory dr coll had been discretion itself popping in for a regular chat perhaps to ask stanley the possible significance of some mound he could see from his surgery window or bring him photocopies of articles on victorian excavations from the radnorshire transactions and all the time as he told juliet with a wink he was observing stanleys colour his breathing his general demeanour keeping tabs she thought the mans style was wonderful perfect preventative medicine how different from the city where a gp could barely spare one the time of day and betty was rehearing lizzie wilshire dr colls been marvellous such a caring caring man juliet pottinger had said as much without spelling anything out to their most solicitous solicitor mr weal who was handling their purchase of a small strip of land for a quite ludicrous amount from the prosser brothers how could she possibly repay dr colls kindness oh well said mr weal when pressed there was a certain local charity to which dr coll was particularly attached oh nothing now he wouldnt want that hed be most embarrassed but something to bear in mind for the future perhaps and please dont tell dr coll that hed mentioned this he would hate to alienate a client it was two years later while they were on holiday in scotland a particularly hot summer that stanley exhibiting symptoms of what might be sunstroke or something worse was whisked off by his anxious wife to a local hospital where two doctors were unable to detect a heart problem of any kind stanley died three and a half years ago of what in the days before everything had to be explained would have been simply termed old age said mrs pottinger and did you ever take this misdiagnosis up with dr coll betty was imagining juliet waking up in the night listening for his breathing monitoring his diet being nervous whenever he was driving it must have been awfully worrying i took the cowards way out and persuaded stanley to move somewhere else a bit more convenient i said i was finding the village too claustrophobic which was true by then id discovered that dr coll had well appeared to have created a dependency among several of his patients and all of them as it happened incomers to the area people who might be feeling a little isolated there and would be overjoyed to find such a friendly and concerned local gp making up illnesses for them too i dont know people dont like to talk about certain things people are only too happy to praise their local doctor to boast about what a good and caring gp they have perhaps ours was an isolated case certainly some of them did die quite soon one rather lonely elderly couple childless and reclusive died her voice faded within only months of each other and did they by any chance leave money betty asked her to this the hindwell trust yes i rather believe there was a substantial bequest did you never say anything dont look at me like that mrs pottinger snapped was i supposed to go to the police id have been a laughing stock i believe dr coll even helped out as a police surgeon for some years yes i did when we were about to leave the village suggest to the connellys whod bought a rather rundown smallholding but no it was a waste of time dr coll is a very popular man he has five children he hosts garden parties at his lovely home on the evenjobb road even now i dont necessarily believe what about the solicitor oh mr weal and dr coll go right back fellow pupils at the old hindwell primary school in fact mr weal administers the hindwell trust and its trustees include councillor gareth prosser you see i see oh yes i do see such a caring caring man driving out of the hamlet of kinnerton betty felt a rising panic an inability to cope with this news on her own the radnor valley was all around her a green enigma abruptly she turned into a lane which she already knew of because it led to the four stones she stopped the car on the edge of a field beyond hindwell farm hindwell not old hindwell different somehow placid and open and almost lush in summer she could see the stones through the hedge she loved this place this little circle she and robin must have been here ten or fifteen times already it was still raining but she got out of the car and climbed eagerly over the gate it felt like coming home the four stones were close to the hedge not high but plump and rounded betty went down on her knees and put her arms around one and looked across the open countryside to the jagged middledistant hillside where stood the sentinel church of old radnor she hugged the stone surrendering to the energies of the prehistoric landscape this was the religion and the radnorshire that she understood the rain intensified beating down on her out of a blackening sky betty didnt care she wished the rain would wash her into the stone when she stood up she was pretty well soaked but she felt better stronger and angry bitterly angry at the corruption of this old and sacred place angry at the bloody local people the level to which they appeared to have degenerated she drove to the end of the lane and instead of turning left towards walton and old hindwell headed right towards new radnor against the rain even if the womans bungalow was strewn with copies of the daily mail she would charm lizzie wilshire around to her side she would ask her directly if the hindwell trust was mentioned in her will above all max said pouring himself a glass of red wine we can challenge them intellectually max had this big wildman beard you couldve lost him at a zz top convention but any suggestion of menace vanished as soon as he spoke for max had a voice like a onenote flute he was a lecturer someplace he liked to lecture st michael equates with the irish god mannon of the tuatha de danaan mannon was the sea god and also the mediator between the gods and humankind and the conductor of souls into the otherworld in coptic and cabbalistic texts you will find these roles also attributed to michael therefore every saint michael church is regardless of its origins in essence a pagan celtic temple which is why this reconsecration is absolutely valid normally even coming from max robin would have found this amazing total cosmic vindication right now he really couldnt give a shit because it was close to dark now and still betty had not returned had not even called he walked tensely around the beamed living room which they had taken over stationing candles in the four corners feeding gathered twigs to a feeble fire theyd gotten going in the inglenook where the witchcharm box had been stored when george and vivvie had come down the first weekend betty had stopped them establishing a temple in this room but now in her absence theyd gone right ahead altar to the north some asshole had cleared one of the trestle tables in robins studio and hauled it through now it held the candle pentacle chalice wand scourge bell sword there had to be a power base george said there would be negative stuff coming at them now from all over the country it was about protection george explained and betty would understand that if she was here shed never been away this long before without at least calling him robin imagined the cops arriving solemn and sympathetic and heavy with awful news of a fatal car crash in torrential rain never for robin had a consecration meant less never had a temple seemed so bereft of holiness or atmosphere of any kind shell be back robin a plump middleaged lady called alexandra had picked up on his anxiety shed been bettys college tutor way back had been present at their handfasting her big face was mellow and kind by candlelight if anything had happened to her one of us would surely know sure robin said i just hope shell be happy weve come yeah robin said hoarsely see if shed only called hed have been able to prepare her for this he knew he should have held them off until hed consulted with her but when george had come through on the mobile robin had been already majorly stressed out beleaguered and it hadnt immediately occurred to him that they would have to accommodate a number of these people in the farmhouse with sleeping bags being unrolled in the kitchen and more upstairs and kids too max and bellas kids two daughters and a nineyearold son called hermes robin had already caught the little creep messing with his airbrushes at least they werent gonna sleep in the house the whole family were now camped in the big winnebago out back it had a pentagram in the rear window the same place christians these days liked to display a fish symbol robin went over to the window again looking out vainly for small headlights sometimes suspicion pierced his anxiety he wondered if this whole thing had been in some way planned while george was into practicalities like dowsing and scrying vivvie was essentially political for her robin sometimes thought paganism might just as easily have been marxism and it was vivvie who had accidentally in the heat of the moment let it out on tv he never had entirely trusted vivvie and now they were looking at a serious showdown with some seriously fanatical fundamentalist christians two of the wiccans jonathan and rosa had been down to the village to take a look and had seen a gathering of people around a man in white ellis this confrontation max said must not be allowed to get in the way of the great festival of light but george had grinned george loved trouble what is terrific about this max piped waving his wineglass is that only two deities were directly filched from the old faith by christianity one was michael the other was the triplegoddess brigid who became associated with saint brigid the abbess of kildare who was in all probability herself a pagan worshipping in an oak grove so as we know imbolc is the feast of brigid christianized as candlemas the feast of saint brigid max beamed through his beard in the candlelight there was no particular need for him to go on they all knew this stuff but max was max and already a little smashed therefore it is absolutely fitting that this church should be reconsecrated on that sacred eve in the names of both mannon and brigid with a fire festival which will burn away jesus robin stared out of the window into the uninterrupted night he wondered if betty once away from here had decided never to come back there was a green range rover parked in front of lizzie wilshires bungalow so betty had to leave the car further down the lane under the outer ramparts of the new radnor castle mound and run through the rain it didnt matter now this was the same rain that was still falling on the four stones when she reached the range rover the clear rectangular sign propped in its windscreen made her stop made her turn and walk quickly back to her car the sign said doctor on call she had to think was this a sign that she was supposed to go in there tackle dr coll face to face betty sat in the driving seat thankful for the streaming rain obscuring the windscreen and her face from any passersby she went over it all again in her head dr coll who was here mr weal the solicitor whose home was not so far from st michaels farm and whose wife had recently died so how did mr weal become your solicitor hes simply there he becomes everyones solicitor sooner or later hes reliable its an old family firm and his charges are modest he draw up wills virtually free of charge i bet he does i dont suppose any of this will affect you at all youre too young youll see both of them out it probably wouldnt have affected major wilshire either he was exregiment a fit man with all his wits about him lizzie wilshire bryan had a thing about the medical profession refused to call a doctor unless in dire emergency a great believer in natural medicine was bryan all his wits about him it was unfortunately entirely in character for bryan to attempt such a job alone he thought he was invulnerable a light tapping on the rainstreaming side window made betty jump in her seat she was nervous again and the nerves had brought back the uncertainty she could be getting completely carried away about this she hurriedly wound down the window mrs thorogood betty was unable to suppress a gasp raindrops glistened in the neat pointed beard under his rugged dependable face im sure mrs wilshire wouldnt want you hanging around out here in the rain why dont you come into the house i didnt want to intrude betty said i was going to wait till youd gone nonsense said dr collard banksmorgan as much as anything id very much like to talk to you about the herbal medicine you so generously prepared for mrs wilshire he held open the car door for her he was wearing the same lightcoloured tweed suit a mustardcoloured tie on his head was a tweed hat with fishing flies in it he had an umbrella which he put up and held over her guiding her briskly past his green range rover and up the path to the bungalow for a moment it was almost like an outofbody experience shed experienced that twice knew the sensations and she was watching herself and dr coll entering the porch together as though this was the natural conclusion to a sequence of events shed set in motion when shed decided she had to leave robin at the mercy of the media and seek out juliet pottinger she was now being led into a confrontation with collard banksmorgan in the presence of mrs wilshire bright panic flared she was not ready she didnt know enough but something evidently had taken over fate or something perhaps she was about to be given the proof she needed betty could hardly breathe wont be a jiff dr coll stood in the doorway shaking out his umbrella go through if you like mrs wilshires in the sitting room as usual betty nodded and went through though it was not yet three oclock the weather had made the room dark and gloomy so that the usually feeblelooking flames in the bronzeenamelled oil stove were brazierbright making shadows rise around mrs wilshire in her usual chair facing the fireplace she didnt turn when betty came in im sorry about this mrs wilshire betty said i wasnt going to come over until the doctor had left mrs wilshire still didnt turn round the shadows leapt the force of her own indrawn breath flung betty back into the doorway oh jesus christ not oh mother which she only said still selfconsciously at times of minor crisis her hand went to her mouth oh no there was a small click and wall lights came on cold and milky blue go and look at her if you like said dr coll i think you ought to he walked over to the fireplace stood with an elbow resting on the mantelpiece you arent afraid of death are you mrs thorogood just a preliminary to rebirth isnt that what you people believe betty found she was trembling what happened to her dr coll raised an ironic eyebrow among other things it seems you happened to her betty edged around the sofa keeping some distance between her and the doctor when she reached the window a movement outside made her look out another car had parked next to the range rover a policeman and a policewoman were coming up the path betty spun and saw lizzie wilshire rigid and slightly twisted in her chair with a little froth around her bluing lips and her bulbous eyes popped fully open as if they were lidless dr coll stepped away from the fireplace he was holding up a round brown bottle with a halfinch of liquid in the bottom is this your herbal potion mrs thorogood the adversary from off they were nearly all of them gomer reckoned hed told merrily he could never imagine too many local people sticking their heads above the hedge and he was right there were maybe fifty of them not an enormous turnout under the circumstances and the ones merrily could hear all had english accents two tv crews had stayed for this they were pushing microphones at the marchers as they came to the end of the pavement a line of lamps moving on into the lane past annie smiths place bound for the prosser farm and st michaels telly questions coming at them to get them all fired up but what are you really hoping to achieve here do you actually believe two selfstyled white witches can in some way curse the whole community dont people have the right in the eyes of the law to worship whatever they want to and the answers came back in brummy in northern in cockney london and posh london this is not about the law read your bible in the eyes of god they are profane why are there as many as five churches around the radnor forest dedicated to st michael who was sent to fight satan a woman in a bright yellow waterproof holding up five fingers for the camera there was a central group of hardcore bible freaks this was probably the first demonstration most of them had ever joined merrily thought for quite a number it was probably the first time theyd actually been closely involved with a church it was the isolation factor the need to belong which they never realized theyd experience until they moved to the wild hills and the fact that nicholas ellis was a quietly spoken educated kind of fanatic its true to say a sprightly elderly woman told itv wales that until i attended one of father elliss services i did not truly believe in god as a supernatural being i did not have faith just a kind of wishywashy wishful thinking now i have more than faith i have belief i exult in it i exult i love god and i hate and despise the adversary for a moment merrily was grabbed by a sense of uncertainty that recalled her first experience of tongues in that marquee near warwick whatever you thought about ellis hed brought all these people to god then she thought about his slim metal crucifix ellis himself was answering no questions tonight gliding along half in some other world no expression on his unlined shiny face selfbelief was a great preserving agent hanging back from the march merrily rang to check on jane walking slowly with the phone it was on the radio the kid said that buckingham womans probably dead isnt she not necessarily but if she is you dont think she topped herself do you thats something the police get to decide flower jane made a contemptuous noise the police wont do a thing they dont have the resources the only reason this area has the lowest level of crime in southern britain is because half the crimes dont even get discovered everybody knows that so cynical so young i read the story in the mail totally predictable rightwing stitchup you reckon yeah mum listen the truth ok have you spoken to irene since we were in worcester like him telling you all about me conning him into taking me to livenight by saying you knew all about us going and it would help his career and then like in his role as a welsh chapel fundamentalist bigot asking if you knew how seriously interested i was in alternative spirituality and maybe that what i secretly wanted was to get to know some of those people the pagans and then you both agreeing that this was probably a spiteful teenage reaction against having a mother who was a priestess and into christianity at the sexy end the kid ran out of breath merrily said was this before or after eirion said to me oh god im so sorry this is all my fault what if shes got brain damage and i said no its all my fault i should never have agreed to do the bloody stupid programme was it after that jane said nothing look merrily said after the initial blinding shock of seeing you in the middle of the motorway it didnt take a lot of creative mental energy to form what looked like a complete picture of how you and eirion came to be in the neighbourhood of birmingham anyway complete enough to satisfy me anyway without any kind of tedious acrimonious inquest i mean you know call me smug call me selfdeluded but the fact is when you really look at it im actually not that much older than you flower silence shit jane said at last ok im sorry i know er might that have been the long talk by any chance i think it might phew what time will you be back hard to say only that nurse phoned eileen said whatever time you get back could you ring her she sounded weird weird how just not the usual dont piss me about or ill take your bedpan back voice kind of hesitant unsure of herself ill call her yeah jane said somehow i would if i were you when the procession reached the prosser farm merrily saw two people emerge discreetly from a gate and join it without a word judith prosser and a bulky slabfaced man thats councillor prosser gomer impressive ent he wait till you hears him talk gives whole new meanin to the word oratry not that you dont rate him or anything prince among men said gomer by the time the march reached the track to st michaels farm a police car was crawling behind that figured even good christians these days had short fuses they walked slowly on that reminded me gomer said learned someing about the prossers and this ellis fore i left the lion greg yeard it one o the boys stephen got pulled over in a nicked car in kington joyridin e was bout a year ago thisd be woulder looked real bad for a magistrates boy it happens not yere it dont first offence mind so gareth talks to big weal an they fixes it with the cops gareth an judy promises the boy wont put a foot out o line again just to make sure of it they takes him to the reverend ellis gets him hexorcized merrily stopped in the road im not hearing this the mobile bleeped in her pocket she pulled it out hearing judith prossers words time was when sinners would be dealt with by the church isnt it merrily sophie she hurried back along the lane to a quieter spot is this convenient i tracked down a canon tommy long formerly the priest in charge of st michaels cascob he was more than glad to discuss something which he said had been puzzling him for many years shall i go on please seems that in the late summer of nineteen seventyfive he had a visit from the reverend mr penney a very odd young man he said longhaired beatniktype and most irrational on this occasion who suggested that as cascob was a remote place with no prospect of anything other than a slow and painful decline in its congregation the reverend long might wish to seek its decommissioning by his diocese bloody hell once he realized this was far from a joke the reverend long asked mr penney to explain himself mr penney came out with what was described to me as a lot of nonsensical gobbledegook relating to the layout of churches around radnor forest st michael churches in an effort to deflect it the reverend tommy long pointed out a folk tale implying that if one of the churches were destroyed it would allow the ah dragon to escape mr penney said this was quite the reverse why mr long wasnt prepared at the time to hear him out and now rather wishes he had what happened then nothing mr long pointed out that the church in wales would hardly be likely to part with a building as historic and picturesque as cascob especially as it contains a memorial to william jenkins rees who helped to revive the welsh language in the nineteenth century the reverend mr penney went somewhat sullenly away and some months later committed his bizarre assault on st michaels old hindwell when he went away where did he go does mr long know theres no happy ending here merrily mr long says he was told some years later that terry penney died in a hostel for the homeless in edinburgh or glasgow he isnt sure which the poor man had been a heroin addict for some time i think i shall go home now merrily robin spotted some lights but they were the wrong lights he saw them through the naked trees through the bald hedgerow further along from the barn they were not headlights george came to stand alongside him at the window what do you want to do robin shall we all go out and have a few words with them in a civilized fashion vivvie dumped her glass of red wine and came over excited is it them she had on a long red velvet dress kind of tudorlooking and she wore those seahorse earrings that robin hated the bitch was ready to appear on tv again what i suggest is we what i suggest robin said loudly is we dont do a goddamn thing this is still my house mine and bettys the whole room had gone quiet except for the damp twigs crackling in the hearth im gonna go talk to them robin said george smiled shaking his head youre not the man for this robin you tend to speak before youve thought it out if you dont mind me saying so i do mind george i mind like hell and youre tired alexandra said kindly youre tired and youre upset yeah well damn freaking right im upset ive been accused by that bastard of being a manifestation of insidious evil how upset would you feel thats not what i meant robin backed up against the window gripping the ledge behind him with both hands so im gonna go out there on my own thats really not wise vivvie said appealing to the coven at large max cleared his throat what i would suggest dont you robin threw himself into the room dont any of you tell me whats wise and you he levelled a shaking finger at vivvie if it hadnt been for you and your goddamn big mouth robin george took his arm robin shook him off vivvie said robin ill thank you not to use the expression goddamned shut the fuck up robin saw that it had begun to rain again he saw the lights curling into rivulets on the window he took off his sweater the gate to st michaels farm was shut through the bare trees you could see lights in the house you could see the black hulk of what seemed to be a barn but you could not see the church the itinerant congregation formed a semicircle around nicholas ellis at the gate the two men with garden torches stood either side of the gate a white wooden cross was raised five or six feet long like the one in the bungalow garden on the road from walton merrily felt an isolated plop of rain umbrellas went up bright striped golf umbrellas a cameraman went down on one knee on a patch of grass as if hed found god but it was only to find a low angle to make ellis look more like an old testament prophet disgracefully ellis responded to it a kind of shiver seemed to go through him like invisible lightning and his wide lips went back in a taut grimace my friends can you feel the evil can you feel the evil here in this place and then he was crying to the night sky oh lord god we pray for your help in eradicating this disease you who sent your most glorious warrior michael to contain the dragon the adversary the old enemy oh lord now that this infernal evil has once again returned we pray that you will help us drive out these worshippers of the sun and the moon and the horned gods of darkness oh lord help us we pray help us and the chant was taken up help us help us lord faces were turned up to the rain merrily winced ellis cried you who send your blessed rain to wash away sin let it penetrate and cleanse this bitter earth this soured soil oh lord wash this place clean of satans stain his voice rode the slanting rain his hair pasted to his forehead the hissing torchlight reflected in his eyes until i attended one of father elliss services i did not truly believe in god as a supernatural being now ellis was spinning round in the mud his white robe aswirl and putting his weight against the gate and bellowing come out come out you snivelling servants of the adversary come out and face the sorrow and the wrath of the one true god fucks sake nick ellis sprang back the weary american voice came from the other side of the gate the tv camera lights found a slightly built young guy with long shaggy hair he wore a plain tshirt as white as elliss robe but a good deal less suited to the time of year he was just standing there arms by his side getting soaked when he spoke the tremor in his voice indicated not so much that he was afraid but that he was freezing nick we dont need this shit ok we never touched your lousy church theres no dragon here no satan so just just like go back and tell your god we wont hold you or your crazy stuff against him the man with the cross stood alongside ellis like a sentinel one of the garden torches fizzed flared and went out there was a gasp from the crowd as though the flame had been a casualty of demonic breath to charismatics everything was a sign merrily moved in close to the gate she needed to hear this ellis put on a grim smile for the cameras let us in then robin open the gate of your own free will and let us and almighty god be readmitted to the church of st michael he waited his white habit aglow praise god a mans voice cried robin thorogood didnt move i dont think so nick he was watching ellis through the driving rain and fighting just to keep his eyes open to merrily he looked bewildered as if he was struggling to comprehend the motivation of this man who was now his enemy on a level hed never before experienced he finally hugged himself barearmed his tshirt soaked grey and wrinkled into his chest then defiantly he let his arms fall back to his sides still staring at nick ellis who was now addressing him sorrowfully and reasonably in a low voice which the tv people might not pick up through the splashing of the rain robin you know that we cannot allow this to go on whether you understand it or not and i believe you fully understand it if you and your kind proceed to worship your profane heathen deities in a temple once consecrated in his holy name you commit an act of gross sacrilege you thereby commend this church into the arms of satan himself and you curse the community into which you and your wife were innocently welcomed no robin thorogood shook his sodden hair that is bullshit robin if you dont recognize it i cant help you the big cross was shaking in the air one of the men screamed out thou shalt not suffer a witch to live merrily tensed expecting an invasion when something struck ellis in the chest kali jane agonized for a while cuddling ethel the cat and then rang eirion at what she always pictured as a grim greystone mansion beyond abergavenny the line was engaged she went back to the sitting room still holding the cat and replayed the tape she had recorded of the old hindwell story on the tv news there was a shot of the church from across a river the male voiceover commented the last religious service at old hindwell parish church took place more than thirty years ago tomorrow night however this church could be back in business cut to a shot of a drearylooking street backing onto hills and forestry but the people of this remote village close to the border of england and wales are far from happy because at tomorrow nights service the ancient walls will echo to a different liturgy ancient black and white footage of naked witches around a fire chanting eko eko azarak and to one local minister this is the sound of satan talking head eirion had taught her the jargon of a really ordinarylooking priest except that he was wearing a monks habit the caption read father nicholas ellis rector this nicholas ellis then came out with all this bullshit about there being no such thing as white witchcraft his voice was overlaid with pictures of candles burning in peoples windows seriously weird and then they cut back to ellis saying its out of our hands its in gods hands now we shall do whatever he wants of us over shots of their farmhouse the reporter said that robin and betty betty jesus whoever heard of a witch called betty were in hiding today but a member of their coven had confirmed that the witches sabbath would definitely be going ahead tomorrow at the church to celebrate the coming of the celtic spring the diocese of hereford says it broadly supports father ellis but seems to be distancing itself from any extreme measures then up came mum personally i dont care too much for witchhunts on the whole jane felt deeply relieved she called eirion again this time it rang and she prepared to crawl eirions stepmother gwennan answered a voice to match the house or maybe it just sounded that way because she answered in welsh jane almost expected her to hang up in disgust when she found it was someone who could only speak english but the woman was actually quite pleasant in the end hes in his room on the internet seventeen years old and still playing with the internet how sad is that hold on ill get him ok im sorry jane said when he came on i am so totally sorry everything i said im braindamaged i make wrong connections i dont deserve to live i agree but forget that listen charming are you online yet no i keep telling you mums got the internet at the office in hereford if theres anything i need i look it up there too much surfing damages your i was going to give you a web site to visit eirion sounded different preoccupied like something was really getting to him id like you to see it for yourself then youll know im not making it up why would i think that i mean the web sometimes its like committing yourself into this great massive asylum irene i was checking out pagan web sites trying to find out what i could about ned bain and these other people ok why because im off school and i got fed up with walking the grounds contemplating the infinite and where did it get you to be really honest into places i didnt think existed you start off on the pagan web sites which are fairly innocent or at least they seem innocent afterwards compared with the serious occult sites you get referred to its like youre into a weedingout process and after a while its kind of only totally depraved screwballs need apply you know like you can learn among other things how to effectively curse someone whats the address for that one let me grab a pen jane he sounded serious take my word for it when you actually see it on the screen it suddenly becomes less amusing its like getting into some ancient library where all the corridors stink of mould and mildew all these arcane symbols sounds like dungeons and dragons only for real you start thinking shit suppose i pick up some i dont know virus and periodically you get casually asked to tap in your email address or your name and your home address or maybe just the town and sometimes you almost do it automatically and then you think christ theyll know where to find me wimp no even if you put in a false name they can trace you and they can feed you viruses so anyway i got deeper and deeper and eventually i reached a site called kali three you mean like like the indian goddess of death and destruction that kali eirion paused and that was where i found her found her for some reason jane started thinking about barbara buckingham a shadow crossed the room and she sat up startled it was ethel only ethel jane said who your mum eirion said merrily watkins deliverance consultant to the diocese of hereford uk wha she came up on kali three pretty much immediately there was a picture of her black and white looked like a newspaper mugshot and then inside there was kind of a potted biography date of birth details of the parish in liverpool where she was curate date of her installation as priestincharge at ledwardine herefordshire oh and daughter jane date of birth picture jane said bravely no but theres a picture of your dad what another black and white bit fuzzy like a blowup from a group picture sean barrow date of birth date of death and the place i mean the exact place the flyover the nearest junction and the circumstances all of what gerry said at livenight and more it says sean and merrily were estranged at the time which explains why she afterwards retained the title mrs but switched back to her maiden name it says that she is hang on the print goes a bit funny here yeah that she is still vulnerable something the death of her husband without which she might have found it harder to enter the church jane exploded who are these bastards i dont know there are several names but i dont think theyre real names i think itd take you a long time to find out who they are if you ever could they could be really heavyduty occultists or they could just be students thats the problem with the net you cant trust anything on there a lot of its lies but why what kind of thats what scares me theres a line at the bottom it says the use of the word deliverance is the churchs latest attempt to sanitize exorcism having a woman in the role particularly one who is fairly young and attractive is an attempt to mask what remains a regime of metaphysical oppression this woman should be regarded as an enemy jane felt herself going pale mum and there are all these curious symbols around the bottom like runes or something ive no idea what a rune looks like but it this is the worrying bit it points out that anyone with an interest can see merrily watkins on the livenight television programme and it gives the date and it says that the programme will be coming live from a new midlands studio complex just off the m so thats out of date now but it must have been there before the programme took place obviously and it says that if anyone is interested in further information they can get it from and then theres a sequence of numbers and squiggles which i cant make any sense of but i dont think its another web site more like a code so jane yeah a whisper im sorry i didnt want you to hear it like this because i could be making it up couldnt i to support the stuff you were rubbishing this morning irene what am i going to do i dont know what happened happened to other people its not even a good coincidence i mean who believes in any of this crap you do i dont know whether i do or not and anyway im just a fundamentalist welsh chapel bigot were there any other people mentioned on this web site apart from mum probably i didnt look to be honest what if thered turned out to be a whole bunch of names and biographies of people and they were all recently dead or shit thats how its supposed to work isnt it preying on your mind like suppose there was this big hex thing and people all over the country the world were being invited to like tune in and focus on mum the enemy to put her off because we both know how rubbish she was on that programme i mean she was fine on tv tonight wasnt she kind of cool almost suppose it wasnt just nerves that night suppose there were hundreds thousands of people sending her hate vibes or something and then they all started focusing on that piece of road where dad its horrible its also complete crap jane were just stretching things to fit the facts were playing right into their hands whose hands anybody who frequents the web site including presumably ned bain if he was the one putting it round about your mum that doesnt mean hes behind any of it it just tells us where he got his information its still creepy its meant to be creepy can you tell when it was originally pasted on the site somebody else might be able to but not me for all i know somebody could have pushed it out after the show to make it look i dont know its all crap and it makes me mad irene im going to have to tell her i think you should ill try and find out some more youre wonderful jane said whoops er hows the whiplash well it just kind of hurts when i look over my shoulder jane instinctively looked over hers and shivered and it wasnt an exciting frisson kind of shiver not now this is history a martyr the rain had eased merrily pushed back the dripping hood of her saturated oncewaxed jacket with his chest all splattered perhaps that was what he wanted when the police had gone in shed walked away from it all her first instinct had been to stay on robin thorogoods side of the fence maybe go and talk to him but now the cops were doing that journalists and cameramen were together in another group by the gate at st michaels farm waiting for someone to emerge ellis had been driven away in a white transit van the cross and the torches packed away in the back his followers watched the white vans tail lights disappear along the end of the track talking quietly in groups there was an air of damp anticlimax for just one moment merrily said to gomer i thought coppers thought that too out o their car in a flash it looked like blood shit does in a bad light it really was sheepshit or dogshit more like stuck on a bloody great lump o soil he dint smell too fragrant then likely the real reason hes buggered off so quick whoever threw it that wasnt a great idea thorogood was winning their argument young kiddie it was e had it on the end of a spade seen him come up behind the boy in the tshirt still look good in the press though merrily said glumly on their pictures he will look like a martyr i she glanced over the gate to where two police were still talking to thorogood look out vicar gomer murmured judith prosser was heading over without her gareth she wore a shiny new barbour a matching widebrimmed hat theyve found barbaras car then mrs watkins she spotted gomer ah i see you have your informant with you owre you judy gomer i heard your wife died im sorry things appens gomer said gruffly he shook his head droplets spinning from his cap judith nodded so what about barbara mrs watkins she down there in claerwen reservoir is it well i dont know those reservoirs mrs prosser but i think if barbaras body was in there theyd have found it by now i reckon the answer to that mysterys much more likely to be found here do you indeed dont you you like a mystery do you hows marianne merrily said mrs starkey is quite well wary now i assume those lustful demons can be difficult to extract the caution was suddenly discarded as judith laughed dont you believe all you hear like what all kinds of nonsense gets talked about mrs watkins be silly for you to start passing on rumours isnt it i certainly havent heard anything to upset me she smiled she had good teeth in that case you must have a strong constitution mrs prosser merrily said left to himself robin would have kicked the kids ass hermes nine years old brother of artemis twelve and of ceres six and a half max and bella did not kick hermess ass they were not the asskicking kind they would presumably explain to him later in some detail what effect having tossed shit at the christian priest might have on him karmically no hassle from the cops for hermes either soon as they found out this was a kid and that they didnt get to lean on a grown pagan they didnt hang around soon as the cops had gone the media went off too back to the black lion none of them came to the house robin peeled off his sodden tshirt towelled himself dry stood in front of the cheery fire with a bath towel around his shoulders theyll be back tomorrow night george said with a good lashing of relish when were in the church and this time therell be hundreds of them its going to get really really interesting man robin said did she call betty er no that cars old robin vivvie said maybe its just broken down i listened to the weather forecast george said the rains likely to have passed by morning itll get colder but tomorrow looks like being dry so well have all day to prepare the site robin shivered under the towel you guys dont get it do you this is not gonna happen without betty if betty doesnt come back no imbolc youre tired man george said she will come back vivvie promised with intensity she wont want to miss this her eyes glowed imbolc the glimmering of spring this really is the start of an era this is history like max was saying while you were outside its going to be the biggest thing since the reformation but whereas that was just henry viii plundering the riches of the catholic church this is about the disintegration and decay of pride and vanity and the regrowth of something pure and organic in the ruins this is so beautifully symbolic i want to cry well ill tell you robin said im starting not to give a shit you dont mean that you did a terrific job tonight i most likely looked a complete asshole i just wasnt gonna cringe in front of that creep in his monks robes was all i was gonna look as white as he was and maybe less pretentious he wasnt gonna go out there swinging a gold pentacle hed wanted to handle the confrontation with simple human dignity because what hed really hoped for was that betty would be out there watching that shed gotten home ok but had been unable to come through the gate on account of the march so was out there watching her tactless thoughtless irresponsible husband handling a difficult situation with some kind of basic human dignity and then fucking hermes had blown it all away if you were looking for omens you sure had one there what kind of headlines were they gonna get tomorrow witches hurl shit at man of god the perfect followthrough to robin looking like a freaking cannibal that last time robin the motherly alexandra smiled a tentatively radiant candlelight smile at him across the room sorry robin theres a small car just come into the yard huh he shot to the window the bath towel dropping to the flags he shaded his eyes with his cupped hands up against the glass hardly daring to hope that hed see a little white subaru justy oh god oh god robin sagged over the big wide window sill staring down between his hands and working on his breathing until he no longer felt faint with relief he straightened up look would you mind all staying here i have to do some explaining the black lion was packed the air in the bar full of damp and steam coming off journalists tv people even a few of the christian marchers all wet through starved in need of a stiff whisky greg was run off his feet no sign of marianne yet gomer fetched merrily a single malt and one for himself there was nowhere to sit except in a tight corner by the window next to the main door whenever the door opened they had to lean to one side but at least they werent overheard as merrily told gomer the plain truth about mariannes exorcism gomer didnt blink he weighed it up nodding slowly he laid out a row of beer mats on the table and with them merrilys dilemma gotter be a problem for you this girl question of which side youre on now ennit yes merrily lit a cigarette shed taken off her wet coat but still had the scarf wound round her neck she was still seeing robin thorogood there on his own vastly outnumbered not wearing anything witchy not countering elliss talk of satan and sacrilege with any pagan propaganda it could have been an act to appear ordinary in the face of all the crosswaving and yet it was too ordinary to be feigned what you gonner do then vicar gomer how could judith prosser and those other women sit there and watch it can they really believe in him to that extent gomer took out a rollup like i said its about stickin together solid elliss helped the right people ennit judy and gareth with their boy and who knows what else he done oh my god vicar merrily drank the rest of her whisky in a gulp menna she murmured menna robin turned on the bulkhead lamp it was no longer raining but the wind had gotten up a metal door creaked rhythmically over in the barn it sounded like a sailing boat on the sea making him wish he and betty were alone together far out on some distant ocean still naked to the waist he stood on the doorstep and watched her park next to one of the winnebagos she stepped out of the car and into a puddle the whole of the yard was puddles tonight she didnt seem to care how wet her feet got her hair was frizzed out by the rain uncombed oh god how he loved this woman he tried to send this out to her i take thee to my hand my heart and my spirit at the setting of the sun and the rising of the stars he saw her standing for a moment entirely still taking in the extra cars in the yard the two winnebagos then she saw him he came out of the doorway walked towards her she still didnt move if it was cold out here he wasnt feeling it yet bets i he stopped a couple of yards from his wife the back of his neck felt on fire bets i couldnt stop them it was either them or or all kinds of people we didnt know it had all gotten out you just couldnt imagine it was all over the internet we were getting hate faxes and also faxes from people who were right behind us like religious polarization you know over the whole nation or so so it seemed betty spoke at last in this real flat voice who are they well there theres george and vivvie and and alexandra and stuart and mona osman who we met at some at some sabbat someplace and max and bella uh max is kind of an allknowing asshole but theyre ok where it matters i guess and some other people bets im sorry if youd only called there was no expression at all on her face this was what scared him why didnt she just lose her temper call him a stupid dickhead get this over see we always said there was gonna be a sabbat at imbolc didnt we say that that we were gonna bring the church alive with lights a big bonfire to welcome the spring so like maybe this was destined to come about maybe there was nothing we could do to get in the way of it like its meant to be only with more significance than we could ever have imagined why did this all sound so hollow why was she taking a step back away from him there was a splish in a puddle her car keys shed dropped the car keys robin rushed forward plunged his hand and half his arm into the puddle scrabbling about in the black freezing water babbling on still look ellis was here with his bornagain buddies chances are theyre gonna be back tomorrow only more of them there was like this real heavy sense of menace you and me we couldntve handled that on our own believe me he hated himself for this blatant lie but what could he say he pulled out the dripping keys hung on to them betty said give me the keys robin why no i cant stay here tonight please you dont know bets its gotten bigger than us two ok thats a cliche but its true whats happening heres gonna be symbolic a voice said from behind him he turned and saw vivvie on the step vivvie had come out to help him vivvie alone the worst thing that couldve happened symbolic of the whole struggle to free this country from two millennia of religious corruption and spiritual stagnation hes right betty we have to play our part we have to reconsecrate the church and it has to be tomorrow night its why were here betty started to shake her head and the light from the bulkhead caught one side of her face and robin saw the dark smudges saw shed been crying hard bets he almost screamed look i know things havent been right i know you never connected with this place honey please once this is over well sell up yeah i mean like jeez from what ive been hearing theres gotta be about a hundred pagans ready to take it off our hands but this imbolc this is something we have to go through together yeah please let it be together give me those keys i will not let you leave you will not stop me betty said and she certainly wont she turned away walked across the yard toward the track robin ran after her managed four paces before the cold suddenly intense bit into his chest and his breathing seemed to seize up but that was nothing to the pain right dead centre of his heart chakra his eyes flooded up dont follow me betty said i mean it dont take one more pace the atheist youre back home eileen cullens relief was apparent even over hospital corridor echo and clattering trays merrily switched on the engine turned the heater up all the way and shook a cigarette into her lap im in my car on a pub car park in old hindwell and wet and cold youre still out there oh hey one of the porters saw you on the box tonight said he fancied the hell out of you listen youve heard about buckingham the car in the reservoir it doesnt mean shes dead eileen its scary merrily civilized woman like that if she wanted to do away with herself why not a bottle of scotch and a handful of pills i still cant believe she has aye well sometimes you cullen hesitated sometimes theres things you just dont want to believe no matter what what are the alternatives after all its suicide face it and dont you go feeling guilty theres nothing you couldve done how can you say that because reverend thats the official motto of the national health service listen will you be in town tomorrow probably not tomorrow i need to talk to you are we not talking now what i want to talk about you dont on the phone well you dont at all if youve got any sense i could come and see you at your home eileen jane was right cullen hard as a hospital potato had never sounded less assured truth is ive not been frank with you merrily or with meself come to that theres things i ought tove said she dropped her voice to just above a whisper about the night menna weal died and i cant talk here im on the public phone youve got an office havent you its open house in there so it is anyway i wont talk in this place and i dont get off now until the morning youve got my home number so call me when you can eileen dont do not hang up lets just talk about menna ok the stroke could have been brought on by stress right severe emotional stress hypertension due to emotional trauma distended arteries then a clot gets shunted into the brain what kind of trauma you thinking about exorcism merrily said oh terrific cullen said drably the expulsion of an evil entity intended expulsion i know what it is i was raised a catholic but excuse me reverend would not someone in your job be seeing it everywhere you bloody look just bear with me ok you get some ministers of an evangelical or charismatic persuasion who believe that demonic forces and angelic forces come to that are all around us in all kinds of guises like there are probably a few in california whod offer to exorcize me in order to expel the demon nicotine you mean eejits so heres poor menna withdrawn maladjusted maybe communication problems ok i wont go into details but theres good reason to think she was abused by her dad is that a fact said cullen whod heard it all many times before probably over a long period but not necessarily when she was a kid so you could be talking about more of an unnatural relationship if she was as naive and immature as ive been told i think were still talking about abuse merrily lit another cigarette and gathered her thoughts staring out along the village street from here she could count candles in nine separate windows the street lighting was so meagre and widely spaced that some of the candles seemed disproportionately bright through the rainblobbed windscreen and unintentionally jolly like christmas lights she just wanted to air this stuff to another woman i dont want to speculate too much about the state of the weal marriage but it seems likely the obsessive love there was fairly onesided and weal must have realized that that the father was still very much in the background even though dead you mean weals thinking he might be having a happier time altogether if he can remove whatever emotional blocks been left behind in menna by her having a sex beast for a father i doubt the concept of happiness means much to him but yeah and he wouldnt have her seeing a psychiatrist or a therapist because thats not the kind of thing youre seen to do in old hindwell so after a lot of agonizing and soulsearching perhaps he goes to the priest who you says not your regular kind of priest yeah mmm at the funeral ellis disclosed that weal and menna were baptized together not long before she died i think that means she was exorcized historically baptisms always been linked with exorcism in the medieval church it was more or less believed that until it was baptized a baby was the property of the devil and if it died before baptism it would be consigned to the fires of hell no offence to you personally cullen said but how i hate the church so suppose weal believed that having menna rebaptized into the faith would free her from the influence of her father from the effects of her childhood and suppose the ceremony conducted in the privacy of their home involved well something considerably more stressful than a sprinkling of holy water and i mean more stressful then sure you could be into stroke country thats what i thought and cullen hesitated as youve mentioned baptism the anointing of the forehead with water if we cast our minds back to a certain wee side ward mmm i always thought any anointing of a corpse was down to the priest me too long silence possession is nine points of the law merrily said that was what barbara buckingham said possession cullen said possession of the dead by the living was how she put it ostensibly meaning the private tomb but i think there were other things she wasnt prepared to put into words maybe even to herself ah merrily pretty much like you really why dont you just tell me the rest cullen said this is a pressure job you know you get overtired so you do and imagine things thats true like like things you dont believe in did something happen when you went down to the morgue cullen sighed maybe he went along with you which is not usual not only that he sent the porters away he asked could he spend some time with her say his goodbyes how long a clear hour to cut a long story short they sent for me in the end to exercise my fabled diplomacy on the man when i get down there im delighted to see hes finally leaving has on his hat and coat a big dark solicitors overcoat like hes on his way to court i didnt approach him but i thought it was as well to follow him to make quite sure he left the premises so i did that i followed him cullen broke off there was the sound of someone calling from a distance then cullen said two minutes josie all right bloody hell merrily said dont stop now ach normal way of things you wouldnt get this out of me with thumbscrews all right weal goes out by one of the back doors near the consultants car park you can get across the yard there to the temporary visitors car park its the quickest way if you dont mind there being no lights which i wish to god there hadve been then i couldve said it was a reflection merrily revved the engine to blow more heat into the volvo i could still say it was cullen said defiantly i can say any damn thing i want to as im an atheist i do not believe in god i do not believe in angels or demons and you dont believe what you saw a lot of people say that thats ok feel free to be patronizing reverend ive woken up about seven times in the night since then gets into me fockin dreams the way you get a virus in your computer and everything freezes on you i know oh you know everything so you do im sorry im standing in the doorway just the other side of the big plastic doors and im watching him walk across to the visitors car park which is all but empty now nobody about but him and this jesus merrilys eyes turned this way and that determinedly counting nine candles in nine windows banishing all wildly flickering thoughts of the old rectory garden while cullen kept her waiting until at last over the sound of footsteps in the hospital corridor and a woman squealing she whispered just a hovering thing you know like a light not a bright light more kind of greyish half there and half not thats as best as i can tell you you could see it and then you couldnt but you knew you bloody knew i went very cold merrily very cold you know mmm and him oh he knew it was there all right i swear to god he knew it was there twice he looked back over his shoulder i aw hell i cant believe im saying this out loud it made me go cold you know i do know merrily said night hag gomer was standing up at the bar with greg starkey talking to him between other customers buying drinks greg glanced at merrily through bloodshot eyes trying to keep his voice muted not succeeding im on eggshells trying to run a boozer while shes up inna bedroom sitting on the edge of the bed staring into space if i put a hand on her its like ive hit her you know like she got no skin thats what it does to them is it a blessing a blessing how much did she tell you about it merrily asked not a lot i fought it was all gonna be praise the lord and that i was geared up for that woulda been better than the battered wife routine whos that bastard fink he is thinks hes st michael merrily said soberly greg do you think shed talk to me i just told gomer ill put it to her soons i get a minute which could be closing time how long you got as long as it takes ill do what i can yes sir carlsberg is that merrily beckoned gomer back to the cold place nobody else wanted near the door she told him what shed discussed with eileen cullen about the reasons they figured jw weal might have wanted menna cleansed gomer said shrewdly you reckon barbara thomas knew about the baptism its possible isnt it the steamy light pooled in gomers glasses likely what barbara thomas found out got her killed then ennit good god gomer gomer sniffed reckoned id say it fore you did mind your back vicar a young woman had come in alone she stood on the mat shaking back wild corncoloured hair that somehow looked not only out of place in old hindwell but out of season she drew a breath scanned the crowd in the bar and then walked through until theres a body merrily said she hasnt been killed until theres a body she isnt dead who you got lined up for it then big weal isself shhhh gomer looked around unconcerned he ent yere ok merrily whispered considered objectively it seems ridiculous i mean if barbara found out weal arranged to have his wife exorcized by ellis as some kind of primitive pyschological therapy well he might not want that out in the open but its only slightly dirty washing and it is christianity of a sort its no reason to kill somebody and would he really expect to get away with it in a place like this gomer threw up his hands place like this nowhere bloody easier vicar local people protects local people might keep any number o secrets from each other but if they gets a threat from off theyll close in real tight till its over and gone they thought jw weal had done it theyd be happy to shovel shit over his tracks ennit the other thing that struck me merrily said is that the doctor who kept prescribing all that oestrogen that sent mennas blood pressure up dr coll eh now theres a respected man if menna did develop dangerously high blood pressure furred arteries serious danger of fatal clotting why didnt he warn her why wasnt he monitoring her if she was on the pill for i dont know twenty years or more gomer said what you wanner do is you wanner talk to judy proper though none o this circlin round each other talk to her straight tonight as well as mrs starkey busy ole night you got lined up there ok tomorrow she pulled out her cigarettes and then put them back i dont know why im doing this why am i doing this gomer because ang about gomer turned towards the bar merrily saw greg starkey frantically beckoning them over i think the boy wants you gomer said greg opened the solid wooden gate in one side of the bar to allow merrily and gomer through just walks in like noffinks happened asks for a room for the night well ive only got two rooms ain i and theyve both gone to reporters i cant turn her away but what if the wife comes out nursing her bible and finds the bleedin spawn of satan under a blanket on the settee gomer merrily said just dont call me vicar in front of her ok greg led them into the wellfitted kitchen with the tomatored aga a woman stood next to it gripping the chromium guard rail as though she was on the deck of a small boat in a gale the night hag couldnt be more than late twenties pleated skirt dark sweater ski jacket all that blond hair this is my friend greg said wiv the accommodation merrily watkins merrily watched the young womans eyes no recognition at all clearly not a livenight viewer not even that particularly relevant edition ok shed said to greg in a snap decision just tell her im someone with a big house who does b and b sometimes b and b sanctuary what a vicarage was for good samaritan the good samaritan who went to the aid of someone from a different culture a different ethos its only for one night betty thorogood was saying probably and this is gomer parry greg said owre you gomer flashed the wildman grin gotter be a problem for you this girl question of which side youre on now ennit part four when people experience the outpouring of the holy spirit and the reality and presence of god in their lives they also become more aware of the power of evil deliverance ed michael perry the christian deliverance study group the real thing merrily flashed her headlights twice and then pulled out to the end of the car park and waited for the young woman to come over funny how things turns out ennit gomer said mildly from the back seat you think this is a terrible mistake bit late to worry bout that vicar the blonde came warily out of the short alley leading to the black lions yard and got into the volvo merrily eased the car into the main street glancing into her wing mirror nobody was following them just put my mind at rest betty thorogood said youre really not from the media are you im really not merrily felt deeply uneasy about this now but at the same time curiously elated she drove carefully along the village street past all the little candles glowing brightly actually betty its much worse than that she was getting uncomfortable anyway driving with the scarf on jane had called eirion back im getting obsessed about this the more you think about it the more things occur to you then stop thinking about it go to bed id just lie awake getting spooked i keep thinking how keen they were to get mum on that programme all those calls from tania why would they go to all that trouble for just one person whos not very controversial nice legs nice face tabloid television but they told bain about her or somebody did well beforehand so theyd have plenty of time to prime kali three i doubt anyone at livenights even heard of kali the web site or the goddess when youre putting a programme together you must make all kinds of deals to get people to come on i dont really think were looking at any kind of big conspiracy its just the way things turned out however what just i hit on another site its called witchfinder its for people who want to contact a coven wherever you are in britain itll put you in touch with your nearest group email addresses mainly any around here loads well two but thats not the point from witchfinder i clicked on another site which was a kind of pagan whos who the which witch guide very good for somebody with brain damage its because of the brain damage normally im serious and pedantic i got it to search for ned bain turned up a surprising amount i assume its true but anybody can put anything on the net unflattering stuff not particularly biographical stuff mainly hes a writer and publisher now in charge of dolmen books the new age imprint at harveycalder been married twice high priest of top peoples coven in chelsea a champagne pagan thats what he gets called shampagan i wouldnt say that since hes been into it a long time since he was at university and possibly before but whats really significant is that we suddenly have an explanation of why he hates the church so much he never said that jane said crossly he insisted his lot were an alternative to christianity he didnt say anything about well its pretty obvious when you read about his background his father was an academic a professor of english literature at oxford and also a fairly acclaimed poet though ive never heard of him edward bainbridge bainbridge thats also neds real name his father died back in the midseventies he was i wish you could see this stuff i dont want you to think im jumping to the wrong conclusions just tell me its just that his father was stabbed to death jane gripped the phone ned bains father was murdered its complicated spill it no hang on a sec she pulled the phone from her ear sound of a car in the drive mums here ill call you back if not tonight first thing tomorrow ill go back online eirion said see what else i can discover before midnight anorak dont lie there getting spooked jane think of me think of my strong body in your dreams welshman the headlights exposed ethel trickling across the lawn a black cat witchfriendly crossing the beam of the sensor which then activated the lantern on the porch spraying light up the yearold black and white facade of ledwardine vicarage merrily switched off the engine how would nicholas ellis react if he could see her giving sanctuary to the spawn of satan a child of the dragon a worshipper of profane heathen deities filth scum spiritual vermin how come to that would the bishop react the pagansll have you down as a jackboot fascist while ellis is calling you a pinko hippy doing the tango with satan the elation was long over merrilys head was choked with contradictions the twentyfiveminute journey through deserted country lanes had been at best awkward their conversation sparse and stilted it was evident that there was far more wrong in the life of betty thorogood than nicholas ellis and the daily mail but very little had come out what was she supposed to say to this woman trust me im a priest gomer sensing the tension opened his side door how bout you gives me your key vicar i could put the ole kettle on and explain a few things to young jane first if shes still up brilliant gomer could be uncannily perceptive they watched him let himself into the vicarage when he opened the door a light came on in the hall i promise i wont be sick as i walk in betty thorogood said drily merrily leaned her head on the back of her seat is it that obvious i can tell youre having second thoughts being psychic im not psychic that way at the first sight of the dog collar betty thorogood had not screamed or hurled herself at the passenger door this was not a hammer film this was not livenight im sorry merrily said it was a stupid remark aye well nearly as stupid as mine about being sick something tiredness probably had brought out a northern accent yorkshire look i realize what you did was a spurofthemoment thing you couldnt have known id walk into that pub merrily said what actually brought you there couldnt go back home mirthless laugh place was full of witches the porch light went out merrily could no longer see bettys face also betty said tonelessly into the darkness id just been virtually accused of murder despite livenight jane still always thought of them as darkhaired darkcomplexioned celtic but this was an english rose and a wild rose at that she had a subdued energy about her or maybe that was just a subjective thing because thanks to gomer jane knew wow this is betty mum had said casually shes staying the night this is my daughter jane brew some tea flower well be down in a few minutes under normal circumstances this would have been an ultracool moment a significant chapter in the liberalization of the anglican church but the chances that the thorogood woman was not involved with ned bain were pretty remote pagans stuck together so clearly mum could have invited in more than she knew we keep a room fairly ready she was saying its not very grand but the bedding should be aired anything please betty thorogood said jane forgot about the tea followed them upstairs the blonde it had to be admitted did not look like a threat instead she looked done in by now most people whod never been here before would be commenting on the atmosphere and the obvious antiquity of the place the twisting black beams the bulging walls the tilted ceilings this woman might have been climbing the stairwell of a concrete apartment block mum said if you need a change of clothes im sure we can sort something out im a bit on the stunted side but janes got a lot of stuff from the days when you were supposed to buy everything a couple of sizes too big the selfstyled witch and mum were standing on the landing near the second staircase leading to janes apartment bathrooms that one mum indicated the one door that was slightly ajar its bleak and cold and horrible but one day when we get the money she broke off from six stairs down jane witnessed this clearly betty thorogood quivered for just an instant before tossing back her mass of hair and almost absently shaking out a word apples mum froze jane saw her eyes grow watchful mum said im sorry as though she hadnt heard which of course she had she and jane both had and they knew what it meant for a moment the air up here seemed almost too thick to breathe im sorry betty said i just you know sorry jane marched up four steps you had a feeling of apples mum frowned jane what kind of apples i betty shook her head again as if to clear it her hair tumbling i suppose not apples as much as blossom white like soft snow oh wow jane breathed im sorry betty said it just came out mum bit her lip jane said and we thought wil had gone mum started flinging lights on betty if you want to just check out your room betty thorogood nodded and followed her she wasnt getting away that easily wil was our ghost jane called after them wil williams vicar of this parish found dead in the orchard behind the church in sixteen seventy hanging from an apple tree when the blossom was out im sorry betty thorogood said again its a problem i have wow jane said in serious awe nobody knew about the apple blossom not even kali three youre the real thing arent you witches dont cry the kid brought them tea at the kitchen table and then started filling the kitchen with the seductive scent of toast it was tenthirty as far as jane was concerned betty thorogood had proved herself merrily had stopped agonizing about this stuff where sensitives were concerned seeking the cold earthly rational explanation could be wastefully timeconsuming life was too short to question it too hard it just was it would have been less impressive in bettys case if she hadnt in other respects appeared defeated demoralized broken as though shed looked into her own future and seen black water is wil still here demanded jane galvanized knowing nothing about the death of the elderly woman mrs wilshire i mean as a spirit not just an imprint i dont know betty said sometimes its hard to qualify what i feel i just get images sometimes fragments incomplete messages the apple blossom last year when theyd first moved in merrily had been sensing an old distress locked into the upper storeys of the vicarage the timeless dementia of trapped emotions jane under the influence of miss lucy devenish folklorist and mystic claimed to have actually smelled the blossom felt it on her face like warm snow it was this undismissable haunting and the churchs general disinterest which had prodded merrily in the general direction of deliverance there needed to be someone around to reassure people that they werent necessarily losing their minds jane was saying were you like sensitive before you became a witch betty looked uncomfortable its why i became one if you exclude spiritualism wiccas one of the few refuges for people who are that way my parents are c of e which doesnt encourage that kind of thing an apologetic glance at merrily who also caught a triumphant glance from jane little cow before she went greedily back into the interrogation but like who do you actually worship thats probably the wrong word we recognize the male and female principles and they can take several forms most of it comes down to fertility in the widest sense we dont need more people in the world but we do need expanded consciousness and you like draw down the moon the kid showing off her knowledge of witch jargon invoke the goddess into yourself kind of betty was reticent solemn in the subdued light of the big creamwalled kitchen maybe having a vicar in the same room was an inhibiting factor but this woman was certainly not livenight material merrily sat down at the table and listened as betty pressured by jane began explaining how shed actually got into wicca at teacher training college before dropping out to work for a herbalist how shed saved up to go with a friend to an international pagan conference in new england where she met the american robin thorogood making a film with some old art school friends so robin had found betty first and then wicca in that order bettys face momentarily shone at the memory her green eyes were clear as rock pools she must literally have bewitched robin thorogood the phone rang jane dropped the cheese grater and carried the cordless into a corner you have a disciple merrily said softly kids only find wicca exotic because its forbidden when it becomes a regular part of religious education theyll find it just as boring as anything else dont feel you have to talk it down on my account merrily betty pushed back her hair there doesnt need to be conflict theres actually a lot of common ground spiritual people of any kind have more in common than they do with total nonbelievers in the end we want the same things most of us dont we maybe jane said loudly no im sorry shes not here i was kind of expecting her back but in her job you cant count on anything sometimes she spends like whole nights battling with crazed demonic entities and then she comes home and sleeps for two days its like shes in a coma really disturbing sure no problem bye flower merrily said you do realize that little exercise in whimsy might be lost in the transition to cold print in the independent merrily nodded so just dont say it to the daily star she went over to switch on the answering machine when she came back betty was saying in shrewsbury we were members of a coven containing quite a few pagan activists i suppose youd have to call them teachers mainly theyre good people in their way but theyd be more use on the council theyre looking for organized religion for structure these are the people whove moved in on your house merrily asked her some of them its what i wanted to come down here and get away from you dont have to work in a coven the only structures im really interested in now are the ones you build for yourself but robin will go along with anybody im afraid why dont you phone him i will i just dont want to speak to any of the others we came down here to work alone at least i did robin just wanted to live somewhere inspiring and to show it off to his friends hed tell you we were sent here because of a series of omens all that was irrelevant to me interesting what was slowly becoming apparent to merrily was that betty had come to old hindwell in a state of personal spiritual crisis shed been drawn into witchcraft by the need to understand the psychic experiences shed been having from an early age but maybe paganism hadnt come up with the answers shed sought omens merrily brought out her cigarettes to janes evident disgust betty accepted one estate agent particulars arriving out of the blue that kind of thing when robin saw the church he was hooked just like major wilshire tell me about mrs wilshire again merrily said the police had questioned betty for almost an hour at mrs wilshires bungalow a detective constable had arrived who probably had never had a suspicious death to himself before id no idea she suffered angina betty had told them i just concocted something harmless for her arthritis no she could not imagine why mrs wilshire would stop taking the trinitrin tablets prescribed for her angina a full unopened bottle of which had been discovered by dr banksmorgan no she would never in a million years have advised mrs wilshire to stop taking them she had only suggested a possible windingdown of the steroids if and when the herbal remedy had any appreciable effects on the arthritis she told me dr coll knew all about me and he was very much in favour of complementary medicines for some complaints you know thats not true mrs thorogood the cid man had said dr banksmorgan says he has no respect at all for alternative medicines and he makes this clear to all his patients it got worse if mrs wilshire was not becoming unduly influenced by mrs thorogood and her witchremedies why would she tell dr banksmorgan he neednt bother coming to visit her again betty could not believe for one minute that mrs wilshire had told her caring caring gp not to come back but she knew which of them was going to be believed what a bastard jane said hes trying to fit you up where did they leave things merrily said the police i mean they said they might be in touch again they probably wont be theres nothing they can prove betty said do you believe me course we do jane said merrily from what little i know of dr coll i wouldnt trust him too far gomer gomer thought about it smarmy little bugger dr coll always persuading folk to ave tests and things for their own good like but its just sos he can pick up cash from the big drug companies thats what greta reckons then ill tell you the rest betty said and she told them about mrs juliet pottinger and what shed said about the hindwell trust ent never yeard of it gomer said when shed finished merrily didnt find that too surprising if the trust was administered by jw weal lot of incomers is retired folk gomer confirmed like young greg says they comes out yere in the summer thinks how nice it all looks and theyre amazed at how low house prices is compared to where they comes from so they sells up buys a crappy ole cottage moves out yere gets ill fair game like poor bloody handreared pheasants gomer said merrily asked betty is it your feeling mrs wilshires left money to the hindwell trust betty nodded this stinks merrily said works both ways see said gomer patient needs their will sortin mabbe some poor ole biddy goin a bit soft in the head and dr coll recommends a good lawyer local man trust him with your life big weal turns up youre some little ole lady you ent gonner argue too much sides which its easy for a lawyer to tamper with a will ennit get the doctor to witness it all local people eh betty explained why shed gone to see mrs pottinger in the first place talking about that particular atmosphere shed perceived in the old church but hesitating before finally describing the image of a stricken and desperate man in what might have been a stained cassock wow said jane merrily tried not to react too obviously but she was becoming increasingly interested in the reverend terence penney what year was this again seventyfive betty said he seems to have been turning into a latent hippy gomer looked up loads o hippies round yere you could get an ole cottage no electric for a few undred back then see and nobody asked no questions more drugs in radnor them days than youd find the whole o birmingham but you never actually ran into penney yourself merrily lit another cigarette no but i been thinkin of danny thomas that boy knew all the hippies see most locals they didnt have nothin to do with em but danny e was right in there up in court for growin cannabis the whole bit you want me to get danny on the phone its a bit late merrily suggested boy dont keep normal farmin hours gomer said danny thomas had now turned down the music in dannys barn there were speaker cabinets the size of wardrobes all covered with chicken shit gomer also recalled an intercom on the wall bawling down it at danny when he was wanted on the phone was how most folk reckoned gretas voice had reached airraid siren level it must be cold tonight out in dannys barn but danny would jump around a lot to the music before collapsing into the hay with a joint gomer pictured him sitting on a bale straggly grey hair down the back of his donkey jacket with jimi at his feet midwaless only deaf sheepdog gomer sat on the edge of the vicars desk and waited while greta had summoned danny back to the farmhouse whats goin down gomer my man you become a private eye is it every bugger i meet these days they just been grilled by gomer parry all right listen to me boy gomer said give your ole drugraddled memory a rattle on the subject of terry penney a few seconds of quiet bit of a rarity around danny unless hed had a puff or two poor bugger he says at last come to a sad end what i yeard i liked ole terry you go to is church dint like him that much but he was all right he lent me his dylan albums this to do with that bugger ellis tricky bastard he is blew poor ole grets mind gets em all in a bloody trance whyd he do it danny whyd penney fill up the ole brook with good pews dope ennit ar well thats what they all says dont mean bugger all danny went quiet again what you know about penney danny what you know about penney you ent sayin long while back gomer terrys dead let the poor bugger lie cant its that vicar o yours ennit diggin the dirt we needs to know boy gimme a day or so to think about it cant cmon danny whos it gonner harm me dannys voice went thin im as guilty as any bugger gomer it was me got terry into it well me and coll dr coll me and dr coll danny says and the bloody era that promised us the earth and here we all are nigh on forty year later and further in the shit stay there gomer said dont move when betty thorogood started to cry it turned everything around until now talking about a world she knew shed been cool and assured the otherworldly visions and gods and archetypes did not scare her any more than neuroses scared a psychologist in the everyday world implicated in the death of a harmless widow betty came apart i just wanted to help her i was sorry for her thats all there was to it jane had moved her chair back appalled witches dont cry merrily leaned across the table put a hand over bettys betty parted her hair peered at merrily through her tears what if their tests show up something nasty in that potion i gave her something i didnt put there what are they going to find henbane deadly nightshade rat poison he doesnt need all that hes got natural causes apparently hastened by her overreliance on you i just dont understand why she would stop taking the pills hed prescribed she thought he was wonderful she thought bettys eyes filled up again she thought everyone was wonderful everyone who tried to help her the local people were so good because she was from off anyone local who didnt actually spit on her front step seemed wonderful and caring i was so sorry for her and dying there in her chair in front of that lukewarm fire perhaps he is telling the truth perhaps poor fuddled mrs wilshire thought my little herbal remedy bottled under the moon was some sort of cureall theres an experienced nurse i know merrily said perhaps ill give her a call she stopped as gomer returned his glasses shone like twin torchbulbs come and talk to danny vicar key to the kingdom as danny talked the picture formed for merrily in ragged fluttering colours radnor forest in the s and s hippy paradise the flower children had wandered in from off and settled in this border country in their hundreds because it was cheap and remote they rented or even bought halfruined cottages far from the roads thin boys in yellow trousers chopping wood from the hedges beautiful longhaired girls in anklelength medieval dresses fetching water from the well in spite of the electricity supply being at best intermittent they brought the new music why the incredible string band even lived for a while near llandegley towards the northwestern end of the forest and the dope the hippies also brought the dope the local people were amused rather than hostile the hippies didnt do any damage and they were always a talking point and for some like danny thomas dreamy faraway farmers boy this was what theyd been waiting for all their lives when it was really happening danny was good and ready he figured he mustve been born a hippy growing up on elvis then the beatles popping purple hearts to groove all night and still be awake in time to milk the cows merrily smiled and then cannabis danny had acquired his first joint at a dance in llandod with another to smoke in the top field after sunset he did a bit of dealing for a while but he was never much good at that and besides there was a much more reliable dealer emerging in the area better just to grow the stuff nice sheltered spot in bryncot dingle and then give it away danny was so excited by the dawning of this incredible new world that by the summer of he was wanting to turn on the whole forest who was this more reliable dealer merrily asked can i take a guess danny was talking freely now his voice hoarse but liquid like wet ash dr coll had been the son of a surgeon at hereford hospital with a house in new radnor still a medical student back then in need of a few quid like all your students medical students always got their sources ennit danny said he was a hippy too lord no dr coll ent never been a hippy not even as a boy just a feller with a eye to a few quid course when he qualified as a doctor that all come to an end gotter keep is nose clean or at least keep it lookin clean and there would have been better ways of making money by then merrily thought what about terry penney when did he appear from what betty had learned from mrs pottinger and from what sophie had passed on to merrily penney had emerged as a bright boy but impressionable and not too welloff but what danny was saying produced a different picture terry was an uppermiddleclass radical with a posh wealthy girlfriend who everyone thought was his wife until she found life in radnor seriously lacking and went back to the smoke leaving the vicar of old hindwell to grow his hair and smoke dope with the likes of danny thomas terry like danny was finding the times lifeenhancing and lifechanging but terry also saw it from a religious perspective drugs opening the doors of perception the gates of the soul terry was a fan of the seventeenthcentury poet thomas traherne who had found secrets of the universe in herefordshire meadows the dope had certainly elevated and coloured terrys faith in god today perhaps hed be all happyclappy and singingintongues like ellis and perhaps the drugs would have represented a passing phase but it was a neverending inner journey then terry and danny would smoke dope untroubled by the law and danny discovered that he loved the whole world and terry loved the world and god terry believed that the time was coming when all mankind would be herbally awakened to the splendour of the lord then dr coll brought the acid along merrily nodded acid had been something different not just another drug but the key to serious religious experience a direct line to god to aldous huxley timothy leary all those guys lsd was the light on the road to damascus and anyone could get there so one fine warm day terry penney and danny thomas and dr coll had found a shady corner of a radnor valley field overlooking the four stones they had their lumps of sugar and dr coll brought out the lysergic acid an experiment he said he wouldnt take any himself hed supervise make sure they came to no harm dannys trip lasted for ever under the perfumed satin sky he went through whole lifetimes in one afternoon he found that the radnor valley was in his blood really in his blood the whole landscape turning to liquid and jetting through his veins when he looked at the inside of his wrist he could see through the skin and into that fastflowing land he was the land he was the valley he was the forest he walked through the silken grass down to the four stones which he now understood to hold the mind of the valley and dr coll said afterwards he had to stop danny beating his head on the prehistoric stones to get inside them because the stones knew the secret the reverend penney meanwhile came to believe hed been granted access to the very kingdom of heaven he saw an angel a giant angel with his feet astride the valley merrily imagined a great william blake angel with the red sun in his wings and a raised sword which cleaved the hills life was never going to be the same again for either terry or danny danny was still tripping when he got home to the farm and he walked down the yard and saw the depth of sorrow in the eyes of the beautiful pigs and realized how much he loved those pigs to this day danny thomas said he wouldnt see a pig ever killed he and terry took four more trips together terry told danny that he knew now that he had seen the archangel michael who had been appointed to guard the forest and the radnor valley because this was a great doorway through which you could enter the kingdom terry found a book by the reverend parryjones whod been vicar at llanfihangel rhydithon back in the twenties and he too thought the forest was special but he also mentioned a dragon that you could hear breathing in the night and terry said this was no surprise because places of great spiritual power were equally attractive to devilish forces terry considered it no accident that he had been brought here now at this time of spiritual awakening to be the priest of one of st michaels churches he had told danny he was going to call a meeting of all the other st michael clergy around the forest because they were destined to work together but this never happened because the other ministers had all heard about terry penney still terry insisted he was being groomed by god for the big task every day before dawn hed kneel before his altar in old hindwell church and beg god and st michael that his mission might be revealed to him but god held out on him terry decided he was not yet worthy did not yet know enough was not yet pure enough he stopped smoking cannabis and concentrated on reading the book of revelation a hundred times he wrote out important verses from it on sheets of white card and hung them around his room at the old rectory his sermons became impenetrably apocalyptic he began to research st michael and the lives of those saints and mystics who had become obsessed by the warrior archangel he made solemn pilgrimages to all the st michael churches around radnor forest approaching each from the direction of the last walking the final mile barefoot after a days fasting local people was startin to go off him in a big way danny said local people dont like it when their vicar gets talked about in other parishes terry penney had walked barefoot across the bridge to the church of st michael cefnllys an awesome setting where an entire medieval town had been laid out under its castle then terry had hiked unshod across the bleak penybont common to llanfihangel rhydithon next hed come down from the forest to the yews encircling the rebuilt roadside church at llanfihangel nant melan and finally hed tramped on callused feet along the sombre narrow road to cascob where hed stood before the old abracadabra charm it was three weeks after this that terry had that visit from councillor prosser wondering why he hadnt applied for a grant towards the upkeep of the old building two weeks later terry trashed the church what had happened danny said was that one night terry came to the conclusion that god wanted him to go alone into st michaels old hindwell and open himself to revelation in fact drop some acid danny had obtained the lsd for terry from dr coll the price had gone up by then acid being in demand but terry didnt care in fact the idea of the priest taking a trip in his own parish church bothered danny more than terry for starters he wouldnt ave nobody with him dr coll was back home at the time but terry wouldnt ave him to supervise nor me had to be just him an god see terry reckoned nothin bad was gonner happen to him in the house of god but me i wouldntve gone in there alone at night in a million year with or without drugs creepy ole place like that bad trip had a bad one meself few months later danny said kept gettin flashbacks for bloody weeks scared the shit out o me anyway the next time i seen terry the boy was a mess hadnt shaved dint smell too good smelt of fear you know yes i dont know what appened to terry penney that night i just sits in yere hammering buggery out o the ole les paul and i remembers the good times you must have asked him about it terry dint wanner talk about it at all vicar kept isself to isself and then they finds bits o church floatin down the brook and terrys gone i used to wonder whether the boy seen the carvings on the wood screen come alive or whether he seen i dunno the dragon merrily said he seen st michael out in that field mabbe e seen the dragon in is own church merrily recalled the william blake print in nick elliss war room the great red dragon and the woman clothed with the sun relating to an image from revelation about the dragon waiting for the woman to give birth so that it could devour the child the dragon was said to have seven heads and ten horns it was not a nice dragon and blakes painting throbbed with a transcendent evil i dont know how much of this ellis knows merrily said telling them as they sat around the kitchen table but it would account for a lot if he believes penney had a black vision of the dragon inside that church satan rising or in his view paganism rising and if we believe what he told me about being the subject of some kind of hate campaign forecasting a return of the dragon poisonpen letters for months and phone calls cackling voices in the night recently had a jagged scratch removed from my car bonnet series of chevrons like a dragons back then to him betty you and robin are the embodiment of something that already exists in those ruins on a metaphysical level its not true though betty said we didnt know anything about penney we didnt even know for certain that the church had been built on an ancient site until wed bought it how do you know that now well after we learned about all the prehistoric archaeology in the area it seemed like it was on the cards also this probably wont cut much ice with you a friend of ours went round with a dowsing rod and pendulum jane do we have an ordnance survey map handy brilliant jane leapt up mr penney came out with what was described to me as a lot of nonsensical gobbledegook relating to the layout of churches around radnor forest betty said that robin had tried to work out a pattern on the map but they had been aware of only three st michael churches at the time ok jane had returned with the map spread it out on the table youll have to help me out here gomer wheres cascob gomer found it after a bit of peering he also found st michaels cefnllys then llanfihangel rhydithon and llanfihangel nant melan jane encircled them along with old hindwell ruins of five now jane drew a ring round the last one and they do go right around the forest betty was silently contemplating the map its too big this she said at last you wouldnt have anything smaller scale only a road map jane bounced up again ill get it and some paper betty said neither cascob nor cefnllys was marked on the road map but she put circles on the approximate spots and pushed the map and the paper and a pencil towards betty betty copied the pattern onto the paper its not perfect but its there its a fivepointed star merrily said a pentagram she looked at betty can you explain betty swallowed could i have another cigarette merrily lit it for her betty was now looking uncertain perhaps worried if these churches were built to form not a circle but a fivepointed star that would represent a defensive thing ok the pentagrams a powerful protective symbol its used in banishing rituals like if youre faced with an evil entity and you draw a big pentagram in the air it ought to go away so the medieval christians might have wanted to enclose radnor forest in a giant pentagram of st michael churches for the purpose of containing the dragon or whatever the dragon represented for them its hardly a perfect pentagram merrily pointed out it could be purely coincidental but then she thought in elliss ministry nothing is coincidental theres another connection here betty said with cascob the word abracadabra is used in a charm an exorcism which was found buried in the churchyard the word abracadabra has become devalued because of all those stage conjurors using it but its actually very very old and very powerful and its believed to represent the pentagram because it contains the letter a five times and if you put the as together betty pulled janes pencil and paper across and drew cool jane said actually its not betty said soberly the defensive white magic pentagram has the point at the top what youve just found on the map is an inverted pentagram she put down the pencil and looked at merrily i dont think i need to explain what that means no merrily pulled out a cigarette probably not jane looked mystified you mean its like an aggressive thing betty said it tended to be used in black magic see the horns even pagans accept that horns are not invariably a good sign look i went to cascob the other day that exorcisms displayed on the wall in a frame it dates back to about seventeen hundred and was used to purge a woman called elizabeth loyd of evil spirits and alleged assaults of the devil i got a bad feeling from it in what way betty looked embarrassed you mean the exorcism itself i dont know my first thought was that elizabeth loyd was just some poor epileptic or schizophrenic girl who somebody decided must be possessed then i got the feeling that maybe she did have something satanic inside her i dont know the wording was a mixture of roman catholic and pagan and cabbalistic references oh a combination of religion and magic therefore i suppose what really scared me was that the words were so very similar to the ones used in a charm that was found in a box concealed in an old fireplace at our house and that one was dated over a century later nothing had changed nothing had changed nothing changes merrily tried to focus there was something very important here you found this charm no it was delivered to us the box was placed on our doorstep just after we moved in it spooked us quite a bit because it was a charm against witchcraft it seemed to be saying we know what you are and we know how to deal with you there was a note with it signed the local people nasty jane murmured the wording of this exorcism merrily said do you remember how it went it invoked god and the trinity it said it would deliver elizabeth loyd from all witchcraft and spirits and hardness of heart it had roman catholic stuff kind of ave maria and it used these cabbalistic names of power tetragrammaton the mighty name of god did it really that means something i dont know ok something else cascob apparently penney approached the then vicar or rector of cascob and suggested he get his church decommissioned he talked about the st michael churches around radnor forest the vicar reminded him of a folk tale implying that if one of those churches were destroyed it would allow the dragon to escape right penney said it was quite the reverse wow jane said like the reverse pentagram i dont get it nor me merrily stared at the irregular star of churches whether the churches were intended to be a circle and just happened to fall into this rather vague star shape or whether its all complete coincidence and when you think about it if you turn the map upside down its not inverted any more is it wrong jane cried because pagans always work to the north right betty their altars are northfacing the two prongs the horns are pointing north merrily nodded with reluctance yeah ok i think its at least fair to say that penney became convinced this was bad news if his lsd experience and in those days the feeling was that this wasnt just another drug if his experience convinced him that the unfortunate layout of the churches invited the old serpent to slither in then that would explain why he was so determined to destroy the pattern by taking out one of the churches i wonder how much of this ellis knows betty said possibly quite a lot merrily thought she was considering the distinctly medieval aspects of elliss unnecessary exorcism of marianne starkey she dreamed through most of that night it seemed in colour deep velvet purples and wild slashing yellows abstract images and then the church at old hindwell vibrating blue against a pink evening sky whiteclad ellis and his followers walking like pilgrims through the woods with their bibles and bottles of holy water to exorcize the pagan place by night betty in a robe of pale mauve jesus christ screaming on the cross fire sizzling yellow fire in the kindling the robe shrivelled and blackened bettys golden hair alight at the foot of the cross marianne starkey in a torn white nightdress bloodflecked out of a dream full of savage heat merrily awoke into the cold the sizzling became the metallic rattle of night hail on the bedroom window merrily wrapped herself in the toothin duvet and prayed for the blue and the gold but they wouldnt come the kindling in the forest it was dawn max led robin out through his own house through the mingled aromas of incense and marijuana out through the kitchen past the rayburn on which sat the remains of a pot of fragrant stew tended last night by alexandra past sleeping people in sleeping bags robin as if sleepwalking his mind disconnected he followed max across the cold yard in between the oily pools past the barn five cars as well as the winnebagos parked in front of it now including the subaru justy there was an intermittent sleet i thought it was meant to be cold and sharp and fine give it time said max in fact the sky was not so dark there was a curdledmilk moon under thin cloud and a pale muddy glow in the east it was february and the blackest night of celtic winter was supposed to be over the fuck it was over robin stared for the first time with resentment at the church big and bare the tower was lamp black the sky in the north and west was burnt umber robin had spent the night in his studio but had hardly slept he hadnt shaved for two days he didnt want to be here any more not without betty without betty there could be no light a short while ago hed been aroused from a miserable doze by a tapping on the door and there was big beardy fluteyvoiced max and he said oh robin im sorry to disturb you so early but we have to discuss tonight max how many ways can i say this if there was no tonight i would not be awfully gutted max was nodding solemnly the asshole i understand i do understand robin i would give anything to have betty back but if she has a problem with all this its perhaps as well she stays away and she probably knows that oh thats what you think is it betty had to be someplace close she couldnt have gone far unless shed called for a cab and then where back to shrewsbury back to her parents in yorkshire whod barely spoken to her since she gave up her career for the craft maybe she was staying with the widow wilshire hed thought she would at leastve phoned hed had the phone and the answering machine in his studio all night but all he heard were good wishes from supporters he didnt know threats from enemies he didnt know offers from media people even one call from some private tv production company suggesting the thorogoods might like to discuss the possibility of a docusoap series about the daytoday lives of witches what did these guys think their average day was like for chrissakes they had breakfast in their ceremonial robes went down to the shops hand in hand skyclad then sang the witches rune together in the tub before having tantric sex in front of an open fire max was bleating on would have been a problem with numbers but as usually happens when something is meant its been solved solved robin said vaguely i want you to come and meet someone a tilley lamp stood on one of the old tombstones in what had been the chancel about where the christian altar was originally located presumably the reverend penney had hurled the altar in the creek with the rest of the stuff or had he baulked at that when max and robin walked into the nave george webster was saying to someone yeah i see your point the problem is this whole building being christian is oriented on the east we can either go with that or we can just pretend the building isnt here at all and work with the site geophysically you know what i mean so which do you think george a mans voice smooth youre the geomancer i think theres got to be a compromise somewhere no the man said firmly oh no no compromise we either use their altar and change the current or we build our own to the north and work as you say with the site ah ned max sounded like a hesitant owl ive brought robin thorogood ned bain pagan publisher kingwitch in all but title came out into the lamplight robin had never seen him before his face looked white in the gaseous tilley light but it was strong and lean and kind of genial his hair was tight and curly he had on a dark suit with a dark shirt underneath kind of priesty like church priesty hi he gripped robins arm hello i do like your name it evokes robin goodfellow the hobgoblin is it your given name sure someones prescience and i very much like your work well uh thanks despite the temperature robins arm felt warm all the way to the shoulder even after bain let it go this place inspires you i guess it should do its an important site its an axis bains voice was one peg down from smooth and refined maybe a tad camp but not enough to deter the ladies robin guessed he felt faintly uncomfortable about the heat in his arm listen robin im grateful for what youre doing i know this has got to be a strain i mean physically psychically domestically uh yeah domestically sure but i cant tell you how important it is mate bain was standing on the tombstone next to the lamp casual on someones grave his eyes found robins couldnt see those eyes but theyd found him and they held him this is our religion we are the religion of the british isles all these church sites are our sites right uh ive been kind of out of it you just drive over here or were you here last night no i was in a hotel last night i think you were already crowded enough werent you i drove over this morning i wanted to watch the sun rise here and to see the place in the dark im sorry i shouldve asked your permission uh no thats max said the point is we have to get this right old hindwells a crucial test case and if were seen to back down before this man ellis itll set the craft back years decades even robin glanced at george george was looking up over the walls of the nave towards the moon robin guessed george had told ned bain all about betty walking out and robin coming to pieces hed been set up for a pep talk trouble was it was working bain had magnetism even in the dark maybe especially in the dark also he had a certain instant gravitas when max talked you thought bullshit but if ned laid something on you you were inclined to accept its importance youve done imbolc before of course robin sure it is very appropriate ned picked up the tilley lamp by its wire handle he looked like a modern cleanshaven christ out of holman hunts the light of the world its the first fire festival of the year the kindling in the forest of winter like the winter of christianity well perceived bain said very softly robin felt stupidly flattered it is the winter of christianity and neds devised a rite reflecting that george said didnt take many modifications which shows how essentially right it is ned bain raised the lamp so that there was a core of light in the centre of what had been the chancel for instance when we chant thus we banish winter thus we welcome spring well be banishing rather more than winter or in this case a spiritual winter which has lasted two thousand years and well be welcoming into this temple a new light stronger than any one spring right robin said the lamp sputtered around ned as he lowered it shadows grouped and divided again what im saying robin is that for the duration of our rite old hindwell will be the centre of everything robin was awed no longer reluctantly george said shell be sorry she missed out on this betty yeah cant you get her back man shes the priestess for this shes got more george opened his hands like he was letting out a cloud of smoke than any of us i was very much looking forward to meeting her ned bain said word gets around well uh robin looked down into the dark around his feet i guess the pressure got too much is all things havent been going so very right for either of us yes i heard about blackmore robin looked up hes an awkward sod ned shrugged but personally you know i liked that design you did a lot i mean well i still think kirk could be persuaded to listen to reason for robin the volatile light seemed to leap up the walls even at this stage the central motifs there isnt it well sure i i could have all seven covers robins heart raced i mean i could have them completed inside a month well you know i cant make any promises except to talk to him but we go back quite a long way there you are man george said ned talks to this blackmore you talk to betty robin breathed out ruefully my part is not gonna be easy do your best ned bain clapped robin on the back that heat again bonding were going to need all the psychic energy we can produce robin was elated the electricity of fate after the blackest night the last night of winter his personal lowest point for years this guy just shows up without warning and things start coming together holism interconnection the central premise in wicca there was some kind of psychic energy here today all right the kindling in the dark forest robins inner vision projected it onto the church walls like the airbrush mist around lord madoc he could see it all coming together like a beautiful painting betty would inevitably be drawn back it was how these things worked imbolc it would be their rebirth too robin tried to conceal some of his delight he mustnt look naive well he grinned i guess the whole thing would be easier if ellis and his flock like if he just gave up and left us alone george glanced at ned bain ned bain smiled broadly shaking his head george felt it was safe to laugh max said i dont think you quite get this do you robin this is the energy the surrounding hostility the negativity from the village all helps to create a rather special kind of tension what you have is the whole struggle in microcosm with those fanatical fundamentalist christians the other side of the gate singing their simplistic hymns throwing everything at us everything theyve got left friction man george webster rubbed his hands together and then did that smoke thing the combustion its a fire festival the dragon rises raising the stakes christ be with me christ within me christ behind me christ before me in the notquitesilence of ledwardine parish church amid dusty skitterings at mouse and bat and earlybird level merrily was kneeling near the top of the chancel steps asking for clarity of mind clearance of all nightmares murmuring the ancient celtic prayer st patricks breastplate i bind unto myself the name the strong name of the trinity today was candlemas known to pagans as imbolc it concerned the quickening of life in mother natures belly the catholic church blessed its candles on this day the church of nicholas ellis kept them in its windows to ward off witchcraft when the breastplate was around her merrily went and sat in the front pew she was wearing jeans and a sweater and janes duffel coat she was still recalling details of elliss exorcism of marianne starkey cursed dragon we give thee warning in the names of jesus christ and michael in the names of jehovah adonai tetragrammaton in the halflight she was granted clarity what became clear was that ellis was following a tradition of exorcism accepted there on the border for many centuries betty had written out for her what she could remember of the charm found in the fireplace at st michaels farmhouse and also the one in cascob church a mongrel exorcism a cunning cocktail of catholicism anglicanism paganism and ritual magic precisely what you would expect to find in an area where cultures and languages and religions overlapped and survival often depended on juggling in the dark this litany of names of power and magical repetition was a blunt instrument a club merrily imagined elizabeth loyd three hundred years ago kneeling cowed and emptied on the stone flags of st michaels cascob when you found an adversary or an obstacle you demonized it and then powered by the sacred names you beat it into the stones hard practical tested over centuries father ellis doesnt do a soft ministry its hardly jeffery weal is it barbara buckingham had said of elliss happyclappy evangelism hardly but happyclappy was only the surface of it happyclappy could unite the population ensnaring the hearts and minds of local and incomer alike but under the surface as judith had said ellis suited the village a quiet evangelist neither ebullient nor charismatic in the popular sense but practical dressed like an army chaplain and he could when required to put the fear of god into people the councillors boy who took a car threatening to bring dishonour to his respected family the kid with a pocketful of ecstasy the repressed solicitor who only wanted his love for his wife to be reciprocated the bored and lascivious licensees wife who sooner or later might tempt a local man ellis had earned his support by dealing with ripples on the normally dark and stagnant waters of old hindwell while focusing beyond them on some bigger darker more nebulous objective in the village hall he had been rooting out some imagined petty demon of desire but also through marianne attacking robin thorogood and what he represented but what did he represent the thorogoods had made no threats taken no particular stance betty even appeared unsure that witchcraft was the right and only way for her yet ellis had lost no time in demonizing them gotter be a problem for you this girl question of which side youre on now ennit merrily stood and approached the altar the stainedglass windows were coming alive with the dawn she spoke the last verse of the breastplate the address to jesus let me not run from the love that you offer but hold me safe from the forces of evil on each of my dyings shed your light and your love keep calling me until that day comes when with your saints i may praise you for ever amen merrily walked blinking out of the church it was going to be a cold bright hard day when she got home jane had breakfast ready the radio was turned to live the news station mum theyve just trailed a report from old hindwell its coming up within the next ten minutes that was about five minutes ago better turn it up then and jane cleared her throat theres some stuff i need to tell you any chance it could wait its just i seem to have got more to think about than at any time since my a levels no jane said it cant wait its about a web site called kali three kali as in the goddess of death and destruction not one of ours merrily helped herself to a slice of toast she was thinking about how best to approach marianne starkey marianne was crucial now if merrily was going to restrain ellis not even one of bettys are you listening sure sorry theres this obscure web site a really heavy occult thing a kind of like a hit list of people who are considered a threat to the er to like the expansion of human consciousness through magic that kind of thing anyway youre included on it youre kidding still shows i mustve got something right jane said sometimes you just make me sick you know that merrily put down her toast jane any other time i might be mildly affronted to think a bunch of loonies had put out a fatwa on me on the internet but right now hold on turn it up jane angrily turned up the radio far too loud a woman said remote welsh border village of old hindwell where the local rector has declared holy war on a community of witches occupying a onetime parish church in old hindwell is our reporter tim francis tim whats happening there well not too much at the moment melissa but i suspect this is merely the calm before the storm because tonight is when the witches are proposing to actually reconsecrate this former christian church to their own gods tonight is in fact the pagan festival known as imbolc i think i pronounced that right which is apparently the first really important witches sabbath of the year gosh that sounds rather sinister well apparently it commemorates the start of the celtic spring which is not terribly sinister however what is seen by the rector nick ellis as a provocative gesture is the witches intention to celebrate that festival tonight inside the former st michaels church which in effect will make it into a pagan temple again and are they going to dance in the nude tim god said jane this woman is so sad i would say that is um a strong possibility now last night we saw the new owner of the church robin thorogood clearly trying to calm down the situation when he confronted nick ellis here at the entrance to his farm also leading to the church clip of robin thorogood over rain we never touched your lousy church theres no dragon here no satan so just just like go back and tell your god we wont hold you or your crazy stuff against him tim said however melissa last nights placatory attitude was to be shortlived we believe about a dozen witches are now residing at the farm here and their leader the latest to arrive is a former official of the british pagan federation and an outspoken proponent of pagan religion thats ned bain jane gasped who joins me now ned bain the impression we all get is that youre raising the stakes here the very fact that you a leading pagan activist have come all the way from london i think tim that the stakes have already been raised enormously by nicholas ellis hes a driven man a fanatic whos made life hell for two people who just wanted to be left alone to practise their religion in a christian church in an abandoned church built on a site of ancient worship nicholas ellis made the preposterous suggestion last night that he and his cronies should be allowed access to the site to carry out what amounts to an exorcism well lets not forget this land now belongs to betty and robin thorogood theyve been faced with an army of militant christians whove promised to turn up in even greater numbers were here to support the thorogoods and youll be welcoming the celtic spring with them tonight indeed at the church itself at a site of established ancient sanctity and how many of you will be involved in that a full coven thirteen members melissa said from the studio ned you going to be dancing in the nude we shall probably be skyclad yes unless the weather is particularly inclement youll be freezing melissa our beliefs will keep us warm well rather you than me thank you ned bain and tim francis and well keep you up to date with whatever happens now here on live jane switched off when she turned round her face had darkened theyre not taking any of it seriously vicars and witches what did you expect how can you sit there and because im used to it its a secular society and weve become a quaint anachronism of course theyre not taking it seriously unfortunately they would do soon if it came out that the police had interviewed betty regarding mrs wilshire jane pulled out a chair and sat down directly opposite merrily you have got to listen to me do you understand im listening ned bain hes a smooth operator a clever man it goes deeper up in the gallery at livenight we found the researcher already knew all about you and dad and how dad died and where it happened and everything and he told irene he got that information from ned bain and its all there on the kali three web site with suggestions that you should be regarded as an enemy like by pagans and occultists everywhere how do you know all that the kid had her full attention now because irene spoke to gerry the researcher afterwards about your dad they had all that for an awful moment she was back in that stifling oppressive studio drymouthed with bain lazily watching her through what appeared for just a moment to be seans eyes everything jane confirmed and earlier that man smiling seans pained isnt it all so tedious smile all of it following a seanhaunted drive up the m and then when returning home on that same stretch of motorway on the way back what we figured it means jane said is that people all over the world were probably sending you ill will at that point down their computers dont try and laugh it off you were crap on telly thanks maybe that wasnt all your fault you know theres a lot of really heavy people out there they knew your weaknesses your guilt trip about dad and the church thats silly and now ned bains in old hindwell ok not good two religious fanatics facing each other across the ruins of a church that was spiritually suspect both sides raising the stakes betty thorogood came down wearing a sloppy old baseball sweater of janes she declined an egg but accepted toast and honey shed heard the radio report from upstairs she said she was going back to st michaels i dont want that church reconsecrating not in anybodys name im not forecasting some apocalypse scenario i just dont want it to happen im stopping it youve got thirteen people to persuade all determined to celebrate candlemas they can bloody well do it somewhere else betty said flatly merrily brought coffee tell me exactly what happens at candlemas its the festival of brigid the triple goddess three stages of womanhood jane translated maiden mother hag imbolc means belly its about mother earth giving birth to spring so in wicca we put the emphasis on the mother three women are involved in the rite but the mother wears the crown of lights thats a headdress of candles this is a festival of light and new awakening of all the sabbats its probably the one closest to christianity id guess merrily nodded normally it would be an especially good time to consecrate a church or temple simply because its coming out of a long period of darkness reawakening to spring everything perfect then merrily said neutrally for giving back old hindwell to the old gods no everythings utterly wrong take it from me if there were good omens before it all reversed when we moved in ive become snappy and irritable and alienated from robin weve hardly even you know touched each other since we arrived and even regarding money robin had the possibility almost the certainty of a very lucrative contract to do seven book covers for kirk blackmore the fantasy writer wow jane said i used to read his stuff when i was a kid and then the rug seems to have been pulled blackmores decided he doesnt like robins concept and its blackmore calls the shots thats just the latest thing to go wrong jane said maybe you need the new light betty shook her head there wont be any we wont bring that place out of the darkness itll suck us in she looked vaguely around from face to face whatever you may think about this ive called out to the goddess in the night and the goddess wont come to me im not being emotional or hysterical about this i just dont see a good future ok so you go back merrily said and you try to stop it how do you do that betty shrugged if necessary i can just tell them all to get out itll cause another row with robin but the house is half mine thats only a last resort if i play along for a while something subtler might occur i dont want to create negative vibrations if possible what about you im going to have to try and cool ellis one or two ideas occur well one anyway merrilys throat was dry from too much smoking not enough sleep maybe we can meet somewhere late afternoon and see where we stand theres a footbridge betty said that leads from the church to the other side of the brook i know it four oclock part of her was saying this was whimsy that the only really important things were to first find barbara buckingham and second persuade the police to investigate the hindwell trust betty what do you think seriously is likely to happen if we cant stop this tonight betty shook her head quickly noncommittally the dragon gets out jane said whatever that means ive been thinking betty looked at merrily the problem with this place is nothing really to do with us but it is to do with you i suspect with what you do ellis thought it needed exorcizing im not sure he was wrong but not by him no betty said not by him you mean by me merrily felt obscurely honoured and immediately guilty about that i wondered about tonight betty said candlemas is candlemas i suppose its a good time wherever you stand i mean id go in with you if you thought that would help or if you thought that would be spiritually wrong id stay out of the way i dont know would you think about it merrily its become kind of central to everything hasnt it but exorcizing a church like you keep saying jane said it isnt a church any more all right ill talk to the bishop please dont do that betty said he might suggest you have other priests along that would bother me i dont want it to look like a formal sellout merrily nodded ok wow jane said mitigating circumstances jane had called eirion at the rotting mansion and there was no answer well there was an answer on a machine and in welsh like she wasnt already feeling excluded enough gomer had collected betty and taken her back to old hindwell mum had gone off on her own little jane had been given the really important job of relaying any messages to mum on her mobile bastards i cant speak bloody welsh she howled over the message just tell irene eirion to call me its very urgent its jane wat she shut up the message was being translated dafydd and gwennan lewis are unable to take your call please leave your message after the tone diolch yn fawr ok please please tell eirion to ring me its jane watkins its very urgent please realizing shed ended on a kind of strangled sob maybe that would underline the urgency or maybe just the existing suspicions of the wealthy and powerful dafydd lewis about the hysterical english it was not bloody fair because she now had like masses of new data to lay on eirion he could hit the net and they could crack this thing wide open jane paced the kitchen actually she was quite proud of mum this time agreeing to undertake an exorcism on behalf of a witch like it was a really heavy decision to have to make but had she accepted the significance of kali three it really was a pity they hadnt got a decent computer ah jane went rapidly round the house doing what had to be done laying a fire in the drawing room putting out dried cat food for ethel and all the time thinking hard she didnt need irene she just needed an online computer sophie sophie had one in the deliverance office it was only right that the diocese should pay for this research there should be a bus to hereford passing through ledwardine within the hour jane ran a brush through her hair tugged on her fleece coat and was out of there thered be some resistance from sophie sure but nothing jane couldnt handle with the usual combination of pathos and ratlike cunning she bought a mars bar from the eighttilllate and stood on the square munching it relishing the freedom to do things back at bloody school next week with dismal gcses looming although the public school system was this like totally disgusting anachronism she wished she was at the cathedral school with eirion at least it was in the middle of town it was bright but unexpectedly cold on the square jane chewed and stamped her feet on the cobbles a silver bmw went past then slowed suddenly and backed up and stopped on the edge of the square the window glided down on the passenger side some sex beast wondering if she was in need of a lift excuse me little girl creepy voice sibilating from the bourgeois tinted interior eyes narrowing jane pocketed the mars bar and sashayed over looking for somewhere i am see he oozed wonder if you can point me in the right direction little place called if i can just see it on the map ah got it the passenger door was thrown wide open england jane glared in delight you bastard good morning eirion eirion said hows the whiplash well its quite a bit more comfortable thank you jane jane got in the leather seat creaked luxuriously whered you steal the flash kraut wheels gwens it is she owes me dont ask are you doing the decent thing and going to school well i was naturally but on second thoughts i think well go to hereford cathedral i can show you the deliverance office in the gatehouse jane eirion snatched off his baseball cap and his dark glasses half the school goes past there you wont be spotted youll have your head bent over a keyboard by lunchtime your eyes will be so terminally weakened youll be regretting you ever left the land of druids and sad male voice choirs eirion sighed and let out the clutch he handed her a brown a envelope read this what is it what do you think it is jane pulled out a thin sheaf of printouts kali three she read about her mother and her father at home with a young child merrily watkins was horrified to discover that her husband was representing gerald mcconnell a west midlands businessman who would later be jailed for four years for fraud and moneylaundering it was this jane looked across at eirion she felt embarrassed eirion drove serenely on there but for the grace of god jane when my father was on the board of the welsh development agency never mind hed have been out by now even if the charges had stuck youre just saying that to make me feel better i wish read the other stuff on bain and his old man start at the top of page five jane read ned was ten years old when his mother edward bainbridges first wife susan walked out on her husband they were quietly divorced and soon afterwards bainbridge formed a relationship with mrs frances wesson the widow of a chaplain at his college mrs wesson had remained a strong even fanatical christian although the extent of this did not become apparent to bainbridge or his son until after the marriage strange how formally this was written like out of a real biography not the usual chatty crap you got off the net it drew you into what even though it was then the mids seemed like a victorian kind of world thus ned entered his teenage years in a stifling high church household dominated by the beautiful but austere frances wesson whose own two children seemed to be accorded special privileges to please his new wife bainbridge hitherto a lukewarm christian at most began to attend church services twice every sunday ned was soon glad to be sent away to public school where he was free to pursue an interest in subjects which would certainly have been forbidden at home during school holidays he became aware of his fathers slide into depression edward bainbridge had given up writing poetry after his latest volume had been derided as maudlin selfpitying and indeed pitifully inept unsurprisingly his academic reputation was crumbling and his drinking had become a problem all of this was concurrent with the dissolution of the bainbridge marriage with the couple living increasingly separate lives if edward now no longer attended church his wife had inflicted all its trappings and symbolism on what remained of their domestic life the house in oxford had become heavy with icons and crucifixes its drawing room had a constant and pervading smell of incense and frances had even set up a private chapel in a pantry next to the kitchen the summer of brought a severe and lifechanging shock for ned edward bainbridges brother david arrived at the school to break the news that his father was dead ned learned to his horror that his father had bled to death on the floor of the private chapel and that his stepmother had already been charged with murder some days later to the eighteenyearold neds outrage the charge was reduced to manslaughter to which frances bainbridge had agreed to plead guilty there was she had claimed a strong element of selfdefence according to mrs bainbridge her husband who had been drinking heavily for most of the day had come hammering on the door of the chapel while she was at prayer and when she refused to admit him had kicked in the door burst into the tiny chapel and proceeded to tear down drapes and overturn the altar when she screamed at him to get out he began to slash viciously with a kitchen knife at a victorian picture of christ until he stumbled and dropped the knife whereupon mrs bainbridge snatched it up edward bainbridge then attacked his wife tearing at her dress and in her struggle to get away she stabbed him fatally in the throat the original murder charge was reduced to manslaughter after frances bainbridges description of the events somewhat unconvincing to ned was supported by her son simon aged fifteen and her twelveyearold daughter madeleine both of whom said they had witnessed the struggle frances bainbridge pleaded guilty to manslaughter but walked free from the court after being given a twoyear suspended sentence because of the mitigating circumstances ned bainbridge returned to school to sit his a levels before going up to oxford to his fathers old college where with fellow students he formed his first coven eirion drove into hereford via whitecross quite a significant family skeleton isnt it he said you can understand that guy not being overfond of the church feel the light greg had shaved he wore a clean shirt he stood in the back doorway at the end of the yard and made rapid wiping movements with his arms no no no merrily stopped about four yards away shes worse shes better greg said thats the point innit im grateful for you taking the witch away and everyfing but im not having you upsetting my wife the day like greg had hardened up merrily dug her hands into the pockets of janes muchborrowed duffel coat she nodded resigned looking down at all the crushed glass ground into the pitted concrete yard im sorry reverend greg said i said id ask her if shed talk to you but i didnt in the end i dont want noffink bringing it back these past two days bleedin nightmare you understand dont you you think shes coming out of it shes talking to me thats enough for now right well merrily shrugged thank you ill see you greg it was nearly eleven am martyn kinsey of bbc wales had spotted her going into the yard and given her a conspiratorial wink martyn was going to be her last resort if she got nowhere with marianne starkey martyn kinsey and a big unchristian lie entirely off the record the diocese has received two complaints of a very serious nature against father nicholas ellis yes of course from women last resort though merrily had reached the entrance to the alley which led from the black lion yard to the village when she heard the wobble and slide of a sash window whos this a woman called down s all right greg rasped i dealt wiv it just go back and siddown willya hey marianne leaned out of the upstairs window i saw you din i merrily paused please god inna toilets marianne said with judy prosser cept you was wearing a whatsit round your neck merrily put a hand to her throat day off today greg said nervously marianne just leave it yeah you wanna cuppa tea love that would be really very nice merrily said its quite cold again today isnt it greg hung around restive breathing down his nose marianne waved him away itll be ok you go and replace your kegs they were upstairs in the living room of the flat above the pub the furniture looked inexpensive but it was all newish as if theyd ditched all their old stuff when they moved here for a bright new start greg waved a finger at his wife you just say what you wanna say marianne was in a cream towelling robe and she wore no makeup she slid back into a big lemon sofa opposite the television the sound was turned down on two young women ranting at robert kilroysilk slept late marianne said must have a clear conscience good you reckon it can really do that wipe the slate clean why not siddown please marianne picked up a cigarette packet from the sofa aint taken everything away mind i still need these dont suppose you do actually merrily slipped off her coat let it fall to the carpet she sat on the edge of an armchair beside the tv and accepted one of mariannes menthol cigarettes blimey youll go to hell love in spite of it all i prefer to think ill just go to heaven a bit sooner how do you feel now marianne bit weird bit hollow all happened kind of suddenly hasnt it cant believe it i feel like a little girl all nervous need me hand held probably why shed been so glad to see merrily a lady priest someone who would know would understand i mean you shouldnt be feeling like that at someones funeral should you marianne said aint right you mean feeling good yeah merrily lit their cigarettes finding yourself joining in the singing the singing sure mmm i know what thats like i should think you do reverend merrily nice name yeah thats what happens merrily i only went along for a laugh no not a laugh i was hacked off with everybody with this place with greg like gregs sayin one of us oughta go put in an appearance its the way they are the locals innit godfearing so yeah ok ill do it cos they all reckon im a slapper ill be down that hall with me hat on and ill put on a real show for em merrily smiled and in the middle of the show wow it turns into the real thing cloud nine love like after half a bottle of vodka nah not really i mean i was so ashamed joyful yet ashamed ashamed of me i was horrified at me what i was what id been i wanted whats the word redemption thats a bleeding big word big thing do you know i went out the back afterwards and i was sick over the fence sick as a dog with all that hating of meself pouring out after that i felt very light you know cut loose then this lady come over i dont know her name but she lives in a bungalow on the road out of here and thats where we went some other ladies come too and they was all really kind i cried most of the time merrily smoked and nodded it was difficult to believe it could happen so quickly until you encountered it but it did happen it happened particularly to people in crisis depressed people and unexpectedly to angry cynical people found i could talk to them talked about stuff i never talked about since i left london personal stuff you know one of the ladies she says i knew you was in trouble when i seen you and that feller robin thorogood marianne shivered i thought it was me invited him but he was playing with me hes a dark person he is merrily he brought out the bad and lustful part of me who told you he was a dark person in the paper wannit they come round with the paper yesterday who did eleri from the post office and judy prosser id been to church to the hall on sunday and it was wonderful i was blown away all over again really and afterwards i was introduced to father ellis and hes like i can tell you been deeply troubled i feel you been exposed to a great evil and it sets me off crying again and he takes my hand and he says in this lovely soft voice he says you come back to me when you feel ready to have the disease taken away and the next day eleri come round with the paper and there he is that robin his face like i never seen it before i mean you could see the evil in him snarling vicious i went a bit hysterical when i seen that picture he was like they said he was what happened then they took me up the hall father ellis was there did they tell you why you were going to the hall what doesnt matter father ellis he was dressed all in white as usual he was like a saint and i felt so comforted i felt i was in the right hands the hands of a living saint and we sits down and father ellis explains about the demon what robin had put inside of me those were his words once hed given me the demon he didnt wanna know me no more he just pushed me away robin pushed me away and i fell down in the street the demon did that that was the demon after the pub closed greg and me we had this terrible dingdong im insulting him im like belittling him you know what i mean im screaming go on do it to me you got any bottle poor greg turns him off like a light you talk dirty but that wasnt me i know now that wasnt me that was the demon is that what father ellis said he said he could take it away but it wouldnt be easy and it was not to be gone into lightly and i would have to understand that i would be giving myself to the holy spirit he said it was a foul entity the demon and it was gonna have to come out like a rotten tooth merrily said you mean out of your mouth mariannes eyes narrowed lines appeared either side of her mouth she looked accusingly at merrily judy said you come to spy on father ellis i was sent to support him merrily said from the bishop remember the bishop thought he needed some help marianne looked confused that judy she took you outside dint she i was glad when she did that we hadnt met before i think she was a bit suspicious of me she took you outside marianne said i was very glad we had a good chat merrily assured her we worked things out marianne do you remember what father ellis did to exorcize the demon of lust marianne blinked affronted he said the church has strict rules about the exorcizing of demons they dont just do it you could wind up exorcizing someone who was mentally ill couldnt you er yes yes you could ellis told her this merrilys heart sank a little this was established deliverance procedure you didnt even contemplate exorcism until all the other possibilities usually psychiatric had been eliminated dont get me wrong love he couldve done what he liked without a word the way i was feeling long as he took it away but he explained it was a disease i needed checking over by a doctor and what he was doing should be medically supervised he said that dr banksmorgan was there for the whole thing marianne said thats the kind of man father ellis is the male figure in the doorway she sat in her car for a while then she rang hereford police asked for mumford he was out so she rang eileen cullen at home hoping she wasnt asleep a man answered merrily realized she knew nothing about cullens domestic situation when she came on the line she sounded softer a bathrobe voice before you say a word merrily there is one incident i will never talk about again not to you not to anyone angina merrily said ask away cullen said the pills you take for angina trisomething trinitrin you feel it coming on you stick one under your tongue becomes automatic longterm sufferers they practically do it in their sleep take a hypothetical case person on trinitrin for angina becomes converted to herbal remedies says im going to stop filling myself up with these nasty drugs then she feels an attack coming on so what does she do reaches for the trinitrin says ill stop fillin meself up with these awful drugs tomorrow all right no time for the subtle approach hypothetically if in circumstances like this a doctor saw an opportunity to do away with a patient in a way which might throw blame on someone else say for instance the herbalist how would he go about it jesus merrily what is this its er a question just a question well heres your answer a hundred ways could casually swap her trinitrins for blanks for starters whos gonna know its easy for a doctor always has been robin had been gazing from his studio window when he saw her walking like some grounded angel across the yard and hed gone running wildly through the farmhouse like some big stupid kid knocking a bowl of cornflakes out of the hands of a mousy pregnant witch from gloucester called alice now he held bettys hand and he was breathing evenly for the first time in many hours they shared this big cushion they used to have in their previous apartment only now it was on the floor of the parlour the room with the inglenook which was now the house temple theyd been left alone in here just robin and betty and the altar and the crown of lights the kindly mature witch alexandra bettys onetime tutor had made it alexandra was a twigweaver or whatever you call it and this was a tight wreath of hedgerow strands like a crown of thorns without the thorns across the top of the wreath was shaped a kind of skullcap made out of one of those foil trays you got around your supermarket quiche the candles which ringed its perimeter were the kind you had on birthday cakes though not coloured a blue peter job betty had said with a wistful smile referring to some tv show she used to watch as a kid where you were taught how to make useful artefacts from household debris foil trays apparently featured big i love you robin said i want you to wear it tonight outside on a calm night with all the candles lit around the head of a beautiful woman the crown of lights looked awesome its the mother wears the lights betty said this is special what would ned say hell be cool everything was cool coming together happening just like hed known it would he hadnt asked where shed spent last night that didnt matter she sometimes needed time to think things out he recalled how one moonlit night shed gone out walking from shrewsbury into the countryside hadnt returned until dawn had covered maybe twenty miles and hadnt noticed the time go by hed been frantic but she was her own person she was his priestess he would trust her for ever through life after life after life neds even gonna fix things with kirk blackmore i tell you about that yes betty said im sure he will bets things are really turning around its imbolc i can feel the light coming through yes betty said down the hill into the forestry land until she came to the point where there were farm buildings either side of the road and a land rover with a christ is the light sticker oh he had his uses did jesus christ the very name served as a disinfectant merrily turned in to a rutted track between two stone and timbered barns and there was the farmhouse grey brown black windows no garden just a yard of dirt and brown gravel where she parked the volvo there was a glazed front porch its door hanging ajar she saw the interior door swing open before she was even into the porch and judith prosser standing there cool and rangy in her orange rugby shirt youre late mrs watkins had you down for an early riser i did the banter was wrapped around judiths need always to be ahead of the situation this visit must on no account be seen as a surprise late night mrs prosser ive coffee on that would be good erm i felt there were things left in the air from last night no bad thing sometimes judith replied swiftly left in the air they have a chance to blow away but sometimes they stick around and the air goes sour and thats not a good thing in my experience oh your experience holding open the door for merrily profound today is it mrs watkins you have a problem with profound merrily blinked it was dark inside and the hulking furniture made it darker lifes too short to tolerate problems lifes too short for coverups mrs prosser merrily said judith turned to face her they were standing in a square hall dominated by a huge overornate chair with a nameplate on the back it looked like the seat of a council chairman or a presiding magistrate judith leaned an elbow on one of its carved shoulders as i said last night it would be stupid for you to react to silly rumours heres the situation merrily said i was there i saw the whole thing the cross the petroleum jelly also dr coll standing in the doorway and didnt that explain why a bunch of local matrons were able to sit there and watch ellis violate a woman with a metal cross because there was a doctor present this of course makes everything all right above board entirely respectable clinically proven judith prosser flicked a speck of dust or ash from the point of the chairmans chair im not sure how far from being a police matter this is merrily continued but were very close to finding out stupid wires jane typed in the word charismatic the usual mainly irrelevant list appeared she grabbed the mouse dithered over charismatic q and a try it eirion suggested might lead somewhere better on the screen the charismatic movement what in the name of god is it all about click eirion said the charismatic movement from the greek charismata meaning spiritual gifts developed in the s and s from the pentecostal movement crossing over the denominations embracing the sphere of angelology and the gifts of healing prophecy speaking in tongues and powerprayer it reached a new peak worldwide in the s there was a list of options jane clicked on yes i want to talk to god they needed all the help they could get sophie had said she shouldnt be allowing this before shutting them in the deliverance office with the computer and she wanted copies of anything they found jane had said this is awfully good of you mrs hill collecting a contemptuous frown and jane you are not among the people with whose patronage i can cope try evangelism on the way here jane had told eirion virtually everything shed learned so far about terry penney about pentagrams the poor little chapel boy had seemed unnerved regaining his cool only when he saw the computer smiling his famous smile at sophie who wore a checked woollen skirt with a grey twinset and pearls sophie who might one day be the last person in the entire universe still wearing a twinset and pearls jane clicked again losing enthusiasm for talking to god when it was working fast and well the internet could give you the illusion of being god you could imagine him operating like this constructing human situations with a click of the mouse running programs consigning icons to the dumpbin evangelism though had been a bummer there were background articles on st john the evangelist there were four web sites about some kind of computer software with that name there were no obvious links into crank preachers in the american south who might have known nick ellis and charismatics proved little better i could try bible belt eirion offered youd probably get suppliers of religious fashion accessories jane said gloomily cults no chance people never think of themselves as being in a cult just off to the cult dont wait up doesnt happen what we need is a christian search engine what we need is divine intervention jane walked over to the window which overlooked the forecourt of the bishops palace no good searching for it out there ok eirion said what are we really asking for some big rattling skeleton in elliss vestment closet something that maybe caused him to leave america come back here in a hurry when you think about it most brits who go over to the states tend to stay there making piles of money so its reasonable to think ellis came back because something happened to make him kind of persona non grata like he was the leader of a mass suicide cult who contrived not to go down with the rest wed have heard about it were stuffed jane angrily keyed in loony fundamentalist bastards and the web found for some no doubt entirely logical reason a bunch of science fiction and fantasy writers including david wingrove david gemmell and kirk blackmore were just not asking the right questions kirk blackmore where did i hear that sophie came in then with a piece of paper a name written on it try this ah jane said as blackmore came up on the screen this was the guy whose covers robin thorogood was going to design but they pulled the plug eirion was staring up at sophie bewildered i used the telephone sophie inclined her neck swanlike its rather oldtech it involves the lessexact medium of human speech but it does tend to be more effective when dealing with the clergy marshall mcallman eirion read before the reverend nicholas ellis came to new radnor and then old hindwell he was a curate for just over a year at a parish outside newcastleupontyne ive talked to his former vicar the reverend alan patterson who only found out after the reverend mr ellis had been with him for several months that hed previously been a personal assistant to the reverend mr mcallman which did not entirely please him lets put it in jane eirion keyed in the name while the computer was still showing kirk blackmore oracle the reclusive celtic scribe returns with a remarkable new lord madoc novel which found eirion said after a few seconds the mobile ministry of marshall mcallman he clicked kirk blackmore vanished there you are sophie peered angelweb factfile the journeys of reverend marshall mcallman were directed by the will of god and took him from oklahoma to south carolina eirion read from the screen via arkansas and tennessee dispensing a lowkey but extremely potent evangelism effectively tailored to the needs of small towns and simple folk he developed a loyal following after several witnessed instances of prophecy divine inspiration and angelic blah blah blah reverend mcallman retired in a disillusioned man after surviving a campaign by an unscrupulous journalist on a tennessee newspaper the goshawk talon although there remains considerable debate about reverend mcallmans ministry his name is still revered in blah blah there you have it then sophie interrupted your next port of call must surely be the ah goshawk talon does that mean its in a place called goshawk jane wondered doesnt matter lets just put it in eirion said found some stuff on birds of prey and the goshawk talon and marshall mcallman ok eirion clicked waited oh the file you are seeking is unavailable janes face fell what do we do now a technical brick wall sophie sighed hard to imagine how we survived for so long without all this then she did something most unsophielike stamped her foot phone them child they presumably have telephones in goshawk tennessee if this publication still exists it shouldnt take long to find the number if it doesnt we shall have to think of something else get on to international directory enquiries i dont know how sophie sighed in mild contempt leave it to me she stalked out wow jane said the turbo twinset eirion smiled his eirion smile it did things to her but this was not the time there never seemed to be a time the sudden urgency manifested by sophie made jane quite tense what if someone was ringing home with information far more important than anything they could hope to find on the net and she wasnt there to relay it paranoid she rang the vicarage answering machine one message for mum to call uncle ted sod that we seem to be drifting a long way from kali three eirion said he started to key it in no dont jane leapt up and stood at the window staring down at the woodpile below there was a sense of being very close to something but it was too indistinct ghostly she felt that invoking kali three would somehow bring bad luck she turned back to the room we have to go there old hindwell eirion said im not sure about that why we just do absolutely not sophie was in the doorway sophie theres some really heavy dont you think your mother has enough to worry about sit down and speak to the man from the paper or would you prefer me to do it perhaps it might be better if i did shes right eirion said shes going to sound so much more authoritative than either of us especially to joebob mccabe of the goshawk talon ah sure lerve your accent maam said jane the only person from tennessee shed ever heard talk was elvis the mans name said sophie is eliot williams hes busy at the moment but his editors getting him to call me back i think he rather senses a story wow jane said youre like incredible but sophie had already returned to her office where the phone was ringing nine points a dark victorian living room merrily imprisoned in the lap of a huge highsided leather armchair coat folded on her knees cup and saucer on top of that judith prosser was adept at disadvantaging her visitors and since when is religion a matter for the police mrs watkins when its sexual assault merrily drank some of the coffee perversely it was good coffee do you know what i think judiths own chair put her about a foot higher than merrily ive been enquiring about you and do you know what i think i think that father ellis has dared to intrude into what you consider to be your back yard he is doing what you think only you should be doing you think id do how would i know what nambypamby thing you would do these days when the church is like a branch of the social services a withering contempt for both now were getting to it merrily said are we mrs watkins merrily tried to sit up in the chair she felt like a child around the walls were dozens of photographs mostly of men wearing chains of office although a group of more recent ones showed boys with motorbikes and trophies what are we getting to judith leaned back arms folded the question of old hindwell preferring to do its own thing which is kind of admirable in one sense i suppose judith reared up it is entirely admirable my girl this is an independent part of the world what do we need with the mandarins in cardiff and london and canterbury the english even the welshies they all think they can come out yere and do what they like when councillor prosser was on the old radnor district council they used to have to employ young officials trotting out their fancy ideas hippies and vegetarians half of them it was oh you cant build there you have to use this colour of slate on your roofs you cant do this you cant do that well they were put in their place soon enough the local people it is who decides we know whats needed we know what works and father ellis even though hes not from yere is a man with old values and a clear straightforward practical approach based on tradition he understands tradition merrily was tired of this how many people has he exorcized so far i can tell you that all of them have come freely to him and asked for it to be done like your son a pause gomer parry again i suppose doesnt matter where it came from i just wondered if your son actually went along to ellis and asked to be cleansed of the takinganddrivingaway demon his parents took him judith scowled another problem in todays world is that parents dont take responsibility we took him to father ellis councillor prosser and i it was our duty and you really think he had a demon inside him that demanded the full castingout bit oh mrs watkins exasperated judith stood and went to lean an arm on the high mantelpiece they all have demons in them whether its mischievous imps or worse in the old days the demons were beaten out of them at school now if a teacher raises a hand to a child hes in court for assault and nothing the poor magistrate can do to help him i see there was an awful logic to this exorcism as a tool of public order evidently the local women had decided that the wanton demon in marianne starkey which perhaps made some local men a little restless a touch frisky should be eradicated before it led to trouble mariannes reaction to the male witch adding a piquantly topical flavour to the exercise menna merrily said what about menna judith brought her arm slowly down to her side stiffening ever so slightly judith did menna herself go to father ellis and beg for exorcism to get rid of the molesting spirit of mervyn thomas judith was silent or was it jws idea in his role as husband and father figure judith said eyes unmoving how do you know she was cleansed wasnt she is that any business of yours or mine first sign of a significant loss of cool what would i know about the private affairs of mr and mrs jw weal was i supposed to be her guardian and her keeper all her life you were obviously still concerned about her you went to visit her regularly you were still by all accounts her only real friend you were the best person to realize she was still a victim he loved her he suffocated her mrs prosser when she was in hospital he tended her he washed her hardly let the nurses near her i saw him with a bowl of water as if he was baptizing her all over again as if he was somehow confirming and reinforcing what father ellis had done you see everything dont you look i just happened to be there with gomer the night his minnie died jw was like a priest giving his wife the last rites but she was already dead ellis said at the funeral that hed baptized them together was that a public thing were you present judith came away from the fireplace there was a large iron coal stove in it closed up she walked to the small window and stood looking out she was thinking and she evidently did not want merrily to see her thinking no she said eventually no i was not there as such am i right in thinking that menna was still felt to be possessed if you like by her father he was not a pleasant man judith said and did you get menna on the pill from an early age because you were afraid that what happened to barbara might happen to her too merrily didnt ask that it perhaps didnt need asking not right now you couldnt really be sure that merv was leaving her alone could you judith didnt reply and whatever he was like she was still dependent on him dependent on a strong man which weal realized and lost no time in exploiting judith kept on looking out of the window he was too old for her yes too rigid in his ways perhaps but she was a flimsy delicate thing she would always need protection she was never going to have much of a life with jeffery but she would at least be protected like a moth in a jar merrily said and judith turned sharply around merrily met her clear gaze when exactly did you begin to think that jw weal in his way might be as bad for menna as her father had been it was not my business any more oh come on youd known that girl all her life did it really not occur to you that weal might think he was somehow still in competition with the dead mervyn thomas for mennas affections if thats the right word that maybe he didnt think he was getting everything he was entitled to judith came back to the fireplace who is this going to help now merrily thought back to barbara buckingham possession is nine points of the law perhaps there was still a chance to help barbara but that wouldnt matter much to judith prosser menna merrily said softly perhaps it will help menna and so it came out the big room at the back of the house the dining room in which probably no one ever dined the baywindowed room with rearing shadows the room facing the mausoleum this was where it was actually done merrily said how do you know that because i watched of course i stood in the garden and i spied just as you did on the night of mennas funeral i was in our yard when i saw father elliss car go past slowly i followed on foot i saw him enter the old rectory with the medical bag he carries for such occasions it was towards evening i saw menna dressed in white i saw father ellis i did not see jeffery something had snapped something had fallen into place perhaps something which even to a local person was no longer defensible merrily said cautiously and did what happened bear comparison with what took place at the village hall yesterday i dont know judith said it was not possible to see what was happening below the level of the window merrilys palms were damp youre saying she was on the floor at some point im saying she wasnt visible when was this about three four weeks ago i cant remember exactly not that long before she had her stroke then im making no connection mrs watkins do you believe she was possessed and needed exorcism i think she needed help was dr coll there i have no reason to think so so just ellis and menna i imagine jeffery was somewhere in the house his car was there anyway but you didnt see him in the room no what do you want mrs watkins how can you knowing any of this possibly help menna now she haunted barbara merrily said haunted im using the word loosely like memories haunt guilt haunts yes we know all about that and spirits haunt do they really judith said do you seriously believe that wouldnt be much good in this job if i didnt what did judith herself believe that ellis was an effective psychologist or an effective and useful con man merrily said barbara wanted me to do a kind of exorcism in reverse to free mennas spirit from weals possession possession of the dead by the living do you seriously believe she believed and i believe we may have a tormented and frantic essence which cant find peace like a moth in a jar except a moth in a jar doesnt live long exactly thats the difference and how would you deal with this mrs watkins judith placed her hands on her narrow hips how would you deal with it now how would you go about it explain to me well it wouldnt be an exorcism because this is not an evil spirit if we think of her perhaps as still a victim needing to be rescued which is normally done by celebrating a requiem eucharist in the appropriate place in the company of people close to the dead person in this case it could be you and mr weal obviously then it will never be done will it merrily heard eileen cullen with the echoes of hospital clatter swear to god he knew it was there twice he looked back over his shoulder he wont let her go she sank into the chair clutching the bundled coat to her chest thats what this is about possessing her in death as he never fully did in life and knowing that how can i let it go on suppose judiths voice had risen in pitch suppose i could get you into that house into that room or into the tomb to perform your ceremony you wouldnt be doing it with his compliance but you wouldnt be doing it against his will either since he wouldnt know about it wouldnt that be better than nothing from your point of view mrs watkins how could you fix that i have keys see keys to the house and also to the tomb menna was often taken unwell so jeffery gave me a key to get in and attend to her when she died he needed someone to let the masons in to work on the tomb why would you want to risk letting me in perhaps judith said its a question of what is right the right thing to do i cared for menna when she was alive perhaps its the last thing i can do for her but its not right for me to go into someones house without permission well judith shrugged thats your decision isnt it she bent over and released a valve on the iron stove there was a rush of air and a slowbuilding roar of fire i was about to say mrs watkins that jeffery wont be there tonight its his lodge night he never misses it unlike councillor prosser itll be even more important to him now always a great comfort to a man the masons merrily said perhaps its a job for father ellis instead judith looked at her with severity does that mean you are afraid mrs watkins part five when i looked for good then evil came unto me and when i waited for light there came darkness i stood up and i cried in the congregation i am a brother to dragons and a companion to owls book of job chapter v breath of the dragon merrily had arranged to meet gomer in the black lion for a sandwich around twothirty she was early but the pub was already filling up with those civilized ramblingclub types anoraks and soft drinks who seemed to constitute elliss core congregation more of them today substantially more you looked at them individually and they seemed worryingly genuine young people with a vision of a new day elderly people with a new and healthy approach to the evening of the day there was a buzz of energy in the dispirited partpainted black lion bar each hug each praise god passing on a vibration merrily found herself standing next to a whitebearded man of about sixty one of the few with a glass of beer she asked him where he was from wolverhampton he said west midland pentecostal how farve you come sister oh just from ledwardine just over the border how many of you are there about what fiftyfive hired ourselves a coach luckily theres a lot of retired people in our church but quite a few youngstersve taken a day off work he grinned relaxed its a question of whose work you put first isnt it were going to walk down to this satanist place after lunch and hold some bible readings outside the gate ive not actually seen father ellis yet but im told hes a very inspiring man so they say praise god said the man from wolverhampton merrily saw gomer coming in and pointed to the table near the door she ordered drinks and cheese sandwiches at the bar greg starkey avoided her eyes gomer was wearing his bomber jacket over a grey sweatshirt with gomer parry plant hire on it in red three bloody coaches on the car park vicar mmm its what happens these days everything goes to extremes fastest growing movement in the church and hey theyre going to prove it ent the only ones bunch of ole vans backed into a forestry clearing up towards the ole rectory lighting camp fires bloody fools travellers pagans they reckons merrily sighed all we need two police vans set up in the ole schoolyard dr colls surgery another one in big weals drive the ole rectory makes you laugh dont it two biggest bloody villains in east radnor both well in with the cops merrily dumped her cigarettes and lighter on the table you find out some more been over to nevs your nephew yes ar drop in now and then make sure the boys lookin after the ole diggers anyway nevs with a lawyer in llandod plays bloody golf with him he gived him a ring for me off the record like word is big weals favourite clients is ole clients specially them not too quick up top nmore going senile worries a lot about their wills when they gets like that see whos gonner get what how its gonner get sorted when they snuffs it what they needs is a good lawyer and a good doctor puts their mind at rest ennit specially folk as ent had a family lawyer for generations see incomers refugees from off in need of guidance exacly it vicar this boy in llandod he reckons weal gets a steady stream of ole clients recommended by their nice kindly doctor that confirm what you yeard vicar fits in and if we were to go a step further down that road we might find a nice kindly priest sure tbe gomer said church gets to be more important the nearer you gets to that big ole farm gate two bikers came in one wore a leather jacket open to a white tshirt with a black dragon motif the dragon was on its back with a spear down its throat it was hard to be sure which side they represented at four oclock the ruined church of st michael looked like an old beached boat waiting for the tide of night to set it afloat going to be lit up like a birthday cake betty said with distaste you cant spot them from here but there are clusters of candles and garden torches all over it in the windows on ledges between the battlements on the tower itll be visible for miles from the hills making a statement yeah after centuries of holding ceremonies discreetly in the woods and behind curtains in suburban back rooms were coming out theyd met in the decaying copse merrily walking from the old archaeological site where gomer had parked betty coming across the bridge from the farmhouse and joining the footpath the sky had dulled low clouds pocketing the sunken sun and you could feel the dusk carrying spores of frost betty looked cold merrily tightened her scarf bain still wants to do it naked possibly theyll light a small fire inside a circle of stones in the open nave dance back to back with arms linked behind not as silly as it sounds after a while you dont feel it youre aglow like singing in tongues merrily thought a long flat cloud lay over the church now like a widebrimmed hat from the other side of the ruins beyond the pines and the sitka spruce they could hear the sounds of a hymn straggly singing offkey the christians at the gate theyre going to keep that up all night long arent they betty said youve heard nothing yet there are scores more in the village now bad betty shivered ned believes the spiritual tension will fuel the rite he says we can appropriate their energy that is way way out of order she shook herself i need to get them out of here lock the gates and try and save my marriage will you stay here afterwards betty shook her head we wont survive this well lose everything weve got with that house but i dont care if were destitute only problem is im going to feel guilty about anyone else living here i wish we could sell it to a waste disposal firm or something but were going to deal with that merrily said firmly no it was very stupid of me to ask you betty looked at her green eyes sorrowful without hope i wasnt thinking this is part of a prehistoric ritual complex we dont know who or what those original inhabitants were but they chose their sites well they knew all the doorways cant you feel the earth and the air fusing together as it gets dark this is a place that knows itself but we dont know it cant you hear it just the singing merrily admitted i can hear a constant low humming now i know its in my head but its this place thats put it there we dont know what went on here nobody does there are no stones left standing only the holes where they were and that church and whatever metaphorically if you like is underneath that church and whatever it is its much older than christianity and much much older than wicca merrily said sure we were invented in the fifties and sixties by wellmeaning people who knew there was no continuous tradition most of wiccas either made up or culled from aleister crowley and dion fortune it has no tradition there ive said it is that what you wanted the singing was already louder more christians had arrived theres a tradition here merrily said of sorts a strand of something that goes back at least to medieval times unfortunately it seems to have been preserved by my lot yeah you can certainly feel it in cascob oh and st michaels cefnllys i meant to tell you i looked this up that when they eventually built a new church at llandrindod the rector had the roof taken off cefnllys church to stop people worshipping there he did it was in a book i suddenly remembered it from when i was a kid in llandrindod so i looked it up i mean was he thinking like penney did they both feel the breath of the dragon probably didnt understand any of it but something scared them badly now people like ned bain are coming along and saying its ok its fine its cool because were the dragon do you still want to go in there with your holy water what time any time after i dunno nine if you dont come ill understand whos that it was a vehicle creaking over the footpath where it had been widened by the archaeologists merrily ran to the edge of the copse she could see gomers ancient land rover parked the other side with gomer leaning on the bonnet smoking a rollup watching the new vehicle trundling towards him it was sophies saab black christianity no candles the candles had gone from the windows not just gone out but gone the trays the bibles everything at first it seemed an encouraging sign and then merrily thought it isnt it isnt at all in the face of the invasion the local people had withdrawn disconnected whatever happened tonight would not be their fault it was about fivefifty pm the post office and shop had closed there were few lights in the cottages only the pub was conspicuously active otherwise old hindwell under dark forestry and the hump of burfa hill had retracted into itself leaving the streets to them from off the multitude in the centre of the village maybe three or fourhundred people had gathered in front of the former school they had christian placards and torches and lamps they were not singing hymns they seemed leaderless gomer put the land rover at the side of the road in front of the entrance to the pubs yard where it said no parking the car park was so full that none of the coaches would get out until several cars were removed two dark blue police vans lurked inside the school gates four tv crews hovered the minority of pagans here seemed to be the kind with green hair and eyebrow rings maybe twenty of them in bunches harmless probably one group squatting outside the pub were chanting harken to the witches rune to the hollow thump of a hand drum sad jane commented she and eirion were in the back of the land rover merrily sat next to gomer in the front theyre just playing at it just being annoying youll be joining the young conservatives next flower but those socalled christians really make me sick theyre tossers holierthanthou gits phew merrily said through the wing mirror she saw sophies saab pulling in behind them sophie didnt get out eirion said what do you want us to do mrs watkins just stay with gomer and sophie perhaps you could get something to eat in the pub jane was dismayed thats all the thanks we get a mouldy cheese sandwich and a can of coke dont think im not immensely grateful for what you two and sophieve uncovered just that i need to put it to ellis by myself if there are any witnesses he wont even talk to me theyd talked intently for over an hour in the land rover listened to a cassette recording of a phone call involving sophie and some journalist in tennessee and then merrily had watched as betty now armed with many things she hadnt known about ned bain had walked away into the last of the dusk not looking back merrily leaned against the land rovers passenger door and it opened with a savage rending sound how long will you be jane asked as long as it takes he hasnt even shown yet an hour and a half maybe and then we come looking for you and then do whatever gomer tells you the crazy violence seemed to start as soon as merrilys feet touched the tarmac lights flaring a womans scream a beer can thrown a black cross reared out of a mesh of torch beams amid a tangle of angry voices finished you fuckers had your time christ was a wanker your level isnt it the gutter get out of my sickening crunch of bone on flesh blood geysering up oh dear god so why dont you just fuck off back to your churches fore we have em all off you stand back reverend a hand pulling merrily back as the police came through marianne she was pushed stand back please everybody back headlights arriving then collard banksmorgan with his medical bag next to him a man in a dark suit not a white monks habit but a dark suit a woman shrieked youll be damned for ever and started to cry listen reverend marianne said calmly im better now good things you oughta know she pulled merrily into the yard she followed when they took the man with the broken nose into the surgery a woman too spattered with his blood wailing elliss arm around her hes in good hands sister the best in the waiting room the lighting was harsh the seats old and hard the ceiling still schoolhall high with creampainted metal girders a woman receptionist smiled smugly through a hatch in the wall come through dr coll sang voice like muzak bring him through thats right doors slammed routinely there were health posters all over the walls posters to make you feel ill paranoid dependent no surprise that dr coll had taken over the school a local bastion of authority and wisdom id like to talk to you merrily said to ellis im sure you would mrs watkins he said briskly but i dont have the time or the interest to talk to you youre a vain and stupid woman under his suit he wore a black shirt no tie no clerical collar what happened to your messiah kit libby tell dr coll ill talk to him later ellis said to the receptionist merrily said theres going to be trouble out there she waited as ellis dabbed with a tissue at a small blood speck on his sleeve are you going to stop them marching to the church who am i he said to stop anyone you started it you lit the blue touchpaper the media started it as you say its already out of hand itd be highly irresponsible of me to inflame it further now if you dont mind you could stop them you could stop it now it isnt worth it for a crumbling old building with a bad reputation id lock the door after us if i were you libby ellis said to the receptionist ill do that father ellis held open the main door for merrily looking over her head after you she didnt move dont make me ask the police to come in ellis said could you clear up a few points for me nick goodnight she had no confidence for this still couldnt quite believe it i am a brother to dragons merrily said go away he didnt look at her opened the door wider book of job i do know the book of job the sounds of the street outside came in carried on cold air sounds alien to old hindwell shouts jeers a mans unstable voice on high may god have mercy on you i think your real name is simon wesson merrily said you went out to the states with your mother and sister in the midseventies after the death of your stepfather over there your mother married an evangelist called marshall mcallman you later became his personal assistant he made a lot of money before he was exposed and disgraced and your mother divorced him very lucratively i believe she couldnt look at him while she was saying all this terrified that it was going to be wrong that jane and eirion had found the wrong person that the journalist whose voice sophie had so efficiently recorded was talking about someone with no connection at all to nicholas ellis mcallman concentrated on little backwoods communities his technique was to do thorough research before he brought his show to town hed employ investigators and although he would appear aloof when he first arrived none of your goodoldboy stuff from marshall the journalist had told sophie on the tape marshall was cool marshall was laidback marshall would target a town that was hungry and hed spread a table and hed check into a hotel and sit back and wait for them to come sniffing and drooling his remoteness only added to his mystique they came to him the local dignitaries the civic leaders the business people and he passed on almost reluctantly what the holy spirit had communicated to him about them and their lives and their past and their future and he convinced them that they and their town were riddled with all kinds of demons merrily focused on a wall poster about the symptoms of meningitis she spoke in a low voice could see libby the receptionist straining to hear while pretending to rearrange leaflets behind the window of her hutch time and time again the local people would pull marshall into the bosom of the community everyone begging him to take away their demons and their childrens demons especially the daughters those wayward kids a little internal ministry well it beats abortion he was a prophet and a local hero in different localities he only went to selected places little introverted nohope places with poor communications the places that were gagging for it the print on the meningitis poster began to blur she turned at last to look up at ellis his nose lifted in disdain but she could see his hand whitening around the doorknob he taught you a lot nick about the psychology of rural communities and about manipulation plus he gave you the inner strength and the brass neck to come back to this country and finally take on your hated stillvengeful stepbrother she stood in the doorway and waited ellis closed the door again in the black lion jane saw gomer was talking at the bar to a fat man of about thirty in a thick plaid shirt that came down halfway to his knees at their table by the door sophie gathered her expensive and elegant camel coat over her knees to protect them from the draught id take you two back to hereford with me if i thought youd stay put in the office no chance jane ripped open a bag of crisps stretched out her legs nothings going to happen here jane sophie said the whole thing comes down to two obsessive men settling a childhood grudge but what a grudge sophie serious serious hatred fermenting for over a quarter of a century a fundamentalist bigot and a warlock steeped in old magic a white witch and a black christian jane he is if you like subvert christianity if you use it aggressively to try and hurt or crush people of a different religion or if you go around exorcizing demons out of people who havent actually got demons in them just to get power over them like this guy mcallman then youre using christianity for evil so thats got to be black christianity i wouldnt exactly call bain a white witch either eirion murmured sophie said jane your grasp of theology but gomer was back with them thoughtfully rolling and unrolling his cap thats nev he said watching the man in the plaid shirt go out my nephew nev see er someings come up ennit mrs hill if theres a chance you could stay with these kids till the vicar gets back uhhuh jane shook her head mum said to stick with gomer gomer sighed he opened the pub door peered out jane got up and leaned over his shoulder there were still a lot of people out there and more police about seven of them also the guy in the plaid shirt standing by a truck in the back of the truck was a yellow thing partly under a canvas cover whats that jane demanded minijcb like for digging sure tbe gomer admitted gruffly ellis took her into the second surgery a plain room with a big dark desk victorianlooking authority a big chair and a small chair ellis sat in the big chair merrily didnt sit down she was thinking rapidly back over the history of her faith the unsavoury aspects in the middle ages christianity was still magic charms and blessings indistinguishable the reformation was supposed to have wiped that out but in seventeenthcentury britain religious healers and exorcists were still putting on public displays just like modern bible belt evangelists and when it was finally over in most of britain here in radnorshire inside the inverted pentagram of churches dedicated to the warrior archangel it continued in a place with a strong tradition of pagan magic the people transferred their allegiances to the priests the more perspicacious of whom took on the role of the conjuror the cunning man few more cunning than nicholas ellis formerly simon wesson his face was unlined bland insolent looking up at her but really looking down wheres your mother now nick dead drowned in her swimming pool in orlando four years ago an accident your sister still out there married with kids you came back to britain because of what happened over marshall mcallman and this tennessee newspaper ive told you i wont discuss that he brought a hand down hard on the desk he was sweating and if you say a word about any of this outside these walls i shall instruct my solicitor to obtain an immediate injunction to restrain you and make preparations to take you to court for libel do you understand this is mr weal is it never underestimate him i wouldnt hell do anything for you wont he after what you did for him and for his wife before she died ellis kept his lips tight his face uplifted to the lights and shining you must have investigated this parish pretty thoroughly before you applied for it or were you looking specifically for a parish that suited your kind of ministry or was it just luck or the will of god from what i gather your mother was into a particularly mystical form of high church he turned his chair away with a wrench no no no i will not perhaps she found the connections perhaps she was a particular influence on mcallmans ministry merrily stood with her back to the door any point in asking you if you did actually help to cover up a lessthanhotblooded murder his eyes burned all that matters is ned bain thinks you did merrily said edward is a despicable nonentity not in pagan circles he isnt i mean i suppose its easy to say thats why he became a pagan its rough natural wild very much a reaction against your mothers suffocating churchiness he rose up blasphemer merrily lost it bounced from the door do you know what real blasphemy is nick its a man with a nineinch cross i will not do you sterilize it first may god have mercy on you only i was there when you exorcized marianne starkey who merrily prayed swiftly for forgiveness whos now prepared to make a detailed statement a lie but she had him he stared at her weve prepared a press release nick unless she hears from me by seven oclock my secretarys been instructed to fax it to the press association in london ellis folded his arms merrily looked at her watch i make it youve got just under an hour to do what he leaned back expressionless put on your white messiah gear merrily said get out there and tell them its all over tell them to go home or lead them all up to the village hall and keep them there ellis spread his hands theyll be there anyway the police wanted them off the streets i believe the prossers have taken them to the hall keep them there then tell them you dont want to risk their immortal souls by having them stepping onto the contaminated ground of st michaels he shrugged ok sure he leaned back two fingers along the side of his head curious but i dont understand why do you care she didnt follow him she stayed on the edge of the schoolyard near the police vans and saw lights eventually come on in what she reckoned was elliss house dr coll came out of the surgery but didnt so much as glance at her perhaps judith hadnt told him at the same time two policemen went in presumably to obtain statements from the injured man and his wife merrily resisted an impulse to yell at dr coll why did you kill mrs wilshire in the hope that some copper might hear the village was comparatively quiet again the lights were still few and bleary or maybe it was her eyes was there more she could have done if there was she couldnt think what it might be she was tired she prayed that ellis would see sense a few minutes later she saw him coming down from the council estate a hollywood ghost in his white monks habit he walked past the school and didnt turn his head towards her leaving twenty or thirty yards between them she followed him to the hall a cameraman spotted him and ran ahead of him and crouched in the road recording his weary stately progress to his place of worship a journalist puffing out white steam ran back to the pub to alert the others merrily prayed that they were all going to be very disappointed like the christians with respect father what was the point of us coming at all one man on his feet in the crowded hall it was the biker with the black dragon ellis brought his hands together you came here because you were moved by the holy spirit we must all obey those impulses which we recognize as a response to the will of god but the man persisted what does god want us to do ellis let the question hang a while then he said softly you all saw what happened earlier to our brother i can tell you that two men have been charged with assault causing actual bodily harm that will be the least of their punishment but in allowing that to happen god was telling us that a public demonstration is no longer the answer the answer is prayer praise god someone cried but it was halfhearted they wanted blood merrily sat at the back demoralized even in victory there will be no more violence ellis emphasized it with open hands there was desultory applause but our task is still far from over he told them they must pray for the intervention of st michael to keep his church out of the hands of satan out of the red claws of the dragon and if they prayed if their faith in god was strong enough the devil would fail tonight the lord would yet intervene a frisson went through the hall there were tentative moans god elliss arms were suddenly extended ramrod stiff arises a man arose from the floor his own arms raised a mirror image of the priest others followed with a squeaking and scraping of chairs hundreds of arms reaching for the ceiling a woman began to gabble god god god god god orgasmically soon merrily found she was the only one seated and was obliged to scramble to her feet she looked up and saw that ellis who must surely know that this was as good as over that there would be no more generating paranoia no more wholesale exorcism no more internal ministry was aglow again his eyes like foglamps and they were focused through the wintry forest of stiffened arms focused on her god arises ellis snarled merrily left the hall he was showing her that even in defeat his power was undiminished that the holy spirit was with him a remarkable man mrs watkins said judith prosser she was standing in the porch in her long black quilted coat yes merrily admitted judith gently closed the doors on the assembly she contemplated merrily with a wryly tilted smile i take it she said lightly that youve made your decision im sorry your exorcism in reverse judith said the laying to rest of the poor moth in the jar oh yes jeffery will have left now for his lodge but perhaps this was not such a good idea inside the hall a hymn was beginning it would end in tongues ellis and his followers were for the time being contained jane too by gomer and sophie merrily had a couple of hours yet before she was due at st michaels she walked out into the cold and looked down on the meagre glimmer of the village she shivered inside janes duffel coat all right she said lets go and do it cashmere and tweed jane had never seen gomer quite like this before although shed heard the tales the legend ciggy glowing malevolently in the centre of his teeth like a ruby in the face of some indian idol he rode the minijcb into the middle of the field to where the earth was banked the digger was the size of a heavyduty rideon mower a big yellow tonka toy nevs truck was parked a few yards back engine running headlights full beam next to it at a slight angle was gomers land rover with sophie inside in any other situation jane would have found this deeply shockingly thrilling but tonight she only wanted to get it over with and find mum this was prossers ground turned over to the archaeologists whod dug trenches all over the place and then paid fat nev to replace the tons of removed soil up here with mum yesterday gomer had noticed a part that was not professionally finished not how hed taught nev to do it not seeded but clumsily planted with turf not made good to gomer parry plant hire standards gomer had taken it up with nev nev had been offended nev said hed left a bloody perfect job banked up and seeded tidy now it could be that gareth prosser had buried some sheep here but no sheep grazed this area and it was a long way to come for a dull lazy bugger like gareth eirion gomer yelled do me a favour boy back the ole land rover up a few feet then we can see the top o the mound ok eirion ran through the mud jane sophie called from the truck either you come in here or im coming out for you knowing jane was quite keen to sneak away and snatch a look at the ruins of the church across the brook to see if they were all lit up oh sophie gomer might need some help very well the trucks passenger door creaked open there was a squelch blast jane grinned sophie was not the kind to carry wellies in the boot the bucket of the little digger went into the soft bank like a spoon into chocolate fudge gomer had thought this minijcb might be more appropriate than a big one in the circumstances and also less conspicuous it couldnt be an awful lot less conspicuous with all the noise gomer was making this is quite ridiculous sophie was now limping across the field serious mudsplashes on her camel coat i dont know how i ever agreed you didnt agree we dragged you along im sorry sophie youve been like really brilliant today shut up jane we could have told the police i suppose but they probably couldnt have done anything without going to a magistrate for a warrant or something and that would have meant tomorrow mind yourselves gomer bawled the arm of the digger swung the bucket dipped with a slurping sucking sound jane wondered if minnies exasperated spirit was watching him now the bucket clanged and shivered ucking nora gomer snarled the diggers hydraulic feet gripped at the slippery earth the whole machine bucked and gomer rose from the seat like a cowboy he turned and spat out his cigarette end eirion can you get the ole torch to that see what we got there but it was a just a big rock too big for the digger to shift gomer and eirion had to manhandle it out of the way it took ages they both got filthy after about half an hour there was a new bank of earth three feet high at right angles to the one they were excavating it was like some first world war landscape jane wandered over to the digger gomer look suppose sophie and i go back and see whats happened to mum is that ok sure tbe gomer sat back in the headlight beams his glasses brownfilmed we ent gettin nowhere fast yere bloody daft idea most likely gotter put all this shit back too fore we leaves it was worth a try gomer you arent usually wrong ok look well get back just as soon as we mr parry eirions face turned round from the gougedout bank ar oh bloody hell mr parry eirion slurped desperately out of the clay he dropped the lamp and his muddy hands went to his mouth jane heard him vomiting the sick slapping into the mud gomer was out of his seat grabbing the hand lamp from where it had rolled stay there jane bloody stay there jane froze where she was in the clinging mud all those crass remarks shed made to mum after mumford had been after the radio reports it should have been her not eirion she deserved to face this horror sophie was hopping towards her what is it theyve found something then lets call the police he needs to make sure sophie realizing with a horrible freezing feeling that gomer wasnt in any position to make sure of this only she was she would have to face it sorry eirion came back his baseball cap had gone his face gleamed with greasy clay and sweat there were touchingly childish mud streaks around his mouth where hed wiped it with his hand that was inexcusable irene it was the smell i suppose he shuddered i just put my hand down this kind of fissure and this whole wall of stuff came down and like oh god he turned away pushing slimy fingers through his hair gomer came back for the spade is it jane was shocked at the weakness of her own voice ang about gomer said noncommittally sophie said her voice dry and clipped is it mr parry well likely oh for heavens sake give me that torch sophie snatched the rubbercovered lamp from a caterpillar of the minijcb and stalked off into the murk gomer followed her with the spade called back over his shoulder better stay there girl ent nothin you can do i kind of think there is actually jane said sadly she slithered after him towards the bank eirion plunged into the mud grabbed her no irene im the only one of us whos actually seen her jane believe me that is not going to help you what even over the clatter of three engines she heard sophies moan ahead of her the newly unearthed soil and clay was shining almost white in the intersecting beams and had that multihued stretched look like when you bent a mars bar in half sophie came back slapping dirt from her hands go back now sophie its a woman could it be barb cashmere and tweed sophie said shes wearing cashmere and tweed what does she look like ive seen her you see when she first came up to mum at the funeral come on jane im not a little kid you know let me just jane eirion took her hand in his mudencrusted paw we dont know what she looks like sophie said coldly someone seems to have hacked her face to pieces before they buried her sophies camel coat was ruined scumbag alone in the yard robin looked back at the farmhouse lit by the underfed porchlight and it was like he was finally waking up here were the oncewhite walls stained and crumbling to reveal rubble underneath there were the four front windows small and sunken like squinting eyes then it just like hit him in the gut what a dump what was he doing here stranded in this squalid hovel with a coughing stove and a pile of wet wood and his wife coming and going like some kind of elemental spirit and his portfolios coming back marked piece of shit this whole godforsaken place rejecting him all day hed felt a madness around him wild fluctuations of mood chasms of disaster opening up at his feet like the potholes in the yard and then the sun suddenly breaking out again the puddles streaked with rainbows i still think kirk could be persuaded to listen to reason the elegant and cultured ned bain could change it all about even though bain was doing this not for robin whom he didnt really need but for betty whom he apparently did whom everyone did even witches talked in hushed tones about betty there were all kinds of people in wicca and the ones you needed to be most wary of tended to be the men guys whod read about group sex and ritual flagellation guys whod heard you could learn to magic your dick into staying hard all night long every coven attracted a few of these and they never stuck it long and they were the trash end of the craft and at the other end were women like betty about whom even witches talked in hushed tones i was very much looking forward to meeting her ned bain had said word gets around and yet since betty had returned home she and bain seemed hardly to have spoken as though neither wanted the other to read their private agenda because there sure as hell were private agendas here even stupid and decidedly unpsychic robin could sense that maybe like high priest and high priestess bain and betty were communicating without words robins fists tightened he couldnt bear the thought of that the night was as cold as you could get without inches of snow on the ground but it was bright with a lastquarter moon and a scattering of stars so what in the names of all the gods were they waiting for the church itself was primed for its reversion to the old religion a hundred fat candles were in place plus garden torches and sconces and fireworks for when it was all over there was a purposeful silence around the place unbroken even by crazy vivvie and flutyvoiced max even the goddamned christians had cooled their hymnsinging robin had had to get out of the house he couldnt stand the tension had kept getting up and walking around irritating the witches who were sitting in the parlour hanging out waiting their robes in view of the extreme cold they were at least starting this one robed stowed in bags at their feet and the crown of lights ready in the centre of the room but whose house was this anyway hed wanted betty to come outside with him confide in him she was a great priestess but she was still his wife for heavens sake but betty had avoided his eyes was there something she didnt want him to know something secretly confided to her by bain he who would later join with her in the great rite simulated simulated right robins nails dug into his palms bain was a handsome and he guessed very sexual guy usually invariably in fact the hours before any sabbat were lit with this gorgeous anticipation tonight was the sabbat an event likely to be more resonant in robins view than the collapse of the berlin wall than the return of hong kong to the chinese this should be the finest night of his life so how come as he walked back toward the house all he felt was a sick apprehension the pub car park the point where the village streets come together is full of nothing much coppers and reporters yes but where were all the funny christians then gomer leaves the truck on the doubleyellows outside the school and that boy eirion brings the land rover in behind him eirions going along with mrs hill to tell the coppers what theyve dug up better coming from somebody cultured see so the cops move faster besides which gomer and young jane need to find the vicar in a hurry on account of theres somebody out there has done for barbara thomas then took what gomer judges to be a logsplitter to her face before her was planted in prossers ground one of the telly cameramen is pointing his lens at the minijcb a boredlooking woman reporter asks what have you been digging sprouts gomer tells her hes spotted a light in the old school thats now become dr colls surgery why dont we give this a try girl he asks jane vicar was in yere earlier we knows that they walk into the yard dont seem two minutes since this old place was a working school dont seem two minutes since gomer had friends went to this school thats life too bloody short too short for bloody old wallop and bullshit so who should they meet but dr coll himself in the doorway coming out gomer stands his ground and dr colls got to take a step back into the building has to be a reason going way back that gomer dont care for doctors but he bloody dont and thats the only mercy about the way minnie went no long years of being at the mercy of no bloody doctors look im afraid surgerys long over it bloody ent pal gomer lets the youngster in and then slams the door behind them all i know you dont i dr coll says with a vague bit of a smile must be close on sixty now but he never seems to change dapper the word is beard a bit grey now but never allowed to go ratty gomer parry plant hire gomer says ah yes never goes near no bloody doctors meself but you might recall as how you used to peddle drugs to a friend o mine danny thomas i really dont think so the smile coming off like grease on a rag and terry penney remember but thats all water up the ole brook now ennit if youre trying to tell me dr coll says severely that youre hoping ill supply you with proscribed drugs i think you should decide to leave very quickly in case you didnt notice theres a police van parked directly outside shows what kind of a bloody nerve you got then ennit doc mr parry them coppers knew what we knew theyd be in yere turnin the place over are you drunk man young jane picks up the thread now we know you killed that old lady in new radnor youve probably killed like loads of people youre probably like that dr shipman all right dr coll turning nasty at last i havent got all night to listen to a lot of ludicrous nonsense out of here the pair of you gomer shoves himself back against the door dr colls a fair bit younger than him and taller but then most blokes are dont make no odds when youre madder than what they are and gomer is sorely mad now guess who just got dug up doc dr coll tries to grab the door handle but gomer knocks his wrist away with his own wrist which hurts like buggery gomer grits his teeth remember barbara thomas come to see you the other week bout her sister menna likely youre one o the last people poor ole barbara talked to fore some bugger ripped the face off her then planted her in prossers bottom field down where the harchaeologists was colour drains out of the docs face something beautiful gomers well heartened by this course the cops dont know barbara seen you fore she got done cops dont know nothin about you an weal the bloody hindwell trust all the doolally patients you recommended to weal for sortin their wills youre making no sense to me dr coll coming over with all the conviction of a bloke caught with a vanload of videos at two in the morning saying hes just been to a bloody car boot sale well then gomer folds his arms ill be straight with you dr death all we wants to know right now is where we finds the vicar the lady vicar we finds the vicar well likely have that much to talk about could be well into tomorrow fore we gets round to makin police statements bout anythin else you gets my meanin leavin quite a bit o time for a feller to pack his range rover with money and bugger off ive got a wife and family dr coll says he blurts it out like hes just suddenly realized anybody else but a bloody doctor and gomer could almost feel sorry for him wheres my mum young jane screams in his face a large chalice of red wine stood on the temple altar with the scourge and the handbell the wand for air the sword for fire royally pissed off by now sitting just inside the door on the doormat for chrissakes robin wanted to suggest they share it out or at least open another bottle across the parlour betty sensed his impatience and sent him a small warning smile the moment was close to intimate her face was warm and young and wonderful in the glow from the tilley lamp which sat in the centre of the floor what would have been the centre of the circle if theyd drawn one but tonights circle would be drawn outside if it ever happened though they were robed and ready maybe this was no night for naked and anyway robin could appreciate the need for a sense of ceremony he also loved to see betty in the loose green medieval gown shed made herself two three years ago robin just wore this kind of grey woollen tunic he didnt have anything more ceremonial but then he would be peripheral tonight an extra a spearcarrier ned bain in a long black robe sat on a bare flagstone below the window opposite the hearth where the heatless twigfire burned he was obviously listening but robin suspected he was not listening to max in preparation max had led a meditation on the nature of the border and read to them in translation an old welsh poem about the death of pwyll son of llywarch the old who sang when my son was killed his hair was bloody and flowed on both banks of the brook robin had been painting it in his head that long bloodied hair was a gift to an illustrator wicca worked in strange ways he himself might not be able to see spirits or know the future but his imagination could be sent into instant freeflow by any image you cared to pitch him hell that was something on this holy celtic night max intoned let us close our eyes and picture all around us the ghostly monuments of our ancestors we are in a wide silent valley the stones in a grey mist around us but over it soars burfa hill and we can dimly make out the notch marking the rising of the sun at the equinox in the black of the night is born the bright day the new spring and we too shall be born again into a new day a new era that was it there was silence the stones had loomed out of the mist for robin his soul reached for the new day but he dispatched it back to his subconscious hed had enough he shifted uncomfortably on his mat and across the room closest to the altar betty saw him and knew he was about to say something instead she did but first she smiled sadly in the lamplight and it was for him and robin thought his heart would burst with love and then betty said very quietly once not so very long ago there were two stepbrothers jane and gomer hurried across the street making for the hall it was jane thought crazy to let the doctor just go but gomer said that if they didnt want to spend the rest of the night in some police station they didnt have a choice the doctor had told them mum had gone off with father ellis and he knew father ellis was up in the hall conducting a service the doctor had then put his dignity back together walked out across the yard his medical bag swinging from his wrist as if he was off on a house call scumbag you couldnt miss the village hall with that cross lit up on the roof as soon as you turned up the track to the steps you could hear the singing a song which had no tune but lots of tunes and endless words but no sense jane started racing up the steps saw that the hall was blazing with light but at the same time she became aware that gomer behind her was panting quite painfully it had been a gruelling night and you tended to forget how old he was and how many rollups he smoked she stopped halfway up and waited for him to catch up she reckoned afterwards after the glass in the porch burst and the flames came out in a great gouging whooomp of heat that gomers lungs had probably saved their lives laid to unrest the laurel alley later its leaves would be crisp with frost merrily could see only the alleys outline rippling black walls under the worn pebble moon we could use a torch amply bright enough judith said if you know the way which she of course did she took merrilys arm leading her down to the fork in the drive mind the step now merrily remembered mariannes hand on her arm as the police burst through things you oughta know judiths grip was firmer judith was without trepidation what did judith believe in not ghosts perhaps not even god except maybe some strictly local deity the guardian spirit of old hindwell at the corner of the rectory where the drive split merrily looked for a car but there was just an empty space jw weal had gone to don his masonic apron it must look like a postage stamp on him lodge night a crude ritual structure to further stiffen his already rigid life the police had gone too now there seemed to have been a windingdown of the action at the gates of st michaels nothing to see or hear when merrily and judith had walked past the farm entrance they dropped down to the tarmac and then the crazy paving to the lawn sharp conifers were all around pricking stars merrily glanced back once at the greystone rectory at the angular bulge of the bay window lightless no magisterial shadows of furniture no frenetic flickering crackling stop it something bothering you mrs watkins nothing at all mrs prosser at the end of the lawn pale grey and shining slightly was the squat conical building the wine store ice house now tomb merrily stumbled on a lump in the lawn judiths arm easily found her waist helped her up merrily tightened inside it was about here that weal had wrapped his arms around her lifting her whirling her around menna merrily shivered suddenly and judith knew youre frightened im cold she clutched her blue airline bag to her side as you wish judith bit the end of one of her leather gloves to pull it off and produced from a pocket something that jingled the keys to the mausoleum but it will im afraid be even colder in here when betty had been talking for a while calm succinct devastating someone actually got up went over and switched on all the lights hard reality time it was a starkly meaningful moment robin stared in cold dismay around the parlour with its damp patches its dull fire of smoky sizzling green twigs its sad assembly of robed witches and the crown of lights on the floor like some unfinished product of a kids handicraft class left behind at the end of the semester it all looked like some halfassed fancy dress party that never quite took off the air was sick with confusion incomprehension embarrassment affecting everyone here except for ned bain who was still entirely relaxed in the lotus position his butt on the stoneflag floor and betty in her green medieval robe remained expressionless having come out with stuff about ned that robin with his famously huge imagination couldnt begin to fathom how shed gotten hold of was that where shed been last night obtaining ned bains life story and never saying a word to robin because he was this bigmouthed asshole whom all subtlety deserted the second he put away his paints he felt royally betrayed shafted up the ass by everyone like how many of them already knew this how many knew that nicholas ellis was bains stepbrother who covered up for his old lady after she stabbed bains father to death was this some british wiccan conspiracy to which only he was denied access but robin only had to look at vivvies pinched and frozen face to be pretty damn sure that few if any of them had been aware of it all they mightve known about neds father and the lingering bitterness over his killing but not about the real identity of the saintly nick ellis ned max came to his feet nervously massaging his massive beard i do rather think were due an explanation all of them except for betty were now looking over at blackrobed ned bain still relaxed but moody now kind of saturnine betty having rolled a grenade into the room just gazed down into her lap ned brought his hands together elbows tucked inside his knees the sleeves of his robe falling back he smiled ruefully slowly shaking his head then in the face of maxs evident disapproval he brought out a packet of cigarettes and a small lighter and they had to wait while he organized himself a smoke first of all what betty says is broadly correct he sounded kind of detached like it was dope he was smoking my father married frances wesson and our intelligent freethinking liberal household changed almost overnight into a strict christian graceatmealtimes churchtwiceonsunday bloody purgatory icons on every wall religious tracts on every flat surface and the beatific face of my smug pious little stepbrother well of course i hated him i hated him long before he lied to the police there was another smoky silence so simon wesson changed his name max prompted i believe ellis was francess maiden name shed already met the appalling marshall mcallman during one of his early missions to the uk but this only became evident later in other words said max too obviously anxious to help ned clear up this little misunderstanding with the promise of american nouveaux riches your father had somewhat outlived his usefulness oh ive conjured a number of scenarios max in the years since none of which allows for the possibility of my fathers death being selfdefence simon knows the truth i realized part of my destiny was to make him bloody well confess it it became a focus for me led me into areas i might never have entered into wicca robin saw betty look up her green eyes hard but lit with intelligence and insight there would be no getouts no short cuts ned bain took another drag at his cigarette id tried to be a simple iconoclast at first telling myself i was an atheist then for a while id be about nineteen i was into ceremonial magic until i realized that was as cramped and pompous as francess high church christianity only paganism appeared free of such crap and there was a great sense of release naked elemental no hierarchy it was what i needed betty said without looking up how long have you known about this place oh only since simon arrived here since he took over the church hall since he became father ellis when he first came back to britain he was a curate in the northeast but that was no use to me he wasnt doing anything that left him open id had people watching him in america for years theres an enormous pagan network over there now happy to be accessed and other links too like kali three betty said robin saw bain throw her a short knifelike glance she didnt even react i used several agencies he turned away like this was an irrelevance and then when father ellis began to make waves on the welsh border i came down to take a look for myself fell rather in love with the place bain then talked of how the archaeological excavation was under way at the time just across the brook from the church how the immense importance of the site as a place of ancient worship was becoming apparent one of the archaeologists told me hed dearly love to know what lay under that church circular churchyard prechristian site i took a walk over there myself and met some eagleeyed old boy who told me hed just bought it major wilshire robin said he couldnt believe how this was shaping up something like that i didnt pay too much attention to him as i was being knocked sideways by the ambience it was while i was talking to this guy that i had the vision i suppose a moment beyond inspiration when past and future collided in the present boom i became aware how wonderful and apt it would be if the power of this place could be channelled if this church was to become a temple again under the very nose of your fundamentalist christian brother betty said quietly in fact bain raised his voice irritated it was rather the other way round for the first time i was almost grateful to simon for bringing me here ironic really but the church had now been sold and that was that i went home to london you can imagine my reaction when just a few months later i learned that st michaels farm and old hindwell church were on the market again no betty said coldly what exactly was your reaction betty said max i really dont think we should prejudge this ned said simply that i wanted it to be bought by someone sympathetic to the pagan cause bulbs finally started flashing big time inside robins head the actual tomb was bigger than merrily had expected perhaps seven feet long close to three feet wide more than three feet deep from outside with the funeral party of prossers dr coll and nick ellis grouped around it it had resembled a stone horse trough now under the cream light from the wroughtiron electric lanterns hanging above the head and the foot of the tomb she could see that it was far more ornate a complex design of linked crosses had been carved out of the side panels the lid was not stone but perhaps as good as an oak slab four inches thick the great tomb had been concreted into its stone plinth all local stone judith said proudly from the quarry got that done quickly didnt he judith closed the oak door so their voices were sharpened by the walls of the mausoleum which were solid concrete inches thick the chamber was about twenty feet square nothing in it but the tomb and the two of them and dead menna judith said mal walters the monumental mason is a longestablished client of jw mal worked through the night right judith prosser stood by the head of the tomb disquietingly priestlike in her tubular black quilted coat not quite cassocklength but close her short strong hair had been bleached her pewtercoloured earrings were thin metal pyramids she was waiting behind the shade of a sardonic smile i thought merrily put down the airline bag shed brought from the car the junior exorcists starter kit i thought id keep it simple but should she even be doing it here rather than in that big room behind the bay window where the baptism had taken place yes she should she didnt want the complication of having to try to restore peace to a room where the atmosphere had apparently been ravaged by another priest also she had been asked by mennas next of kin to calm the spirit no one had invited her to deal with that room least of all weal she didnt want to go in there didnt want to enter his actual house in his absence she really needed guidance if shed predicted this situation might develop shed have rung her spiritual adviser huw owen in advance but thered been no time for that judith moved to a double switch on the wall and the lantern at the head of the tomb went out leaving mennas concrete cell softly lit like a drawing room are you a christian mrs prosser thats a funny question i know you go to church i know you support father ellis i dont really know what you believe nor will you ever judith said tartly whats your point what are you getting at do you believe in the unquiet dead judith prosser regarded merrily across the tomb her eyes half closed the dead are always quiet mrs watkins the dead are dead and only the weakminded are afraid of them they cannot touch us nor i assume she laid a forefinger gently on mennas small inscription can we touch them meaning mr weal mr weals a tragic figure isnt it he wanted what he thought menna was he liked it that she was quiet he liked it that she was polite to her father and did not go with boys a real threedimensional woman was far too complicated for jw he wanted i suppose a shadow of a woman oh my god merrily said you have to tell me this if not you yourself then has anyone else seen the spirit of menna weal judith made a scornful pfft noise she half turned and began to unbutton her coat anyway sweeping the coat back to place her hands on her hips turning to face merrily time is getting on what do you propose to do here my girl well im going to say some prayers what i really should be doing i mean to be halfway sure of this is holding a requiem eucharist and for that there really ought to be a few of us like i said this morning it would be better if wed had mr weal with us i mean with us and as i said that would be imposs or even barbara if barbara were here it merrily heard her own words rebound from the concrete walls she lurched away from the tomb as if it were mined such a vast tomb for one small body judith looked mildly curious someone walk over your grave mrs watkins merrily knew shed gone pale judith go ahead said mrs prosser were quite alone almost merrily swallowed the scarf felt tight around her throat what do you think jw weal would have done if hed discovered that barbara buckingham had found out about father elliss exorcism of menna performed at his behest judiths eyes were not laughing what on earth am i supposed to say to that she stepped back now they were both looking at the tomb oh i see judith said merrily said nothing you mean after he dumped the car in the claerwen reservoir what precisely did he do with the body merrily said nothing does barbara perhaps lie below her poor sister were her remains in those fine english clothes already set in concrete when mennas coffin was laid to unrest merrily bit her lip come on woman is that what you meant it looks very deep merrily said and as you said the monumental mason worked all night all right judiths voice rang with challenge then lets find out shall we merrily found shed backed against the door oh mrs watkins did you think poor jw could bring himself to say such a final farewell to his beloved what other reason would a man like him have for going to all this trouble she pointed from back here merrily didnt even have to bend down to see that the tombs handsome oakwood lid was hinged its very heavy all the same judith said you may have to help me merrily remembered when she was a little kid being towed along by her mother to make the arrangements for her grans funeral and how the undertakers inner door had been left open merrilys mother thinking she was too young to understand but not too young to absorb the smell of formaldehyde from the embalming room shed been four years old the formaldehyde alternating with the equally piercing tang of furniture polish making her afraid to go to sleep that night and she didnt know why there was only this grim opaque fear the sense of a deep unpleasant mystery which returned when judith threw back the solid oak lid of the tomb judith hadnt needed help with it after all she looked down into the tomb and smiled the dead are always quiet mrs watkins the dead are dead and only the weakminded are afraid of them but merrily who since ordination had seen any number of laidout bodies was afraid the same grim opaque fear and she didnt know why what would be the point anyway judith had only done this for effect to put herself in control from the start and if the body of barbara buckingham was in there too it would be in the base set in concrete never to be discovered certainly not in jw weals lifetime menna though menna was readily accessible it was clear that judith was not now looking down on merely a coffin lid close it please merrily said how do you know it isnt barbara come on see for yourself this is intrusion merrily said it was always intrusion mrs watkins then close the lid and ill say some prayers and well go if i close the lid judith said she wont be able to hear you will she the whole mausoleum stank of embalming fluid merrily needed air a fortifying cigarette she went back to the door dont open it you silly girl the light judith let go of the lid and it hung for a moment and then fell against the stone side of the tomb with a shuddering crash leaving the interior fully exposed the single lantern over the foot of the tomb swung slightly and merrily saw a quiver of parchmentcoloured lace from inside come over yere mrs watkins judith said this is wrong merrilys hand went to the centre of her breast where under her coat under her jumper the pectoral cross lay christ be with me christ within me christ behind me come and see how peaceful she looks itll make you feel better then well say goodnight to her come yere christ before me merrily walked into the centre of the mausoleum if necessary shed close the lid herself you silly girl judith reached out suddenly and grabbed her by the arm pulled her close dont be afraid ill look after you i dont think so as the formaldehyde seared the back of merrilys throat the lantern swung again at the sudden movement and shot spears of light and shadow from mennas swaddled feet to mennas exposed face see how peaceful she looks no that night in the hospital with the freshly applied water on her brow menna had appeared simply and calmly dead the body hadnt from a distance seemed much different during her funeral now embalmed only days later her face was pinched and rigid her mouth downturned lips slightly parted to reveal the teeth and that particularly merrily thought in revulsion was surely not the work of the embalmer she recoiled slightly judiths arm was around her gently squeezing thank you merrily said now i know it isnt barbara youre trembling merrily felt judiths breath on her face dont she said mildly things you oughta know marianne had said and earlier that judy she took you outside dint she i was glad when she did that its been hard for you merrily hasnt it judith said quite tenderly all the pressures all the things you didnt understand im getting there marianne had been in shock marianne needed help marianne who sometimes preyed on men had herself become vulnerable pitiable accessible yes i believe you are judith said tonelessly beast is come jane watched eaten up with dread as the multitude assembled where two lanes in the village converged the uniformed chief inspector in charge tried to organize some kind of rollcall but it wasnt going to be easy only two people known to be missing and one of them was mum once the fire brigade was in four machines two welsh two english the police had sealed off old hindwell firefighters with breathing apparatus tried to get into the village hall but were eventually ordered out for their own safety jane was there when the order was given and that was when she began to sob when soon after the brigade got there the porchs wooden roof had collapsed lighting up the night and several sitka spruce many people fell down on their knees and prayed to the violent orange sky jane was frantic and clung to eirion by the side of the police transit in the filthy choking air she didnt remember when eirion had appeared or where hed appeared from sophie was here too now and many local people had come out of their homes and gomer gomer was a deeply reluctant hero the media kept wanting to talk to him they wanted to hear him describe how hed spotted the flames and gone round to the rear entrance and opened it up and guided christians to safety gomer kept saying later boys all right but later he was muttering bugger off as the firefighters went on blasting thousands of gallons into the roaring hall and still they hadnt found mum jane by now hyperactive with fear had dragged eirion into the middle of the milling people and she kept shouting through her tears small dark woman in a tatty duffel coat anybody anybody but nobody had seen her nobody though a number elected to pray for her not nearly as many however as were praying for father ellis last seen apparently stepping from the stage to sing with the crowd nobody at that time had been aware of the fire in the porch because of the fire doors and nobody had heard it because of the glorious exultation of the holy spirit amplified through their hearts and lungs nobody had known a thing in fact until a skinny little man with wild white hair and thick glasses had appeared at the bottom of the hall and had begun bawling at them to bloody well shut up and follow him by then the fire doors were surrounded by flame and the air was turning brown and the tongues were torn with coughing now janes arms were gripped firmly sophie said incisively into her ear jane she is not in there do you understand she cannot possibly be in there jane opened her mouth to protest and took in a wad of smoke and was bent double with the coughing and heard a man shouting in rage theyve found a petrol can obvious what this meant jane straightened up eyes streaming a seniorlooking policeman was saying we dont know anything yet so dont anybody go jumping to conclusions but he was wasting his breath because everybody knew what the petrol can meant and then suddenly the white monk was there he was just suddenly there about thirty yards away from the crowd up against the schoolyard wall janes feeling was that hed been sitting quietly in one of the cars or something staying well out of it and had come out casually when everyones attention was diverted by the sound of the porch crashing down or something two women in their thirties noticed him first and it was like mary magdalene and the other woman finding an empty tomb and then turning around and there he was they ran towards him shouting thank god thank god thank god and it just kind of escalated like that jane saw all these people falling down on their knees at his feet and all shouting praise god and thank you god and some of them even looked like local people jane heard a tut of disdain from sophie and for the first time felt something approaching genuine affection for the cool cathedral woman in the wreckage of her camel coat there wasnt a mark on the white monk please he was saying dont you worry about me im fine he bent to one of the women stand up please he raised her up and hugged her and then he walked away from the wall and his arms were raised palms towards the crowd fingers splayed stand up everyone stand up and smell the foetid stench of satan there was this shattering hush feel the heat of the dragons breath a woman moaned and know that the beast is come it was you in the dingy parlourturnedtemple robin stared at ned bain bain didnt look at robin you had the estate agents send us the stuff not directly for the first time the guy was showing some discomfort we put out feelers through the pagan federation to see if anyone might be interested we betty said i did but like how come you didnt just buy this place yourself robin was still only half getting this and reveal himself to ellis betty said before he could get his plans in hand coulda bought it through a third party he has betty said acidly i dont think thats quite fair said max there was hardly time for plans except perhaps in spheres beyond our own im inclined to believe this came about as a spontaneous response to what one might call serendipitous circumstance max betty was laying on that heavy patience robin knew too well do you think for one minute that wed all be here today trying to pull something together at the eleventh hour if vivvie hadnt crassly shot her mouth off on a piece of latenight trash television and alerted ellis to what he immediately perceived as the devil on his doorstep no ned would have waited for beltane lammas samhain and got it all nicely set up for maximum impact max started to speak then his beard knitted back together george was up now squat stubbly george partner of vivvie look people i think that however this all came about weve got to put it behind us for tonight if we allow it to destroy this seminal sabbat under the spotlight of the entire pagan world we are going to regret it for the rest of our lives man i agree that maybe neds not been as upfront as he mightve been i know we could start to accuse him of only setting this thing up to have this ellis man go down in history totally humiliated as the priest who lost his church to the old religion but its more than that betty said for a start he set us up and in a place which none of us it doesnt matter betty we cannot let personal issues fuck up a seminal event we have to hold the sabbat we have to reconsecrate this church in the names of mannon and brigid and george stopped betty had stood up in this damp chilly room she was a heat source the only one here who didnt look kind of tawdry she looked like a goddess ask him what hes waiting for she demanded please george wilted back just leave it ned bain didnt move hes waiting for his stepbrother betty said hes waiting for the hymns to start up only louder hes waiting for his stepbrother to lead the enemy to the gate but betty we need that tension george said thats what this is about the changeover in the dawn of the year the dawn of a millennium a pretender is banished christ you mean if you like i prefer to think in terms of the warlike michael ive got nothing against christ but he was at best an irrelevance yeah christ if you like i dont like betty said were an alternative were not the opposition i mean he might be he and ellis both whatever else they are whatever they claim to represent its completely soured by what lies between them i dont want that i dont want to go into that old fouled place on the back of twentyfive years of pentup hatred i suggest everybody gets changed and leaves now howls of protest and serious consternation at this shared by robin in some ways the recent revelations had made him feel better about the situation the great ned bain brought down to human level bets look he said hoarsely you cant precisely say we were set up we decided to go for this place all the omens said it was right at the time plus we had the promise of the blackmore deal and all that it could bring we were on a roll ah yes betty said the blackmore deal ned bain shifted robin felt a pulse of alarm i still think kirk could be persuaded to listen to reason this was all gonna crash now the rainbows in the puddles turning black robin love bettys eyes had misted or was it his own kirk blackmores been working you like a puppet hasnt he all your highs and all your lows he was important sure robin looked at ned ned was staring at the stone flags in the floor elbow on knee and arm outstretched cigarette loose between his fingers and suddenly robin knew i guess youre kirk blackmore huh bain didnt reply the room was silent robin turned to betty how did you find that out inside his rough woollen tunic he was starting to sweat like a hog some friends of mine got some information from the internet blackmores this notorious recluse supposedly living on a welsh mountain and communicating only by fax people speculate endlessly on the net about the true identities of authors publishers often write novels under pseudonyms usually lurid massmarket novels they might not want to be associated with im really sorry robin neds brow was suddenly a little shiny but he couldve bought this place out of his small change betty continued it was your destiny not mine bain said calmly at the time bullshit robin said quietly any time you wanted to get out id have taken it off your hands you mean like after we ran out of money after wed taken all the shit from the local people after ellis got safely kicked out on his ass by the church after our marriage got smashed up on the fucking rocks there was always this growing atmosphere of turbulence betty said we were made to feel insecure from the first he wanted us to feel beleaguered maybe a little scared she looked down at bain you needed this didnt you were you working on it with your coven ned or was it some magical construction of your own long and intrictate like one of your novels generating unrest backed up by a campaign of mysterious letters and phone calls directed at ellis the dragon rising were you working towards some kind of cataclysm only forestalled by stupid vivvie giving it away resulting in this farce vivvie snarled what are you these days betty because youre not one of us any more bain said if you really want to discuss this im perfectly willing did you buy the witch box from major wilshire did you have someone deliver it to us place it on our doorstep betty paused and were you were you really that surprised when major wilshire fell from his ladder ned bain sprang up in a single movement dont you fucking dare his stiffened finger inches from bettys soft cheek which was enough robin lurched across the room to the altar george reached out to stop him but robin shook george savagely away he felt the weight of his hair on his shoulders he heard warbling sirens in the night he saw through a deepening mist he remembered the pit of desperation that swallowed him when al delaney of talisman had called to say he wants someone else to do it robin he doesnt want you robin wrenched from the altar the great ceremonial sword no toy this no lightweight replica but three and a half feet of hightensile steel robin raised it in both hands high above his head he heard vivvie screaming snakeskin merrily said you really did look after her didnt you you really took care of her judith prosser adjusted a fold in the corpses shroud i was the only one ever took care of her could we close the lid now judith didnt touch the lid why dont you conduct your ceremony merrily take off your coat make yourself into a priest taking control again merrily moved to the head of the coffin looking down towards mennas feet her airline bag with the bible the prayer texts the flask of holy water stood by the door why dont you finally leave her alone why dont you just accept that maybe youve done enough harm meaning what precisely mrs watkins judith said briskly she went to stand at the foot of the coffin from where she could observe the faces of both merrily and menna you had her on the pill from an early age dr colls good like that isnt he ministering to the real needs of the local people dr coll understands these things shed have been pregnant by fourteen if we hadnt done something mmm her father really was abusing her wasnt he maybe over quite a long period judith shrugged and of course you knew that we didnt talk about such things then other peoples domestic arrangements that was their own affair yeah yeah but also because whenever it happened she would come to you oh well yes almost a mile judith smiled incredibly it looked like a smile of nostalgia almost a mile across the fields to our farm to my parents farm in tears usually or you could see where the tears had dried in the wind and you would comfort her judith breathed in very slowly her black coat flung back breasts pushing out the rugby shirt merrily thought of her in the toilet at the village hall tenderly ministering to marianne always victims always vulnerability confusion helplessness terror desperation like menna alone on that remote hill farm with her beast of a father what a turnon that must have been merrily said judiths face became granite dont overstep the mark mrs watkins why didnt you just take her to the police to give evidence against her own father apart from the fact that as i say such things were not done yere in those days not talked about how would she have managed on her own with her father in prison how would she have coped probably have been taken into care and thats probably the best thing that could have happened in mennas case merrily paused if not in yours you dont know anything about this area judith snapped social services pah we have always managed our own social services im sure especially after you got married and you were operating from the perfect secure social platform marriage to gareth prosser councillor magistrate on this committee that committee big man dull bugger mind lucky hes got judy to do his thinkin for him a very satisfactory arrangement that in almost all areas of life judith needed gareth for the framework the structure the tradition a facade and a good one what did sexual orientation have to do with it fancy meaningless phrase from off selfsacrifice was sometimes necessary for a while the foundations of rural life merrily said a husband a farm and sons preferably two of them in case something happens to one of them or the other grows up strange and wants to live in cardiff and be an interior designer judith smiled thinly oh youre such a clever little bitch what about your life mrs watkins they say your husband died some years ago does the love of god meet all your needs merrily let it go when youre married to a man like gareth nothing needs to change you go to menna she comes to you and then when her father dies you have the contingency plan for her jeffery weal good old jw the solid silent family solicitor a local man and discreet he was too old for her yes too rigid in his ways perhaps but it was what she was used to isnt it she was a flimsy delicate thing she would always need protection what could be more perfect his clothes smelling of mothballs and little or no experience of women and living just a few hundred yards down the hill from the prosser farm you arranged that ideal marriage judith you probably coached menna in what would be expected of her but she was used to all that anyway poor kid shed always been a kid a sad pale little girl he must have frightened her a bit at first the size of him he frightens me but that would be no bad thing either for you if she needed a lot more comforting judiths hands were on her hips now you have overstepped the mark and of course she must continue to take her pill because children would not be a good thing at all having a child can make someone grow up awfully quickly she was not strong enough for children judith said sullenly was that how weal eventually found out about you and menna because he wanted children with the family business to pass on to them pills what pills are these menna she put up a hand no all right i reckon he did find out though didnt he you reckon judith sneered you guess you theorize is that why you wanted me to come here tonight to find out what direction the speculation was taking id guess the answer is that you dont really know for sure whether weal knows about you and menna or not but if he does he wouldnt say a word to you its not the local way besides i suppose you were useful to him i expect there were aspects of menna he couldnt deal with maybe shed finally changed becoming a woman you dont know what youre but that wouldnt be awfully good for you either would it to have menna becoming a bit worldlywise as she reached middle age what actually was her mental state i wouldnt know but my god merrily pointed into the tomb look at her now look at her face its all coming out now isnt it in that face god almighty judith its almost turning into your face judith prosser stood very still seemed hardly to be breathing merrily moved away back towards the door you know what i think what id bet big money on she was aware of her voice rising in pitch more than a bit scared now of where this was inexorably leading when weal had ellis exorcize his wife that was nothing to do with her father at all ellis seemed to be able to demonize anything and then get rid of it he stopped your boy from nicking cars didnt he so maybe weal thought that nicholas ellis could purge menna of the demon the demon that was you merrily was shattered she hadnt quite realized what she had been about to say but the evident truth of it was explosive judith took a swift step towards her then stopped and said brightly too brightly you are off your head mrs watkins you do know that she laughed her eyes glittering with rage that was only the half of it though merrily said to defuse things a little the next part would be the baptism of the two of them in the same little bowl of holy water i guess something medieval going on there the fusion of two souls merrily stared down at the soured face in the tomb in the medieval church baptism was exorcism exorcism charms had been included in marriage services or blessing of the sick pregnant women were exorcized too in those days demons were getting expelled from people like tapeworms a scenario late afternoon the sky like sheet metal the baywindowed room northfacing so not much of the sunset visible a cold room and a cold time of day menna standing there like some white slave her skin waxy her arms like straws perhaps a bruise forming blue where ellis had gripped her roughly in his mind gripping not her but it perhaps she was wrapping her arms around herself and shivering or was she entirely unmoved compliant accepting this ritual as just another of those things men liked to do to her do you embrace god elliss customizing of the rite jw weal standing there big as god menna hesitating perhaps a little worried by the word embrace and thoughts of what else god might do to her after this do you embrace him i yes yes around the high white room dark oak chairs with long pointed spines standing like judge and jury do you renounce the evil which corrupts that which god has created and the sick and sinful perverted desires which draw you away from the love of god menna beginning to cry again say it her head going back a sniff say i so renounce them i s so renounce them i cant begin to know where ellis derived that rite from merrily said or if he made it up but theres an awfully long tradition of bodged religion around the forest isnt there i dont know what you mean judith prosser said sulkily like whats the good of religion if it isnt practical whatever he did it was nasty and unhealthy and yet and yet somehow it worked judith in some horrible insidious way it bloody well worked and he has her now merrily felt she was drifting away on a formaldehyde fog sailing so far from the land of normality that she was afraid of never getting back there got her to himself at least part of her part of something something half realized fluttering after him like a crippled bird its obscene there was a slithering sound judith was shedding her long black quilted coat like a snakeskin no gods land even jane could see the police didnt quite know how to handle this any more a routine peacekeeping assignment had turned into a confusion of arson and murder theyd taken over the doctors surgery as an incident room for two separate investigations which might be totally unconnected jane and gomer were keeping well back from it all they stood with sophie and eirion in the shadow of the rear entry to the pub yard gomer had a ciggy going and looked more his old self jane too felt more in control since sophie had taken her to the chief fire officer and hed confirmed that theyd now managed to get inside the hall and had found no bodies there but the police had a body a body with no face dug out of the mud and now that the immediate fire crisis was over this had become their priority again and they wanted very much to talk to gomer wanted to know why hed been so sure that something was buried in the old archaeological site that hed gone up there with a digger at night sophie her white hair in almost haglike disarray was trying to explain to him that all they wanted was a statement to allay their suspicions gomer didnt want to know though it was a plant hire thing that would take too long to explain jane understood this its stupid why would gomer have sent you to tell the police if he had something to do with it eirion said to gomer i think what mrs hills trying to say is it would be better if you approached them rather than have them come find you eirion what can i tell em thats gonner be any help gomer growled ill talk to the buggers tomorrow ennit and jane realized that he was worrying about mum she looked out of the entry to the street where a sombre assembly had formed around two priests or at least two men in dog collars one of them was raising his hands as if holding up a huge rock he was about to smash down on something jane just knew that some crazy scenario was being manufactured around the village hall fire involving not a furtive little greenhaired plonker with a can of petrol and a grudge but some great satanic panoply clanking through the night theyd asked father ellis what he wanted them to do but ellis had said cleverly im not your leader listen to your hearts and let the holy spirit move within you and he had walked away leaving bitter apocalyptic stuff on the air amidst the hellfire fumes he knew what theyd do he just wasnt going to be seen to instigate it watching this gomer had nodded knowingly truly a local man at last hed said which jane didnt really understand sophie appeared at her shoulder theres one place we havent tried jane said the church i suppose sophie said she had a loose arrangement with that young pagan woman didnt she to do some sort of deliverance work youre probably right if you and gomer want to go down there eirion and i will stay here in case she shows up gomer nodded he never liked to stand still for very long thank you sophie jane said youve been shut up jane sophie said wearily just go and perhaps you could warn them over at the church she nodded towards the assembly on the streets about that robin and betty were holding one another in some kind of sweet desperation everything seemed lost robins work the house their friends their religion their future here everything smashed in an act of sacrilege so gross it was worthy of a christian the candle chopped in half the scourge handle snapped the pentacle sent skimming like a frisbee into the wall the chalice of red wine draining into the rug finally the onetime studio table hauled from its trestles flung onto its side maxs wife bella screaming vivvie raging calling down the vengeance of the gods or some shit like that this was before ned bain had come and stood unflinching in front of robin who still held the sword robin had felt like decapitating the bastard but ned bain had remained impressively cool that quiet power even robin felt it before i leave bain said i want to make it clear that no one else here was involved no one conspired no one else deserves to suffer and then he turned and gathered his robe and walked out without another word thered been a long period of quiet then broken only by some weeping betty leaned against a wall drained vivvie had her head in her hands even max had nothing to say his kids hovered in the doorway the fiendish hermes looking satisfyingly scared the pregnant witch whose name robin couldnt recall had left the room with her partner robin only hoped she was ok he was starting to feel sick and cold the twigfire hissed a thick piece of altar candle rolled into a corner alexandra whod been sitting calmly with the crown of lights on her knees to protect it was the first to speak i think we should all leave betty and robin alone for a while and so robin and betty covenless had rediscovered one another i take thee to my hand my heart and my spirit at the setting of the sun and rising of the stars robin started to weep again and buried his face in her hair clinging together in their stupid robes in the wreckage of the altar they went hand in hand to the door and looked out at winnebagos the barn and puddles robin watched the moon in the puddles icing over you could almost get sentimental about those puddles but not quite we should get outa here tomorrow go check into a hotel someplace think things over i love you betty had her red ski jacket around her shoulders and i love you she said but robin honey betty fell silent he hated when betty became silent ok what he said she held his hand to the centre of her breast her emotional centre we cant just leave it watch me robin said but his spirit took a dive shed already explained how shed spent the night at a christian priests house a woman priest who was also the county exorcist or some such and knew a lot of stuff he had the idea it had all come about through bettys meeting with juliet pottinger a part of him still didnt want to know about any of this he thought he could hear distant voices beyond the trees like from a barbecue or maybe he just thought barbecue on account of the red glow in the sky perhaps a glimmering of imbolc theres a fire somewhere betty said cant you smell it didnt you hear the sirens i was maybe smashing things at the time coming on like the reverend penney let me tell you the truth about penney betty said he had a bad time in old hindwell church i think he was basically a very good man probably determined to make a success of his ministry but i think there were some aspects of what he found here that he couldnt handle began taking all kinds of drugs didnt the pottinger woman say in her letter to the major she didnt think he was doing drugs she was wrong he seems to have had a vision or a hallucination of a dragon satan in the church and he seems to have thought that by discontinuing active worship there it would make it go away nothing very new there but robin said but i dont think what he experienced was anything to do with the old religion or the rise of the new paganism i think he became aware of the dualistic nature of religion as it already existed in this area that there is a paganism here but its all mixed in with christianity a kind of residual medieval christianity when magic was very much a part of the whole thing when prayer was seen as a tool to get things done its practical it suits the area marginal land hand to mouth robin thought of the witch box the charm christian but not entirely christian those astrological symbols and some of the words using witchcraft against witchcraft there are five st michael churches betty said a pentagram of churches apparently to confine the dragon but its an inverted pentagram right that doesnt sound good perhaps betty said it was accepted that at some time they might need to invoke the dragon its border mentality i met a bloke called gomer parry radnorshire born and bred hell tell you this place took a lot of hammering from both the english and the welsh and survived he reckons by knowing when to sit on the fence and which side to come down on robin took some time to absorb this he could smell those bonfire fumes on the air now it was in some ways a sharp and exciting smell carrying the essence of paganism he said you mean theyre i dont know this stuff the book of revelation and all sitting on the fence while the war in heaven rages betty said five little old churches in a depopulated area with a rockbottom economy nomansland nogodsland robin said awed but like way back way way back this place was something the archaeology shows that maybe that accounts for its inner strength i dont know we dont know what were standing in front of we dont know the full nature of what lies the other side of that barn does ellis i dont know or bain partly maybe but bains big thing was personal thats dark magic low magic there are people round here who would understand it its notorious for feuds lasting from generation to generation robin said i wonder how did ned bain get the box from the major he buy it or just push the old guy off of his ladder and steal it i dont think hed push the major off the ladder but i dont think hed have been averse to posting his name on the kali three web site what is that anyway you dont want to know betty said dont wanna dump on my idyll huh theres no idyll babes no more idyll wheres that leave us leaves us with eleven disappointed witches betty said and a contaminated church robin breathed in the distant smoke what do we do i was expecting somebody i thought shed have come by now the woman priest the christian priest shes also an exorcist excuse me robin said but didnt we pass this way before it wouldve been very wrong to let ellis do it you were right about that from the start dont try and get me on your side ok they looked out over the freezing puddles to the barn on the other side of which the church of st michael overhung the restless hindwell brook probably the very same brook into which that guys sons blood flowed from his hair in the old welsh poem max had read out on account of you know you never need to robin said eventually you know that whatever shit comes down i am on your side do what you think is best he felt like crying he wished for subsidence an earthquake he wished the freaking church would fall into the freaking brook presently alexandra stood on the edge of one of the puddles her long grey hair loose a thick woollen shawl wrapped around her the emissary the negotiator the one they were most likely to talk to it has to be your decision alexandra told them i dont know what to say betty said babes robin said gently its getting late and the priest isnt here if she was ever gonna come at all we dont know what that place is really about betty looked out into the night in the direction of the church we dont know what rituals they were performing what kind of magic they were trying to arouse or for what purpose all those millennia ago bets robin said pained the ancient powers locked into the land the magic of the old ones this is blackmore shit she looked at him puzzled she was probably thinking of him standing watching the water rushing below the church and ranting about the cool energy him and george with their dowsing rods working out how many old old bodies were under there where the energy lines converged she didnt understand as robin now did that to do his paintings to be what he was a true creative artist he just had to live the legend that was all that was as deep as it went alexandra said hesitantly may i make a suggestion please said robin we abandon all reconsecration plans thats been tainted now anyway because of ned and neds gone and we talked about that and we were all relieved even george because neds neds a little bit dark fucker robin said so we forget all that we forget the politics even vivvie alexandra glanced behind her robin saw the whole coven in the shadows vivvie came forward looking like some rescued urchin she stood beside alexandra whatever she said my suggestion alexandra said is that we simply enact the imbolc rite whod be the high priest robin said it should be you robin knew this was a major concession with george and max out there although hed been through seconddegree initiation hed never led a coven and when we come to the great rite alexandra said well leave so that you can complete it for robin the cold february night began to acquire luminosity alexandra smiled youve both had a bad time we want this night to be yours robin tingled he did not dare look at betty grey lightless only a dead body whatever else remained was not here it was probably earthbound in that back room where a medieval exorcism replayed itself again and again until the spirit was flailing and crackling and beating at the glass the grey and lightless thing that jw weal brought home from hereford county hospital look at her said merrily in whom guilt constantly dwelt like an old schoolmistress thats what you all did thats what you left behind take a proper look at her face go on but judith prosser looked only at merrily and there was no guilt practical judith in her tight blue jeans the sleeves of her shirt pushed up to the elbows her black coat in a heap on the floor practical judith prosser ready to act thinking what to do next how to make her move a smart woman a hard woman a survivor but merrily perhaps taking on the guilt that judith would never feel pushed harder maybe thats why jw invited you to the interment you and gareth and the good dr coll did dr coll by the way prescribe valium to keep menna afloat keep her quiet when she threatened to be an embarrassment was there medication for marianne too i thought marianne seemed awfully compliant during her cleansing you have it all worked out mrs watkins judith said yeah merrily said i finally think i do it stinks worse than this embalming stuff and what will you do with it all will you go to the police and make accusations against dr collard banksmorgan and mr weal the solicitor and mrs councillor prosser it would help merrily conceded if barbara buckinghams body was in here so why dont you come back here with a pickaxe or with your good friend gomer parry and one of his roadbreakers it wasnt going to be there was it there was no one under menna yet merrily was sure now that barbara buckingham was dead did barbara find out about the exorcism judith slowly shook her head smiling her pastedon smile back on top of the situation giving nothing away still merrily said mennas here for any time you want to look at her and remember the old days before she turned into a woman and became less malleable and jws left you with a key so you can come in any time and watch what you once had see what you did watch it slowly decaying before your merrily sank to her knees shed been expecting if anything a shriek of outrage and clawing hands she hadnt seen this coming judith prosser didnt seem to be close enough now merrily was on her knees with the flash memory of a fist out of nowhere hard as a kitchen pestle on a cheekbone she had never been hit like this before it was shattering like a car crash she cried out in shock and agony judith prosser bent with a hand out as if to help her and then hit her again with the heel of it full in the eye merrily even saw it as if in slow motion but still couldnt move it drove her back into the wall her head connecting with the concrete her left eye closing you can tell the police about that too mrs watkins judith was panting with satisfaction and see who they believe a hysterical little pretendpriest from off or mrs councillor prosser ah one hand over her weeping eye merrily saw through the other one that the door had swung open and the doorway was filled really filled good evening jeffery judith said you have me judith as a witness that she hit you first weals voice was colourless and flat as card but only if you make no further mess of her than that or it would not be a reasonable defence he was carrying what looked like a kind of garden implement he came in and gently closed the door of the mausoleum behind him he was wearing a charcoal grey threepiece suit and a white shirt and a black tie to show he was still in mourning his face was pouchy red veins prominent in his grey cheeks he propped the garden implement against the door merrily saw that it was a doublebarrelled twelvebore shotgun thought it was the hippies see he nodded at the twelvebore some satanist hippies are parked up in the clearing by the fedw dingle father ellis phoned to warn me they break in anywhere isnt loaded is it jeffery judith said its always loaded there are foxes about and feral cats i hate cats as you know not going to the masonic i was going judith till i saw all those troublemakers in the village cant leave your house unguarded all this going on can you talking politely like neighbours over the wall people who knew each other but not that well they must have known one another for most of their lives merrily didnt try to move judith looked down at her recognize this one do you jeffery came to see me this morning asking all kinds of questions about father ellis and about you and menna when she left i saw that the keys you know where i keep your keys on the hook beside the door stupid of me i know but i trust people see and weve never had anything stolen before but when she left i seen the keys were gone weal stood over merrily called the police well next thing there she is coming down the lane tonight i thought ill follow her i will and sure enough up the drive she goes lets herself in and when i came in here shed already done that they both looked at the open tomb disgusting little bitch i shouldnt have touched her but as you say she went for me like a cat i hate cats as you know how instinctive she was merrily was able to open her swelling eye just a little she looked up at weal it was like standing under some weathered civic monument she didnt think there was any point at all in telling him that judith had lured her here picking up with psychopathic acumen merrilys guilt her sense of responsibility for barbara buckingham why did you do this why do you keep coming here why do you keep wanting to see my wife jw weal gazing down at her sorrowfully giving merrily the first real indication that there was something wrong with him his speech was slow his voice was dry the truth of it is judith said that she seems to have a vendetta against father ellis father ellis is a good man weal said calmly no it wasnt calmness so much as depletion something missing almost as if he was drugged not fully here as if part of him existed on some intermediate plane at greyandlightless level lying there in a cocoon of pain detached merrily felt her senses heightened her objectivity sharpened supposed to be the exorcist for the hereford diocese she is judith told weal doesnt like him working in her back yard a priest whose feet she is not fit to wash what good would a woman like this be at what he does merrily tried to stand judith immediately pushed her down again and she slid into the corner by the door judith was wearing her leather gloves again perhaps to cover up any slight abrasions or bruising from the punches merrilys face felt numb and twisted she wondered if her cheekbone was broken she wondered where this would end the way these two were talking to each other it was like a bad play gave me some nonsense story judith prosser said about barbara buckingham being murdered and buried in there another nod to the open tomb why in gods name didnt one of them close it buckingham weal said vaguely what was wrong with him barbara thomas murdered she thinks barbara was murdered a gleeful almost girlish lilt now thinks you did it jeffery merrily didnt look at him she could almost hear his mind trying to make sense of it because barbara thomas came to see me is it his voice thin and stretched as though he was trying to remember something because she accused me did she merrily said shut up judith moved towards her merrily shrank back into the corner if she could just get to her feet she might but then there was weal if you grievously injure her he told judith earnestly you know i may not be able to help you merrily shut her eyes think barbara believes weal was responsible for mennas death so she goes to see weal and accuses him of bringing about mennas death by subjecting her to elliss perverse ritual what does weal do then what does he do to barbara nothing the way he was talking now viewing the situation almost naively from a pedantic legal perspective made one thing clear whatever else he was this man was not a killer theres only one killer jw merrily said when barbara came to see you when she went a little crazy and started accusing you of things did you she could hear the acceleration of judiths breathing but she didnt look at her she was going to get this out if she was beaten into the ground for it did you send her to see judith weal didnt answer he glanced briefly at judith then down at merrily the question had thrown him he looked at judith again his jaw moving uncertainly as if he was trying to remember why it was that he hated her so much merrily could suddenly see weal and barbara in the old rectory weal redfaced and anguished why are you plaguing me you stupid tiresome woman why dont you talk to the one person who for twentyfive years has been judith said jeffery youre tired yes he said im always tired these days why dont you go back to the house now judith said kindly ill sort this out he put his fingers vaguely to his forehead you wont go doing anything stupid will you judith we are entitled to protect our property but only dont worry about me i have never been a stupid woman i was just carried away see just carried away jeffery he nodded here judith picked up his shotgun take this with you and lock it away no one will try to get in now she held the gun upright and handed it to him weal accepted it holding the barrel loosely right he said thank you judith when judiths gloved hand slid gracefully down the barrel down the stock the blast was like the end of the world merrily shrinking into her corner into herself saw jw weals head burst like a melon in a rising red spray felt it come down again a warm hail each of my dyings judith still held the shotgun her face creased in concern poor man she said but see what did he have to live for now judith held the gun with both gloved hands the stock under her arm not much she added not much at all weals great body blocked the door his blood and flesh and bone and brain blotched the walls but most of the mess still dripping was on the ceiling merrily sobbing was still hearing the sound of weals head hitting the ceiling would hear it for ever a terrible accident judith said two smells now the embalming room and the slaughterhouse merrily hung her head she felt very cold she heard something sliding stickily down the wall behind and above her an accident mrs watkins a terrible accident yes merrily croaked or perhaps he meant to do it do you think you saw me handing it to him such a tall man it was pointing directly under his chin she laughed shrilly such a big man they calls him big weal in kington and around big weal the big wheel thats very good merrily said judith said flatly im making excuses isnt it merrily felt something warm on her forehead wiped it roughly away with her sleeve she thought that maybe being squashed into a corner had protected her from most of the carnage she remembered judith jumping quickly back snatching the gun away too not a speck on judith she heard herself say these things happen and felt a bubble of hysteria she began to get up levering herself hands flat behind her pushing against the floor her bottom against the wall now she could see jw weals huge shoes shining in the lantern light his legs oh no you dont judith swung round the stock hard against her shoulder youll stay there while i think or youll have the other barrel merrily froze judiths eyes were pale but not distant like jws had been her gaze was fixed hard on merrily you made me do that its your fault you suggested to jw that he mustve sent barbara thomas to me he never did he wouldnt do that didnt she tell you merrilys gaze turned to the river of blood that had pumped from jw weals collar she gagged she was off her head that woman judith said off her head screaming at me standing there screaming at me in her fancy clothes how dare she run away go from here spend her life in cushy where was it where was it ham hampshire hampshire soft cushy place that is how dare she come back from hampshire start screaming at me me whos had it hard all my life they comes here the english think they can say what they like half a mile over the border just half a mile and this myth of the english having it so good judiths accent seemed to deepen as she remembered the encounter but a scrawny neck she had like an old bird trying to hide her scrawny neck with a fancy silk scarf but i found it mrs watkins oh god merrily stiffened in her halfcrouch against the wall sinewy hands around a scrawny neck maybe a silk scarf pulled tight going to tell everybody she was that bitch everybody going to shout it all over radnorshire that mrs councillor prosser was a lesbian how dare the bitch call me a lesbian ill sue you i said to her ill hire jw to sue you see how long your english money lasts you then merrily retched again never seen blood before mrs watkins used to kill all our own pigs we did when i was a girl and whatever else we wanted to until the regulations regulations about this and that regulations it is killing country life she calmed down sighed poor jeffery its just like putting down an old horse what was the matter with him it was since she died a toss of her head towards the tomb he was hardly awake since couldnt face being awake was he on medication from dr coll wouldnt have it said it was the mourning took his energy eating him up inside took his energy menna do you know what i think judith said brightening i think he ought to have killed you mrs watkins merrily felt the first spasm of a cramp in her right leg she had to move thats what i think meddling little bitch you are come to spy on father ellis merrily braced herself against the wall straightened the leg in front of her looking up into the black metalsmelling barrels of the twelvebore hovering six inches from her face judith said perhaps he did shoot you she raised a hand to her head for a moment horribly childlike as if putting something together in her mind likely he shot you before he killed himself blew your little head off with the one barrel saved the other for himself he was a solicitor a logical man see she looked delighted the woman was mad merrily looked along the barrel of the great gun towards the stock she saw two triggers one slightly in front of the other judiths finger around the second one the speed shed managed it last time there must be hardly any tension in those triggers merrily jerked her head to one side but the two holes followed her judith was a practical woman first used one of these when i was nine year old she said proudly when i could hardly lift it saw my father shooting crows she smiled happily country girl see always the tomboy always a better shot than councillor prosser the trigger finger relaxed merrily still held her breath could she summon the strength to throw herself from the wall knock the barrel aside as if shed picked up the thought judith backed away smartly smiling jeffery thought you were one of the hippies broken in thought you were a hippy and you went for him and his gun went off thats what theyll say isnt it then when he saw what hed done he turned the gun on himself suicide while the balance of mind was disturbed went to an inquest two year ago we did councillor prosser and i one of our old neighbours hanged himself verdict of suicide while the balance of mind was disturbed everyone here knew jws balance of mind was gone merrily shook her head helplessly judith waggled her fingers to show she was still wearing gloves dropped the gun as he died two of you dead she glanced at the open tomb went to say goodbye to his wife before he killed himself poor jeffery hes with her now is that what you think mrs watkins yes judiths face turned red rubbish nonsense how can a woman be so stupid there is nothing after death menna waiting in the clouds with her arms open waiting for her jw with no head is that what you would tell them in your church mrs watkins is that what you say to father ellis the barrel moved down to merrilys chest at this range the blast would cut her in half and it could happen any time if she moved too quickly judith would blow her apart she wouldnt feel anything she wouldnt even hear the shot her last moment would be a moment just like this we could have been friends you and i merrily watkins im not sure that we could merrily said honestly im not a lesbian you know are you calling me a lesbian merrily thought of jane glad that gomer was with her would the kid later remember hearing a distant explosion from the village hear it echoing down her life pray that these concrete walls were too thick pray please god oh god please jesus hold me safe from the forces of evil on each of my dyings shed your light and your love would she die wearing janes coat she saw not her own life flashing before her but janes jane aged three on the beach in pembrokeshire following a ball tripping over it starting to cry because she thought she should and then bursting into wild laughter rolling over and over like a kitten merrily tore herself wretchedly back into the present frankly judith i couldnt care less where you stand sexually its insignificant not to me mrs watkins not to my reputation the real point is youre a monster a monster that feeds on the vulnerable anything that brings out pity in the rest of us it just makes you more excited tears turn you on you were probably everything to menna all she had sometimes but she was nothing to you no more than a slim white trembling body to play with she stood up looked at judith and shrugged you may close your eyes if you wish judith said coldly but shed squeezed the second trigger before merrily even had time to decide betty and the stately alexandra drifted about the ruins like mother and daughter ghosts moving things around while robin watched and held the lamp the fat candles mostly stayed on sills and ledges and in glass lanterns on the top of the tower the altar got moved this was an old workbench from the barn with a wood vice still clamped on the side robin helped alexandra carry it from the north wall to a place in the middle of the nave opposite the tower but facing where betty figured the chancel had been eastfacing like a christian altar in case this merrily watkins turned up the ruins hung around them like old and tattered drapes moonlight showing up all the mothholes the moon was real white now like a slice of philadelphia cheese over the tower robin thought he saw a movement up there an owl maybe across the roofless nave betty was taking some crystals from a drawstring bag she kept her eyes down when it was all ready the coven was summoned in and alexandra said to betty will it be robin looked at betty and he knew she had at last accepted that the christian priest would not come betty nodded tapers and matches were handed out the coven moved like shadows dipping and bending and when each one rose there was a new glimmering maxs wife bella did the tower creepy she said when she came down felt i was being watched in the end there must have been seventy or eighty candles alight lined up in every jagged glassless window along the walls of the roofless nave in the arrowcracks of the tower on top of the cold battlements in glass lanterns st michaels old hindwell was ethereal unearthly shivering with lights and the display reflected crystallized in the hindwell brook in shock never had a gun never wanted one but gomer knew about gunshots how loud they could be at night how the sound would carry miles and hed figured out roughly where this one had come from and it wasnt likely to be poachers or lampers of hares not tonight with all these coppers on the loose the church young jane said scared further on more like he wasnt gonner say it was the ole rectory yet but he was gonner check it out as they reached prossers farm a police van shot past them far too fast in gomers view to be heading for the entrance to the ole church they wouldntve heard the shot most likely they was heading for the camp the coppers wouldve now set up where theyd dug up barbara thomas gomer had been worried they might get stopped under his bomber jacket he had his sweatshirt on back to front so it no longer said gomer parry plant hire behind them the fire was just fumes on the air almost unnoticeable as they reached the st michaels entrance no protesters here yet no coppers neither and no reporters a womans body and some bugger figuring to fry three hundred people had to be more important than god and the devil the fivebar gate was closed across the track but the padlock hung loose from the hasp on a chain gomer was about to open it when jane let out a gasp two women were approaching up the road jane hesitates a moment then starts to run gomer levels his torch it lights up judy prosser also the vicar the kiddie runs to her mam and they starts hugging but gomer knows straight off this ent normal he walks over slowly owre you judy but hes looking at the vicar in the torchlight where her eyes black and swelledup her face lopsided janes now spotted it too mum what have you but judy cuts in gomer were looking for the police we are something terribles happened whats that judy i have to report a suicide shes holding herself up straight in this long black quilted coat mr weal hes shot himself im afraid to say big weal blew his head off with a shotgun in his wifes tomb this was poor man turned his mind isnt it the grief tried to stop him didnt i mrs watkins tried to talk him out of it the vicar says in this clear voice like in the pulpit no one could have done more mrs prosser you all right vicar yeah im fine apart from a few bruises where mr weal hit me i warned her not to approach him said mrs prosser silly girl yes ive been a very silly girl judy says we all were terrified that he might do something stupid so as a close neighbour i was keeping an eye on him i go there every night i do to check hes all right and sometimes i finds him beside the tomb with the top open just staring at mennas remains mrs watkins said she did not think this was healthy and she asked me to take her to see mr weal and we finds the poor man in there with his wife on show and his twelvebore in his hands mrs watkins panics see gomer the vicar says ar are there any police around i thought thered be some here over the harchaeologist site vicar gomer says warily any number o the buggers could you take mrs prosser ask for a senior officer and tell them mrs prosser has a lot of information you can tell them my husbands on the police committee judy says that should expedite matters but surely youre coming too mrs watkins i have to take my child back to the vicarage mrs prosser shes too young to hear about this kind of thing the vicar hugs young jane very close for a few seconds say goodnight to gomer jane the vicar says the kiddie comes over puts her arms round gomers neck and hugs him real tight and in his ear in this shocked trembling whisper her says mum says to tell the police not to let her go shes killed twice they followed the path to the old archaeological site some thirty yards away they could see two police cars lined up a radio crackling from one of them they could see the low white tent the orange tape the second car was parked on the edge of a small wood full of dead trees white branches shining like bone jane had told her what was probably still lying under the tent are you sure the kid kept saying are you sure i promised but with everything thats and look at you look at you you need a doctor dr coll merrily started to laugh and the laughter wouldnt stop stop it jane screamed whats that on your hands merrily looked down still laughing oh thock she heard thock seeing the ridiculous dismay on judiths face watching her step back angrily breaking open the gun and coming out with that brilliantly dry observation wouldnt you know it mrs watkins a radnor man to the core never load two cartridges when you may not even need the one the funniest line merrily had heard in a long time possibly at that moment the funniest line being spoken in the whole insane world when she started to laugh she was half expecting judith to come at her with both fists or take a swing at her with the shotgun but smart judith canny judith this was not how judith reacted at all she simply laid down the empty gun a few inches away from the halfcurled hand out of which shed snatched it before the fingers could spasm around its barrel the stupid man voice flat eyes flat like aluminium what did he want to do that for you saw it mrs watkins you saw how i tried to stop him as if the previous minutes had never happened as if editing her life like a videotape instinctively compiling the alternative version with an efficient jumpcut from the second the gun went off so practical this judith and merrily had reacted quickly for once getting it exactly right youd better tell the police what happened then mrs prosser its my duty mrs watkins give me a hand here will you both of them then pulling the body away from the door as though it was a huge dead sheep so they could squeeze outside this was how merrily had got the blood on her hands to the left she could hear the sound of the hindwell brook jane said she killed barbara buckingham that woman yes strangled her with her own silk scarf beat her up first probably perhaps when barbara went to see her and challenged her over certain things i think gomer said her husband owned a digger i suppose one of them wouldve driven her car over to the elan valley with the other following who is she shes mrs councillor prosser flower fortified by the local community the doctor the lawyer the councillor even the priest solid as a rock she was until someone from off blew it all open someone who hadnt always been from off and realized what she was seeing here and merrily couldnt help wondering to herself then if anything had ever gone on way back between judith and barbara something barbara had suppressed erased from her memory as simply as judith prosser had erased from her mental tape the murder of weal and the attempted murder of merrily over her shoulder was slung her airline bag bought because it was blue and gold shed brought it out of the tomb with her but there was no blood on it a small miracle it contained the bibles prayers altar wine and holy water so medieval they stopped at the bridge and there was the church across the water and also reflected in the water bettys birthday cake its beautiful jane breathed its son et lumiere without the son merrily smiled wildly less than an hour ago she was staring into eternity down the barrels of a twelvebore now she was back in airyfairyland are you sure about this jane said merrily squeezed her arm jane look i dont want to have to worry about you ok so id like you to stay out of the way i know youre sixteen and everything youre in shock arent you i mean youve just seen something totally horrific youve been through a really horrifying yeah i probably am in shock you could do this tomorrow i said id do it tonight we could explain to betty they were halfway across the footbridge now the ruins shimmered in a hollow of silence then a womans voice rose up dread lord of death and resurrection of life and the giver of life lord within ourselves whose name is mystery of mysteries encourage our hearts let thy light crystallize itself in our blood merrily slumped over the rail of the bridge too late the woman clothed with the sun his coven around him robin lifted the wand high in his right hand until it divided the moon the wand was a slender footlong piece of hazel wood cut from the tree with a single stroke on a wednesday as laid down in the book of shadows in his left hand robin held the scourge a mild token thing like a riding crop with silken cords behind him were the crone alexandra and a woman called ilana who was twentyfour but looked a lot younger and represented the maiden tonight the flames rose straight up out of the tight nest of stones in the centre of the nave as he brought down the wand in a long diagonal right to left then left to right in a fortyfivedegree angle and straight back horizontally and down and up to a point one point the positive invoking pentagram of earth drawn before his high priestess whose hair shone brighter than the fire whose eyes were deeper than crystals blessed be robin whispered and never had meant it more merrily followed jane around the church tower the kid had a small torch borrowed from gomer but they didnt need it the church cast its own light when she looked up to the top of the tower she could no longer see the candlelanterns only the highlighted stones she and jane slipped unseen she assumed from the tower across a grassy graveless churchyard glittering with frost to the side of what looked like a stone barn what to do watch and pray christ be with us christ within us christ behind us they stood with their backs to the barn from here through an empty gothic window in the nave about twenty feet away they could see the long candles on the altar and they could see by the fire and candlelight betty in her green robe on one side of her was a girl of about eighteen on the other a plump and placid woman who looked like she ought to be running a day nursery the girl was combing bettys blond hair there was now music on the freezing air vaguely celtic string and reed music from some boombox stereo concealed in the ruins it all seemed gentle and poetic and harmless and not a lot in merrilys view to do with religion the distance the walls and the music allowed them to talk in low voices jane said doesnt look as if shes been like coerced does it betty stood with her back to the altar the other women on either side the male witch who looked like he should be playing bass with primal scream appeared in the gothic window we saw him in the daily mail right merrily said yeah im pretty sure thats robin and is he the high priest you know this stuff better than me has to be not ned bain then which is a mercy jane said which has to be a mercy a shadow moved beside her as if off the barn any night but this she might have cried out a mercy you think then the shadow said hello ned said merrily theyd customized the rite slightly to allow for the place and the changed circumstances but robin thought it could still be ok he tried to concentrate on the meaning of the ritual the birth of spring and the purpose the bringing of fresh light to an old dark place he wondered if terry penney could see them in some way and feel what was happening for in the absence of the woman priest betty said this rite must also be a form of exorcism to convey terrys spirit into a place of peace but robin couldnt dispel the awareness that they were doing this in a church he would close his eyes for a moment and try to bring down the walls until there was only a circle of stones around them but he was finding he couldnt hold that image and this wasnt robin thorogood visionary seducer of souls guardian of the softly lit doorways he found himself wishing they were someplace else in a frosted glade or on some open moorland and that wasnt robin thorogood custodian of an ancient site which tonight was entering its third incarnation quietly and harmoniously without tension without friction he laid the wand and scourge upon the altar and helped the maiden to arrange the shawl around the shoulders of the crone from a jam jar on the altar he took a small bunch of snowdrops the flowers of imbolc which alexandra had found growing behind the barn and had bound together with some early catkins he presented this humble bouquet to ilana the maiden he lifted the crown of lights from the altar and waited while the three women arranged themselves he raised the crown of lights and placed it on bettys head and the maiden and the crone tucked and curled her golden hair becomingly around it merely spectators ned bain whispered isnt it sad came for a baptism and they wouldnt even let us be godparents merrily said nothing keeping her eyes on the gothic window full of moving lights ive been barred he said might that be down to you she flicked a glance at him she hadnt seen him clearly but he was not robed like the others he seemed to be wearing a jacket and jeans she made sure she kept jane on the other side of her if youve been barred why are you still here because simon will come bain said if he isnt here already simon you know who i mean maybe you really arent on his side are you merrily im not on anybodys side she was picking up a musky sandy smell on him it reminded her for just a moment of sean she made the sign of the cross and cloaked herself and jane in the glow from the breastplate of st patrick the smell went away bain said am i right in thinking simons offended you am i supposed to think this is esp ned your awesome powers at work isnt father ellis performing exorcisms is he do they work depends on what he intends them to do thats where the problems arise tell me jane touched her shoulder mum i think theyre coming if i tell you what he did merrily said will you bugger off ok he performed some kind of baptismal ritual which effectively bound together two people who never should have been brought together in the first place and when the woman died her spirit would not leave the man and instead of bringing him comfort it oppressed him and sapped his energy and turned him into even less than he was before mum thank you ned bain said what will you do about that i dont know that i can do anything she moved behind jane to the corner of the barn looked out across a yard past the farmhouse to where a track was marked out by a line of swinging torches and lamps she heard singing inane redneck gospel with all the spirituality of a football chant we shall raise the sword of christ and strike the devil down sounds like your people merrily ned bain said and my cue to disappear in the night with all the spearing torches the hymn sounded dense and menacing merrily remembered the christian biker with the dead dragon on his tshirt this is what you wanted isnt it ned if i were you ned bain said id stay well out of it call that a gentle warning call it a prophecy goodnight merrily he turned and merged with the shadows theres blood on your hands whys that i wonder she didnt see how in this light he could possibly have seen her hands and shed got it all off hadnt she in the shimmering silence of the open ruins with the tower rearing behind his priestess robin brought a taper from the fire and lit the candles around the crown of lights the little flames sprang brightly robin said behold the threeformed goddess she who is ever three yet is she ever one for without spring there can be no summer without summer no winter without winter no new spring tears in his eyes as he gazed on his goddess she was everything hed ever imagined the beautiful book cover hed painted so often in his head for the book which was too profound too poetic too resonant for anyone yet to have written he looked into bettys eyes and then up at the blurred moon listen to the words of the great mother she who of old was also called among men artemis astarte athene dion melusine aphrodite ceridwen dana arianrhod isis brigid and by many other names and so it went on and when it was over the maid took up a broomstick and walked clockwise around the fire followed by the mother and the crone sweeping away the old and robin prayed to the moon for the badness and torment in this place to be swept away for ever when the torch and lamp lights were enlarged beams crossing in the air and the hymn behind her began to sound like the baying of wolves merrily looked up and saw him just a shadow against the stars then faintly lit by the lanterns on the battlements he was not in his white robes which would have been too conspicuous someone would have seen him getting into the tower oh christ merrily said she turned to jane stay there no chance jane muttered and followed her towards the church they kept close to the walls so they couldnt be seen from the tower itself passed by the gothic window full of lights edged around the building to the opening where the south porch had been merrily began to pray softly and realized with horror that she was praying to god for protection against his servants at the gate she was very anxious now robin picked up from outside the ring of stones surrounding the fire two twigs of holly hed cut a week ago and hung over the back door so that they were now nicely brittle the coven gathered around him he knelt before the fire and set light to each twig in turn and held it up for them all to see then he tossed each of the twigs into the flames and the coven chanted with him in what ought to have been joy and optimism but sounded scarily flat and formulaic thus we banish winter thus we welcome spring say farewell to what is dead and greet each living thing thus we banish winter thus we welcome spring then the coven melted away into the shadows and out of the church max patting robin on the shoulder as he passed well done mate max whispered all over all over but for the great rite a double sleeping bag lay directly under the tower protected from the wind a candlelantern quietly alight at either end robin stood by the fire betty walked away towards the base of the tower and when she reached it she turned around all aglow in her nest of candles but the glow came from more than the candles and there was a strange moment of fusion as if the whole church was a crown of lights around them both and bettys gown slipped down with a silken rustling and robins heart leapt like a fawn and he moved towards her along the open nave and then he heard a voice cold and strident on the night foul serpent robin looked up and saw the spectre on the battlements its arms raised like the twin points of a pentagram upside down o most glorious leader of the heavenly armies defend us in our war against the dark spirits which rule this world and the spirits of wickedness in the high places for the holy church venerates you as her guardian and the lord has entrusted to you the souls of the redeemed to be led into heaven st michael merrily explained hes invoking st michael its his exorcism she stood in the entrance with jane youve got to do something jane said a bright light lanced over the kids shoulder a tv cameraman was moving up behind her they were all piling in now whether theyd come over the gate or across the bridge forming a big circle around the ruins but it had been a small church and she and jane were blocking the narrow entrance people began to push at her back make them go away a womans voice shed heard somewhere before i can show you a church with a tower and graves and everything this is sacrilege merrily put an arm around jane and didnt move ellis boomed from the tower his voice like a klaxon in the still freezing air in the name of jesus christ our lord and of michael the archangel we confidently undertake to repulse the deceits of satan merrily was furious he was not entitled he was not entitled to wield the name of christ like an axe or the cross of christ like a dildo robin thorogood couldnt seem to move he stood in the nave staring up as if his blood had turned to ice impaled by tv lights he looked like a prisoner caught in the searchlights escaping from some concentration camp merrily couldnt see betty from the tower in the haze of the lanterns ellis cried god arises his enemies are dissembled and those who hate him shall fall down before him just as the smoke of hellfire is driven away so are they driven just as wax melts before the fire so shall the wicked perish before the presence of god behold he stopped betty had walked out she was robed again she looked terrified but she didnt look up not once she was somehow still wearing the crown of lights and merrily in a vibrantly dark moment was already hearing the verse from revelation when he started to broadcast the words now a great sign appeared in heaven a woman clothed with the sun with the moon under her feet and on her head a garland of twelve stars robin thorogood shouted no thats not throwing out his arms in protest serpent merrily saw what she knew that ellis was seeing she saw the picture in his war room the one by william blake and it turned robins arms into great webbed leathery wings the colours of a freshly dug worm and his wild hair into a rams curling horns she saw the woman clothed with the sun stars around her head a twinkling lure for the great red dragon merrily at last gave way to the prods and thrusts at her back robin saw the small darkhaired woman running into the nave no she was yelling please god no and when he heard from above this sickening crumbling creaking cracking sound he realized he was screaming too as he hurled himself towards betty threw his arms around her and bore her to the ground covering her with his body and closing his eyes as the first stone came out of the sky he didnt feel it he couldnt feel anything but he could hear other peoples screams and above them all elliss bellow and there was war in heaven robin just lay across his goddess on the sleeping bag unmoving as the black sky tumbled he opened his eyes just once to watch the crown of lights rolling away like a cheap catherine wheel the birthday candles going out one by one there were many other lights too but he closed his eyes on them many other sounds but he didnt listen to them he heard only the heart of his goddess and his own voice whispering the words which moved him beyond all others in the fullness of time we shall be born again at the same time and in the same place as each other and we shall meet and know and remember and love again damage he was a tall stooping man with a mournful halfmoon kind of face a heavy grey moustache he was the recently appointed head of dyfedpowys cid a mere caretaker role he said before retirement his name was gwyn arthur jones detective superintendent gomer parry knew him from way back which saved them some time but it was still close to three am before they left the incident room dr colls waiting room for the comparative privacy of dr colls surgery the door was closed and a metal anglepoise burned on a desk swept clean of all papers formal statements had been taken and signed jane was asleep on dr colls couch sophie had taken eirion back to hereford and his stepmothers car detective superintendent gwyn arthur jones had brought out his pipe and discovered a bottle of single malt in dr colls filing cabinet kept naggin at me see gomer said that piece o ground amateur job stood out a mile why would bloody gareth dig it up again and put it back less he was lookin for treasure and gareth wouldnt know treasure less it come in a bloody brassbound chest with treasure wrote on it and mrs prosser the superintendents accent was west wales quite soft a firstlanguage welshspeakers voice did no one ever nurture uncharitable suspicions about her judy gomer shook his head as though he would go on shaking it for ever not me least nothin i could get a ringspanner to but her kept croppin up ennit i kept sayin to the vicar didnt i vicar you wanner talk to judy judys smart judy knows bloody hell gwyn i never guessed judy knowed it all and still holding out on us gwyn arthur sipped dr colls whisky merrily had noticed that when hed taken the bottle from the drawer hed replaced it with a twentypound note i dont somehow think she will ever do otherwise mrs councillor prosser wife of a former chairman of the police committee time and time again like name rank and number local credentials gomer said means everythin here and dr collard banksmorgan former acting police surgeon the allegations about him he tells us are quite risible as we would have been further assured by mr weal had the poor man not taken his own life i suspect people cleverer than me will have to spend many days among mr weals files gwyn arthur poured further measures of whisky into those little plastic measuring vessels you got with your medicine all in all he said never in my experience have so many eminently respectable conspicuously guilty people lied so consistently through their teeth im awfully afraid mrs watkins that you are destined for a considerable period in the witness box what will you do with ellis merrily asked well hold him until the morning then we shall have to think in terms of charges and im very much afraid that my imagination at present will not stretch a great deal further than wilful damage if that regardless of the tragic consequences he didnt even have to break into the tower just bolted himself in from the inside what happened later was he insists an unfortunate accident he hasnt even described it as the will of god the tower parapet as the late major wilshire discovered to his ultimate cost was horribly unstable he did not mean for all those stones to fall what about the tv pictures almost gratuitously graphic when it comes to portraying the results but the lights on the cameras were insufficiently powerful to reach the top of the tower or to illuminate elliss movements in the moments before the stones were dislodged i would give anything for it to be otherwise but there we are merrily lit a cigarette with fingers which still would not stay steady im not giving up on that bastard expect me at the station later today with a mrs starkey if ive got to drag her but i dont think itll come to that not now yes indecent assault is a better beginning gwyn arthur jones drained his medicine measure and went to stand at the window the only vehicles left on view in the village were the police cars and vans merrilys volvo gomers land rover and nevs truck with the digger on the back gwyn arthur came back and sat down and contemplated merrily and what else what else in your wildest imaginings merrily would you think ellis might have done she took a tiny sip of scotch well have you got anybody yet for the village hall interesting gwyn arthur said but no we havent the travellers we brought in were most indignant i mean it was all getting a bit tame wasnt it a few hymns a little placardwaving hed had his chance to convince three hundred fundamentalist christians that satan was in residence in old hindwell and he hadnt really pulled it off had he you think he planned to inflame these people as it were with the thought that the pagans wanted to burn them alive maybe to drive them to excesses knowing full well hed have been able to lead them to safety out of the rear entrance even if gomer hadnt turned up and received the credit i think thats very much on the cards hmm said the superintendent certainly emotions among those decent churchgoing christians were running at a level possibly unparalleled since the days of the witchhunts theres no question in my mind that it could have become extremely nasty if ironically enough those stones had not fallen when and where they did you could always check out his robe for petrol traces or something no one as yet has been able to find his robe said gwyn arthur jones regretfully he doesnt remember where he left it unlike mrs prosser hes being entirely cooperative he tells us he chose to go alone to the church one man against a horde of heathens precisely because he did not want his legitimate christian protest against the desecration of the house of god to become a bloodbath several witnesses confirm that he tried to stop them merrily closed her eyes he doesnt like churches churches are disposable instead he set up in this village hall because it was close to old hindwell church the battleground he claimed hed been getting anonymous letters phone calls signs on the internet she sighed do you know the book of revelation at all the paintings of william blake betty stared down into the nearblack water she said slowly o lord jesus christ saviour salvator i beseech the salvation of all who dwell within from witchcraft and from the power of all evil men or women or spirits or wizards or hardness of heart amen amen amen an ambulance warbled across the city maybe the one which had brought her here several hours ago from the viewing platform above victoria bridge the suspension footbridge over the wye bushes hid the sprawl of hereford county hospital it was dawn that coldest time with only a few lights across the river shining through the bare grey trees either the charm didnt work she said or it worked all too well get rid of it merrily said half an hour ago shed been waiting with betty when the orthopaedic surgeon who was called frank had explained that robins pelvis was smashed and there was some spinal damage will he walk again betty had asked frank couldnt answer that one yet but he said he was hopeful merrily said bitterly war in heaven and all the casualties down here dont you go losing your faith betty said its only religion faith is faith but religions are no better than the people who practise them lamplit it was still only midmorning when the bedside phone awoke her she hadnt been in bed long enough for it to be a sleep of any depth although the halfdreams were dark and she was instantly focused and expecting the worst she didnt expect him it all comes down to demonization you see merrily he said as if theyd been talking for hours i was demonized from an early age twelve to be exact he was the little christ and i was the antichrist he and his mother were always very efficient at the demonization of anything in their way and he still is of course he sounded as if hed been drinking his voice was dark and smooth and intimate merrily sat up in bed fumbling a cardigan around her shoulders he wanted dragons so i sent him dragons i sent him serpents what do you mean it isnt all done by magic the postal service can be equally effective and now the internet and email almost as fast as one can transmit a thought but then its all electricity isnt it everythings a form of electricity science is catching us up soon everyone will be doing magic what a dispiriting thought she heard the clink of a glass against his teeth ive been a bad man in my way no worse i would submit than simon but bad enough sometimes i yearn for redemption is that possible do you think merrily its possible for everybody the sunlight penetrated through the crack in the curtains and put a pale stripe down the bed celtic spring had come i hoped youd say that he said so will you help me will you help a poor sinner onto the lamplit path she froze who told you about that he laughed i know everything about you youre in bed arent you she felt his seanbreath the warm dusting and she was afraid i can just see you in bed he said all rumpled a little creased around the eyes rumpled and smelling of softness and sleep she remembered the blood he could not have seen on her hands she remembered the red and white lights on the motorway false lights in a night of filth can we meet ned bain said and discuss my redemption i dont think thats a good idea she said and put down the phone and sat there in bed shivering
