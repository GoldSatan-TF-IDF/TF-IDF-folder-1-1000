constant support and help merci and grazie gene and lisl and finally many thanks to the readers who are kind enough to look forward to my books i wish all of you a blessed happy and safe holiday season for joan murchison broad and in memory of col richard l broad with love and thanks for all the marvelous times we shared stchristopher patron of travelerspray for us and protect us from evil it was christmas eve in new york city the cab slowly made its way down fifth avenue it was nearly five oclock the traffic was heavy and the sidewalks were jammed with lastminute christmas shoppers homebound office workers and tourists anxious to glimpse the elaborately trimmed store windows and the fabled rockefeller center christmas tree it was already dark and the sky was becoming heavy with clouds an apparent confirmation of the forecast for a white christmas but the blinking lights the sounds of carols the ringing bells of sidewalk santas and the generally jolly mood of the crowd gave an appropriately festive christmas eve atmosphere to the famous thoroughfare catherine dornan sat bolt upright in the back of the cab her arms around the shoulders of her two small sons by the rigidity she felt in their bodies she knew her mother had been right tenyearold michaels surliness and sevenyearold brians silence were sure signs that both boys were intensely worried about their dad earlier that afternoon when she had called her mother from the hospital still sobbing despite the fact that spence crowley her husbands old friend and doctor assured her that tom had come through the operation better than expected and even suggested that the boys visit him at seven oclock that night her mother had spoken to her firmly catherine youve got to pull yourself together she had said the boys are so upset and youre not helping i think it would be a good idea if you tried to divert them for a little while take them down to rockefeller center to see the tree then out to dinner seeing you so worried has practically convinced them that tom will die this isnt supposed to be happening catherine thought with every fiber of her being she wanted to undo the last ten days starting with that terrible moment when the phone rang and the call came from st marys hospital catherine can you come right over tom collapsed while he was making his rounds her immediate impression had been that there had to be a mistake lean athletic thirtyeightyearold men dont collapse and tom always joked that pediatricians had birthright immunization to all the viruses and germs that arrived with their patients but tom didnt have immunization from the leukemia that necessitated immediate removal of his grossly enlarged spleen at the hospital they told her that he must have been ignoring warning signs for months and i was too stupid to notice catherine thought as she tried to keep her lip from quivering she glanced out the window and saw that they were passing the plaza hotel eleven years ago on her twentythird birthday theyd had their wedding reception at the plaza brides are supposed to be nervous she thought i wasnt i practically ran up the aisle ten days later theyd celebrated little christmas in omaha where tom had accepted an appointment in the prestigious pediatrics unit of the hospital we bought that crazy artificial tree in the clearance sale she thought remembering how tom had held it up and said attention kmart shoppers this year the tree theyd selected so carefully was still in the garage its branches roped together theyd decided to come to new york for the surgery toms best friend spence crowley was now a prominent surgeon at sloankettering catherine winced at the thought of how upset shed been when she was finally allowed to see tom the cab pulled over to the curb okay here lady yes fine catherine said forcing herself to sound cheerful as she pulled out her wallet dad and i brought you guys down here on christmas eve five years ago brian i know you were too small but michael do you remember yes michael said shortly as he tugged at the handle on the door he watched as catherine peeled a five from the wad of bills in her wallet how come you have so much money mom when dad was admitted to the hospital yesterday they made me take everything he had in his billfold except a few dollars i should have sorted it out when i got back to grans she followed michael out onto the sidewalk and held the door open for brian they were in front of saks near the corner of fortyninth street and fifth avenue orderly lines of spectators were patiently waiting to get a closeup look at the christmas window display catherine steered her sons to the back of the line lets see the windows then well go across the street and get a better look at the tree brian sighed heavily this was some christmas he hated standing in linefor anything he decided to play the game he always played when he wanted time to pass quickly he would pretend he was already where he wanted to be and tonight that was in his dads room in the hospital he could hardly wait to see his dad to give him the present his grandmother had said would make him get well brian was so intent on getting on with the evening that when it was finally their turn to get up close to the windows he moved quickly barely noticing the scenes of whirling snowflakes and dolls and elves and animals dancing and singing he was glad when they finally were off the line then as they started to make their way to the corner to cross the avenue he saw that a guy with a violin was about to start playing and people were gathering around him the air suddenly was filled with the sound of silent night and people began singing catherine turned back from the curb wait lets listen for a few minutes she said to the boys brian could hear the catch in her throat and knew that she was trying not to cry hed hardly ever seen mom cry until that morning last week when someone phoned from the hospital and said dad was real sick cally walked slowly down fifth avenue it was a little after five and she was surrounded by crowds of lastminute shoppers their arms filled with packages there was a time when she might have shared their excitement but today all she felt was achingly tired work had been so difficult during the christmas holidays people wanted to be home so most of the patients in the hospital had been either depressed or difficult their bleak expressions reminded her vividly of her own depression over the last two christmases both of them spent in the bedford correctional facility for women she passed st patricks cathedral hesitating only a moment as a memory came back to her of her grandmother taking her and her brother jimmy there to see the cr√®che but that was twenty years ago she had been ten and he was six she wished fleetingly she could go back to that time change things keep the bad things from happening keep jimmy from becoming what he was now even to think his name was enough to send waves of fear coursing through her body dear god make him leave me alone she prayed early this morning with gigi clinging to her she had answered the angry pounding on her door to find detective shore and another officer who said he was detective levy standing in the dingy hallway of her apartment building on east tenth street and avenue b cally you putting up your brother again shores eyes had searched the room behind her for signs of his presence the question was callys first indication that jimmy had managed to escape from rikers island prison the charge is attempted murder of a prison guard the detective told her bitterness filling his voice the guard is in critical condition your brother shot him and took his uniform this time youll spend a lot more than fifteen months in prison if you help jimmy to escape accessory after the fact the second time around when youre talking attempted murderor murderof a law officer cally theyll throw the book at you ive never forgiven myself for giving jimmy money last time cally had said quietly sure and the keys to your car he reminded her cally i warn you dont help him this time i wont you can be sure of that and i did not know what he had done before shed watched as their eyes again shifted past her go ahead she had cried look around he isnt here and if you want to put a tap on my phone do that too i want you to hear me tell jimmy to turn himself in because thats all id have to say to him but surely jimmy wont find me she prayed as she threaded her way through the crowd of shoppers and sightseers not this time after she had served her prison sentence she took gigi from the foster home the social worker had located the tiny apartment on east tenth street and gotten her the job as a nurses aide at st lukesroosevelt hospital this would be her first christmas with gigi in two years if only she had been able to afford a few decent presents for her she thought a fouryearold kid should have her own new dolls carriage not the battered handmedown callyd been forced to get for her the coverlet and pillow she had bought wouldnt hide the shabbiness of the carriage but maybe she could find the guy who was selling dolls on the street around here last week they were only eight dollars and she remembered that there was even one that looked like gigi she hadnt had enough money with her that day but the guy said hed be on fifth avenue between fiftyseventh and fortyseventh streets on christmas eve so she had to find him o god she prayed let them arrest jimmy before he hurts anyone else theres something wrong with him there always has been ahead of her people were singing silent night as she got closer though she realized that they werent actually carolers just a crowd around a street violinist who was playing christmas tunes holy infant so tender and mild brian did not join in the singing even though silent night was his favorite and at home in omaha he was a member of his churchs childrens choir he wished he was there now not in new york and that they were getting ready to trim the christmas tree in their own living room and everything was the way it had been he liked new york and always looked forward to the summer visits with his grandmother he had fun then but he didnt like this kind of visit not on christmas eve with dad in the hospital and mom so sad and his brother bossing him around even though michael was only three years older brian stuck his hands in the pockets of his jacket they felt cold even though he had on his mittens he looked impatiently at the giant christmas tree across the street on the other side of the skating rink he knew that in a minute his mother was going to say all right now lets get a good look at the tree it was so tall and the lights on it were so bright and there was a big star on top of it but brian didnt care about that now or about the windows they had just seen he didnt want to listen to the guy playing the violin either and he didnt feel like standing here they were wasting time he wanted to get to the hospital and watch mom give dad the big st christopher medal that had saved grandpas life when he was a soldier in world war ii grandpa had worn it all through the war and it even had a dent in it where a bullet had hit it gran had asked mom to give it to dad and even though she had almost laughed mom had promised but said oh mother christopher was only a myth hes not considered a saint anymore and the only people he helped were the ones who sold the medals everybody used to stick on dashboards gran had said catherine your father believed it helped him get through some terrible battles and that is all that matters he believed and so do i please give it to tom and have faith brian felt impatient with his mother if gran believed that dad was going to get better if he got the medal then his mom had to give it to him he was positive gran was right sleep in heavenly peace the violin stopped playing and a woman who had been leading the singing held out a basket brian watched as people began to drop coins and dollar bills into it his mother pulled her wallet out of her shoulder bag and took out two onedollar bills michael brian here put these in the basket michael grabbed his dollar and tried to push his way through the crowd brian started to follow him then noticed that his mothers wallet hadnt gone all the way down into her shoulder bag when she had put it back as he watched he saw the wallet fall to the ground he turned back to retrieve it but before he could pick it up a hand reached down and grabbed it brian saw that the hand belonged to a thin woman with a dark raincoat and a long ponytail mom he said urgently but everyone was singing again and she didnt turn her head the woman who had taken the wallet began to slip through the crowd instinctively brian began to follow her afraid to lose sight of her he turned back to call out to his mother again but she was singing along now too god rest you merry gentlemen everyone was singing so loud he knew she couldnt hear him for an instant brian hesitated as he glanced over his shoulder at his mother should he run back and get her but he thought again about the medal that would make his father better it was in the wallet and he couldnt let it get stolen the woman was already turning the corner he raced to catch up with her why did i pick it up cally thought frantically as she rushed east on fortyeighth street toward madison avenue she had abandoned her plan of walking down fifth avenue to find the peddler with the dolls instead she headed toward the lexington avenue subway she knew it would be quicker to go up to fiftyfirst street for the train but the wallet felt like a hot brick in her pocket and it seemed to her that everywhere she turned everyone was looking at her accusingly grand central station would be mobbed she would get the train there it was a safer place to go a squad car passed her as she turned right and crossed the street despite the cold she had begun to perspire it probably belonged to that woman with the little boys it was on the ground next to her in her mind cally replayed the moment when she had taken in the slim young woman in the rosecolored allweather coat that she could see was furlined from the turnedback sleeves the coat obviously was expensive as were the womans shoulder bag and boots the dark hair that came to the collar of her coat was shiny she didnt look like she could have a care in the world cally had thought i wish i looked like that shes about my age and my size and we have almost the same color hair well maybe by next year i can afford pretty clothes for gigi and me then shed turned her head to catch a glimpse of the saks windows so i didnt see her drop the wallet she thought but as she passed the woman shed felt her foot kick something and shed looked down and seen it lying there why didnt i just ask if it was hers cally agonized but in that instant shed remembered how years ago grandma had come home one day embarrassed and upset shed found a wallet on the street and opened it and saw the name and address of the owner shed walked three blocks to return it even though by then her arthritis was so bad that every step hurt the woman who owned it had looked through it and said that a twentydollar bill was missing grandma had been so upset she practically accused me of being a thief that memory had flooded cally the minute she touched the wallet suppose it did belong to the lady in the rose coat and she thought cally had picked her pocket or taken money out of it suppose a policeman was called theyd find out she was on probation they wouldnt believe her any more than theyd believed her when she lent jimmy money and her car because hed told her if he didnt get out of town right away a guy in another street gang was going to kill him oh god why didnt i just leave the wallet there she thought she considered tossing it in the nearest mailbox she couldnt risk that there were too many undercover cops around midtown during the holidays suppose one of them saw her and asked what she was doing no shed get home right away aika who minded gigi along with her own grandchildren after the daycare center closed would be bringing her home it was getting late ill put the wallet in an envelope addressed to whoevers name is in it and drop it in the mailbox later cally decided thats all i can do cally reached grand central station as she had hoped it was mobbed with people rushing in all directions to trains and subways hurrying home for christmas she shouldered her way across the main terminal finally making it down the steps to the entrance to the lexington avenue subway as she dropped a token in the slot and hurried for the express train to fourteenth street she was unaware of the small boy who had slipped under a turnstile and was dogging her footsteps god rest you merry gentlemen let nothing youdismay the familiar words seemed to taunt catherine reminding her of the forces that threatened the happily complacent life she had assumed would be hers forever her husband was in the hospital with leukemia his enlarged spleen had been removed this morning as a precaution against it rupturing and while it was too early to tell for sure he seemed to be doing well still she could not escape the fear that he was not going to live and the thought of life without him was almost paralyzing why didnt i realize tom was getting sick she agonized she remembered how only two weeks ago when shed asked him to take groceries from the car hed reached into the trunk for the heaviest bag hesitated then winced as he picked it up shed laughed at him play golf yesterday act like an old man today some athlete wheres brian michael asked as he returned from dropping the dollar in the singers basket startled from her thoughts catherine looked down at her son brian she said blankly hes right here she glanced down at her side and then her eyes scanned the area he had a dollar didnt he go with you to give it to the singer no michael said gruffly he probably kept it instead hes a dork stop it catherine said she looked around suddenly alarmed brian she called brian the carol was over the crowd dispersing where was brian he wouldnt just walk away surely brian she called out again this time loudly alarm clear in her voice a few people turned and looked at her curiously a little boy she said becoming frightened hes wearing a dark blue ski jacket and a red cap did anyone see where he went she watched as heads shook as eyes looked around wanting to help a woman pointed behind them to the lines of people waiting to see the saks windows maybe he went there she said in a heavy accent how about the tree would he have crossed the street to get up close to it another woman suggested maybe the cathedral someone volunteered no no brian wouldnt do that were going to visit his father brian cant wait to see him as she said the words catherine knew that something was terribly wrong she felt the tears that now came so easily rising behind her eyes she fumbled in her bag for a handkerchief and realized something was missing the familiar bulk of her wallet oh my god she said my wallets gone mom and now michael lost the surly look that had become his way of disguising the worry about his father he was suddenly a scared tenyearold mom do you think brian was kidnapped how could he be nobody could just drag him off thats impossible catherine felt her legs were turning to rubber call the police she cried my little boy is missing the station was crowded hundreds of people were rushing in every direction there were christmas decorations all over the place it was noisy too sound of all kinds echoed through the big space bouncing off the ceiling high above him a man with his arm full of packages bumped a sharp elbow into brians ear sorry kid he was having trouble keeping up with the woman who had his moms wallet he kept losing sight of her he struggled to get around a family with a couple of kids who were blocking his way he got past them but bumped into a lady who glared down at him be careful she snapped im sorry brian said politely looking up at her in that second he almost lost the woman he was following catching up toher again as she went down a staircase and hurried through a long corridor that led to a subway station when she went through a turnstile he slipped under the next one and followed her onto a train the car was so crowded he could hardly get in the woman was standing hanging on to a bar that ran over the seats along the side brian stood near her his hand gripping a pole they went only one long stop then she pushed her way to the opening doors so many people were in brians way that he almost didnt get out of the subway car in time and then he had to hurry to catch up with her he chased after her as she went up the stairs to another train this time the car wasnt as crowded and brian stood near an old lady who reminded him of his grandmother the woman in the dark raincoat got off at the second stop and he followed her his eyes fixed on her ponytail as she practically ran up the stairs to the street they emerged on a busy corner buses raced past in both directions rushing to get across the wide street before the light turned red brian glanced behind him as far as he could see down the block there were nothing but apartment houses light streamed from hundreds of windows the lady with the wallet stood waiting for the light to turn the walk sign flashed on and he followed his quarry across the street when she reached the other side she turned left and walked quickly down the now sloping sidewalk as he followed her brian took a quick look at the street sign when they visited last summer his mother had made a game of teaching him about street signs in new york gran lives on eightyseventh street she had said were on fiftieth how many blocks away is her apartment this sign said fourteenth street he had to remember that he told himself as he fell in step behind the woman with his moms wallet he felt snowflakes on his face it was getting windy and the cold stung his cheeks he wished a cop would come along so he could ask for help but he didnt see one anywhere he knew what he was going to do anywayhe would follow the lady to where she lived he still had the dollar his mother had given him for the man who was playing the violin he would get change and call his grandmother and shed send a cop who would get his moms wallet back its a good plan he thought to himself in fact he was sure of it he had to get the wallet and the medal that was inside he thought of how after mom had said that the medal wouldnt do any good gran had put it in her hand and said please give itto tom and have faith the look on his grandmothers face had been so calm and so sure that brian knew she was right once he got the medal back and they gave it to his dad he would get well brian knew it the woman with the ponytail started to walk faster he chased after her as she crossed one street and went to the end of another block then she turned right the street they were on now wasnt bright with decorated store windows like the one they had just left some places were boarded up and there was a lot of writing on the buildings and some of the streetlights were broken a guy with a beard was sitting on the curb clutching a bottle he stretched out his hand to brian as he passed him for the first time brian felt scared but he kept his eyes on the woman the snow was falling faster now and the sidewalk was getting slippery he stumbled once but managed not to fall he was out of breath trying to keep up with the lady how far was she going he wondered four blocks later he had his answer she stepped into the entranceway to an old building stuck her key in the lock and went inside brian raced to catch the door before it closed behind her but he was too late the door was locked brian didnt know what to do next but then through the glass he saw a man coming toward him as the man opened the door and hurried past him brian managed to grab it and to duck inside before it closed again the hall was dark and dirty and the smell of stale food hung in the air ahead of him he could hear footsteps going up the stairs gulping to swallow his fear and trying to not make noise brian slowly began to climb to the first landing he would see where the lady went then he would get out of there and find a telephone maybe instead of calling gran he would dial l he thought his mom had taught him that that was what he should do when he really needed help which so far he didnt all right mrs dornan describe your son to me the police officer said soothingly hes seven and small for his age catherine said she could hear the shrillness in her voice they were sitting in a squad car parked in front of saks near the spot where the violinist had been playing she felt michaels hand clutch hers reassuringly what color hair the officer asked michael answered like mine kind of reddish his eyes are blue hes got freckles and one of his front teeth is missing he has the same kind of pants im wearing and his jacket is like mine cept its blue and mine is green hes skinny the policeman looked approvingly at michael youre a real help son now maam you say your wallet is missing do you think you might have dropped it or did anyone brush against you i mean could it have been a pickpocket i dont know catherine said i dont care about the wallet but when i gave the boys money for the violinist i probably didnt push it down far enough in my purse it was quite bulky and might have just fallen out your son wouldnt have picked it up and decided to go shopping no no no catherine said with a flash of anger shaking her head emphatically please dont waste time even considering that where do you live maam what i mean is do you want to call anyone the policeman looked at the rings on catherines left hand your husband my husband is in sloankettering hospital hes very ill hell be wondering where we are in fact we should be with him soon hes expecting us catherine put her hand on the door of the squad car i cant just sit here ive got to look for brian mrs dornan im going to get brians description out right now in three minutes every cop in manhattan is going to be on the lookout for him you know he may have just wandered away and gotten confused it happens do you come downtown often we used to live in new york but we live in nebraska now michael told him we visit my grandmother every summer she lives on eightyseventh street we came back last week because my dad has leukemia and he needed an operation he went to medical school with the doctor who operated on him manuel ortiz had been a policeman only a year but already he had come in contact with grief and despair many times he saw both in the eyes of this young woman she had a husband who was very sick now a missing kid it was obvious to him that she could easily go into shock dads gonna know somethings wrong michael said worried mom shouldnt you go see him mrs dornan how about leaving michael with us well stay here in case brian tries to make his way back well have all our guys looking for him well fan out and use bullhorns to get him to contact us in case hes wandering around in the neighborhood somewhere ill get another car to take you up to the hospital and wait for you youll stay right here in case he comes back absolutely michael will you keep your eyes peeled for brian sure mom ill watch out for the dork dont call him then catherine saw the look on her sons face hes trying to get a rise out of me she thought hes trying to convince me that brian is fine that hell be fine she put her arms around michael and felt his small gruff embrace in return hang in there mom he said jimmy siddons cursed silently as he walked through the oval near avenue b in the stuyvesant town apartment complex the uniform he had stripped from the prison guard gave him a respectable look but was much too dangerous to wear on the street hed managed to lift a filthy overcoat and knit cap from a homeless guys shopping cart they helped some but he had to find something else to wear something decent he also needed a car he needed one that wouldnt be missed until morning something parked for the night the kind of car that one of these middleclass stuyvesant town residents would own mediumsized brown or black looking like every other honda or toyota or ford on the road nothing fancy so far he hadnt seen the right one he had watched as some old geezer got out of a honda and said to his passenger sures good to get home but he was driving one of those shiny red jobs that screamed for attention a kid pulled up in an old heap and parked but from the sound of the engine jimmy wanted no part of it just what hed need he thought get on the thruway and have it break down he was cold and getting hungry ten hours in the car he told himself then ill be in canada and paige will meet me there and well disappear again she was the first real girlfriend hed ever had and shed been a big help to him in detroit he knew he never would have been caught last summer if he had cased that gas station in michigan better he should have known enough to check the john outside the office instead of letting himself be surprised by an offduty cop who stepped out of it while he was holding a gun on the attendant the next day he was on his way back to new york to face trial for killing a cop an older couple passed him and threw a smile in his direction merry christmas jimmy responded with a courteous nod of the head then he paid close attention as he heard the woman say ed i cant believe you didnt put the presents for the children in the trunk who leaves anything in sight in a car overnight in this day and age jimmy went around the corner and then stepped into the deep shadows on the grass as he returned to watch the couple stop in front of a darkcolored toyota the man opened the door from the backseat he took a small rocking horse and handed it to the woman then scooped up a halfdozen brightly wrapped packages with her help he transferred everything to the trunk relocked the car and got back on the sidewalk jimmy listened as the woman said i guess the phones all right in the glove compartment and her husband answered sure it is waste of money as far as im concerned cant wait to see bobbys face tomorrow when he opens everything he watched as they turned the corner and disappeared which meant from their apartment they wouldnt be able to glance out and notice an empty parking space jimmy waited ten minutes before he walked to the car a few snowflakes swirled around him two minutes later he was driving out of the complex it was quarter after five he was headed to callys apartment on tenth and b he knew shed be surprised to see him and none too happy she probably thought he couldnt find her why did she suppose that he didnt have a way to keep track of her even from rikers island he wondered big sister he thought as he drove onto fourteenth street you promised grandma youd take care of me jimmy needs guidance grandma had said hes in with a bad crowd hes too easily led well cally hadnt come to see him once in rikers not once he hadnt even heard from her hed have to be careful he was sure the cops would be watching for him around callys building but he had that figured out too he used to hang around this neighborhood and knew how to get across the roofs from the other end of the block and into the building a couple of times hed even pulled a job there when he was a kid knowing cally he was sure she still kept some of franks clothes in the closet shed been crazy about him probably still had pictures of him all over the place youd never think hed died even before gigi was born and knowing cally shed have at least a few bucks to get her little brother through the tolls he figured hed find a way to convince her to keep her mouth shut until he was safely in canada with paige paige an image of her floated through his mind luscious blond only twentytwo crazy about him shed arranged everything gotten the gun smuggled in to him shed never let him down or turn her back on him jimmys smile was unpleasant you never tried to help me while i was rotting in rikers island he thoughtbut once again sister dear youre going to help me get away like it or not he parked the car a block from the rear of callys building and pretended to be checking a tire as he looked around no cops in sight even if they were watching callys place they probably didnt know you could get to it through the boardedup dump as he straightened up he cursed damn bumper sticker too noticeable were spending our grandchildrens inheritance he managed to pull most of it off fifteen minutes later jimmy had picked the flimsy lock of callys apartment and was inside some dump he thought as he took in the cracks in the ceiling and the worn linoleum in the tiny entranceway but neat cally was always neat a christmas tree in the corner of what passed for a living room had a couple of small brightly wrapped packages under it jimmy shrugged and went into the bedroom where he ransacked the closet to find the clothes he knew would be there after changing he went through the place looking for money but found none he yanked open the doors that separated the stove refrigerator and sink from the living room searched unsuccessfully for a beer settled for a pepsi and made himself a sandwich from what his sources had told him cally should be home by now from her job in the hospital he knew that on the way she picked up gigi from the babysitter he sat on the couch his eyes riveted on the front door his nerves jangling hed spent most of the few dollars he found in the guards pockets on food from street vendors he had to have money for the tolls on the thruway as well as enough for another tank of gas come on cally he thought where the hell are you at ten to six he heard the key inserted in the lock he jumped up and in three long strides was in the entryway flattened against the wall he waited until cally stepped in and closed the door behind her then put his hand over her mouth dont scream he whispered as he muffled her terrified moan with his palm understand she nodded eyes wide open in fear wheres gigi why isnt she with you he released his grip long enough to let her gasp in an almost inaudible voice shes at the babysitters shes keeping her longer today so i can shop jimmy what are you doing here how much money have you got here take my pocketbook cally held it out to him praying that he would not think to look through her coat pockets oh god she thought make him go away he took the purse and in a low and menacing tone warned cally im going to let go of you dont try anything or gigi wont have a mommy waiting for her understand that yes yes cally waited until he released his grip on her then slowly turned to face him she hadnt seen her brother since that terrible night nearly three years ago when with gigi in her arms she had come home from her job at the daycare center to find him waiting in her apartment in the west village he looks about the same she thought except that his hair is shorter and his face is thinner in his eyes there wasnt even a trace of the occasional warmth that at one time made her hope there was a possibility he might someday straighten out no more there was nothing left of the frightened sixyearold who had clung to her when their mother dumped them with grandma and disappeared from their lives he opened her purse rummaged through it and pulled out her bright green combination change purse and billfold eighteen dollars he said angrily after a quick count of her money is that all jimmy i get paid the day after tomorrow cally pleaded please just take it and get out of here please leave me alone theres half a tank of gas in the car jimmy thought theres money here for another half tank and the tolls i might just be able to make canada hed have to shut cally up of course which should be easy enough he would just warn her that if she put the cops onto him and he got caught hed swear that she got someone to smuggle the gun in to him that hed used on the guard suddenly a sound from outside made him whirl around he put his eye to the peephole in the door but could see no one there with a menacing gesture to cally indicating that she had better keep quiet he noiselessly turned the knob and opened the door a fraction just in time to see a small boy straighten up turn and start to tiptoe to the staircase in one quick movement jimmy flung open the door and scooped up the child one arm around his waist the other covering his mouth and pulled him inside then roughly set him down eavesdropping kid who is this cally jimmy leave him alone i dont know who he is she cried ive never seen him before brian was so scared he could hardly talk but he could tell the man and woman were mad at each other maybe the man would help him get his mothers wallet back he thought he pointed to cally she has my moms wallet jimmy released brian well now thats good news he said with a grin turning to his sister isnt it aplainclothesman in an unmarked car drove catherine to the hospital ill wait right here mrs dornan he said i have the radio on so well know the minute they find brian catherine nodded if they find brian raced through her mind she felt her throat close against the terror that thought evoked the lobby of the hospital was decorated for the holiday season a christmas tree was in the center garlands of evergreens were hung and poinsettias were banked against the reception desk she got a visitors pass and learned that tom was now in room she walked to the bank of elevators and entered a car already half full mostly with hospital personneldoctors in white jackets with the telltale pen and notebook in their breast pockets attendants in green scrub suits a couple of nurses two weeks ago catherine thought tom was making his rounds at st marys in omaha and i was christmas shopping that evening we took the kids out for hamburgers life was normal and good and fun and we were joking about how last year tom had had so much trouble getting the christmas tree in the stand and i promised him id buy a new stand before this christmas eve and once again i thought tom looked so tired and i did nothing about it three days later he collapsed didnt you push the fifth floor someone asked catherine blinked oh yes thank you she got off the elevator and for a moment stood still getting her bearings she found what she was looking for an arrow on the wall pointing toward rooms to as she approached the nurses station she saw spence crowley her mouth went dry immediately following the operation this morning he had assured her that it had gone smoothly and that his assistant would be making the rounds this afternoon then why was spence here now she worried could something be wrong he spotted her and smiled oh god he wouldnt smile if tom were it was another thought she could not finish he walked quickly around the desk and came to her catherine if you could see the look on your face toms doing fine hes pretty groggy of course but the vital signs are good catherine looked up at him wanting to believe the words she heard wanting to trust the sincerity she saw in the brown eyes behind rimless glasses firmly he took her arm and ushered her into the cubicle behind the nurses station catherine i dont want to bully you but you have to understand that tom has a good chance of beating this thing a very good chance i have patients whove led useful full lives with leukemia there are different types of medicine to control it the one i plan to use with tom is interferon its worked miracles with some of my patients it will mean daily injections at first but after we get the dosage adjusted hell be able to give them to himself when he recuperates fully from the operation he can go back to work and i swear to you thats going to happen then he added quietly but there is a problem now he looked stern this afternoon when you saw tom in icu i understand you were pretty upset yes she had tried not to cry but couldnt stop shed been so worried and knowing that he had made it through the operation was such a relief that she couldnt help herself catherine tom just asked me to level with him he thinks i told you it was hopeless hes starting to not trust me hes beginning to wonder if maybe im hiding something that maybe things are worse than im telling him well catherine that is simply not so and your job is to convince him that you have every expectation that you two will have a long life together he mustnt get it in his head that he has a very limited time not only because that would be harmful to him but equally important because i dont believe thats true in order to get well tom needs faith in his chances to get better and a great deal of that has to come from you spence i should have seen he was getting sick spence put his arms around her shoulders in a brief hug listen he said theres an old adage physician heal thyself when tom is feeling better im going to rake him over the coals for ignoring some of the warnings his body was giving him but now go in there with a light step and a happy face you can do it catherine forced a smile like this much better he nodded just keep smiling remember its christmas thought you were bringing the kids tonight she could not talk about brian being missing not now instead she practiced what she would tell tom brian was sneezing and i want to make sure hes not starting with a cold that was wise okay see you tomorrow kiddo now remember keep that smile going youre gorgeous when you smile catherine nodded and started down the hall to room she opened the door quietly tom was asleep an iv unit was dripping fluid into his arm oxygen tubes were in his nostrils his skin was as white as the pillowcase his lips were ashen the private duty nurse stood up hes been asking for you mrs dornan ill wait outside catherine pulled up a chair next to the bed she sat down and placed her hand over the one lying on the coverlet she studied her husbands face scrutinizing every detail the high forehead framed by the reddish brown hair that was exactly the color of brians the thick eyebrows that always looked a bit unruly the wellshaped nose and the lips that were usually parted in a smile she thought of his eyes more blue than gray and the warmth and understanding they conveyed he gives confidence to his patients she thought oh tom i want to tell you that our little boy is missing i want you to be well and with me looking for him tom dornan opened his eyes hi love he said weakly hi yourself she bent over and kissed him im sorry i was such a wimp this afternoon call it pms or just oldfashioned relief you know what a sentimental slob i am i even cry at happy endings she straightened up and looked directly into his eyes youre doing great you really are you know she could see he did not believe her not yet she thought determinedly i thought you were bringing the kids tonight his voice was low and halting she realized that with tom it was not possible to utter brians name without breaking down instead she said quickly i was afraid theyd be hanging all over you i thought it was a good idea to let them wait until tomorrow morning your mother phoned tom said drowsily the nurse spoke to her she said she sent a special present for you to give me what is it not without the boys they want to be the ones to give it to you okay but be sure to bring them in the morning i want to see them for sure but since its just the two of us now maybe i should climb in the sack with you tom opened his eyes again now youre talking a smile flickered on his lips and then he was asleep again for a long moment she laid her head on the bed then got up as the nurse tiptoed back in doesnt he look fantastic catherine asked brightly as the nurse put her fingers on toms pulse she knew that even slipping into sleep tom might hear her then with a last glance at her husband she hurried from the room down the corridor and to the elevator then through the lobby and into the waiting police car the plainclothesman answered her unasked question no word so far mrs dornan isaid give it to me jimmy siddons said ominously cally tried to brave it out i dont know what this boy is talking about jimmy yes you do brian said i saw you pick up my moms wallet and i followed you because i have to get it back arent you a smart kid siddons sneered always go where the buck is his expression turned ugly as he faced his sister dont make me take it from you cally there was no use trying to pretend she didnt have it jimmy knew the boy was telling the truth cally still had her coat on she reached into the pocket and took out the handsome moroccan leather wallet silently she handed it to her brother that belongs to my mother brian said defiantly then the glance the man gave him made him shiver he had been about to try to grab the wallet instead now suddenly fearful he dug his hands deep in his pockets jimmy siddons opened the billfold my my he said his tone now admiring cally you surprise me you run rings around some of the pickpockets i know i didnt steal it cally protested someone dropped it i found it i was going to mail it back well you can forget that jimmy said its mine now and i need it he pulled out a thick wad of bills and began counting three hundreddollar bills four fifties six twenties four tens five fives three ones six hundred and eightyeight dollars not bad in fact itll do just fine he stuffed the money in the pocket of the suede jacket he had taken from the bedroom closet and began to dig through the compartments in the wallet credit cards well why not drivers license no two of them catherine dornan and dr thomas dornan whos dr thomas dornan kid my dad hes in the hospital brian watched as the deep compartment in the wallet revealed the medal jimmy siddons lifted it out held it up by the chain then laughed incredulously st christopher i havent been inside a church in years but even i know they kicked him out long ago and when i think of all the stories grandma used to tell us about how he carried the christ child on his shoulders across the stream or the river or whatever it was remember cally disdainfully he let the medal clatter to the floor brian swooped to retrieve it he clutched it in his hand then slipped it around his neck my grandpa carried it all through the war and came home safe its going to make my dad get better i dont care about the wallet you can have it this is what i really wanted im going home now he turned and ran for the door he had twisted the knob and pulled the door open before siddons reached him clapped a hand over his mouth and yanked him back inside you and st christopher are staying right here with me buddy he said as he shoved him roughly to the floor brian gasped as his forehead slammed onto the cracked linoleum he sat up slowly rubbing his head he felt like the room was spinning but he could hear the woman he had followed pleading with the man jimmy dont hurt him please leave us alone take the money and go but get out of here brian wrapped his arms around his legs trying not to cry he shouldnt have followed the lady he knew that now he should have yelled instead of following her so that maybe somebody would stop her this man was bad this man wasnt going to let him go home and nobody knew where he was nobody knew where to look for him he felt the medal dangling against his chest and closed his fist around it please get me back to mom he prayed silently so i can bring you to dad he did not look up to see jimmy siddons studying him he did not know that jimmys mind was racing assessing the situation this kid followed cally when she took the wallet siddons thought did anyone follow him no if they had theyd be here by now where did you get the wallet he asked his sister on fifth avenue across from rockefeller center cally was terrified now jimmy would stop at nothing to get away not at killing her not at killing this child his mother must have dropped it i picked it up off the sidewalk i guess he saw me i guess he did jimmy looked at the phone on the table next to the couch then grinning he reached for the cellular phone he had taken from the glove compartment of the stolen car he also took out a gun and pointed it at cally the cops may have your phone tapped he pointed at the table next to the couch go over there im going to dial your number and tell you im turning myself in and i want you to call that public defender who is representing me all you have to do is act nice and nervous just like you are now make a mistake and you and this kid are dead he looked down at brian one peep out of you and he left the threat unspoken brian nodded to show he understood he was too scared to even promise that hed be quiet cally you got all that straight cally nodded how stupid ive been she thought i was fool enough to believe id gotten away from him no chance he even knows this phone number he finished dialing and the phone beside her rang hello her voice was low and muffled cally its jimmy listen im in trouble you probably know by now im sorry i tried to get away i hope that guard will be all right im broke and im scared jimmys voice was a whine call gil weinstein hes the public defender assigned to me tell him ill meet him at st patricks cathedral when midnight mass is over tell him i want to turn myself in and i want him to be with me his home number is cally im sorry i messed up everything so badly jimmy pressed the disconnect on the cellular phone and watched as cally hung up as well they cant trace a cellular phone call you know that dont you okay now phone weinstein and give him the same story if the cops are listening they must be jumping up and down right now jimmy theyll think i in two steps jimmy was beside her the gun to her head make the call your lawyer may not be home he may refuse to meet you naw i know him hes a jerk hell want the publicity get him cally did not need to be told to make it quick the moment gil weinstein was on the line she rushed to say you dont know me im cally hunter my brother jimmy siddons just called he wants me to tell you in a quavering voice she delivered the message ill meet him the lawyer said im glad hes doing this but if that prison guard dies jimmy is facing a deathpenalty trial he could get life without parole for the first killing but now his voice trailed off i think he knows that cally saw jimmys gesture i have to go now goodbye mr weinstein you make a great accomplice big sister jimmy told her he looked down at brian whats your name kid brian he whispered come on brian were getting out of here jimmy leave him alone please leave him here with me no way theres always the chance youd go running to the cops even though the minute they talk to that kid youre in big trouble yourself after all you did steal his mamas wallet no the kid comes with me no one is looking for a guy with his little boy are they ill let him go tomorrow morning when i get to where im headed after that you can tell them anything you like about me the kidll even back you up wont you sonny brian shrank against cally he was so afraid of the man that he was trembling was the man going to make him go away with him jimmy leave him here please cally thrust brian behind her jimmy siddonss mouth twisted in anger he grabbed callys arm and yanked her toward him roughly twisting her arm behind her she screamed as she lost her grip on brian and slipped to the floor with eyes that denied any history of affection between them jimmy stood over his sister again holding the gun to her head if you dont do what i tell you youll get more of that and worse they wont take me alive not you not nobody else is gonna send me to the death chamber besides i got a girlfriend waiting for me so just keep your mouth shut ill even make a deal you dont say nothing and ill let the kid live but if the cops try to close in on me he gets a bullet in the head its as simple as that got it straight he stuck the gun back inside his jacket then reached down and roughly pulled brian to his feet you and i are gonna get to be real pals sonny he said real pals he grinned merry christmas cally the unmarked van parked across the street from callys apartment building was the lookout post for the detectives watching callys building for any sign of jimmy siddons they had observed cally come home at just a little after her usual time jack shore the detective who had visited cally in the morning pulled off his earphones swore silently and turned to his partner what do you think mort no wait a minute ill tell you what i think its a trick hes trying to buy time to get as far away from new york as possible while we take up the collection at st pats looking for him mort levy twenty years younger than shore and less cynical rubbed his chin always a sign that he was deep in thought if it is a trick i dont think the sister is a willing accomplice you dont need a meter to hear the stress level in her voice listen mort you were at bill grassos funeral thirty years old with four little kids and shot between the eyes by that bum siddons if cally hunter had come clean with us and told us that shed given that rat brother of hers money and the keys to her car grasso would have known what he was up against when he stopped him for running a light i still believe that cally had bought jimmys story about trying to get away because hed been in a gang fight and the other gang was after him i dont think she knew that hed wounded a clerk in a liquor store up till then he hadnt been in really serious trouble you mean hed gotten away with it till then shore snapped too bad that judge couldnt put cally away as an accessory to murder instead of just for aiding a fugitive she got off after serving fifteen months bill grassos widow is trimming the tree without him tonight his face reddened with anger ill call in just in case that louse meant what he said weve got to cover the cathedral you know how many people go to midnight mass there tonight take a guess cally sat on the worn velour sofa her hands clasped around her knees her head bent her eyes closed her entire body was trembling she was beyond tears beyond fatigue dear god dear god why did all this happen what should she do if anything happened to brian she would be responsible she had picked up his mothers wallet and thats why hed followed her if the child was right his dad was very ill she thought of the attractive young woman in the rosecolored coat and how she had been sure everything in her life was perfect would jimmy let the boy go when he got to wherever was his destination how could he she reasoned wherever that was theyd start searching for jimmy in that area and if he does let him gobrian will tell how he followed me because i tookthe wallet she reminded herself but jimmy had said he would shoot the child if the cops closed in on him and he meant it she was certain of that so if i tell the cops brian doesnt have a chance she thought if i dont say anything now and jimmy does let him go then i can honestly say that i didnt tell because he threatened to kill the kid if the cops got near him and i knew he meant it and i know he does mean it cally thought thats the worst part brians face loomed in callys mind the reddish brown hair that fell forward on his forehead the large intelligent blue eyes the spatter of freckles on his cheeks and nose when jimmy dragged him in her first impression was that he wasnt more than five from the way he spoke though she was sure he was older he was so scared when jimmy made him go with him out the window and onto the fire escape he had looked back at her his eyes pleading the phone rang it was aika the wonderful black woman who minded gigi along with her own grandchildren each afternoon after the daycare center closed just checking to see if youre home cally aika said her voice rich and comforting did you find the doll man im afraid not too bad you need more time to shop no ill come right over now and get gigi no thats okay she already ate dinner with my gang i need milk for breakfast so ive got to go out anyway ill drop her off in half an hour or so thanks aika cally put down the receiver aware that she still had her coat on and that the apartment was dark except for the entryway light she took off the coat went into the bedroom and opened the closet door she gasped when she saw that when he took franks suede jacket and brown slacks jimmy had left other clothes crumpled on the floor a jacket and pants and a filthy overcoat she bent down and picked up the jacket detective shore had told her that jimmy had shot a guard and stripped him of his uniform obviously this was the uniformand there were bullet holes in the jacket frantically cally wrapped the jacket and pants inside the overcoat suppose the cops came in with a search warrant theyd never believe her that jimmy broke into her place theyd be sure she gave him clothes shed go back to prison and shed lose gigi for good what should she do she looked around the closet wildly searching for a solution the storage box on the overhead shelf in it she kept whatever summer clothes she and gigi had she yanked the box down opened it pulled out the contents and threw them on the shelf she folded the uniform and coat into the box closed it ran to the bed and fished under it for the christmas wrappings she had stored there with frantic fingers she wrapped candycane paper around the box and tied it with a ribbon then she carried it into the living room and put it under the tree she had just completed the task when she heard the downstairs buzzer smoothing back her hair and forcing a welcoming smile for gigi she went to answer it it was detective shore and the other detective who had been with him this morning who came up the stairs playing games again cally shore asked i hope not brian huddled in the passenger seat as jimmy siddons drove up the east river drive he had never felt so afraid before hed been scared when the man made him climb up that fire escape to the roof then hed practically been dragged from one roof to another as they went the length of the block finally going down through an empty building and onto the street where this car was parked the man had pushed brian into the car and snapped on the seat belt just remember to call me daddy if anyone stops us he had warned him brian knew the mans name was jimmy that was what the woman had called him she had looked so worried about brian when jimmy pulled him through the window she had been crying and brian could tell how scared she was for him she knew his parents names maybe she would call the cops if she did would they come looking for him but jimmy said hed kill him if the cops came would he brian huddled deeper in the seat he was scared and hungry and he had to go to the bathroom but he was afraid to ask his only comfort was the medal that now lay against his chest on the outside of his jacket it had brought grandpa home from the war it was going to make daddy well and it was going to get him home safe too he was sure of it jimmy siddons glanced briefly at his small hostage for the first time since he had broken out of the prison he was beginning to relax it was still snowing but if it didnt get any worse than this it was nothing to worry about cally wouldnt call the cops he was positive of that she knew him well enough to believe him when he said he would kill the kid if he was stopped im not going to rot in prison for the rest of my life he thought and im not giving them the chance to pump me full of poison either i make it or i dont but i will he smiled grimly he knew there had to be an apb out on him and theyd be watching all the bridges and tunnels out of new york but they had no idea where he was heading and they certainly werent looking for a father and son traveling in a car that wasnt reported stolen yet hed pulled out all the presents he had seen the couple stash in the trunk now they were piled on the backseat bundles of christmas cheer those presents coupled with the kid in the front meant even if toll takers had been alerted to be on the lookout theyd never glance twice at him now and in eight or nine hours he would be across the border and into canada where paige would be waiting and then he would find a nice deep lake that would be the final destination of this car and all the nice presents in the backseat and this kid with his st christopher medal the awesome power of the new york city police department ground methodically into gear as plans were laid to assure that jimmy siddons did not slip between their fingers just in case at the last minute he panicked and decided not to surrender after midnight mass as soon as their wiretap recorded callys phone calls from jimmy and to his lawyer jack shore had called in the information he had let the higherups know exactly what he thought of siddonss decision to surrender its an outandout crock he had barked we tie up a couple of hundred cops till onethirty or two in the morning and hes halfway to canada or mexico before we find out that hes made us look like a bunch of fools finally the deputy police commissioner in charge of the manhunt had snapped all right jack we know what you think now lets get on with it theres been no sign of him around his sisters place no sir jack shore had said and hung up and then he and his partner mort had gone to visit cally when they got back to the van shore again reported in to headquarters we just were back to hunters apartment sir shes fully aware of the consequences if she helps her brother in any way the babysitter dropped off her kid as we were leaving and my guess is callys in for the night mort levy frowned as he listened to his partners conversation with the deputy police commissioner there was something about that apartment that was different from the way it had looked this morning but he couldnt figure out what it was mentally he reviewed the layout the small entryway the bathroom directly off it the narrow combination living roomkitchen the celllike bedroom barely large enough to hold a single bed a cot for the little girl and a threedrawer dresser jack had asked cally if she would mind if they looked around again and she had nodded assent certainly no one was hiding in that place they had opened the door to the bathroom looked under the beds poked in the closet levy had felt unwilling pity for cally hunters attempts to brighten the dismal flat all the walls were painted a bright yellow floral pillows were randomly piled on the old couch the christmas tree was bravely decorated with tons of tinsel and strings of red and green lights a few brightly wrapped presents were placed under it presents mort did not know why this word triggered something in his subconscious he thought for a moment then shook his head forget it he told himself he wished jack hadnt bullied cally hunter it was easy to see that she was terrified of him mort hadnt been in on her case which had been tried over two years ago but from what hed heard he believed that cally honestly thought that her troublesome kid brother had been in a gang fight and that the members of the other gang were hunting him what am i trying to remember about her apartment mort asked himself what was different they were normally scheduled to go off duty at eight oclock but tonight both he and jack were going back to headquarters instead like dozens of others they would be working overtime at least until after midnight mass at the cathedral maybe just maybe siddons would show up as he had promised levy knew that shore was aching to make the arrest personally i could spot that guy if he was wearing a nuns habit he kept saying over and over again there was a tap at the back door of the van signifying that their replacements had arrived as mort stood up stretched and stepped down onto the street he was glad that just before he left cally hunters apartment he had slipped her his card and whispered if you want to talk to anyone mrs hunter heres a number where you can reach me the crowds on fifth avenue had thinned out although there were still some onlookers around the tree in rockefeller center others were still lined up waiting to see sakss window display and there was a steady stream of visitors slipping in and out of st patricks cathedral but as the car she was in pulled up behind the squad car where officer ortiz and michael were waiting catherine could see that most of the lastminute shoppers were gone theyre on their way home she thought to do the final gift wrapping and to tell each other that next year for sure they wont be rushing around to stores on christmas eve everything at the last minute that had been her own pattern until twelve years ago when a thirdyear resident dr thomas dornan came into the administration office of st vincent s hospital walked over to her desk and said youre new here arent you tom so easygoing but so organized if she were the one who was sick tom wouldnt have stuffed all her money and identification into his own bulging wallet he wouldnt have dropped it into his pocket so carelessly that someone either reached in and grabbed it or picked it up off the ground that was the thought that was torturing catherine as she opened the car door and through the swirling snow ran the few steps to the squad car brian would never have wandered away on his own she was sure of that he was so anxious to get to tom he hadnt even wanted to take the time to look at the rockefeller center tree he must have set off on some mission that was it if somebody hadnt actually kidnapped himand that seemed unlikelyhe must have seen whoever took or picked up the wallet and followed that person michael was sitting in the front seat with officer ortiz sipping a soda a brown paper bag with remnants of a packet of ketchup was standing on the floor in front of him catherine squeezed in beside him on the front seat and smoothed his hair hows dad he asked anxiously you didnt tell him about brian did you no of course not im sure well find brian soon and there was no need to worry him and hes doing just great i saw dr crowley hes a happy camper about dad she looked over michaels head at officer ortiz its been almost two hours she said quietly he nodded brians description will keep going out every hour to every cop and car in the area mrs dornan michael and i have been talking hes sure brian wouldnt deliberately wander away no hes right he wouldnt you talked to the people around you when you realized he was missing yes and no one noticed a kid being pulled or carried away no people remember seeing him then they didnt see him ill level with you i dont know any molester who would even attempt to kidnap a child from his mothers side and work his way through a crowd of people but michael thinks that maybe brian would have taken off after someone he saw take your wallet catherine nodded ive been thinking the same thing its the only answer that makes sense michael tells me that last year brian stood up to a fourthgrade kid who shoved one of his classmates hes a gutsy kid catherine said then the import of what the policeman had said hit her hethinks that if brian followed whoever took my wallet he may have confronted that person oh god no mrs dornan if its all right with you i think it would be a good idea if we tried to get cooperation from the media we might be able to get some of the local tv stations to show brians picture if you have one the one i carried is in my wallet catherine said her voice a monotone images of brian standing up to a thief flashed in her mind my little boy she thought would someone hurt my little boy what was michael saying he was talking to the cop ortiz my grandmother has a bunch of pictures of us michael was telling him then he looked up at his mother anyhow mom you gotta call gran shes going to start worrying if were not home soon like father like son catherine thought brian looks like tom michael thinks like him she closed her eyes against the waves of near panic that washed through her tom brian why she felt michael fishing in her shoulder bag he pulled out the cellular phone ill dial gran he told her in her apartment on eightyseventh street barbara cavanaugh clutched the phone not wanting to believe what her daughter was telling her but there was no disputing the dreadful news that catherines quiet almost emotionless voice had conveyed brian was missing and had been missing for over two hours now barbara managed to keep her voice calm where are you dear michael and i are in a police car at fortyninth and fifth thats where we were standing when brian just suddenly wasnt next to me ill be right there mom be sure to bring the most recent pictures you have of brian the police want to give them out to all the news media and the news radio station is going to have me on in a few minutes to make an appeal and mom call the nurses station on the fifth floor of the hospital tell them to make absolutely sure that tom isnt allowed to turn on the tv in his room he doesnt have a radio if he ever found out that brian was missing her voice trailed off ill call right away but catherine i dont have any recent pictures here barbara cried all the ones we took last summer are in the nantucket house then she wanted to bite her lip shed been asking for new pictures of the boys and hadnt received any only yesterday catherine had told her that her christmas present framed portraits of them had been forgotten in the rush to get tom to new york for the operation ill bring what i can find she said hurriedly im on my way for an instant after she finished delivering the message to the hospital barbara cavanaugh sank into a chair and rested her forehead in her palm too much she thought too much had there always been a feeling haunting her that everything was too good to be true catherines father had died when she was ten and there had always been a lingering touch of sadness in her eyes until at twentytwo she met tom they were so happy together so perfect together the way gene and i were from day one barbara thought for an instant her mind rushed back to that moment in when at age nineteen and a sophomore in college shed been introduced to a handsome young army officer lieutenant eugene cavanaugh in that first moment theyd both known that they were perfect for each other they were married two months later but it was eighteen years before their only child was born with tom my daughter has found the same kind of relationship with which i was blessed barbara thought but now she jumped up she had to get to catherine brian must have just wandered away they just got separated she told herself catherine was strong but she must be close to the breaking point by now oh dear god let someone find him she prayed she rushed through the apartment yanking framed photographs from mantels and tabletops shed moved here from beekman place ten years ago it was still more space than she needed with a formal dining room library and guest suite but now it meant that when tom and catherine and the boys came to visit from their home in omaha there was plenty of room for them barbara tossed the pictures into the handsome leather carryall tom and catherine had given her for her birthday grabbed a coat from the foyer closet and without bothering to double lock the door rushed outside in time to press the button for the elevator as it began to descend from the penthouse sam the elevator operator was a longtime employee when he opened the door for her his smile was replaced by a look of concern good evening mrs cavanaugh merry christmas any further word on dr dornan afraid to speak barbara shook her head those grandkids of yours are real cute the little one brian told me you gave his mom something that would make his dad get well i sure hope thats true barbara tried to say so do i but found that her lips could not form the words mommy why are you sad gigi asked as she settled onto callys lap im not sad gigi cally said im always happy when im with you gigi shook her head she was wearing a redandwhite christmas nightgown with figures of angels carrying candles her wide brown eyes and wavy goldenbrown hair were legacies from frank the older she gets the more she looks like him cally thought instinctively holding the child tighter they were curled up together on the couch across from the christmas tree im glad youre home with me mommy gigi said and her voice became fearful you wont leave me again will you no i didnt want to leave you last time sweetheart i didnt like visiting you at that place that place the bedford correctional facility forwomen i didnt like being there cally tried to sound matteroffact kids should stay with their mothers yes i think so too mommy is that big present for me gigi pointed to the box that held the uniform and coat jimmy had discarded callys lips went dry no sweetheart thats a present for santa claus he likes to get something for christmas too now come on its past your bedtime gigi automatically began to say i dont want to then she stopped will christmas come faster if i go to bed now uhhuh come on ill carry you in when she had tucked the blankets around gigi and given her her bee the tattered blanket that was her daughters indispensable sleeping companion cally went back to the living room and once again sank down onto the couch kids should stay with their mothers gigis words haunted her dear god where had jimmy taken that little boy what would he do to him what should she do cally stared at the box with the candycane paper thats for santa claus a vivid memory of its contents flashed through her mind the uniform of the guard jimmy had shot the side and sleeve still sticky with blood the filthy overcoatgod knew where hed found or stolen that jimmy was evil he had no conscience no pity face it cally told herself fiercelyhe wont hesitate to kill that little boy if it helps his chances to escape she turned on the radio to the local news it was seventhirty the breaking news was that the condition of the prison guard who had been shot at rikers island was still critical but was now stable the doctors were cautiously optimistic that he would live if he lives jimmy isnt facing the death penalty cally told herself they cant execute him now for the cops death three years ago hes smart he wont take a chance on murdering the little boy once he knows that the guard isnt going to die hell let him go the announcer was saying in other news early this evening sevenyearold brian dornan became separated from his mother on fifth avenue the family is in new york because brians father frozen in front of the radio cally listened as the announcer gave a description of the boy then said here is a plea from his mother asking for your help as cally listened to the low urgent voice of brians mother she visualized the young woman who had dropped the wallet early thirties at the most shiny dark hair that just reached the collar of her coat shed only caught a glimpse of her face but cally was sure that she was very pretty pretty and well dressed and secure now listening to her begging for help cally put her hands over her ears then ran to the radio and snapped it off she tiptoed into the bedroom gigi was already asleep her breathing soft and even her cheek pillowed in her hand the other hand holding the ragged baby blanket up to her face cally knelt beside her i can reach out and touch her she thought that woman cant reach out to her child what should i do but if i call the police and jimmy does harm that little boy theyll say its my fault just the way they said that the cops death was my fault maybe jimmy will just leave him somewhere he promised he would even jimmy wouldnt hurt a little boy surely ill just wait and pray she told herself but the prayer she tried to whisperplease god keep little brian safesounded like a mockery and she did not complete it jimmy had decided that his best bet was to go over the george washington bridge to route then take route to the new york thruway it might be a little farther that way than going up through the bronx to the tappan zee but every instinct warned him to get out of new york city fast it was good that the gw had no toll gate at the outgoing side where they might stop him brian looked out the window as they crossed the bridge he knew they were going over the hudson river his mother had cousins who lived in new jersey near the bridge last summer when he and michael spent an extra week with gran after they came back from nantucket they had visited them there they were nice they had kids just about his age too just thinking about them made brian want to cry he wished he could open the window and shout im here come get me please he was so hungry and he really had to go to the bathroom he looked up timidly i could i please i mean i have to go to the bathroom now that hed said it he was so afraid the man would refuse that his lip began to quiver quickly he bit down on it he could just hear michael calling him a crybaby but even that thought made him feel sad he wouldnt even mind seeing michael right now you gotta pee the man didnt seem too mad at him maybe he wouldnt hurt him after all uhhuh okay you hungry yes sir jimmy was starting to feel somewhat secure they were on route the traffic was heavy but moving nobody was looking for this car by now the guy who parked it was probably in his pjs watching its a wonderful life for the fortieth time by tomorrow morning when he and his wife started to holler about their stolen toyota jimmy would be in canada with paige god he was crazy about her in his life she was the closest he had ever come to a sure thing jimmy didnt want to stop to eat yet on the other hand to be on the safe side he probably should fill up the tank now there was no telling what hours places would keep on christmas eve all right he said in a couple minutes well get some gas go to the john and ill buy sodas and potato chips later on well stop at a mcdonalds and get a hamburger but just remember when we stop for gas you try to attract attention and he pulled the pistol from his jacket pointed it at brian and made a clicking noise bang he said brian looked away they were in the middle lane of the threelane highway a sign pointed to the exit marked forest avenue a police car pulled abreast of them then turned off into the parking lot of a diner i wont talk to anyone i promise he managed to say i promise daddy jimmy snapped daddy involuntarily brians hand curled around the st christopher medal he was going to bring this medal to daddy and then daddy was going to get better then his dad would find this guy jimmy and beat him up for being so mean to his kid brian was sure of it as his fingers traced the raised image of the towering figure carrying the christ child he said in a clear voice i promise daddy at lower manhattan s one police plaza the command post for the jimmy siddons manhunt the escalating tension was visibly evident everyone was keenly aware that to make good his escape siddons would not hesitate to kill again they also knew he had the weapon smuggled in to him armed and dangerous was the caption under his picture on the flyers that were being distributed all over the city last time we got two thousand useless tips followed up every useless one of them and the only reason we ever got him behind bars last summer was because he was dumb enough to hold up a gas station in michigan while a cop was on the premises jack shore growled to mort levy as in disgust he watched a team of officers answer the flood of calls on the hot line levy nodded absently anything more about siddonss girlfriend he asked shore an hour ago one of the prisoners in siddonss cellblock had told a guard that last month siddons had bragged about a girlfriend named paige who he said was a worldclass stripper they were trying to trace her in new york but on the hunch that she might have been involved with siddons in michigan shore had contacted the authorities there no nothing so far probably another dead end call for you from detroit jack a voice bellowed above the din in the room both men turned quickly in two strides shore was at his desk and had grabbed the phone his caller did not waste time stan logan jack we met when you came out to pick up siddons last year i may have something interesting for you lets have it we never could find out where siddons was hiding before he tried to pull the holdup here the tip about paige may be the answer weve got a rap sheet on a paige laronde who calls herself an exotic dancer she left town two days ago told a friend she didnt know if shed be back that she expected to join her boyfriend did she say where she was going shore snapped she said california then mexico california and mexico hell if he makes it to mexico we may never find him our guys are checking the train and bus stations as well as the airports to see if we can pick up her trail well keep you posted logan promised then added were about to fax her rap sheet and publicity pictures dont show them to your kids shore slammed down the phone if siddons managed to get out of new york this morning he could be in california right now maybe even mexico it would be pretty tough to get a plane reservation at the last minute on christmas eve levy reminded him cautiously listen somebody got a gun in to him that same somebody may have had clothes and cash and an airline ticket waiting for him probably managed to get him to an airport in philadelphia or boston where no ones looking for him my guess is that hes met up with his girlfriend by now and the two of them are heading south of the border if theyre not already eating enchiladas and i still say one way or the other the gobetween had to be siddonss sister frowning mort levy watched jack shore go to the communications room to await the faxes from detroit the next step would be to forward pictures of both siddons and his girlfriend to the border patrol in tijuana with the warning to be on the lookout for them but we still have to cover the cathedral tonight on the oneinamillion chance that jimmys offer to surrender was on the level mort thought somehow neither possibility rang true to himnot mexico not the surrender would this paige be smart enough to lie to her friend on the chance that the cops might come looking for her the coffee and sandwiches they had ordered were just being delivered mort went over to get his ham on rye two of the women officers were talking together he heard one of them lori martini say still no sign of that missing kid for sure some nut must have picked him up what missing kid levy asked soberly he listened to the details it was the one kind of case no one in the department could work on without becoming emotionally involved mort had a sevenyearold son he knew what must be going through that mothers mind and the father so sick he hadnt even been told his son was missing and all this at christmastime god some people really get it in spades he thought call for you mort a voice shouted from across the room carrying the coffee and sandwich mort returned to his desk who is it he asked as he took the receiver a woman she didnt give her name as mort pressed the phone to his ear he said detective levy he heard the sound of frightened breathing and then a faint click as the line went dead wcbs reporter alan graham approached the squad car where hed interviewed catherine dornan an hour earlier when he had done an update on the story it was eightthirty and the intermittent gusts of snow had become a steady flow of large white flakes again through his earphone graham heard the anchorman give the latest information about the escaped prisoner the condition of mario bonardi the injured prison guard is still extremely critical mayor giuliani and police commissioner bratton have paid a second visit to the hospital where he is in intensive care after delicate surgery according to the latest report the police are following up on a tip that his assailant alleged murderer jimmy siddons may be meeting a girlfriend in california with the final destination mexico the border patrol at tijuana has been alerted one of the newsmen had been tipped off that jimmys lawyer claimed siddons was turning himself in after midnight mass at st patricks alan graham was glad that the decision had been made not to air that story none of the police brass really believed it and they didnt want the worshipers distracted by the rumor there were few pedestrians now on fifth avenue it occurred to graham that there was something almost obscene about the breaking stories they were covering this christmas eve an escaped cop killer a prison guard clinging to life a sevenyearold missing boy who was now the suspected victim of foul play he tapped on the window of the squad car catherine glanced up then opened it halfway looking at her he wondered how long she would be able to maintain her remarkable composure she was sitting in the passenger seat of the car next to officer ortiz her son michael was in the back with a handsome older woman whose arm was around him catherine answered his unasked question im still waiting she said quietly officer ortiz has been good enough to stay with me i dont know why but i feel as though somehow ill find brian right here she turned slightly mom this is alan graham from wcbs he interviewed me right after i spoke with you barbara cavanaugh saw the compassion on the face of the young reporter knowing that if there were anything to tell they would have heard it by now she still could not stop herself from asking any word no maam weve had plenty of calls to the station but they were all to express concern hes vanished catherine said her voice lifeless while tom and i have raised the boys to basically trust people they also know how to deal with emergencies brian knew enough to go to a policeman if he was lost he knew to dial somebody has taken him who would take and hold a sevenyearold child unless catherine dear dont torture yourself her mother urged everyone who heard you on the radio is praying for brian you must have faith catherine felt frustration and anger rising inside her yes she supposed she should have faith certainly brian had faithhe believed in that st christopher medal probably enough to have followed whoever picked up my wallet he knew it was inside she reasoned and felt he had to get it back she looked back at her mother and at michael beside her she felt her anger ebb it wasnt her mothers fault that any of this had happened no faitheven in something as unlikely as a st christopher medalwas a good thing youre right mom she said from the receiver in his ear graham heard the anchorman say over to you alan stepping back from the car he began brian dornans mother is still keeping watch at the spot where her son disappeared shortly after pm authorities believe catherine dornans theory that brian may have seen someone steal her wallet and followed that person the wallet contained a st christopher medal which brian was desperately anxious to bring to his fathers hospital bed graham handed the microphone to catherine brian believes the st christopher medal will help his father get well if i had had brians faith i would have guarded my wallet more carefully because the st christopher medal was in it i want my husband to get better i want my child she said her voice steady despite her emotion in the name of god if anyone knows what happened to brian who has him or where he is please please call us graham stepped back from the squad car if anyone who knows anything about brians whereabouts is listening to that young mothers pain we beg you to call this number her eyes filled with tears her lip quivering cally turned off the radio if anyone knows what happened to brian i tried she told herself fiercely i tried she had dialed detective levys number but when she heard his voice the enormity of what she was about to do overwhelmed her they would arrest her they would take gigi away from her again and would put her with a new foster family if anyoneknows anything about brians whereabouts she reached for the phone from inside the bedroom she heard a wail and spun around gigi was having another nightmare she rushed inside sat down on the bed gathered her child in her arms and began rocking her sshh its okay everythings fine gigi clung to her mommy mommy i dreamed that you were gone again please dont go mommy please dont leave me i dont want to live with other people ever ever that wont happen sweetheart i promise she could feel gigi relax gently she laid her back on the pillow and smoothed her hair now go back to sleep angel gigi closed her eyes then opened them again can i watch santa claus open his present she murmured jimmy siddons lowered the volume on the radio your mom sure is flipping out about you kid brian had to keep himself from reaching out to the dashboard and touching the radio mom sounded so worried he had to get back to her now she believed in the st christopher medal too he was sure of it there were a lot of cars on the highway and even though it was really snowing now they were all going pretty fast but jimmy was in the far right lane so no cars were coming up on that side brian began to plan if he could open the door real fast and roll out onto the road he could keep rolling to the side that way nobody would run over him he pressed the medal for an instant and then his hand crept to the handle on the door when he put faint pressure on it it moved slightly he was right jimmy hadnt put the lock on after they stopped for gas brian was about the throw open the door when he remembered his seat belt hed have to unfasten that just as the door swung open careful not to attract jimmys attention he laid the index finger of his left hand on the seat belts release button just as brian was about to pull on the handle and push the release jimmy swore a car weaving erratically was coming up behind them on the left an instant later it was so close it was almost touching the toyota then it cut in front of them jimmy slammed on the brakes the car skidded and fishtailed as around them came the sound of metal impacting metal brian held his breath crash he begged crash then someone would help him but jimmy righted the car and drove around the others just ahead brian could hear the wail of sirens and see the brilliance of flashing lights gathered around another accident which they quickly drove past as well jimmy grinned in savage satisfaction were pretty lucky arent we kiddo he asked brian as he glanced down at him brian was still clutching the handle now you werent thinking of jumping out if wed gotten stuck back there were you jimmy asked he clicked the control that locked the doors keep your hand away from there i see you touch that handle again and ill break your fingers he said quietly brian didnt have the slightest doubt he would do just that it was five after ten mort levy sat at his desk deep in thought he had only one explanation for the disconnected call cally hunter the tap from the police surveillance van outside callys building confirmed that she had dialed him the men on duty there offered to go up and talk to her if mort wanted them to no leave her alone he ordered he knew it would be pointless shed only repeat exactly what shed told them before but she knows something and she is afraid to tell he thought he had tried to phone her twice but she had not answered he knew she was there though the lookouts in the van would have notified them if shed left the apartment so why wasnt she answering should he go over to see her himself would it do any good whats with you jack shore asked impatiently you forgot how to hear mort looked up the rotund senior detective stood glowering down at him no wonder callys afraid of you mort thought remembering the fear in her eyes at jacks anger and open hostility im thinking mort said curtly resisting the impulse to suggest that shore try it sometime well think with the rest of us weve gotta go over the plans to cover the cathedral then shores scowl softened mort why dont you take a break he isnt as bad as he tries to seem mort thought i dont see you taking a break jack he replied its just that i hate siddons worse than you do mort got up slowly his mind was still focused on the elusive memory of some important clue that had been overlooked something he knew was there right in front of him but that he just couldnt make himself see theyd seen cally hunter at sevenfifteen this morning shed already been dressed for work they had seen her again nearly twelve hours later she looked exhausted and desperately worried she was probably in bed asleep now but every nerve in his body was telling him that he should talk to her despite her denial he believed she held the key as he turned away from his desk the phone rang when he picked it up he again heard the terrified breathing this time he took the initiative cally mort said urgently cally talk to me dont be afraid whatever it is ill try to help you cally could not even think of going to bed she had listened to the allnews station hoping but at the same time fearing that the cops had found jimmy praying that little brian was safe at ten oclock she had turned on the television to watch the fox local news then her heart sank brians mother was seated next to the anchorman tony potts her hair seemed looser now as though shed been standing outside in the wind and snow her face was very pale and her eyes were filled with pain there was a boy sitting next to her who seemed to be about ten or eleven years old the anchorman was saying you may have heard catherine dornans appeals for help in finding her son brian weve asked her and brians brother michael to be with us now there were crowds of people on fifth avenue and fortyninth street shortly after five oclock this evening maybe you were one of them maybe you noticed catherine with her two sons michael and brian they were in a group listening to a violinist playing christmas carols and singing along sevenyearold brian disappeared from his mothers side his mother and brother need your help in finding him the anchorman turned to catherine youre holding a picture of brian cally watched as the picture was held up listened as brians mother said its not very clear so let me tell you a little more about him hes seven but looks younger because hes small he has dark reddish brown hair and blue eyes and freckles on his nose her voice faltered cally shut her eyes she couldnt bear to look at the stark agony on catherine dornans face michael put his hand over his mothers my brothers wearing a dark blue ski jacket just like mine cept mine is green and a red cap and one of his front teeth is missing then he burst out we gotta get him back we cant tell my dad that brian is missing dads too sick to be worried michaels voice became even more urgent i know my dad hed try to do something hed get out of bed and start looking for brian and we cant let him do that hes sick real sick cally snapped off the set she tiptoed into the bedroom where gigi was at last sleeping peacefully and went over to the window that led to the fire escape she could still see brians eyes as he glanced over his shoulder begging her to help him his one hand in jimmys grasp his other holding the st christopher medal as though it would somehow save him she shook her head that medal she thought he hadnt cared about the money he followed her because he believed that medal would make his father get well cally ran the few steps back into the living room and grabbed mort levys card when he answered her resolve almost crumbled again but then his voice was so kind when he said cally talk to me dont be afraid mr levy she blurted out can you come here quick ive got to talk to you about jimmy and that little boy whos missing all that was left of the snack jimmy had purchased when they stopped for gas were the empty cocacola cans and the crumpled bags that had held potato chips jimmy had thrown his on the floor in front of brian while brian had placed his in the plastic wastebasket attached under the dashboard he couldnt even remember what the chips had tasted like he was so hungry that scared as he felt being hungry was all he could think about he knew that jimmy was really mad at him and ever since the time theyd nearly crashed and jimmy realized that he had been planning to try to jump out of the car hed seemed real nervous he kept opening and closing his fingers on the steering wheel making a scary snapping sound the first time he did it brian had flinched and jumped and jimmy had grabbed him by the shoulder snarling at him to stay away from the door the snow was coming down faster now ahead of them someone braked the car swung around in a circle then kept going brian realized that it hadnt slammed into another car only because all the drivers on the road were trying to keep from getting too close to other cars even so jimmy began to swear a low steady stream of words most of which brian had never heard even from skeet the kid in his class who knew all the good swear words the spinning car confirmed jimmys growing sense that near as he was to escaping the country something could still go wrong any minute it didnt sound as though that prison guard he shot was going to make it if the guard died jimmy had meant it when he told cally that they wouldnt take him alive then jimmy tried to reassure himself he had a car that probably nobody even realized was missing yet he had decent clothes and money if theyd been stuck back there when that crazy fool caused the accident the kid might have managed to jump out of the car if that jerk who just spun around had hit the toyota i might have been hurt jimmy thought on my own maybe i couldve bluffed it but not with the kid along on the other hand nobody knew he had the kid and in a million years no cop was on the lookout for a guy in a nice car with a bunch of toys in the backseat and a little boy beside him they were near syracuse now in three or four hours hed be across the border with paige there was a mcdonalds sign on the right jimmy was hungry and this would be a good place to get something to eat it would have to last him until he reached canada hed pull up to the drivein window order for the two of them then get back on the road fast whats your favorite food kid he asked his tone almost genial brian had spotted the mcdonalds sign and held his breath hoping that this meant they were going to get something to eat a hamburger and french fries and a coke he said timidly if i stop at mcdonalds can you look like youre sleeping yes i promise do it then lean against me with your eyes closed okay obediently brian slumped against jimmy and squeezed his eyes shut he tried not to show how scared he was lets see what kind of actor you are jimmy said and youd better be good the st christopher medal had slipped to the side brian straightened it so that he could feel it heavy and comforting against his chest it was scary to be so close to this guy not like being sleepy when he was driving with dad and curling up against him and feeling dads hand patting his shoulder jimmy pulled off the highway they had to wait on line at the drivein window jimmy froze when he saw a state trooper pull in behind them but had no choice except to stay put and not draw attention to himself when it was their turn and he placed the order and paid the attendant didnt even glance into the car but at the pickup spot the woman looked over the counter to where the light from behind her shone on brian i guess he just cant wait to see what santa claus is going to bring him can he jimmy nodded and tried to smile in agreement as he reached for the bag she leaned way forward and peered into the car my goodness is he wearing a st christopher medal my dad was named after him and used to try to make a big deal of it but my mom always jokes about st christopher being dropped from the calendar of saints my dad says its too bad mom wasnt named philomena shes another saint the vatican said didnt exist with a hearty laugh the young woman handed over the bag as they drove back onto the highway brian opened his eyes he could smell the hamburgers and the french fries he sat up slowly jimmy looked at him his eyes steely his face rigid through lips that barely parted he quietly ordered get that goddamn medal off your neck cally had to talk to him about her brother andthe missing child after promising to be right over mort levy hung up the phone stunned what possible connection could there be between jimmy siddons and the little boy who disappeared on fifth avenue he dialed the lookout van you recorded that call is she crazy mort she cant be talking about the dornan kid can she want us to pick her up for questioning thats just what i dont want you to do levy exploded shes scared to death as it is sit tight until i get there he had to inform his superiors starting with jack shore about cally hunters call mort spotted shore leaving the chief of detectives private office was out of his chair and across the room in seconds he grabbed shores arm come back inside i told you to take a break shore tried to shake off his hand we just heard from logan in detroit again two days ago a woman whose description matches siddonss girlfriend got a ride from a private car service over the border to windsor logan s guys think that laronde told her girlfriend about california and mexico to throw them off her trail the girlfriend was questioned again this time it occurred to her to mention that she offered to buy larondes fur coat because it wouldnt be needed in mexico laronde refused i never bought that mexico story mort levy thought he didnt relinquish his grip on shores arm as he shoved open the chiefs door five minutes later a squad car was racing up the east side drive to avenue b and tenth street a bitterly frustrated jack shore had been ordered to wait in the lookout van while mort and the chief bud folney went upstairs to talk to cally mort knew that shore would not forgive him for insisting that he stay out of it jack when we were there earlier i knew there was something she was holding back youve scared her to death she thinks youd do anything to see her back behind bars for gods sake cant you look at her as a human being shes got a fouryearold child her husband is dead and she got the book thrown at her when she made the mistake of helping the brother shed practically raised now mort turned to folney i dont know how jimmy siddons ties into that missing child but i do know that cally has been too frightened to talk if she tells us now whatever she knows it will be because she feels that the department you arent out to get her folney nodded he was a softspoken lean man in his late forties with a scholarly face he had in fact spent three years as a high school teacher before realizing his passion was law enforcement it was widely believed among the ranks that one day hed be police commissioner already he was one of the most powerful men in the department mort levy knew that if there was anyone who could help cally assuming she had in some way been forced to cover for jimmy again it was folney but the missing childhow could siddons be involved in this it was a question they were all frantic to ask when the squad car pulled up behind the surveillance van shore made one last appeal if i keep my mouth shut folney answered i suggest you start right now jack get in the van pete cruise had been about to call it a day hed discovered where cally hunter lived when he tried to interview her after she was released from prison and now he was hoping her brother would show up but thered been nothing to watch for hours except the onagainoffagain falling snow now at least it seemed to have stopped for good the van that he knew was a police van was still parked across the street from callys apartment but probably all they were doing was monitoring her calls the likelihood of jimmy siddons suddenly showing up at his sisters house now was about the same as two strangers having matching dna all the hours of hanging around hunters building were a waste pete decided from the time hed seen cally come home shortly before six and the two detectives stop in around seven it had been a big nothing hed kept his powerful portable radio on the whole time he waited switching between the police band his station wyme and the wcbs news station no word of siddons at all shame about that missing kid when the ten oclock news came on wyme pete thought for the hundredth time that the anchor in that slot sounded like a wimp but she did have some real emotion when she talked about the missing sevenyearold maybe we need a missing kid every day pete thought sarcastically then was immediately ashamed of himself there was a lot of activity in hunters building people coming and going many of the churches had moved up the midnight services to ten oclock no matter what time they schedule them some people will always be late pete thought as he saw an elderly couple hurry from the building and turn up avenue b probably heading for st emerics the woman who had brought hunters kid home earlier was coming up the block was she headed for hunters apartment cally planning to go out he wondered pete shrugged maybe hunter had a late date or was going to church herself obviously today wasnt the day to get the story that was going to make his name as a reporter itll happen pete promised himself i wont always be working on this lousy tenwatt station his buddy who worked at wnbc loved to ride pete about his job a favorite putdown was that the only audience for wyme were two cockroaches and three stray cats this is station whyme hed joke pete started his car he was just about to pull out when a squad car raced down the block and stopped in front of callys building through narrowed eyes pete observed three men emerge one he recognized as jack shore crossed the street and got into the van then in the light from the building entrance he could make out mort levy he didnt get a good look at the other one something was breaking pete turned off the engine suddenly interested again while she waited for mort levy cally took gigis christmas presents from their hiding place behind the couch and set them in front of the tree the secondhand dolls carriage didnt look that bad she decided with the pretty blue satin coverlet and pillowcase shed put the baby doll shed picked up for a couple of dollars last month in it but it wasnt nearly as cute as the one that shed wanted to buy from the peddler on fifth avenue that one had gigis goldenbrown hair and was wearing a blue party dress if she hadnt been looking for that peddler she wouldnt have seen the wallet and the boywouldnt have followed her and she put that thought aside she was past feeling now carefully she stacked the presents shed wrapped with candycane paper an outfit from the gapleggings and a polo shirt crayons and a coloring book some furniture for gigis dollhouse everything even the two pieces of the gap outfit was in separate boxes so at least it looked as though gigi had a stack of gifts to open she tried to avoid looking at the largest package under the tree the package that gigi thought was their gift for santa claus finally she phoned aika aikas grandchildren always went home to sleep so she was sure she could come over and stay with gigi in case the cops arrested cally after she told them about jimmy and the little boy aika answered on the first ring hello her voice was filled with her normal warmth if only theyd let gigi stay with aika if they put me in prison again cally thought she swallowed over the lump in her throat then said aika im in trouble can you come over in about half an hour and maybe stay overnight you bet i can aika did not ask questions simply clicked off as cally replaced the receiver the buzzer from the downstairs door resounded through the apartment the switchboards on fire mrs dornan leigh ann winick the producer of fox ten oclock news told catherine as carefully avoiding the floor cables she and michael left the broadcast area it looks as though everyone in our viewing area wants you to know that theyre rooting and praying for brian and your husband thank you catherine tried to smile she looked down at michael he had been trying so hard to keep up his spirits for her sake it was only when she had listened to his oncamera plea that she had fully realized what this was doing to him michaels hands were in his pockets his shoulders hunched under his ears it was exactly the same posture tom unconsciously fell into when he was worried about a patient catherine squared her own shoulders and put her arm around her older son as the door from the studio closed behind them the producer said our operators are thanking everyone in your name but is there anything else youd like us to tell our audience catherine drew a deep breath and her arm tightened around michael i wish youd tell them that we think i dropped my wallet and that brian apparently followed whoever picked it up the reason he was so anxious to get it back is that my mother had just given me a st christopher medal that my father wore through world war ii my father believed the medal kept him safe it even has a dent where a bullet glanced off it a bullet that might have killed him brian has the same wonderful faith that st christopher or what he represents is going to take care of us again and so do i st christopher will carry brian back to us on his shoulders and he will help my husband get well she smiled down at michael right pal michaels eyes were shining mom do you really believe that catherine drew a deep breath i believe lordhelp my unbelief yes i do she said firmly and maybe because it was christmas eve for the first time she really did state trooper chris mcnally tuned out as deidre lenihan droned on about just seeing a st christopher medal and how her father was named after st christopher she was a wellmeaning young woman but every time he stopped for coffee at this mcdonalds she seemed to be on duty and always wanted to talk tonight chris was too preoccupied with thoughts of getting home he wanted to get at least some sleep before his kids got up to open all their christmas presents he also had been thinking about the toyota he had just seen pull out in front of him hed been thinking of buying one himself although he knew his wife wouldnt want a brown one a new car meant montly payments to worry about he noticed the remnant of a bumper sticker on the toyota a single word inheritance he knew the sticker had originally said were spending our grandchildrens inheritance we could use an inheritance he thought and my father said chris forced himself to refocus deidres nice he thought but she talks too much he reached for the bag she was dangling in her hand but it was clear she was not going to relinquish it yet not until she had told how her dad said it was too bad that her mother hadnt been named philomena still she wasnt finished years ago my aunt worked in southampton and belonged to st philomenas parish when they had to rename it the pastor had a contest to decide which saint they should choose and why my aunt suggested st dymphna because she said she was the saint of the insane and most of the people in the parish were nuts well i was named after st christopher myself chris said managing to snare the bag merry christmas deidre and it will be christmas before i get a bite out of this big mac he thought as he drove back onto the thruway with one hand he deftly opened the bag freed the burger and gratefully took a large bite the coffee would have to wait until he got back to his post hed be off duty at midnight and then he thought smiling to himself it would be time to grab a little shuteye eileen would try to keep the kids in bed till six but lots of luck it hadnt happened last year and it wouldnt happen this year if he knew his sons he was approaching exit and drove the car to the official turnaround from which he could observe errant drivers christmas eve was nothing like new years eve for nabbing drinkers but chris was determined that no one who was speeding or weaving on the road was going to get past him hed witnessed a couple of accidents where some drunk turned the holiday into a nightmare for innocent people not tonight if he could help it and the snow had made driving that much more treacherous as chris opened the lid on his coffee he frowned a corvette doing at least eighty was racing up the service lane he snapped on his dome lights and siren shifted into gear and the squad car leaped in pursuit chief of detectives bud folney listened with no expression other than quiet attentiveness as a trembling cally hunter told mort levy about finding the wallet on fifth avenue she had waived her miranda warning saying impatiently this cant wait any longer folney knew the basics of her case older sister of jimmy siddons had served time because a judge had not believed her story that she thought she was helping her brother get away from a rival gang bent on killing him levy had told him that hunter seemed to be one of the hardluck people of this worldraised by an elderly grandmother who died leaving her to try to straighten out her louse of a younger brother when she was only a kid herself then her husband killed by a hitandrun driver when she was pregnant about thirty folney thought and could be pretty with a little meat on her she still had the pale haunted expression he had seen on other women who had been imprisoned and carried with them the horror that someday they might be sent back he looked around the neat apartment the sunny yellow paint on the cracked walls the bravely decorated but skimpy christmas tree the new coverlet on the battered doll carriage they all told him something about cally hunter folney knew that like himself mort levy was desperate to know what connection hunter could give them between siddons and the missing dornan child he approved of morts gentle approach cally hunter had to tell it her way its a good thing we didnt bring in the raging bull folney thought jack shore was a good detective but his aggressiveness often got on folneys nerves hunter was talking about seeing the wallet on the sidewalk i picked it up without thinking i guessed it belonged to that woman but i wasnt sure i honestly wasnt sure she burst out and i thought if i tried to give it back to her she might say something was missing from it that happened to my grandmother and then youd send me back to prison and cally take it easy mort said what happened then when i got home she told them about finding jimmy in the apartment wearing her deceased husbands clothes she pointed to the big package under the tree the guards uniform and coat are in there she said it was the only place i could think to hide them in case you came back thats it mort thought when we looked around the apartment the second time there was something different about the closet the box on the shelf and the mans jacket were missing callys voice became ragged and uneven as she told them about jimmy taking brian dornan and threatening to kill him if he spotted a cop chasing him levy asked cally do you think jimmy can be trusted to let brian go i wanted to think so she said tonelessly that was what i told myself when i didnt call you immediately but i know hes desperate jimmy will do anything to keep from going to prison again folney finally asked a question cally why did you call us now i saw brians mother on television and i knew that if jimmy had taken gigi id want you to help me get her back cally clasped her hands together her body swayed slightly forward then back in the ancient posture of grief the look on that little boys face the way he put that medal around his neck and was holding on to it like it was a life preserver if anything happens to him its my fault the buzzer sounded if thats shore folney thought as he jumped up to answer it it was aika banks when she entered the apartment she looked at the policemen searchingly then rushed to cally and hugged her baby what is it whats wrong why do you need me to stay with gigi what do these people want cally winced in pain aika peeled up her friends sleeve the bruises caused by jimmys fingers were now an ugly purple any doubts that bud folney had about hunters possible cooperation with her brother disappeared he squatted in front of her cally youre not going to get into trouble i promise you i believe you found that wallet i believe you didnt know what was best for you to do but now youve got to help us have you any idea where jimmy mighthave gone ten minutes later when they left callys apartment mort levy was carrying the bulky giftwrapped package that held the guards uniform shore joined them in the squad car and impatiently fired questions at mort as they were driven downtown they agreed that the search for jimmy siddons would be based on the assumption that he might be trying to reach canada hes got to be in a car folney said flatly theres no way hell travel on public transportation with that child cally had told them that from the time he was twelve years old jimmy could hotwire and steal any car she was sure he must have had one waiting near the apartment my guess is that siddons would want to get out of new york state as soon as possible folney said which means hed drive through new england to the border but its only a guess he could be on the thruway headed for i thats the fastest route and siddons girlfriend was probably in canada it all fit together they also accepted callys absolute certainty that jimmy siddons would not be taken alive and that his final act of vengeance would be to kill his hostage so they were faced with an escaped murderer with a child possibly driving a car they could not describe probably headed north in a snowstorm it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack siddons would be too smart to attract attention by speeding the border was always mobbed with holiday traffic on christmas eve he dictated a message to be sent to state police throughout new england as well as new york has threatened to kill the hostage he emphasized they calculated that if siddons had left cally hunters apartment shortly after six depending on driving conditions hed be between two and three hundred miles away the alert that went out to the state police contained callys final certainty on achain around his neck the child may be wearing abronze st christopher medal the size of a silver dollar pete cruise watched as the detectives emerged from cally hunters building some twenty minutes after arriving there he noted that levy was carrying a bulky package shore immediately jumped out of the van and joined them this time pete got a good look at the third man then whistled silently it was bud folney chief of detectives and in line to be the next police commissioner something was breaking something big the squad car took off with its dome light flashing a block away its siren was turned on pete sat for a moment debating what to do the cops in the van might stop him if he tried to go in to see cally but obviously something major was going down here and he was determined to scoop everyone on this as he was wondering about looking for a back entrance to the building he saw the woman he knew to be callys babysitter leave in a flash he was out of the car and following her he caught up with her when she turned the corner and they were out of sight of the cops in the van im detective cruise he said ive been instructed to see you safely home how is cally doing oh that poor girl aika began officer you people have to believe her she thought she was doing the right thing when she didnt phone you about her brother kidnapping that little boy even though brian was hungry the hamburger was hard to swallow his throat felt like there was something stuck in it he knew that jimmy was the reason for that he took a giant swallow of coke and tried to think about how daddy would beat jimmy up for being so mean to him but now when he thought about daddy it was hard to remember anything except all the plans they had made for christmas eve daddy had planned to come home early and they were all going to trim the tree together then they were going to have dinner and go around their neighborhood singing christmas carols with a bunch of their friends that was all he could think about now because that was all he wanted to be home and have daddy and mommy smiling a lot the way they always did when they were together when they came to new york because dad was sick mom had told him and michael that their big presents the ones they really wanted would be waiting for them when they got back home she said that santa claus would keep the presents on his sleigh until he knew they were in their own house again michael had said yeah really under his breath to brian but brian believed in santa claus last year dad had pointed out marks on the roof of the garage where santas sleigh had landed and where the reindeer had stood michael told him he heard mom tell dad it was a good thing dad hadnt broken his neck sliding around on the icy roof and making tracks all over it but brian didnt mind what michael said because he didnt believe it just like he didnt mind that michael sometimes called him the dork he knew he wasnt a dork he knew things were bad when you wished your jerk brother who could be such a pain in the neck was there with you and that was just how he felt now as brian swallowed over that feeling of something in his throat the plastic container almost jumped out of his hand he realized jimmy had switched lanes fast jimmy siddons swore silently he had just passed a state troopers car stopped in back of a sports car the sight of a trooper made him sweat all over but he shouldnt have switched lanes like that he was getting jumpy sensing the animosity that bristled from jimmy brian put the uneaten hamburger and the soda back in the bag and moving slowly so jimmy could see what he was doing leaned down and put the bag on the floor then he straightened up huddled against the back of the seat and hugged his arms against his sides the fingers of his right hand groped until they closed around the st christopher medal which he had laid on the seat next to him when he opened the package of food with a sense of relief he closed his hand over it and mentally pictured the strong saint who carried the little kid across the dangerous river who had taken care of his grandfather who would make dad get better and who brian closed his eyes he didnt finish the wish but in his mind he could see himself on the shoulders of the saint barbara cavanaugh was waiting for catherine and michael in the green room at channel you both did a great job she said quietly then seeing the exhaustion on her daughters face she said catherine please come back to the apartment the police will get in touch with you there as soon as they have any word about brian you look ready to drop i cant mother catherine said i know its foolish to wait on fifth avenue brian isnt going to get back there on his own but while im out and about i at least feel as though im doing something to find him i dont really know what im saying except that when i left your apartment i had my two little boys with me and when i go back theyre going to be with me too leigh ann winick made a decision mrs dornan why not stay right here at least for the present this room is comfortable well send out for some hot soup or a sandwich or whatever you want but youve said yourself theres no point in just waiting on fifth avenue indefinitely catherine considered and the police will be able to reach me here winick pointed to the phone absolutely now tell me what i can order for you twenty minutes later as catherine her mother and michael were sipping steaming hot minestrone they watched the green rooms television monitor the news bite was about mario bonardi the wounded prison guard although still critical his condition had stabilized the reporter was with bonardis wife and teenage children in the waiting room of the intensive care unit when asked for a comment a weary rose bonardi said my husband is going to make it i want to thank everyone who has been praying for him today our family has known many happy christmases but this will be the best ever because we know what we so nearly lost thats what well be saying michael catherine said determinedly dad is going to make it and brian is going to be found the reporter with the bonardi family said back to you at the news desk tony thanks ted glad to hear that its going so well thats the kind of christmas story we want to be able to tell the anchors smile vanished there is still no trace of mario bonardis assailant jimmy siddons who was awaiting trial for the murder of a police officer police sources are quoted as saying that he may be planning to meet his girlfriend paige laronde in mexico airports train stations and bus terminals are under heavy surveillance it was nearly three years ago while making his escape after an armed robbery that siddons shot and fatally wounded officer william grasso who had stopped him for a traffic violation siddons is known to be armed and should be considered extremely dangerous as the anchorman spoke jimmy siddonss mug shots were flashed on the screen he looks mean michael observed as he studied the cold eyes and sneering lips of the escaped prisoner he certainly does barbara cavanaugh agreed then she looked at her grandsons face mike why dont you close your eyes and rest for a little while she suggested he shook his head i dont want to go to sleep it was one minute of eleven the newscaster was saying in an update we have no further information about the whereabouts of sevenyearold brian dornan who has been missing since shortly after five oclock today on this very special evening we ask you to continue to pray that brian is safely returned to his family and wish you and all of your loved ones a very merry christmas in an hour it will be christmas catherine thought brian you have to come back you have tobe found you have to be with me in the morningwhen we go see dad brian come back pleasecome back the door of the green room opened winick ushered in a tall man in his late forties followed by officer manuel ortiz detective rhodes wants to talk to you mrs dornan winick said im outside if you need me catherine saw the grave look on the faces of both rhodes and ortiz and fear paralyzed her she was unable to move or speak they realized what she was thinking no mrs dornan it isnt that ortiz said quickly rhodes took over im from headquarters mrs dornan we have information about brian but let me begin by saying that as far as we know hes alive and unharmed then where is he michael burst out wheres my brother catherine listened as detective rhodes explained about her wallet being picked up by a young woman who was the sister of escaped prisoner jimmy siddons her mind did not want to accept that brian had been abducted by the murderer whose face she had just seen on the television screen no she thought no that cant be she pointed to the monitor they just reported that that man is probably on his way to mexico brian disappeared six hours ago he could be in mexico right now at headquarters we dont buy that story rhodes told her we think hes heading for canada probably in a stolen car were concentrating the search in that direction suddenly catherine could feel no emotion it was like when she was in the delivery room and was given the shot of demerol and all the pain miraculously stopped and shed looked up to see tomwink at her tom always there for her feels better doesnt it babe he had asked and her mindno longer clouded with pain had become so clear it was that way now as well what kind of car are they in rhodes looked uncomfortable we dont know he said were only guessing that hes in a car but we feel sure its the right guess we have every trooper throughout new york and new england on the alert for a man traveling with a young boy who is wearing a st christopher medal brian is wearing the medal michael exclaimed then hell be all right gran tell mom that the medal will take care of brian like it took care of grandpa armed and dangerous catherine repeated mrs dornan rhodes said urgently if siddons is in a car hes probably listening to the radio hes smart now that officer bonardi is out of danger siddons knows he isnt facing a death sentence capital punishment had not been reinstated when he killed the police officer three years ago and he did tell his sister that hed let brian go tomorrow morning her mind was so clear but you dont believe that do you she did not need to see the expression on his face to know that detective rhodes did not believe that jimmy siddons would voluntarily release brian mrs dornan if were right and siddons is heading for the canadian border hes not going to get there for at least another three or four hours although the snow has stopped in some areas the roads are still going to be something of a mess all night he cant be traveling fast and he doesnt know that we know he has brian thats being kept from the media in siddonss mind brian will be an assetat least until he reaches the border we will find him before then the television monitor was still on with the volume low catherines back was to it she saw detective rhodess face change heard a voice say we interrupt this program for a news bulletin according to a report that has just been broadcast by station wyme sevenyearold brian dornan the boy who has been missing since this afternoon has fallen into the hands of alleged murderer jimmy siddons who told his sister that if the police close in on him he will put a bullet through the childs head more later as news comes in after aika left cally made a cup of tea wrapped herself in a blanket turned the television on and pressed the mute button this way ill know if theres any news she thought then she turned on the radio and tuned in a station playing christmas music but she kept the volume low hark the herald angels sing remember how frank and i sang that together when we were trimming the tree she thought five years ago their one christmas together theyd just learned that she was pregnant she remembered all the plans theyd made next year well have help trimming the tree frank had said sure we will a threemonthold baby will be a big help shed said laughing she remembered frank lifting her up so that she could place the star on the top of the tree why why had everything gone so wrong there wasnt a next year just one week later frank was killed by a hitandrun driver hed been on his way home from a trip to the deli for a carton of milk we had so little time cally thought shaking her head sometimes she wondered if those months were just a dream it seemed so long ago now ocome all ye faithful joyful and triumphant adeste fideles was it just yesterday that i was feeling so good about life cally wondered at work the hospital administrator had said cally ive been hearing wonderful reports on you they tell me youve got the makings of a born nurse have you ever thought of going to nursing school then shed talked about scholarships and how she was going to look into it that little boy cally thought oh god dont let jimmy hurt him i should have called detective levy immediately i know i should have why didnt i she wondered then immediately answered her own question because i wasnt just afraid for brian i was afraid for myself too and that may cost brian his life she got up and went in to look at gigi as usual the little girl had managed to work one foot out from under the covers she did it every night even when the room was cold cally tucked the covers around her daughters shoulders then touched the small foot and tucked that in too gigi stirred mommy she said drowsily im right here cally went back to the living room and glanced over at the television for a moment then rushed to turn up the volume no no she thought as she heard the reporter explain that police now had information that the missing boy had been kidnapped by escaped cop killer jimmy siddons the police will blame the leak on me she thought frantically theyll think i told someone i know they will the phone rang when she picked it up and heard mort levys voice the pentup emotions that had seemed so frozen erupted suddenly i didnt do it she sobbed i didnt tell anyone i swear i swear i didnt tell the steady rise and fall of brians chest told jimmy siddons that his hostage was asleep good he thought better for me the problem was that the kid was smart smart enough to know that if he had managed to throw himself out of the car next to the breakdown lane he wouldnt risk getting run over if that jerk hadnt spun out and caused the fenderbender it would be all over for me now jimmy thought the kid would have gotten out and the troopers would have been on my tail right then it was past eleven oclock the kid should be tired with luck hed sleep for a couple of hours anyhow even with the snow on the roads they should be at the border in at most three or four hours itll still be dark for a long time after that jimmy thought with satisfaction he knew he could count on paige to be waiting on the canadian side theyd worked out a rendezvous point in the woods about three miles from the customs check jimmy debated about where he should leave the toyota there was nothing to tie him to it as long as he made sure he wiped it clean of fingerprints maybe hed ditch it in one of the wooded areas on the other hand he thought of the niagara river where he would make the border crossing it had a strong current so chances were it wouldnt be frozen with luck the car might never surface what about the kid even as he asked himself the question jimmy knew there was no way hed take a chance on the kid being found near the border and able to talk about him paige had told all her friends she was going to mexico sorry kid jimmy thought thats where i want the cops looking for me he reflected for a moment then decided the river would take care of the car and the kid that decision made jimmy felt some of the tension ease from his body with every mile he felt more sure that he was going to make it that canada and paige and freedom were within reach and with each mile he felt more anxiousand more determinedthat nothing happen to screw it up like last time hed been all set hed had callys car a hundred bucks and was heading for california then he ran a lousy caution light on ninth avenue and got pulled over the cop a guy about thirty thought he was a big shot he had come to the drivers window and said real sarcastically drivers license and registration sir thats all he would have needed to see jimmy thought remembering the moment as though it were yesterday a license issued to james siddons he had had no choice he would have been arrested on the spot hed reached into his breast pocket pulled out his gun and fired before the cops body hit the ground jimmy was out of the car and on the street blending into the crowd around the bus terminal he had looked at the departure schedule board and rushed to buy a ticket on a bus leaving in three minutes destination detroit that was a lucky decision jimmy thought hed met paige the first night moved in with her then got some phony id and a job with a lowlife security firm for a while he and paige had even had a kind of normal life their only real arguments were when he got sore at the way she encouraged the guys who made passes at her in the strip joint but she said it was her job to make them want to make passes at her for the first time everything was actually working out until he was dumb enough to hit the service station without taking enough time to case it he focused his attention back on the snowcovered road ahead of him he could tell from the feel of the tires that it was getting icy good thing this car had snow tires jimmy thought he flashed back to the couple who owned the carwhat had the guy said to his wife something about cant wait to see bobbys face yeah that was it jimmy thought grinning as he imagined their faces when they found an empty space where their car had been parked or more likely another car taking up the space he had the radio turned on but the volume was low it was tuned to a local station to get an update on the weather but now the sound was fading and static was breaking up the signal impatiently jimmy twiddled the dial until he found an allnews station then froze as an announcers urgent voice reported police have reluctantly confirmed the story broken by station wyme that sevenyearold brian dornan missing since five oclock this evening has fallen into the hands of alleged murderer jimmy siddons who is believed to be heading for canada swearing steadily jimmy snapped off the radio cally she must have called the cops the thruways probably already lousy with them all looking for meand the kid he reasoned frantically he glanced to the left at the car just passing him probably dozens of unmarked cars around here he thought calm keep it calm he told himself they didnt know what kind of car he was driving he wasnt going to be dumb enough to speed or worse yet crawl so far below the speed limit that theyd get suspicious but the kid was a problem he had to get rid of him right away he thought the situation through quickly hed get off at the nearest exit take care of him dump him fast and then get back on the road he looked at the boy sleeping beside him too bad kid but thats the way its got to be he said to himself on the right he saw an exit sign thats it jimmy thought thats the one ill take brian stirred as though starting to wake up then fell back asleep drowsily he decided that he must have been dreaming but he thought he had heard his name al rhodes saw the haunted look on the face of catherine dornan when she realized the implications of brian being with jimmy siddons he watched as she closed her eyes ready to catch her if she fainted but then she opened her eyes quickly and reached out to put her arms around her older son we mustnt forget that brian has the st christopher medal she said softly the mask of adult bravado that michael had managed to maintain throughout the evenings ordeal began to crumble i dont want anything to happen to brian he sobbed catherine stroked his head nothing is going to happen to him she said calmly believe that and hold on to it rhodes could see the effort it took for her to talk who the hell leaked to the media that brian dornan was with jimmy siddons he wondered angrily rhodes could feel his fist itching to connect with the louse who had so thoughtlessly jeopardized the kids life his anger was further fed by the realization that if siddons was listening to the radio the first thing hed do was get rid of the boy catherine was saying mother remember how dad used to tell us about the christmas eve when he was only twentytwo years old and in the thick of the battle of the bulge and he took a couple of soldiers in his company into one of the towns on the fringe of the battle line why dont you tell michael about it her mother took up the story thered been a report of enemy activity there but it turned out not to be true on the way back to their battalion they passed the village church midnight mass had just started they could see that the church was packed in the midst of all that fear and danger everyone had left their homes for the service their voices singing silent night drifted out into the square dad said it was the most beautiful sound hed ever heard barbara cavanaugh smiled at her grandson grandpa and the other soldiers went into the church grandpa used to tell me how scared all of them had been until they saw the faith and courage of those villagers here these people were surrounded by fierce fighting they had almost no food yet those villagers believed that somehow theyd make it through that terrible time her lower lip quivered but her voice was steady as she continued grandpa said that was when he knew he was going to come home to me and it was an hour later that the st christopher medal kept the bullet from going through his heart catherine looked over michaels head to officer ortiz would you take us to the cathedral now i want to go to midnight mass wed need to be in a seat where you could find me quickly if you have any news i know the head usher ray hickey ortiz said ill take care of it she looked at detective rhodes i will be notified immediately if you have any word at all absolutely he could not resist adding youre very brave mrs dornan and i can tell you this for sure every law enforcement officer in the northeast is dedicated to getting brian back safely i believe that and the only way i can help is to pray the leak didnt come from our guys mort levy reported tersely to chief of detectives folney apparently some hotshot kid from wyme was watching callys apartment and saw us go in knew something was up and followed aika banks home he told her he was a cop and pumped her his name is pete cruise damn good thing it wasnt one of ours when all this is over well hang cruise out to dry for impersonating an officer folney said in the meantime weve got plenty to do here he was standing in front of an enlarged map of the northeast that had been attached to the wall of his office it was crisscrossed with routes outlined in different colors folney picked up a pointer heres where were at mort weve got to assume that siddons had a car waiting when he left his sisters place according to her he left shortly after six if were right and he got in a car immediately hes been on the road about five and a half hours the pointer moved the light snow band extends from the city to about herkimer exit on the thruway its heavier throughout new england but even so siddons probably isnt more than four to six hours from the border folney gave a decisive thump to the map amounts to looking for a needle in a haystack mort waited he knew the boss didnt want comments weve got a special alert along the border folney continued but with the heavy traffic he could still be missed and we all know that someone like siddons probably knows how to get into canada without going through a checkpoint now he waited for comments how about staging an accident on the major roads to force a onelaner about twenty miles before the border mort suggested i wouldnt rule that out but on the same principle as erecting a barrier traffic would build up in two minutes and siddons might just try to get off at the nearest exit if we go ahead with that plan well have to put barriers at all the exits as well and if siddons feels trapped mort levy hesitated siddons has a screw loose sir cally hunter believes her brother is capable of killing both brian and himself rather than get captured i think she knows what shes talking about and if she had had the guts to call us the minute jimmy left her house with that boy he wouldnt have gotten out of manhattan both men turned jack shore was in the doorway he looked past mort levy to bud folney a new development sir a state trooper chris mcnally got a hamburger about twenty minutes ago at the travel plaza between syracuse exit and weedsport exit on the thruway he didnt pay much attention at the time but the woman at the pickup station a miss deidre lenihan was talking about a st christopher medal that some kid was wearing bud folney snapped where is the lenihan woman now her shift ended at eleven her mother said her boyfriend was picking her up theyre trying to track them down now but if cally hunter had called us earlier none of this would have happened we could have been at every travel plaza between here and bud folney almost never raised his voice but his increasing frustration over the agonizing twists in the manhunt for jimmy siddons made him suddenly shout shut up jack if onlys dont help now do something useful get the radio stations in that area to broadcast a plea to deidre lenihan to call her mother say shes needed at home or something and for gods sake dont let anyone connect her to siddons or that child got it from his perch just off the road chris mcnally kept a watchful eye on the cars passing before him the snow had finally ended but the roadway remained icy at least the drivers were being careful he thought although they were all probably frustrated at having to crawl along at thirtyfive miles an hour since hed picked up his hamburger he had only ticketed one driver a hotshot in a sports car although he was focused on the flow of traffic on the highway he still could not get his mind off the report of the missing child the minute the alert had come in about the little boy who was being held hostage by an escaped cop killer a little boy wearing a st christopher medal chris had phoned the mcdonalds he had just visited and had asked to speak to deidre lenihan the woman who had waited on him even though he hadnt really been paying any attention he remembered that she had been going on about just such a medal and a little boy now he was sorry he hadnt been more in the mood to gab with her especially since they told him she had just left for the evening with her boyfriend despite the tenuous nature of the tip he nonetheless had reported the possible lead to his supervisor who had passed it along to one police plaza they had decided it was worth acting on and had asked the local radio station to broadcast an appeal that deidre call in to police headquarters from deidres mother they had even gotten a description of the boyfriends car then they had gotten his license number and put out an allpoints call to try and find them deidres mother had also told them however that she thought tonight was going to be special for her daughter that the boyfriend had let her know his christmas present was going to be an engagement ring chances were they wouldnt be out on the road now but someplace a little more romantic but even if deidre did hear the radio appeal and did call in what could she tell them that she had seen a kid wearing a st christopher medal they knew that already did she know the make and model of the car had she seen the license plate from what chris knew of deidre goodhearted as she was she was not too alert and was observant only when something struck her fancy no it was unlikely that she could provide any more significant information all of which made chris even more frustrated i might have been around that kid myself he thought i might have been in line behind them at mcdonaldswhy didnt i notice anything more the thought of having possibly been close to the kidnapped child practically drove him wild my kids are home in bed right now he thought that little boy should be with his family too the problem was he realized thinking back over his conversation with deidre the car with the little boy could have come through there anywhere between a few minutes and an hour before she told him about it still it was the only lead they had so they had to treat it seriously his radio went on it was headquarters chris the dispatcher said the boss wants to talk to you sure when the captain got on his voice was urgent chris the new york city police think your tip is the closest thing they have to a chance of saving that kids life were going to keep on beating the bushes looking for the lenihan woman but in the meantime rack your brain try to remember if there was anything else she might have said anything that might be of some help im trying sir im on the thruway now if its all right with you id like to start driving west if the guy was on the mcdonalds line about the same time as i was hes got about a ten to fifteen minute lead on me at this point if i can pick up a little time on him id sure like to be in the vicinity when word does come through from deidre id like to be there when we get him okay go ahead and chris for gods sake think are you sure that she didnt say anything more specific about either the kid with the st christopher medal or maybe about the car he was in just the word jumped into chriss mind was it his imagination or had deidre said i just saw a kidwearing a st christopher medal he shook his head he couldnt remember for sure he did know that the car ahead of him in the line at mcdonalds had been a brown toyota with new york plates but there hadnt been a kid in the car or at least not that he could see that much he was sure of even so if deidre had said just maybe she did mean the toyota what had been the license number on that car he couldnt remember but he had noticed something about it what was it chris the supervisors voice was sharp effectively breaking his reverie im sorry sir i was trying to remember i think deidre said she had just seen the kid wearing the medal if she meant that literally then it could have been the car directly in front of me on line that was a brown toyota with new york plates do you remember any part of the number no im just getting a blank my mind was probably a million miles away and the car was there definitely a little boy in it i didnt see one thats not much help every third car on the road is probably a toyota and tonight theyre all so dirty you cant tell one color from another they probably all look brown no this one was definitely brown that much is for sure i just wish i could remember deidres exact words well dont drive yourself crazy lets hope we hear from the lenihan woman and in the meantime ill send one of the other cars to cover your station head west well check in later at least it feels as if im doing something chris thought as he signed off turned the key and pressed his foot on the gas the squad car leaped forward one thing i do know is how to drive he thought grimly as he steered the vehicle onto the breakdown lane and began passing the cautious motorists along the way and as he drove he continued to try to remember what exactly he had seen in front of him it was there imprinted in his mind he was sure of that if only he could call it up as he strained he felt as though his subconscious were trying to shout out the information if only he could hear it in the meantime every inch of his sixfootfour inch being was warning him that time was running out for the missing boy jimmy was seething what with all the cars going like old ladies were driving them it had taken him half an hour to get to the nearest exit jimmy knew he had to get off the thruway now so he could get rid of the kid a sign told him he was within a half mile of exit and a town named waterloo waterloo for the kid he thought with grim satisfaction the snow had stopped but he wasnt sure that was good for him the slush was turning to ice and that slowed him up more plus without the snow it was easier for any cops who might be driving by to get a look at him he switched to the right lane in a minute hed be able to get off the thruway suddenly the brake lights flashed on the car ahead of him and jimmy watched with increasing anger and frustration as the rear of that car fishtailed jerk jimmy screamed jerk jerk jerk brian sat up straight eyes wide open fully alert jimmy began to curse a steady stream of invective flowing as he realized what had happened a snowplow four or five cars in front had just switched into the exit lane instinctively he steered the toyota into the middle lane and barely managed to avoid the fishtailing car as he pulled abreast of the snowplow they were just passing the exit he slammed the wheel with his fist now hed have to wait till exit to get off the thruway how far was that he wondered but as he glanced back at the exit hed just missed he realized he actually had been lucky there was a pileup on the ramp it must have just happened that was why the plow had switched lanes if he had tried to get off there he could have been stuck for hours finally he saw a sign that informed him the next exit was in six miles even at this pace it shouldnt take more than fifteen minutes the wheels were gripping the road better this stretch must have been sanded jimmy felt for the gun under his jacket should he take it out and hide it under the seat no he decided if a cop tried to stop him he needed it just where it was he glanced at the odometer on the dashboard hed set it when he and the kid started driving it showed that they had gone just over three hundred miles there was still a long way to go but just knowing that he was this close to the canadian border and paige was so exciting a sensation he could almost taste it this time hed make it work and whatever he did this time he wouldnt be dumb enough to be caught by the cops jimmy felt the kid stirring beside him trying to settle back into sleep what a mistake he thought i should have dumped him five minutes after i took him i had the car and the money why did i think i needed him he ached for the moment when he could be rid of the kid and be safe officer ortiz escorted catherine her mother and michael to the fiftieth street entrance to st patricks cathedral a security guard stationed outside was waiting for them we have seats for you in the reserved section maam he told catherine as he pushed the heavy door open the magnificent sound of the orchestra led by the organ and accompanied by the choir filled the great cathedral which was already packed with worshipers joyful joyful the choir was singing joyful joyful catherine thought please god yes let this night end like that they passed the cr√®che where the lifesized figures of the virgin joseph and the shepherds were gathered around the empty pile of hay that was the crib she knew that the statue of the infant christ child would be placed there during the mass the security guard showed them to their seats in the second row on the middle aisle catherine indicated that her mother should go in first then she whispered you go between us michael she wanted to be on the outside at the end of the row so she could be aware the minute the door opened officer ortiz leaned over mrs dornan if we hear anything ill come in for you otherwise when mass is over the guard will lead you out first and ill be waiting outside in the car thank you catherine said then immediately sank to her knees the music changed to a swirling paean of triumph as the procession beganthe choir the acolytes deacon priests and bishops preceding the cardinal who was carrying the crook of the shepherd in his hand lamb of god catherine prayed please please save my lamb chief of detectives folney his gaze still riveted to the map of the thruway on the wall of his office knew that with each passing minute the chances of finding brian dornan alive grew slimmer mort levy and jack shore were across the desk from him canada he said emphatically hes on his way to canada and hes getting close to the border they had just received further word from michigan paige laronde had closed all her bank accounts the day she left detroit and in a burst of confidence she had told another dancer that she had been in touch with a guy who was a genius at creating fake ids it was reported that she had said let me tell you with the kind of papers i got for my boyfriend and me we can both just disappear if siddons makes it over the border bud folney muttered more to himself than to the others nothing from the thruway guys he asked for the third time in fifteen minutes nothing sir mort said quietly call them again i want to talk to them myself when he got through to chris mcnallys supervisor and heard for himself that absolutely nothing was new he decided he wanted to speak to trooper mcnally himself a lot of good thatll do jack shore muttered to mort levy but before folney could be connected with mcnally another call came in hot lead an assistant said rushing into folneys office siddons and the kid were seen by a trooper about an hour ago at a rest area on route in vermont near white river junction he said the man matches siddonss description to a t and the boy was wearing some kind of medal forget mcnally folney said crisply i want to talk to the trooper who saw them and right now call the vermont police and have them put up barriers at all the exits north of the sighting for all we know the girlfriend may be holed up waiting for him in a farmhouse on this side of the border while folney waited he looked over at mort call cally hunter and tell her what weve just learned ask her if she knows if jimmy has ever been to vermont and if so where did he go there might be some place in particular he could be headed brian could tell that the car was going faster he opened his eyes then shut them as fast as he could it was easier to stay lying down curled up on the seat pretending to be asleep instead of having to try not to act scared when jimmy looked at him he also had been listening to the radio even though the volume was turned way down he could hear what they were saying that cop killer jimmy siddons who had shot a prison guard had kidnapped brian dornan his mother had been reading a book named kidnapped to him and michael brian liked the story a lot but when they went to bed michael told him he thought it was dumb he had said that if anyone tried to kidnap him hed kick the guy and punch him and run away well i cant run away brian thought and he was sure that trying to hurt jimmy by punching him wouldnt work he wished that hed been able to open the car door earlier and roll out like he had planned to hed have curled up in a ball just like they taught the kids to do in gym class he would have been okay but now the car door near him was locked and he knew that before he could even pull up the lock and open the door jimmy would grab him brian was almost crying he could feel his nose filling up and his eyes getting watery he tried to think about how michael might call him a crybaby sometimes that helped him when he was trying not to cry it didnt help now though even michael would probably cry if he was scared and he had to go to the bathroom again and it said right on the radio that jimmy was dangerous but even though he was crying brian made sure he didnt make a sound he felt the tears on his cheeks but he didnt move to brush them away if he moved his hand jimmy would notice and know he was awake and for now he had to keep pretending instead he clasped the st christopher medal even tighter and made himself think about how when dad was able to go back home they were going to put up their own christmas tree and open the presents just before they had left for new york mrs emerson who lived next door had come in to say goodbye and he had heard her say to his mom catherine no matter when it is the night you put up your tree were all going to come and sing christmas carols under your window then shed hugged brian and said i know your favorite carol silent night hed sung it all by himself in the firstgrade christmas pageant at school last year brian tried to sing it to himself now in his mind but he couldnt get past silent night he knew if he kept thinking about it he wouldnt be able to keep jimmy from knowing that he was crying then he almost jumped someone on the radio was talking about jimmy and him again the man was saying that a state trooper in vermont was sure he had seen jimmy siddons and a young boy in an old dodge or chevrolet at a rest stop on route in vermont and the search was being concentrated there jimmys grim smile vanished as quickly as it had come the first surge of relief at hearing the news bulletin was followed by instant caution had some fool claimed hed spotted them in vermont he wondered it was possible he decided when he had been hiding out in michigan some twobit drifter swore hed seen jimmy in delaware after he got caught at the gasstation job and was taken back to new york he had found out that the marshals had kept the heat on in delaware for months even so being on the thruway was really beginning to spook him the road was good and he could make time but the nearer you got to the border the more troopers there might be on the road he decided that when he got off at the next exit and got rid of the kid hed swing over to route now that it wasnt snowing he should be able to make okay time there follow your hunch jimmy reminded himself the only time he hadnt was when he had tried to hold up that gas station he still remembered that at the time something had warned him there was a problem well after this therell be no more problems he thought looking down at brian then when he looked up he grinned the sign looming before him read exit geneva one mile ahead chris mcnally had passed the fenderbender on the exit ramp two police cars were on the scene already so he decided there was no need for him to stop he had traveled fast and he hoped that by now he had caught up to any cars that had been ahead of him on line at mcdonalds provided of course they hadnt taken one of the earlier exits a brown toyota thats what he kept looking for finding it was the one chance he knew it what was it about the license plate he clenched his teeth again trying hard to remember there had been something about it think damn it he told himself think he didnt for one minute believe the report that siddons and the kid had been spotted in vermont every gut instinct kept telling chris that they were nearby exit to geneva was coming up that meant the border was only another hundred miles or so away most of the cars were doing fifty to sixty miles an hour now if jimmy siddons was in this vicinity he could look forward to being out of the country in less than two hours what was there about the license plate of the toyota he asked himself once more chriss eyes narrowed he could see a dark toyota in the passing lane that was moving fast he switched lanes and drove up beside it then glanced in he prayed that it held a single man or a man with a young boy just a chance to find that child give me a chance he prayed without turning on his siren or dome light chris continued past the toyota he had been able to see a young couple inside the guy was driving with his arm around the girl not a good idea on an icy road another time hed have pulled him over chris stepped on the gas the road was clearer the traffic was better spaced but everything was moving faster and faster and closer and closer to canada his radio was on low when a call came in for him officer mcnally yes new york city chief of detectives bud folney calling you from one police plaza i just spoke to your supervisor again the vermont sighting is a washout the lenihan woman cant be found tell me what you reported earlier about a brown toyota knowing his boss had dismissed that chris realized that this folney must be really pressing him he explained that if deidre had been talking about the car directly ahead of him in the mcdonalds line she was talking about a brown toyota with new york plates and you cant remember the license no sir chris wanted to strangle the words in his throat but there was something unusual about it he was almost at exit as he watched a vehicle two cars ahead switched into the exit lane his casual glance became a stare my god he said officer what is it in new york bud folney instinctively knew that something was happening thats it chris said it wasnt the license plate i noticed it was the bumper sticker theres just a piece of it left and it says inheritance sir im following that toyota down the exit ramp right now can you check out the license dont lose that car bud snapped and hang on three minutes later the phone rang in apartment c in stuyvesant oval in lower manhattan a sleepy and anxious edward hillson picked it up hello he said he felt his wifes nervous grasp on his arm what my car i parked it around the corner at five or so no i didnt lend it to anyone yes its a brown toyota what are you telling me bud folney got back to chris i think you have him but for gods sake remember hes threatened to kill the child before he lets himself get captured so be careful michael was so sleepy all he wanted to do was lean against gran and close his eyes but he couldnt do that yet not until he was sure that brian was okay michael struggled to suppress his growing fear why didnt he grab me if he saw that lady pick up moms wallet i could have run after her and helped him when he got caught by that guy the cardinal was at the altar now but when the music stopped instead of starting to offer mass he began to speak on this night of joy and hope off to the right michael could see the television cameras he had always thought it would be cool to be on television but whenever he had thought about it the circumstances he envisioned had to do with winning something or with witnessing some great event that would be fun tonight when he and mom were on together it wasnt fun it was awful to hear mom begging people to help them find brian in a year that has brought so much violence to the innocent michael straightened up the cardinal was talking about them about dad being sick and brian being missing and believed to be with that escaped killer he was saying brian dornans mother grandmother and tenyearold brother are with us at this mass let our special prayer be that dr thomas dornan will recover fully and that brian will be found unharmed michael could see that mom and gran were both crying their lips were moving and he knew they were praying his prayer was the advice he would have given brian if he could hear him run brianrun now that he was off the thruway jimmy felt somewhat relieved despite a gnawing sense that things were closing in on him he was running low on gas but was afraid to risk stopping at a station with the kid in the car he was on route south that connected with route in about six miles route led to the border there was a lot less traffic here than on the thruway most people were home by now anyway asleep or getting ready for christmas morning it was unlikely that anyone would be looking for him here still he reasoned the best thing to do was to get on some of the local streets in geneva find someplace like a school where thered be a parking lot or find a wooded area somewhere he could stop without being noticed and do what he had to do as he took the next righthand turn he glanced in the rearview mirror his antennae went up he thought he had seen headlights reflected there as he made the turn but now he didnt see them anymore im getting too jumpy he thought a block later it suddenly was like theyd sailed off the edge of the earth as far as he could see there were no cars ahead they were in a residential area quiet and dark the houses were mostly unlit except some of them still had christmastree lights glowing from bushes and evergreens on the snowcovered lawns he couldnt be sure if the kid was really asleep or faking it not that it mattered this was the sort of place he needed he drove six blocks and then saw what he was looking for a school with a long driveway that had to lead to a parking area his eyes missed nothing as he carefully searched the area for any sign of an approaching car or someone out walking then he stopped the car and opened the window halfway listening intently for any hint of trouble the cold instantly turned his breath to steam he could hear nothing but the hum of the toyota s engine it was quiet out there silent still he decided to drive around the block one more time just to be sure he wasnt being followed as he put his foot on the accelerator and as the car slowly moved forward he kept his gaze glued to the rearview mirror damn hed been right there was a car behind him running without lights now it was moving too the lights from a brilliantly lit tree reflected on its rooftop dome a squad car cops damn them jimmy swore under his breath damn them damn them he tromped on the gas pedal it might be his last ride but hed make it a good one he looked down at brian quit pretending i know youre awake he shouted sit up damn you i shoulda ditched you as soon as i was out of the city lousy kid jimmy floored the accelerator a quick look in the rearview mirror confirmed that the pursuing car had also speeded up and was now openly following him but so far there seemed to be only one of them clearly cally had told the cops he had the kid he reasoned shed probably also told them that he said hed kill the kid first if they tried to close in on him if that cop behind him knew that it explained why he wasnt trying to pull him over right now he glanced at the speedometer fifty sixty seventy damn this car jimmy thought suddenly wishing he had something more powerful than a toyota he hunched over the wheel he couldnt outrun them but he still might have a chance to get away the guy chasing him didnt have backup yet what would he do if he saw the kid had been shot and pushed out of the car hed stop to try to help him jimmy reasoned id better do it right away he thought before he has time to call in help he reached inside his jacket for his gun just then the car hit a patch of ice and began to skid jimmy dropped the gun in his lap turned the wheels in the direction of the skid then managed to straighten the car just inches away from crashing into a tree at the edge of the sidewalk nobody can drive like i can he thought grimly then he picked up the gun again and released the safety catch if the cop stops for the kid ill make it to canada he promised himself he released the lock on the passenger door and reached across the terrified boy to open it cally knew she had to call police headquarters to see if there was any word about little brian she had told detective levy she didnt think jimmy would try to reach canada through vermont he got in trouble up there when he was about fifteen shed said he never did time there but i think some sheriff really scared jimmy he told him he had a long memory and warned him never to show up in vermont again even though that was at least ten years ago jimmy is superstitious i think hed stick to the thruway i know he went to canada a couple of times when he was a teenager and both times he went that way levy had listened to her she knew he wanted to trust her and she prayed that this time he had she also prayed that she was right and they got the boy back safely so she could know that in some small way she had helped someone other than levy answered his phone and she was told to wait then levy came on what is it cally i just had to know if theres been any word ive been praying that what i told you about jimmy taking the thruway helped levys voice softened even though he still spoke quickly cally it did help and were very grateful i cant talk now but whatever prayers you know keep saying them that means they must have located jimmy she thought but what was happening to brian cally sank to her knees it doesnt matter whathappens to me she prayed stop jimmy before hehurts that child chris mcnally had known it the minute jimmy spotted him the radio was open between him and headquarters and was tied in to one police plaza in manhattan he knows hes being followed chris reported tersely hes taking off like a bat out of hell dont lose him bud folney said quietly weve got a dozen cars on the way chris the dispatcher snapped theyre running silent and on dim lights theyll surround you were bringing in a chopper too keep them out of sight chris pressed his foot on the accelerator hes going seventy theres not many cars out but these streets arent completely cleared this is getting dangerous as siddons raced across an intersection chris watched in horror as he barely missed slamming into another car siddons was driving like a maniac there was going to be an accident he knew it passing lakewood avenue he reported two blocks later he saw the toyota skid and almost hit a tree a minute after that he yelled the boy what is it folney demanded the passenger door of the toyota just opened the inside lights on so i can see the kid struggling oh god siddons has his gun out it looks like hes going to shoot him kyrie eleison the choir sang lord have mercy barbara cavanaugh prayed save my lamb catherine begged run dork run get away from him michael shouted in his mind jimmy siddons was crazy brian had never been in a car before that was going so fast he wasnt sure what was going on but there must be someone following them brian looked away from the road for a moment and glanced at jimmy he had his gun out he felt jimmy tugging at his seat belt releasing it then he reached across brian and opened the door beside him he could feel the cold air rushing in for a moment he was paralyzed with fear then he sat up very straight he realized what was about to happen that jimmy was going to shoot him and push him out of the car he had to get away he was still clutching the medal in his right hand he felt jimmy poke him in the side with the gun pushing him toward the open door and the roadway rushing beneath them holding on to the seatbelt buckle with his left hand he swung out blindly with his right the medal arced and slammed into jimmys face catching him in his left eye jimmy yelled and took his hand off the wheel instinctively slamming his foot on the brake as he grabbed his eye the gun went off the bullet whistled past brians ear as the outofcontrol car began to spin around it jumped the curb went up into a corner lawn and caught on a bush still spinning it slowed as it dragged the bush back across the lawn and out onto the edge of the road jimmy was swearing now one hand again on the wheel the other aiming the gun blood dripped into his eye from a gash across his forehead and cheek get out get out brian heard the command in his head as though someone were shouting it at him brian dove for the door and rolled out onto the snowcovered lawn just as a second bullet passed over his shoulder jesus christ the kids out of the car chris yelled he jammed on the brakes and skidded to a stop behind the toyota hes getting up oh my god bud folney shouted is he hurt but chris didnt hear him he was already out of his car and running toward the boy siddons was in control of the toyota again and had turned it clearly planning to run over brian in what seemed like an eternity but was actually only seconds chris had crossed the space between him and brian and gathered the boy in his arms the car was racing toward them its passenger door still open and its interior still illuminated so that the maniacal anger in jimmy siddonss face was clearly visible clutching brian tightly against him chris dove to the side and rolled down a snowy incline just as the wheels of the toyota passed inches from their heads an instant later with a sickening sound of metal crashing and glass breaking the vehicle careened off the porch of the house and flipped over for a moment there was silence and then the quiet was shattered as sirens screamed and wailed lights from a dozen squad cars brightened the night as swarms of troopers raced to surround the overturned vehicle chris lay in the snow for a few seconds hugging brian to him listening to the convergence of sounds then he heard a small relieved voice ask are you st christopher no but right now i feel like him brian chris said heartily merry christmas son officer manuel ortiz slipped noiselessly through the side door of the cathedral and instantly caught catherines eye he smiled and nodded his head she jumped up and ran to meet him is he hes fine theyre sending him back in a police helicopter hell be here by the time mass is over noticing that one of the television cameras was trained on them ortiz raised his hand and made a circle of his thumb and forefinger a symbol that for this moment on this most special of days everything was aok those seated nearby witnessed the exchange and began to clap softly as others turned they stood and applause began to slowly rumble through the giant cathedral it was a full five minutes before the deacon could begin to read the christmas gospel and it came to pass im going to let cally know whats happened mort levy told bud folney sir i know she should have called us earlier but i hope dont worry im not going to play scrooge tonight she worked with us she deserves a break folney said crisply besides the dornan woman has already said shes not going to press charges against her he paused for a moment thinking listen theres got to be some toys left in the station houses tell the guys to get busy and round some up for that little girl of callys have them meet us at callys building in fortyfive minutes mort you and i are going to give them to her shore you go home it was brians first helicopter ride and even though he was incredibly tired he was too excited to even think about closing his eyes he was sorry officer mcnallychris as he had said he should call himhadnt been able to come with him but he had been with brian when they took jimmy siddons away and he had told him not to worry that this was one guy who would never get out of prison again and then hed gotten the st christopher medal out of the car for brian as the helicopter came down it looked like it was almost landing on the river he recognized the fiftyninth street bridge and the roosevelt island tramway his dad had taken him for a ride on that he wondered suddenly if his father knew what had happened to him he turned to one of the officers my dads in a hospital near here i have to go see him he might be worried the officer who was by now familiar with the story of the whole dornan family said youll see him soon son but now your mothers waiting for you shes at midnight mass at st patricks cathedral when the buzzer sounded at callys avenue b apartment she answered it with the resigned belief that she was going to be arrested detective levy had called to say only that he and another officer were coming by but it was two beaming selfappointed santa clauses who arrived at her door laden with dolls and games and a sparkling white wicker dolls carriage as she watched unbelieving they placed the gifts under and around the christmas tree your information about your brother was a tremendous help bud folney said the dornan boy is okay and on his way back to the city jimmy is on his way back to prison hes our responsibility once again and i promise we wont let him get away this time from now on i hope it gets a lot better for you cally felt as though a giant weight had been lifted from her she could only whisper thank you thank you folney and levy chorused merry christmas cally and were gone when they left cally at last knew she could go to bed and sleep gigis even breathing was an answered prayer from now on shed be able to hear it every night and listen without fear that her little girl would be taken away from her again everything will get better she thought i know it now as she fell asleep her last thought was that when gigi saw that the big package with santas present was missing from under the christmas tree she could honestly tell her that santa claus had come and taken it away the recessional was about to start when once again the side door of the cathedral opened and officer ortiz entered this time he was not alone he bent down to the small boy beside him and pointed before catherine could get to her feet brian was in her arms the st christopher medal he was wearing pressed against her heart as she held him close she said nothing but felt the silent tears of relief and joy course down her cheeks knowing that he once again was safe and firm in her belief now that tom was going to make it too barbara also did not speak but leaned over and laid her hand on her grandsons head it was michael who broke the silence with whispered words of welcome hi dork he said with a grin christmas day christmas morning dawned cold and clear at ten oclock catherine brian and michael arrived at the hospital dr crowley was waiting for them when they got off the elevator on the fifth floor my god catherine he said are you okay i hadnt heard about what happened until i got here this morning you must be exhausted thanks spence but im fine she looked at her sons were all fine but how is tom when i called this morning all they would say was that he had a good night and he did its an excellent sign he had a very good night a lot better than yours thats for sure i hope you dont mind but i decided it was best if i told tom about brian the press have been calling here all morning and i didnt want to risk his hearing about it from an outsider when i told him i started with the happy ending of course catherine felt relief rush through her im glad he knows spence i didnt know how to tell him i couldnt be sure how hed take it he took it very well catherine hes a lot stronger than you might think crowley looked at the medal around brians neck i understand you went through a lot to make sure youd be able to give that medal to your dad i promise all of you that between st christopher and me well make sure he gets well the boys tugged at catherines hands hes waiting for you spence said smiling the door of toms room was partly open catherine pushed it the rest of the way and stood looking at her husband the head of the bed was elevated when tom saw them his face brightened with that familiar smile the boys ran to him then carefully stopped just inches from the bed they both reached out and grasped his hand catherine watched his eyes fill with tears when he looked at brian hes so pale she thought i can tell that he hurts but he is going to get better she did not need to force the radiant smile that her lips formed as michael lifted the chain with the st christopher medal from brians neck and together they put it on tom merry christmas dad they chorused as her husband looked over their sons heads and his lips formed the words i love you other words sang through catherines being all is calm all is bright mary higgins clark talks about her life and work does christmas hold a special significance for you yes it is a family holiday time and my birthday is on christmas eve christmas will be very special for meafter many years of widowhood i am getting married and will be celebrating my first christmas with my husband john j conheeney your books are worldwide bestsellers what is thesecret of your popularity i write about universal emotions and relationships people can walk in the shoes of my characters where do you get the inspiration for your plots from real life i attend criminal trials regularly the amount of coincidence in crime is staggering for example a young nurse in new jersey was on her way to work and someone got into her car at a red light a few minutes later she was dead she was going to work she wasnt doing anything foolish she is typical of characters in my bookspeople to whom things happen who are not looking for trouble what kind of people do you write about nice people whose lives are invaded by evil they are people with whom we can identifyleading ordinary lives and going about their business my heroines are strong women who take a major role in solving their own problems a man may come in to help at the end but the woman basically copes with the menacing situation herself when did you first realize you wanted to be awriter i knew it as a child the first thing i wrote was a poem when i was seven i still have it its pretty bad but my mother thought it was beautiful and made me recite it for everyone who came in i am sure the captive audience was ready to shoot me but that kind of encouragement nurtures a budding talent from the time i was seven i also kept diaries i can read them now and look back at what i was like at different ages i still keep diaries they are a great help to my novels no one has seen themthey are locked in a trunk what early experiences influenced you i grew up in the bronx where my father was the owner of higgins bar and grille when i was ten years old i had a terrible shock coming home from early mass one morning i found a crowd of neighbors outside the house my father had died in his sleep my mother went on to raise me and my two brothers alone when i had said good night to my father i didnt know it was for the last time his sudden death jolted me into awareness of the fragility of life my mothers example taught me resilience the characters in my books are resilient and resourceful when calamity strikes they carry on how did your fathers death influence the course ofyour life our whole existence changed my mother tried to get a job but at that time it was practically impossible for women in late middleage to return to the job market she took babysitting jobs and while i was in high school i worked as a babysitter and switchboard operator after graduating from high school i went to secretarial school so i could get a job and help with the family finances so you had to sacrifice your college education only postpone it i went to college after my children were grown and i was already an established writer in i graduated from fordham university at lincoln center summa cum laude with a ba in philosophy to celebrate i gave myself a graduation party the card read this invitation is years overduehelp prove its not too late what happened in the years before you becameaprofessional writer after completing secretarial school i worked for a couple of years in an advertising agency then one day a frienda pan am stewardessspoke seven words that changed my life god it was beastly hot in calcutta i decided that i too wanted to see the world and signed up as a pan am stewardess my run was europe africa and asia i was in a revolution in syria and on the last flight into czechoslovakia before the iron curtain went down i flew for a year and then was married to warren clark when did you start your writing career after i got married i signed up for a writing course at new york university there i got advice from a professor which has always served me well he said write about what you know take a dramatic incident with which you are familiar and go with it i thought of my experience on the last flight to czechoslovakia and gave my imagination free rein suppose i reflected the stewardess finds an eighteenyearold member of the czech underground hiding on the plane as it is about to leave the story was called stowaway it took six years and forty rejection slips before i sold it to extension magazine in for a hundred dollars i framed that first letter of acceptance you were widowed at an early age with five youngchildren did that discourage you from pursuingyour goal no on the contrary to help fill the gap i decided to concentrate on writing my children ranged in age from thirteen down to five because of his heart condition warren clark wasnt insurable so i had to work just a few hours before he died of a heart attack i had called a friend who did radio script writing she had often asked me to join her company in writing for radio and i began writing radio shows for fourteen years i supported my family writing these programs the series consisted of five fourminute programs a week syndicated on five hundred stations and hosted by celebrities such as betsy palmer hugh downs bill cullen lee meriwether and betty white but i knew that writing radio scripts wasnt enough i wanted to write books what was your first book a biographical novel about george washington aspire to the heavens based on a radio series i was then writing called portrait of a patriot vignettes about presidents it was a commercial disaster and remaindered as it came off the press but it showed that i could write a book and get it published how did you find time to write books while raisingfive children and holding a job when my children were young i used to get up at five and write at the kitchen table until seven when i had to get them ready for school for me writing is a need its the degree of yearning that separates the real writer from the wouldbes those who say ill write when i have time when the kids are grown up or when i have a quiet place to work will probably never do it when do you write now i still love to work early in the morning but get up a little later at am i dont seek seclusion having an active lively family around keeps my ears sharpened what are your children doing at present my daughter carol is the author of three suspense novels decked snagged and iced published by warner books my daughter marilyn is a superior court judge and my daughter patty is an executive assistant at the mercantile exchange my son warren a lawyer is a municipal court judge my son david is president of celebrity radio producing syndicated programs i have six grandchildren what made you turn to the field of mystery andsuspense i decided to write a book that would hopefully outsell aspire to the heavens one of the best clues about what to write is what one likes to read i decided to see if i could write a suspense novel it was like a prospector stumbling on a vein of gold i wrote whereare the childrenmy first bestseller and a turning point in my life and career your background is irish how did that influenceyour writing the irish are by nature storytellers all my grandparents were born in ireland as was my father at family gatherings my mother aunts and greataunts and cousins would sit around the table and stories flowed nothing was ever said simply when one cousin was dating a fellow the family didnt approve of one of the old girls sighed many a man was lost at sea the night that one was born there were sad stories and glad stories and i sat at the table drinking them all in many of that clan have been prototypes for characters in my books which of your novels have been made into films two of my novels were feature films a strangeris watching produced by mgm and where are thechildren released by rastar films through columbia pictures i was a local extra in where are the children blink and youll miss me three others were cbs television films the cradle will fall stillwatch and remember me in which i make a brief appearance playing myself the television film based on my novel a cry in the night released by rysher distribution starred my daughter carol higgins clark and perry king it was produced by telescene in canada and i went to the set in montreal and ended up with a oneline part im the lady coming out of church and greeting the priest my friends tell me thats typecasting how do you feel about film adaptations of yourwork when you sell a book for television or for a feature film you are in essence giving up your child for adoption you wish it well but lose control its a different medium and there is no way anyone can take your book and reproduce it exactly as you wrote it its always fun to watch something you have written turned into a film i cant spend much time on the sets but i love to go at least for a few days and be part of it now that i am establishing myself as a walkon like alfred hitchcock its even more fun how do you feel about having your stories on audiocassette the first time i heard one of my own books on audio i was
