brian freemantle betrayals wrong janet stone let the word echo in her mind the way hank had always said it when theyd made a mistake deep down and echoing like the sound of a bell with all the emphasis at the end and then let it chime again and reverberate again waiting for the memory to hurt there was a pang but not a bad one and she was grateful it had taken too longfar too longfor her to get this far being able positively to think about it without breaking down without actually having to leave a room so it was getting better a necessary test shed soon have to leave this room though she was ready for a lot of things but not quite yet for harriet andrews ritual assemblage of washington glitterati a melee of teethflashing gabble and spilled drinks and furtive hands she should have known better of course she and hank had nearly always found an excuse to avoid coming testing herself against the pain of memories janet forced another recollection hank hadnt called them melees menagerie had been his word janet thought the description was fitting she was in a menagerie of performing human animals being watered and fed doubtless as she understood inhabitants of menageries did theyd further perform by mating before the night was out it was an impromptu intrusion and janet thrust it irritably away she could never allow herself reflections about sex the subjectthe very thoughtwas more tightly locked out and forbidden from her mind than anything else how could it be otherwise what could there bewho could there beafter hank janet gazed around seeking a doorway from the cage in which she felt incarcerated it was not harriets house it was a fourstory brownstone on dumbarton street that harriets father had bought when he was seconded from the bank of england in london to the world bank in washington and had afterwards retained as the undoubted investment it was the main living room area stretched the entire length of the booklined lowlighted first level and there were ornately metaled and overhanging balconies at either end reached through floortoceiling windows both were open and janet began to maneuver through the crush towards the one directly overlooking the street but she halted almost at once this wasnt the way to escape this was scurrying into an even smaller cage where she would be isolated in a more restricted area among people interested only in their own audiences which were audiences she had no wish to join and their own voices which were voices she had no wish to hear from her hostesss command post near the bar a permanent mahogany bunker where a hiredin blacktied waiter plied gallon jugs of booze harriet caught janets eye harriet was wearing a designer skirt tight enough to have revealed her underwear if she had been wearing any which she wasnt and a low silk blouse which her nipples puckered to show she was not wearing a bra either the makeup had not started to melt yet and the naturally blonde hair was still in comparative order bubbled like fairground candyfloss around a finenosed face that was too long to make the style successful harriet shone an enameled smile and made a circular motion with an extended finger as if she were stirring something and janet nodded and stirred in the opposite direction in a signlanguage promise to circulate maybe someone would have talked to her if shed bothered with as much makeup as harriet or left her knickers in the underwear drawer or made an effort to get her hair professionally fixed before coming tonight instead of relying upon that mornings shampoo in the shower more things forbidden to reflect upon she thought janet who knew harriet to be the closest friend she had in washingtonperhaps in the worldangrily stopped the drift of her thoughts harriet had simply tried to help by inviting her like a lot of other people not as close had tried to help in other ways to get her out of the pit of despair in which shed buried herself now she was struggling to emerge and it was important to avoid selfpity what had happened hadnt been anyones fault hadnt been avoidable or preventable dear god how she wished so much had been avoidable or preventable selfpity again careful she warned herself she really did have to get away find a quieter part of the cage at least claustrophobia was beginning to tighten around her so that it was physically difficult to breathe the first stirring of familiar panic shed hoped to be over the gap was near the door which was what she wanted anyway a tiny oasis were there oases in menageries kept vacant by the passing inrush of new arrivals cradling her barely sipped drink a sweet punch janet suspected might be too strongly laced with something like tasteless vodka from the gallonbottle on the mahogany bar she set out on her escape turning and twisting and smiling her apologies through the crowd in between twice as she moved through she felt an apparently solicitous hand on her ass and once someone openly groped her left breast before she could get by janet concentrated entirely upon reaching the space shed identified and ignored the fondling so it only took seconds to get through but when she looked up the empty space wasnt empty any more it wasnt possible so late to change direction besides which there wasnt anywhere else to go the entrance now was jammed with a group of new arrivals kissing greetings and discarding coats and dispensing presents and gesturing with booze contributions to prove their right of entry oh said janet im sorry so was janet at her gauche reaction to his getting there ahead of her it was just that nothing im sorry she stumbled still awkward he smiled unflustered and said we cant both be sorry not when neither of us know what were apologizing for i didnt think you were apologizing she said it had been so long she felt lost i wasnt he said but you seem disconcerted so if ive done something wrong i will janet knew she was flushed redfaced it was just that i thought this part of the room so near the door wasnt occupied she wished everything wasnt coming out so badly the smile stayed a reassuring expression you too he said i dont understand janet said thinking in relief that she did but didnt want to make any more mistakes i was looking for somewhere to hide he said well not hide exactly to get out of the way janet smiled herself feeling further relief me too she admitted you didnt come with anyone either no or know anyone i know the girl whose party it is harriet andrew conceded janet shes a close friend he looked beyond her unhurriedly and appearing really to look not just shift his attention casually quite a bunch of people he said harriet gives these sorts of parties often gets her name in the social columns even he didnt seemed impressed you come to them all oh no said janet at once i havent been to one for a long time the last occasion she had been with she started to remember and then stopped blocking off the reminiscence i dont think i fit particularly well here he said coming back to her and smiling again i dont think i do either she said you caught me caught you i wasnt trying to steal your space he grinned i was making a break for it without being aware of it happening janet realized she had relaxed the words were coming easily and the claustrophobic girdle wasnt tight around her any more she said i guess i was doing the same thing that was before i found someone to talk to of course me too she said again janet assured herself that this wasnt flirtation or anything like the sort of conversational foreplay going on everywhere else it was simply nicerelaxing like she had already decidedjust to talk and come back to some sort of social normalcy she had for so long denied herself with noise battling noise all around there was a moment of silence between them he said so as were talking i could stay i dont want to keep you she said immediately retreating into the pit where she felt at home ok he said at once going backwards himself ill probably leave as well she said why dont we leave together he shrugged a nobigdeal shrug why not she said answering the shrug as well as the question my names john he said john sheridan janet she responded janet stone dumbarton was jammed as it nearly always was cars tight against each other some were even pulled in off the road between the trees and parked halfway into driveways completely blocking the pavement the thunderclaps of party noise came out above them through the open balcony windows sheridan said being a neighbor of harriet andrew could seriously damage your peace of mind shes a very good person said janet defensively im sure he said you friends from england youre very observant the accent is pretty obvious said sheridan yes said janet answering the question we read at oxford together she hesitated feeling as uncomfortable as she had back at the house i came by cab theres a rank on wisconsin my cars that way he said falling into step beside her they had to maneuver around several obstructing vehicles always he politely stood back deferring for her to go first and never once reached for her hand or her arm on the pretense of helping her not even when they had to go over a cross street wisconsin avenue was brightly lit compared to the side roads and very busy cars and people ebbing and flowing in both directions and with shops and bars and cafes open on either side sheridan turned towards m street and announced no cabs jane looked towards the deserted rank and said theyre along here all the time she started down towards the intersection and again he went with her at the junction they looked both ways along m street there wasnt anywhere a taxi showing a for hire light not really your night he said it wont take long really would you like a drink janet had been expecting such an approach from the moment he began walking with her and had the polite refusal already rehearsed work she had to do at home which wasnt actually a lie because mondays lecturethe slide of the lebanon into utter anarchywas still only half written she saw from the clock in the bank window behind him that it wasnt yet eight she said thank you not knowing why shed accepted i dont know georgetown particularly well he said theres nathans she said nodding across the road he stood away from her while they waited for the lights and made no move to cup her arm when they went over as he held back for her to enter the bar janet saw three cabs in convoy coming from the city their flags lit nathans was crowded but as they entered two people got up from a table near the door so they were seated immediately she asked for scotch and he said hed have the same when he came back with the drinks he said cheers janet said cheers back unsure what would happen next wheres your husband he asked abruptly how she began and then stopped following his look towards her hand janet steeled herself to utter the word gazing directly across the table she blurted dead she paused and then said hes dead shed confronted it before of course to herself at first staring into mirrors in their empty apartment needing to convince herself it was true and not a bad dream saying dead dead dead hanks dead but this was the first time to a complete stranger something else that did not hurt as much as shed expected janet waited for an insincere im sorry but instead he said how long this was going beyond anything for which janet had prepared herself clipvoiced gazing down into her untouched drink she said ten months ten months and two weeks there was another pause and four days it was a friday how did he die janet swallowed deeply and said i dont think i want to talk about it why not she shrugged lost she said i just dont you should he said suddenly angry janet said dont give me any of that youll feel better if you talk about it amateur psychology she leveled her hand beneath her chin ive had that sort of crap up to here i wasnt going to give you any sort of amateur psychology crap deflated janet demanded what then now he shrugged it just seems odd that if you loved a guy that much you want to lock everything away you might as well take the rings off and pretend it never happened its not like that at all she said still angry if you say so what sort of remark is that a backingoff sort of remark he said i was out of order and now im embarrassed would you like another drink no she said then quickly no thank you you want me to say im sorry thats up to you im sorry it sounded as if he meant it she said what about you wife i mean there isnt one why not janet said trying to hit back with the unsettling sort of directness that he had shown earlier the shoulders rose and fell once more never the right person in the right place at the right time for the moment i cant remember the movie that line came from said janet sheridan lowered and raised his head in acknowledgment he said it just never happened i guess you sure about that drink on the street outside the for hire lights bobbed and dipped like leaves in a stream janet said just one more janet watched as sheridan made his way to the bar properly studying him for the first time deciding he was a difficult person about whom to form an instant impression he was inconspicuous in stature and in demeanour and in the way he dressedabruptly she realized he was wearing a collar and a tie and a muted suit while everyone else at the party had been laidback casualbut he appeared in no way nervous or uncertain rather the reverse people parted at the bar and he was served almost at once despite louder shouted demands and people parted again for him when he turned away janet stayed intent upon him as he returned concentrating upon detail now he was a lean man the skin almost taut over high cheekbones and a sharp aquiline nose and there was some hint of discoloration to his face as if he had spent a lot of time in the sun she could not discern any beardline and wondered if hed shaved a second time before going to the party there was a slight sag of puffiness beneath his eyes which had no positive color but seemed to her like a tweed a mixture of browns and greens and his brown hair was just lightening into gray at the sides and oddly at just one temple the left on the small finger of his left handthe hand with which he proffered her drinkhe wore a rubystoned ring and because his arm was extended she could see a thick heavily calibrated rolex watch he repeated cheers and she raised her glass back to him in response you were leading the inquisition he said janet was glad of the lightness so she asked i work for the government saying that in washington is like declaring youre a coalminer in pennsylvania or brew beer in milwaukee said janet she allowed the pause or maybe hinting at something sinister sheridan smiled unevenly because he did not appear to have bothered with any dental correction and said nothing spooky about me he gestured vaguely over his shoulder towards the city and said state department you know foggy bottom janet nodded thinking how close the state department headquarters were to a georgetown hed earlier said he didnt know very well whether or not he visited georgetown was hardly any business of hers she thought must be interesting she said wishing as she spoke she had managed to avoid the cliche he shook his head not at my lowly level he said general analysis long reports that take weeks to prepare and weeks to print for nobody to read why bother in the first place paperwork is the lifeblood of bureaucracy said sheridan selfmocking im just one of the billions of bureaucrats who write billions of unread reports that need huge forests of trees cut down to make the paper to print them on its people like me who make cities possible in the cleared spaces thank you laughed janet trying to respond she decided guiltily that she was enjoying herself and because of that guilt made an immediate qualification not actually enjoying herself relaxing she thought again more than she had for a very long time there was nothing wrong in that nothing disrespectful to hanks memory just coming out of seclusion your turn sheridan said and then at once conscious of her slight stiffening he said no forget it lets just drink our drinks damned sight safer than that punch back there by now theyll be swinging from the chandeliers she said youre very considerate and youre very vulnerable does it show that much is the grand canyon a ditch it was just she set out stopping almost at once because the words werent there so complete she started again i didnt want didnt need anybody else neither did he which is what makes it worse because now he isnt here any more theres nothing just emptiness like a hole i cant climb out of exactly that she thought she had buried herself dont said sheridan gently leave it let me you sure janet nodded jerkily eyes down on her drink again she started to tell him stumbling again at the beginning until the surroundings receded going right back to oxford where theyd met she reading modern history and hankwhom she called henry now as she had in those early dayswas studying law strangely there was no embarrassment telling this calm unmoving stranger how hank had moved in with her after four months and how shed followed him back to america after theyd both graduated she talked of the luck theyd had in his getting a position with the downtown law firm on th street and of her own matching good fortune in getting a placelow in the pecking order at firstin the middle east division at georgetown university where she was now a senior lecturer in middle eastern studies there was no warning she said bitterly nothing and hed always been so fit hed always worked out in england and he jogged when we came back here and we played tennis most weekends in the summer it was just tiredness at first and we didnt think anything of it because he was working so hard trying to prove himself in a new job but it got worse and then he started to lose a lot of weight janet gulped at her drink needing a break in the narrative did you know there isnt any pain with cancer of the liver sheridan shook his head that was another obscenity along with so much else she said he just faded away literally every day he seemed to get smaller like he was collapsing inside which he was i guess we tried everything of course went to all the experts about a transplant which they said wasnt possible because it had been discovered too late to prevent the spread i said i still wanted it done and they said he was too weak by then that he could not withstand the shock of surgery she drank again so we just waited that was the worst part the thing i couldnt take the helplessness just having to wait and accept there was nothing i could do nothing that anyone could do my mother came across towards the end and we just sat around and watched that was all we could do can you imagine what that was like no said the man i dont think i can do you want to hear something ridiculous janet stretched out both hands palms upwards and said when he was so wasted away that i could pick him up like this like a baby i decided it wasnt going to happen i convinced myself that it was going to go away as quickly as it had come and that he was going to get better again and we were going to go on just like we were before have the baby wed talked about and that he would start his own law firm which was another plan make a lot of money so we could move to chevy chase janet laughed bitterly can you imagine that on the day he died the friday i couldnt cry because i was too angry i told my mother thered been a mistake she gave another humorless headshaking laugh unable to believe it herself but you didnt go back to england janet looked up at the man caught by how quick he was how direct she nodded and said my family wanted me to wanted me to get a job at a university or an institute there put america behind me i almost went but then i thought about it and somehow it seemed like giving up does that sound funny maybe sheridan said maybe not anyway she said with forced briskness i didnt go and here i am and thats it the story of janet stone they looked at each other for several moments and then sheridan said i cant think of anything to say that wouldnt sound trite thanks for not trying said janet she was abruptly astonished at herself she hadnt talked to anyone like this not to harriet and not even she didnt think to her mother was it because he was a stranger someone completely uninvolved and unaffected she felt embarrassed but not she realized in further surprise anything else no ache at the memories no pain the feeling of embarrassment worsened do you want another drink asked sheridan no thank you she said at once was that why shed talked so much because of the whisky of course not she said you go ahead if you want one no he said im fine he looked around them and then out into the street have you eaten georgetown seems to have cornered the market in restaurants no thank you shed done enough said enough this was an early outing after all ok he smiled his crooked smile at her openfaced and said i guess its time to go then i guess so she said outside the street was again completely devoid of taxis isnt it always the way he shrugged like i said it wont take long to pick one up my car really is close said sheridan practically at the junction of dumbarton and wisconsin janet looked unsuccessfully in every direction and then said that would be kind it was a volkswagen a beetle an inconspicuous gray car matching the inconspicuous man although it was dark there was sufficient light from the wisconsin avenue illumination for janet to see the interior was immaculate and very clean where to he said rosslyn janet began worrying as they drove over key bridge trying to push the concern away by the reassurance of the evening so far there had not been any furtive handontheknee myplaceoryours nonsense hed actually held back at every opportunity so it would be overreacting to become frightened now janet recognized in a further revelation of the evening she was in a situation she didnt know how to handle had forgotten how to handle for as long as she seemed able to remember hank had always been with her always there controlling everything and keeping her safe but hank wasnt here any more and she was being driven back to an obviously empty apartment by a man she knew only by nameif that was his real nameand a vague reference to the state department the apprehension began to burn through her and she felt the perspiration wet on her face and wetter still on her back she shifted in her seat edging closer to the passenger door whats the matter sheridan asked conscious of her movement nothing janet felt stupid childlike youll have to guide me he said as they crossed the parkway into rosslyn she directed him to the apartments at radnor heights her uncertainty increased when he opened his door as he turned off the engine walking around the front of the volkswagen to let her out momentarily janet hesitated and then swung herself from the vehicle her apartment was in the first of a matching block of three each with its wide openplanned vestibule before the elevator bank screened first by the doorman and then by a security clerkcumtelephonist behind the mail counter janet walked with her hands tight beside her knowing what she was expected to say but unsure whether she could bring herself to say it she stopped just before the main entrance turning to face him making him stop too sheridan kept a distance between them would you like to come in for a drink she said with great effort no thank you he said at once janet just stopped herself from blurting out her surprise instead she said i enjoyed the evening the last part anyway thanks for saving me from the party i enjoyed it as well i think we saved each other good night then she said hoping he would not try to kiss her good night he said making no move ill stay here until youre safely inside which he did janet looked back as she entered the elevator and he was still there and when she entered her fifthfloor apartment at the front of the building she went immediately to the window and stared down there was no sign of the unobtrusive man or his unobtrusive car neither in the parking lot nor in either direction on the passing road john sheridan seemed able to disappear as easily as he materialized he had not asked for her telephone number janet realized or if he could see her again she did not know what she would have said if hed suggested either it was an established ritualone of the few outings she allowed herselffor them to have sunday brunch at the american cafe on the hill but janet half expected harriet to call off pleading the previous nights party but she didnt she was late though as usual she flustered in fast enough to create a breeze in her wake not pausing to be shown her seat because she was confident janet would have gotten their customary table close to the wall at the back harriet was wearing buttonfly jeans and loafers and a poncho and her hair was still bubbled as it had been the previous night her face was scrubbed completely clean of makeup harrriet was talking before she actually sat down a breathless litany of whod screwed whom and who hadnt screwed whom and whod been caught and whod got away with it she complained that someone called jake or geoff she wasnt sure which had been a disaster and couldnt get it up and tried to blame the booze but said she didnt think it was booze at all but that hed been a momentarily reluctant gay trying to pretend that he wasnt can you imagine it an experiment to prove his fucking manhood literally at my own party i think youre silly taking the risks you do they both ordered eggs benedict and bloody marys and harriet said i dont too many insisted janet you dont even know his name for christs sake what if he is gay or bisexual believe me darling said harriet the only thing i risked catching last night was a cold hanging around waiting for something to happen that never did i still think youre mad you should see the house it looks like the red army went through in a hurry without saying excuse me would you like me to come back to help this afternoon asked janet the lecture was still only halfwritten she remembered forget it harriet said mrs barrett comes in tomorrow ill slip her an extra ten dollars harriet worked as a senior administrative assistant for a virginia senator who thought an englishwoman on his staff conveyed the impression of european culture and indicated an awareness of international affairs janet wondered if her friends brittleness were necessary for the job politely she said i thought it was a great party they held back for the drinks to be replaced and harriet said you ducked it without saying goodbye i didnt think youd miss me and i didnt duck it i was there for over an hour well well what what happened thats well what janet was conscious of blushing positively redfaced she hadnt thought harriet had seen her leave we had a drink thats all harriet reached across the table covering janets hand with hers darling she said this isnt headmistresss question time i think its wonderful you found a guy and had a drink its about time theres no reason to get embarrassed janet smiled and said i just dont find it easy youre going to have to learn my love life goes on but yours hasnt for far too long youre so vulnerableso innocentit almost hurts youre like a virgin in a whorehouse i worry about you crossing roads how recently would remarks like that have irritated her wondered janet unperturbed she said how well do you know him not at all he mean anything to you of course not said janet ok so i can be honest i thought he was a boring asshole he spent all night propping up the wall with one drink in his hand talking to no one like me thought janet did harriet andrew secretly think she was a boring asshole too janet said his names john sheridan that much i know and hes not really boring janet added defensively sorry said harriet archly stretching the word like elastic why did you invite him if you dont like him a research assistant on the senators staff knows him they belong to some racquet club or something said harriet staring into her glass as if she were surprised to find its contents gone i wanted to make the numbers match and told this guy to bring another man his choice was sheridan a mistake that wont be repeated she smiled celibate women like us need alternatives im going to have another how about you janet shook her head ill pass he said he worked in state harriet was screwed around in her seat trying to catch the waitresss eye something like that she said succeeding in her attempt and turning back to the table and dont ask because i dont know if hes married or not he said hes not janet remembered but it doesnt matter whether he is or he isnt does it thats what they all say darling harriet said cynically but no if it doesnt matter it doesnt matter cheers janet consciously let the conversation move away from john sheridan harriet was organizing part of the senators staff to visit nato headquarters in brussels and she gabbled on about the clothes she was having to buy and of the hopedfor sideways trip to paris and said wouldnt it be terrific if they could meet up in london when janet made her twiceyearly visit to her parents and janet agreed it would but warned she had not made any definite travel plans at the moment she joined harriet with another bloody mary and offered again to help clean up the dumbarton street house and harriet waved away the suggestion as she had before it was almost three oclock before they got up to leave harriet snatching up the bill and refusing any contribution from janet outside they walked without any intentional direction towards the capitol building what are you going to do for the rest of the day asked harriet ive got a lecture to finish off for tomorrow much an hour or two maybe you can always make up a couple of hours urged harriet why dont we take in a movie maybe a drink afterwards you can work later janet shook her head you know how it is her friend sighed in reply the dedicated janet stone pillar of washington academia i like always being on top of things said janet defensive again you know that you sure you get sufficient recognition for all you do at that damned university yes said janet and it isnt a damned university its got very high standards shed worked as determinedly when hank was aliveanxious then for the promotion and extra money that was so important for their plansand now she needed the timeconsuming afterhours preparation work and the difficulty with students and being imposed upon for opinions by other middle east lecturers to block out the sterility of the other parts of her life the capitol dome was very clear now starkly white and almost artificial in its perfection more like a decoration than the seat of the most powerful legislature in the world with your ability and qualifications you could get a hell of a job there harriet said gesturing towards the administration building ever thought about it no said janet why dont you youd probably double your salary im happy enough where i am said janet and safe she thought no longer being safeno longer having someone she could completely rely on to protect and take care of herhad been one of janets worst and most persistent fears after hanks death and secretlyso secretly that shed admitted it to no oneit still was she kept the rosslyn apartment despite its painful memories because she felt safe and cocooned in it and it was the need for such a feeling that had been her major reason for resisting her parents demands that she return to england she wanted always now to be with things and in places that were familiar safe like hideaway holes harriet smiled sideways you want me to ask around ask about what john sheridan who props up walls and nurses one drink dont be ridiculous janet said as forcefully as she could i had a drink with a shy man a lonely man lonely like me ok no drama no nothing just that what happened after the drink less than happened with your starchfree gay he didnt make a pass no ask for your number no ask if he could see you again no harriet sighed heavily isnt life sometimes a bucket of shit yes janet agreed more often than not life is a bucket of shit they stopped by the side of the enormous building able from the top of the hill to gaze out over washington and its orderly patterns of grassed malls and reflecting pools and museums and monolithic monuments to past presidents i really could get you fixed up with a terrific job harriet said ill stay where i am for how long janet wondered forever why not there was nothing else for her to do you sure about that movie positive call me during the week you know i will it took janet little over an hour to complete the lebanese lecture and she was pleased with the way it went the following day a teaching assistant named barnett whod come close to making a pass several times asked her to go over his masters thesis which she agreed to do although she knew it was a ploy giving them time together the thesis was weak and badly arguedhe actually predicted the israelis might agree to surrender the occupied bank and the gaza strip which janet dismissed as ridiculously naiveand she told him so hoping the rejection would go beyond the academic paper that week a letter arrived from her parents who lived in sussex asking when she intended to visit they planned to take a long tour through egypt and the sudan and saudi arabia in each of which her father had served and they did not want the dates to clash she replied that she wasnt sure yet so why didnt they make their arrangements and she would fit in whenever she had dinner with harriet one night and brunch with her as usual the following sunday and the week after that went with harriet to garfinkels and to the georgetown mall setting up for harriets trip to europe prompted by the shopping expedition she thought about buying a winter coat in the sales but decided against it because it was too soon in the year and shed be gettting the previous autumns style anyway her cat george developed a dry cough and she had to take it to the vet who said it was easily treated this time but warned her that it was six years old sundays were lonely like all the other days in the week with harriet away she got cards from bonn dullsville and berlin super janet was marking papers in the rosslyn apartment on a wednesday evening when the telephone rang and momentarily she frowned at it curiously because she got so few calls i dont know if you remember me the voice said its john sheridan i remember janet said j anets collapse into complete and abject despondency had come the day after the funeral when shed finally accepted hanks death shed refused to get out of bed or to bathewash evenor to eat most of all she had refused to eat and when her mother warned that unless she did she would cause herself harm the idea of committing suicide settled in janets mind for several days she lay curled beneath the covers with her knees up under her chin very calmly planning how to do it shed bought a lot of painkillers when hanks cancer had first been diagnosed scouring magazines for every brand name and every formula to find the maximum strength she thought would be necessary not realizing there would be no pain and stupidly imagining she might find something better than the doctors would prescribe if there were and they were all still in the bathroom cabinet shed been very confident about how easy it would be she planned to respond to her mothers urging to take a bath actually letting it run while she started swallowing the pills slowly and carefully because she did not want to vomit and spoil everything when the bath was ready she was going to get in with the bottles where she just had to reach out to go on willing herself to fight against the initial sensation of unconsciousness and to continue swallowing to ensure she took enough to die and not just lapse into a drugged sleep from which she could be resuscitated if they got to her in time her mother had smiled gratefully and helped her from her disheveled bed and janet had forced herself not to think of the anguish she was going to cause the woman sure her own anguish was greater she said she felt a lot better and was going to take a long soak to avoid her mother becoming alarmed and forcing her way in before the pills had time to work immediately inside the bathroom janet had pressed back against the locked door not frightened at all her feeling rather one of impatience to get started in a hurry to die from outside her mother asked if she was all right and janet called back that she was turning the taps on in further reassurance and then shed opened the bathroom cabinet to find every pill bottle gone the frustration had whimpered through her as she scrabbled through what remained thinking they might be hidden by something else and then whimpered again at the awareness that her mother had cleared them out her mother called again and janet made a sound back slumping on the bath edge emptied so completely she was unable even to think the bathroom was small and mirrored to make it seem bigger and when janet had finally looked up to turn off the water before it overflowed the bath edge her instant and absurd reaction had been to wonder whose reflection she was seeing the shock at realizing it was herself actually made her gasp janet had always been fastidious even at boarding school before going up to oxford the girl whose dormitory place was never disarranged and whose drawers were always allocated item for item and whose shoes were always clean and whose hair was always neatly held and clipped and whose uniform was never stained or torn or borrowed or lost she wasor had been until that momentphysically uncomfortable with untidiness and dirt and neglect her first thought was that hank would have been disgusted with her because he had been as meticulous as she was that she was letting him down her hairwhich was naturally red and which shed hated at boarding school because it was so different from the other girls and which shed only really come to like after hank had told her it was beautifulwas matted and tangled straggled around her face which looked appalling she was gaunt from not eating and not sleeping the sallow skin strained over her high cheekbones and her green but now blank eyes deeply sunk into blackened surrounds it was already the face of a dead person and then she thought again that she was letting hank down and determined abruptly at that moment not to give up not to die inherent though it already was taking care of herself became privately something she did for hank for his memory like other private and secret things like sometimes when she was sure she was quite alone talking aloud as if he could hear her imagining what he would say back she did it now when she was almost ready you dont mind do you she said staring at her own reflection in the full length mirror knowing what the answer would be he hadnt known how to be jealous not from the moment theyd first met and not because he didnt care but because he trusted her completely only going out for the evening she said thats all just dinner you know that dont you of course you do the fuller looser shirt with the jacket on top was better janet concluded shed matched a sweater with the checked skirt first but when shed examined herself half turning sideways she thought it looked as if she was trying to make her breasts obvious and she didnt want to do that she considered wearing her hair loose the way hank had liked it best but quickly corrected that too pulling it back away from her face and twisting it into a chignon the style meant she had to wear earrings she chose gold studs to accompany the single gold chain but no other jewelry she wore her engagement and wedding rings of course promptly at six the time theyd agreed the security clerk buzzed to say sheridan was in the foyer and janet said she would be down at once shed considered inviting him up for a drink remaining unsure even while she was dressing before dismissing the idea as a mistake like wearing the sweater sheridan asked if there was any place she would like to go and janet said no shed leave it up to him expecting hed choose somewhere in town instead he drove out into virginia to a beamed and roughstone inn proudly proclaiming its one hundred and twenty year history there was a log fire in the open hearth and they ate oysters and fresh trout and drank a frenchbottled sancerre janet found it as easy to talk to him as she had the night of their escape from the party when he said he had worked for a while out of the american embassy in cairo she asked if hed known her father who had been third secretary at the british legation there but the postings had not been contemporary because it was her subject and from the talk of egypt she thought he might have an interest she asked him what he thought about the lebanon and he said it seemed a completely lost and collapsed country about iran sheridan said he didnt have any positive idea either but he thought another sort of revolution was possible after the death of the ayatollah khomeini she asked how it had been possible for america to have been so wrongfooted about the overthrow of the shah and then so helpless after the seizure of the us embassy hostages in teheran and he said he didnt know but agreed with her that it had been incredibly inept on the way back towards washington sheridan said hed enjoyed the evening and janet agreed that she had too considering and once more dismissing the idea of inviting him in for a drink when he stopped the car outside the apartment he asked if he could call her again and she said of course and he let her out as he had before but made no attempt to kiss her when she looked down from her apartment window hed vanished again sheridan called the same week to invite her to a performance of the taming of the shrew that the touring english shakespearean company was giving at the kennedy center that evening she did suggest his coming in when they got back to rosslyn sheridan drank coffee and brandy and looked at her bookshelves and said paul scott and graham greene were two of his favorite english authors too he enquired if she liked updike and janet said not much and asked him if hed ever read anything by le carre or deighton sheridan replied that he didnt enjoy espionage fiction again he left without trying to kiss her janet confessed the outings to harriet at that sundays brunch and harriet said why the hell not and when they met later in the week harriet admitted quizzing her friend on the senators staff whod originally invited sheridan to the party the man knew nothing at all about sheridan except that he was a higher than average squash player generous without being stupid in the clubhouse afterwards never made passes at other guys wives or girlfriends and never talked about himself janet remarked unthinkingly that sheridan hadnt made a pass at her either and harriet suggested that maybe he was gay to which janet replied that was more harriets problem than hers because she wasnt interested anyway harriet said oh yeah janet felt a jump of excitement in immediately recognizing sheridans voice on the next call which she answered hoping it would be him that time they went to the national theater downtown afterwards they had drinks at the restored willard where he recounted the names of the presidents whod used it in the past and how the word lobbying had originated there to describe the favorseekers waylaying president grant and later still they ate in chinatown janet deferring to sheridans obvious knowledge of a sichuan menu he seemed to expect to come up to the apartment that night and the conversation was almost stilted there developed an odd difficultyan unspoken anticipationbetween them and janet became apprehensive which she neednt have been when he got up to go after finishing the brandy he merely leaned forward and kissed her cheek which she offered and this time she watched from the window as he drove off in the volkswagen confidently alone in the apartment she said dont think badly darling its just that i feel so very alone onceaweek meetings became twice a week and when the weather got better he took her to the yacht basin on the alexandria side of the potomac and they went sailing in his boat which was not white fiberglass and gleaming chrome like most of the others but fatbellied and clinkerbuilt in wood sheridan sailed as he appeared to do everything else with quiet undemonstrative competence that first time janet was uncertain because sailing had never been something she did but with sheridan she immediately felt safe they started sailing every weekend he the patient instructor janet the eager student she was apprehensive again when he suggested going away for an entire weekend casting off on saturday and tying up overnight somewhere on the chesapeake bay he kissed her differently now but had not suggestedor attempted to doanything more and janet was unsure how she would feel if he did yet again her fears were unfounded there was only one cabin the bunks on either side and when she went below she saw there were single sleeping bags laid out on each that night without any discussion he let her go in first to undress and get into bed before he followed the season was right and so one sunday sheridan took her to a crab feast in a weathered unprepossessing wooden restaurant where the waitress tore brown paper from a roll to form a tablecloth and sheridan warned her they were expected to eat with their fingers they drank beer from a pitcher and sheridan taught her how to dismember the small crabs her fingers and face became sticky from the flavoring salt and janet realized surprised that she was thinking of nothing beyond what she was doing and the person with whom she was doing it she couldnt remember being so happy for a very long time afterwards after the disaster when she reflected upon everything that had happened between them janet calculated that to be the precise moment she had fallen in love with john sheridan although of course that was not her awareness then it was a month after the crab feast that they made love it was a friday night and they had been out to the virginia restaurant to which he had taken her on their first date afterwards hed come up to the apartment for brandy which had become the custom he had one drink which was all he ever allowed himself and then he said i suppose i should be going posing it as a question which he never had before i suppose you should janet said making it sound like a question too not knowing whether she had intended it that way or not sheridan remained sitting across from her gazing at her and janet held his eyes unmoving as well sheridan said i dont want to no said janet as if she were agreeing to something they had already discussed she waited for the nervousness that she expected but nothing came she tried not to be so stiff and awkward embarrassed at herself but he was gentle and kind coaxing her to relax and eventually she did relax although not on that first occasion as much as she was able to later sheridan was as competent as a lover as he appeared to be about everything else despite her tenseness bringing her to a climax as he climaxed himself and then slowly leading her down from the peak of her excitement they lay entwined for a long time afterwards unspeaking sheridan soothing his hand along her face eventually he said i dont want this to spoil how it was before with us it wont you sure janet wasnt not then i dont think so sorry i dont know she answered honestly not yet janet soon became sure there were nights when they did not see each other but increasingly few it was several weeks after that first occasion before they slept at his apartment a conversion in an old building off columbus circle janet went curiously unsure what to expect immediately conscious of his extreme neatness one wall of the main room and three of a spare room were lined with books a lot in french and italian languages which she had not known until then that he could speak there were some ornaments which she recognized to be egyptian and a lot of other foreign souvenirs sheridan identified some as aztec from a posting to mexico and there were some inca figures from a period hed spent in peru and which he said obviously werent originals but copies about two hundred years old janet was intrigued by a crossbow and a heavily decorated knife which did not seem to fit sheridan told her they were montagnard and she learned for the first time that he had been attached to the american embassy in saigon but before it really became the mess that it ended it was on that initial visit to columbus circle that janet discovered he could cook sheridan prepared chinese food better than she had tasted in any washington restaurant even the beijinggovernment supported one in midtown and janet said dont tell me youve worked in china as well sheridan laughed and said no and i dont intend to my days of overseas postings are over im strictly a headquarters guy now janet told harriet of course and was apprehensive of the first meal the three of them had together but sheridan made a particular effort obviously charming harriet maintaining a stream of anecdotes some of which were amusing and others hilarious that sunday when they brunched together harriet said darling im abject i take back everything i ever said hes wonderful when you get fed up with him give him my number im not going to get fed up with him replied janet her parents letters to her outnumbered janets to them there were repeated assurances of how pleased they were and how much they wanted to meet him and demands to know all about him which janet tried to satisfy but her answers always seemed to prompt fresh questions the virginia inn became their favorite their special place and it was there just over a year after their first meal that sheridan said ive got something to ask you what will you marry me janet sat unmoving unthinking aware only of a bizarre sensation of hollowness and sheridan misunderstood her silence he blurted im sorry i shouldnt have asked but she spoke at last cutting him off oh yes darling she said yes please the following evening was one of the nights they did not spend together and abruptly without consciously imagining hank janet embarked on one of her lonely conversations with her dead husband something she had not done for a long time dont hate me darling she said ill always love you of course but i so much need someone to care to love to be safe with i t was inevitable of course that janet should compare the preparations for her wedding to john sheridan with those for her wedding to hank and she was secretly uncomfortable that this time there seemed to be more excitement and anticipation her memories of the first relationship and the first marriage were that everything had happened gradually almost without planning or arrangement her recollection was that they paired up at university without any positive decision to go together and that it had then seemed natural but not overly dramatic to move in with hank in oxford and natural again when he suggested she come over to america to visit his nowdead parents by which time the eventual marriage was an obvious and unavoidable culmination of everything everyonetheir friends and their familieswould have been shocked if it hadnt happened as they themselves would have been janet could not actually recall hank asking her to be his wife without her being able to pinpoint the moment their conversation had suddenly become about what they would do and how they would do it and where they would do it when they were married almost as if the actual nuptial had been decided upon by other people who knew best and all they had to do was comply this time was quite different harriet was the first person she toldahead of her parentsand harriet whooped her instant agreement to be janets maid of honor and immediately bustled in to take over the arrangements together they bought every fashion book and wedding magazine they could find to choose the absolutely right gown for janet and the absolutely right gown for harriet still undecided about either they extended their reading to house publications after sheridan said he wanted to sell both their apartments and buy a house whose location and furnishing and fittings were to be entirely her choice the day after sheridan told her that janet put her name on the mailing list of every agent in washington and the immediate suburbs sheridan had laid the boat up for the winter so every weekend they scurried around maryland and virginia in the volkswagen assessing distances and convenience and prices her parents foreshortened their trip to the middle east and flew directly from cairo to washington to meet sheridan janet was more nervous of that encounter than she had been about the meeting with harriet but once again as they always seemed to be her fears were unfounded sheridans effort was not so obvious to janet as it had been with harriet but the impression upon her parents was the same if not better janets mother was clearly surprised and delighted that until their marriage they were maintaining separate homes a reaction which janet found curious since her openly living with hank had brought no criticism the fact meant of course that her parents could stay with her and on the night of their arrival she introduced sheridan simply over early evening drinks to enable the elderly couple to recover from their jet lag the following night sheridan took them out to the virginia inn when they went to the restroom janets mother said she thought he was an extremely pleasant manwhich for janets mother was a high accoladeand much later after sheridan left the rosslyn apartment after his usual solitary brandy her mother said she was very happy that janet was getting together with such a nice man and her father admitted to being impressed with sheridan in every way he added that sheridan appeared extremely knowledgeable about a wide spectrum of international affairs including the middle east from his career her father regarded himself as something of a middle east specialist janet remarked that it was hardly surprising considering that sheridan was a state department analyst and her father said hed met dozens of state department personnel including supposed analysts whose grasp was very weak hed tried hard to find people who knew sheridan at various embassy postings but there hadnt been a single one which the old man regretted he told his daughter he intended asking around at the next reunion they like you janet reported to sheridan when they were by themselves i like them sheridan said mothers campaigning for the wedding to be in england why not what about your friends wont it be difficult for them sheridan shrugged there are none close enough to worry about and theres no family to ferry across youre sure tell her its fine i love you said janet i love you he said her parents visit lasted a week and by the end janet believed sheridan and her father to be firm friends before they left theyd agreed on having the ceremony in england in march which gave janet and sheridan five months to decide upon a house dispose of their own apartments and make the purchase throughout janet remained working at georgetown university from which she called him most days because it was difficult for him to get her when she was in class it was often a problem for her to reach him at the state department too there was usually a connection delay when she mentioned it to him sheridan agreed it was a nuisance but explained he spent more time in committee meetings verbally analyzing situations and events than at his desk working on papers and reports their concentration span is limited he said mockingly theyd rather hear opinions than be forced to read an assessment i think its all the fault of television a hundred years from now no one will be able to read at christmas during the university break sheridan had time owing for a holiday when janet suggested it he said he thought it would be terrific to spend the time in england with her parents janet wrote suggesting it and her mother was so excited that she telephoned i never thought i could be like this again janet said to harriet not this happy they were having an early dinner in chinatown so it was still only ten oclock when janet got back to rosslyn sheridan who had had a key to her apartment for several months was waiting as she entered sitting forward on a couch gravefaced janet was stopped by his expression remaining just inside the door darling she said what is it ive been posted said sheridan overseas but started janet confused where overseas she managed beirut he announced simply janet stayed where she was her mind and body frozen into incomprehension the images and the thoughts flustered through her head all halfformed and refusing to become whole not beirut that was inconceivable thered been us embassy bombings by suicide squads and the kidnapping of us embassy staff and reagans irangate fiasco and the apparently insoluble conflict between christian and moslem formed part of practically every lecture that she gave at the university john sheridan her john sheridancouldnt go there couldnt become involved in a situation like that it was murderous for gods sake people had been murdered janet shook her head disbelieving despite having heard him say it she said no no its got to be a mistake sheridan stood and came to her holding her to him without knowing why janet was rigid almost resisting sheridan said i dont want to go you know that who would ive tried to get out of it but i cant janet pulled back from his embrace but you told me a long time ago that you werent going to travel any more that you were always going to be here in washington i know he agreed i thought i was they think i might be some use there no she wailed finally confronting what he was saying sheridan led her into the room and sat her where he had been sitting kneeling at her feet shush now he said now listen theres no way i can get out of it like i said ive tried no way but it wont be for a long time six months a year at most janet sat shaking her head consciouslydeterminedlyrefusing to absorb the words its an unaccompanied posting obviously i couldnt take you with me even if we rushed the marriage through sheridan pushed on but we wont be apart all the time we can spend our vacations together cyprus anywhere you like in the mediterranean but weve made plans she said in weak protest itll only mean delaying things a few months assured sheridan i promise as soon as im reassignedand dont worry the time limit is a firm commitmentwell get married thats all it means really putting the wedding back a month or two thats not all it means janet argued recovering further youre going to beirut for christs sake beirut you hear the name im saying we keep everything there as safe as it can be now sheridan tried to placate her no one takes any chances bullshit yelled janet and you know its bullshit how can you be safe in a place where theres no law no government beirut is a bunch of rival gangs everyone fighting everyone else and stealing and kidnapping and killing its not religion any more hasnt been for a long time its gang warfare ive taught little else for years and i know she had to stop breathless but then blurted off again extending her fingers and then collapsing them as she counted william buckley american murdered peter kilburn american murdered alec collet briton murdered i know he tried to stop her but she wouldnt stop seven slaughtered in all she said four russsians too at least seventeen still held nothings been heard of terry anderson the ap bureau chief since terry waite the archbishop of canterburys envoy has been missing almost two years ive got to go he said simply no way of refusing she pleaded none when she said dully two weeks two weeks everything is being done in panic thats not fair not enough time it gives me an edge to get back why when everything was so good janet demanded allowing herself the briefly forgotten selfpity itll be all right sheridan said everything will be all right they changed their vacation dates so they could spend the final week completely together which they did at the rosslyn apartment they stored what furniture and effects he wanted to retain from the columbus circle flat and sold the rest and sheridan assigned janet power of attorney to act on his behalf to dispose of the property they drove again out into virginia and maryland househunting but it was impossible in the circumstances so they abandoned the pretence they made love every night but anxiously as if it might be the last time and when he suggested a farewell dinner at their virginia inn janet said no because that was a place to celebrate good times not bad theres something we havent done sheridan announced the night before he was due to leave what i havent bought you a ring he said janet looked down at the hand where she still wore what hank had bought her no she agreed it isnt right to go on like this is it as she spoke janet realized that to remove the rings would be the final cutting off the final parting from one to another they only had time to get to two shops but in the second janet saw a sapphire surrounded by diamonds and said it was beautiful then tried to pull back when she learned the price sheridan insisted on buying it and she sat for their final lunch with her hand before them proudly displaying it i love you said sheridan i love you too you mustnt worry everything is going to be fine he said trust me i do said janet j anet had forgotten the aching loneliness and when it immediately returned that positive physical feeling shed never wanted to know ever again she was surprisedand vaguely embarrassedhow easy it had been to put from her mind the first echoing night she came close to embarking on one of her private conversations but quickly and determinedly stopped herself that indulgencethat needwas over she thought gazing down at the new engagement ring it was john now not hank wrong then to talk about one to the other even secretly when no one else would ever know everything was different now like the loss was different with hank when shed eventually confronted reality it had been absolute final finish but not this time this time it was only a separationan unwanted intrusive resented irritating separationbut no more than that a separation john could come back would come back a lot of women temporarily lost their men in situations like this although perhaps not in places as dangerous as beirut she had to be logical about it logical and sensible she had to stop behaving like a spoiled child janet tried hard work was still the obvious blanket and she wrapped herself in it beyond her customary dedication and studied beyond that dedication reading everything and watching everything and listening to everything connected with the lebanon as a whole and beirut in particular her assessment was that it was as lawless and as ungoverned and dangerous as shed declared it to be the night of sheridans announcement that he was going there but janet consciously opposed the depression separation nothing more before hed left sheridan had explained the correspondence procedure providing her with the specific state department address in washington through which their letters could be channeled in the embassys diplomatic bag which resulted always in an unusually quick and reassuring exchange better than any normal mail service his letters touched upon the destruction of the city and the difficulty of civil control but never in detail an attempt not to avoid the obvious but not to worry her either janet outwrote sheridan sometimes despatching as many as three letters a week she related a great deal from what she was studying with increased interest about the lebanon and she recounted the gossip of washington and she gave practically an hourbyhour account of what she did and how she felt every day always repeatedly she told sheridan how much she loved him there was never a letter from sheridan without the same assurance apart from her sunday brunches with harriet househunting occupied much of her weekends and provided more material for the letters after two months janet was shown a brick colonial she instantly adored just over the dc border into maryland with a chevy chase address it had only been on the agents books for three days and janet was frightened of losing it so she took a chance and on the spot handed over a nonreturnable deposit that night she sent sheridan all the photographs and the brochure together with her own excited plea that it was the best house she had ever seen in her entire life and could they have it please because of the diplomatic routing his reply came within the week sheridan thought the agents house looked great and was sure that if she liked it he would too and said he wanted her to go ahead and secure the property contingent on the sale of his apartment and included an authorization notarized by an embassy lawyer giving her similar attorney power to take to his bank for the mortgage to be arranged janet at once secured the contract the sellers were a charming pentagonretiring colonel and his wife fleeing the east coast winters to california who said she could come in any time irrespective of the legal exchanges to measure and to plan her own fittings two couples were interested in sheridans apartment she asked the agent to put pressure on them to act janet made two visits to the chevy chase house on each of which harriet accompanied her janet did not intend any major structural alterations not even in the kitchen so there was no need for any extensive measuring but at harriets urging janet decided upon color changes in practically every room which meant some tape measure work where she decided to recarpet and again at the windows where she was going to hang new drapes the activity occupied janetan inner lining to the work blanketand her late shopping evenings and weekends were filled with visits to furnishing departments and making comparisons between the best deals that each offered although it was never demandednever hinted atby sheridan janet determined to get the best for the least to prove to him that she was not profligate despite her reaction to the tooexpensive sapphire and diamond ring sheridans apartment was sold then lawyers at sheridans bank wanted to check directly with sheridan about his power of attorney for the house purchase despite already having the legally sworn deposition from the lebanon janet said of course and by using the diplomatic channel the confirmation came back from beirut in five days im sorry the bank executive said we want always to be sure i understand assured janet that night in the third letter of that week janet wrote that everything had been finalized and that the purchase was expected to be completed in six weeks which was perfect timing for the carpet fitters and curtain hangers to move in to get everything ready sheridans letter by returnjust four dayswas the one for which janet had been waiting from the moment of his going to the middle east it began beguilingly responding to what she had written and saying that he was delighted and that he was sure the house was going to be wonderful he could hardly wait sheridan said and then wrote that he was not going to have to wait much longerneither of them werebecause hed been officially notified that the date of his return was may which was just three and a half months away or put another way not more than six weeks beyond the originally chosen wedding date why didnt she sheridan demanded start sending out the invitations and warn her parents to rearrange the wedding for some convenient date after the twentyfourth janet called harriet and then her parents in london and that night sat with a celebration glass of brandy in one hand cradling george with her other watching the evening news which it had become her unthinking habit to do since sheridans assignment there is a topofthehour development which we will update during the course of this program announced anchorman tom brokaw there has been another american embassy kidnap in beirut the victim has been confirmed as john patrick sheridan aged the screen was filled with a stilted fullfaced photograph tonight nbc has confirmed through washington sources that sheridan was the cia officer in charge oh no said janet dear god no j anets immediate crowded impression was that she had been betrayed cheated that for all these months she had gone with a man and slept with a man and learned to love a man whom she thought she knew and now realized she knew not at all as always she found it easy to remember words and phrases in the tone in which they had been uttered and sheridans remark forced its way mockingly into her mind the plea hed made the night hed told her of the beirut posting trust me hed said and she had not just then but before trusted him completely believed that he was a senior but otherwise runofthemill analyst in the anthill of the state department unimportant uninvolved with that reflection came more taunting words nothing spooky about me not much she thought bitterly not bloody much janet blinked against her fogged vision aware of library footage of the shellcratered streets of west beirut being put up on the screen with brokaws voice commenting over no official confirmation of his cia position intoned the anchorman but the official diplomatic listing records sheridan to be a political officer janet sucked the breath into her body conscious of the significance before it was made obvious as another picture was flashed on to the screen a still photograph this time of a hollowfaced bearded man political officer was the designation of william buckley recounted the newscaster buckley it will be recalled was the cia station chief in beirut who was kidnapped and murdered by the islamic jihad in march the very name shed identified to john the night hed made the beirut announcement janet knew about the buckley case knew how a tape of buckleys agonizing screaming torture had been made and sent to the cia in direct challenge to the agency who had taken it as a challenge there had never been a denial from the cia headquarters at langley or the reagan administration that the buckley tape had so disgusted and frightened cia director william casey that he had personally urged upon the president the hostage freeing attempts that were later to emerge as irangate the photographs were side by side on the screen now sheridan and buckley and illogically janet thought how ordinary they both looked just ordinary open american faces runofthemill she reflected again it was the briefest of considerations because abruptly horrifyingly there was another too vivid intrusion janet pictured what had happened to buckley and imagined it happening now at this moment to sheridan in some cellar or cell or lonely house she physically squeezed her eyes shut against the mental picture and the mental sounds and clamped her mouth closed too until she could keep her lips together no longer dont let him be hurt she begged dear god dont let him be hurt janet was distantly aware of a sound beyond the television and recognized the telephone but could not move herself to respond to it almost at once there was another bell the downstairs summons this time and janet shifted at last momentarily unsure which to answer she chose the intercom and at once harriets voice babbled into her ear demanding to be let in automatically janet pressed the release button and unlatched the door careless of leaving it open she turned back to the strident telephone but as she moved towards it the ringing stopped janet remained gazing down at it wondering who it had been harriet burst into the apartment in her usual flurry throwing her arms around janet and said i came as soon as i heard thanks said janet dully harriets was the sort of remark people made after a bad accident or a bereavement maybe she thought it was fitting what have you been told demanded harriet janet indicated the television now showing some baby cream commercial just that no ones called janet had not until now considered any official notification she looked again to the telephone and said i didnt get to it in time how long have you known pressed harriet i just told you began janet but the other woman talked over her impatiently about john being in the cia i mean i didnt she admitted simply not a clue nothing i thought he worked in the state department like i told you another recollection came to janet as she talked of the invariable delay in reaching sheridan when shed called the office number hed given her she supposed it would have been some complicated switching device transferring the calls from foggy bottom to to where something else she didnt know she accepted even where he worked his voice came into her mind once more the glib easy explanation when shed complained of the difficulty in reaching him i spend more time verbally analyzing situations than working at my desk id heard thats the way it was but i never really believed it said harriet the way it was wives and girlfriends never ever being told always a secret said harriet janet realized annoyed that her friend was excited enjoying it all would sheridan have told her after their marriage janet supposed officially he would have been forbidden to tell her anything janet said its very serious you dont have to tell me that darling assured harriet dont you think i dont know what youre going through no thought janet despite trying so hard harriet had not been able to begin to imagine what it had been like with hank slowly dying and she would not be able to begin to imagine what it was like now no one could more to herself than to her friend janet said if i had known it might have been better i might have been more prepared what are you going to do i dont know admitted janet confronting her helplessness for the first time no said harriet an admission of her own seeming embarrassed now by her question its difficult to think of anything to do isnt it i suppose ill call tomorrow to see what they can tell me she said who janet demanded of herself the only number she had was one she now suspected to be some clever telephone system and who were they the telephone rang again and janet jumped at the noise realizing how already strained her nerves were she recognized her mothers voice at once although it was a difficult connection one that made the words echo from the english end ive been trying to reach you for hours announced her mother with typical exaggeration when did you ring asked janet about half an hour ago the call she hadnt reached in time decided janet so it had not been some official notification she said i was here you should have waited what are you going to do it seemed to be a repetitive question thought janet she said i dont know yet its late here now ill start trying to do something tomorrow what she asked herself again did you know he was a spy janet could not respond at once her mind had not gone on to the actual description of what he did the concept of the polite cultured quiettalking john sheridan actually being a spy seemed preposterous was preposterous she said no i didnt know how could he not have told you her mother sounded outraged over the hollow line he couldnt have told me could he said janet already she was making excuses almost irritably she said did daddy tell you everything he did at the embassies now the older woman hesitated no she conceded finally so its just the same isnt it i suppose so said her mother doubtfully theyll get him out wont they the governmentwashingtoni mean something else her mind had not gone on to conceded janet not quite true she corrected something she had refused to let herself think about janet said of course conscious as she spoke of the lack of conviction in her own voice do you want us to come over why asked janet surprised i dont know admitted her mother i just feel that we should theres not really a lot of point is there said janet theres nothing you can do i suppose not accepted the older woman ill let you know as soon as i hear anything promised janet there was a moment of silence on the telephone that seemed to go on for a long time janet said hello are you still there im here said her mother i just dont know what else to say theres nothing much to say is there pointed out janet everything seemed so wonderful after what happened to hank your father and i were so happy for you you didnt deserve this the voice trailed off lost ive thought about that mother said janet tightly he should have told you warned you blurted the woman abruptly it wasnt fair weve discussed that reminded janet tighter still are you sure there is nothing we can do the problem thought janet was that she was sure about very little nothing in fact she said no but thank you keep in touch urged her mother janet thought it was a stupid remark to make and at once curbed her increasing irritation her mother was only trying to be sympathetically helpful she said of course i will the moment i hear anything its all going to turn out fine insisted the woman with forced enthusiasm your father and i have talked about it and we know everything is going to be fine i know youre right said janet emptily now she was reassuring her mother instead of it being the other way around call if theres anything you need said her mother reluctant to sever the connection i will promise promise goodbye then goodbye sure you dont want us to come over quite sure when she turned around from the telephone janet saw that harriet had overfilled two brandy snifters and was offering her one her immediate thought was that it was a cliched reaction to a personal drama like a scene from one of the interminable soap operas and then just as quickly that the glass being held out to her was the one in which sheridan usually had his nightcap janet accepted the drink although she didnt want it and said thanks now said harriet briskly what would you like me to do every conversation appeared limited to the same questions and answers reflected janet she shrugged and said theres nothing any of us can do not until tomorrow is there would you like me to stay over sleep here harriet asked again janet was surprised whatever for it became harriets turn to shrug i dont know thought you might like some company ill be ok janet said its a bastard isnt it harriet said yes janet agreed a complete bastard t he number rang twice before it was picked up and a voice janet thought she recognized from her previous calls said state is it asked janet there was a pause and the voice said maam my name is janet stone she said carefully prepared i am the fiancee of john sheridan who gave me this number ive reached him on it several times i want to speak to somebody to find out whats happened to him in beirut there was a further hesitation before the voice said will you hold a moment maam janet did not time the delay but it seemed to last for several minutes when the line opened again it was a different voice the man said who is this please janet repeated her earlier statement which she had rehearsed just as she had written down questions she wanted answered while she waited for eightthirty to show on the clock the time she imagined they might start work she finished by saying who am i talking to he didnt answer her question instead he said how did you get this number i already told you from my fiance john sheridan reiterated janet i want to find somebody who can help me can you help me maam im sorry he said i think youve got a misconnection no john sheridan works here janet felt a hollowness begin to form deep down in her stomach but there was anger too she tried to control the anger knowing it would not help and believing too that this number and this unknown man was the only link she had to people who might know what was going on in beirut with forced calmness she said i have not got a misconnection and i know i did not misdial either i have used this number to speak to john sheridan on a number of occasions during the past year i want to know whats happened to him whats going to be done to get him released maam ive told you im sorry i really cant help you who are you demanded janet what cia department am i speaking to maam i really dont know what youre talking about i genuinely cant assist you janets anger lapped over she said for gods sake stop patronizing me and certainly stop talking about genuineness when youre not showing any i want to know whats happened to my fiance maam ive told you i know what youve told me cut off janet and i know youre lying im not interested or concerned in any secrecy rubbish i just want to speak to someone who can help me who knows more than ive seen on the newscasts she felt her control begin to waver and fought against the collapse please she said please help me maam there really isnt any point in continuing this conversation said the man i want began janet and then stopped because she heard the click of disconnection and knew it was pointless she sat crouched in the rosslyn apartment the telephone off its rest and purring in her hand engulfed in a fury that physically burned through her so that she felt hot but it was not all fury there was a frightening helplessness too the allalone feeling shed known in the comingtoterms period after hanks death it was an emotion shed never wanted to experience again janet realized she was crying not from the wetness of any tears but from the shaking of her shoulders she sniffed angry at herself now and tried to stop she was surprised she still held the telephone and put it hurriedly down she had to go into her bedroom for a kleenex and returned blowing her nose hard as if making a noise would help her control back in the living room she stared down at the piece of paper upon which was written suffused by a fresh wave of helplessness and striving to suppress it wouldnt give in couldnt give in she mentally recited to herself what then she didnt know couldnt think janet who had no religion thought dear god someone something please help me think she reached out intending to dial it again and then stopped willing herself to concentrate and did that wasnt the entire number in the habit of americans which janet had actually found curious when she first arrived in the united states sheridan had prefixed the number with the area code which was washington dc janet knew just as she knew that the cia headquarters were at langley which was in virginia she picked up the dc directory and found the state department under the government heading the main number was janet carefully ran her finger through the subsidiary listings seeking the number sheridan had given her it wasnt there she dialed and when the switchboard answered asked as expectantly as she could to be put through to thats not a state department extension said the operator i didnt think it was an extension said janet it was given to me as a state department number let me check said the operator the line went dead but only briefly sorry said the woman coming back thats not registered in any of our directories while she waited janet had already changed telephone books and located two numbers for the central intelligence agency or both with a area code she called the first and on impulse when there was a reply asked for personnel the operator said in connection with what maam christ how she wished everyone would stop calling her maam janet thought she recited her practiced request and was asked to wait and again another unidentified male voice came on to the line and asked who she was and again janet mouthed the ritual we are aware of reports that have appeared in newspapers and on television said the man the central intelligence agency can neither deny or confirm that john patrick sheridan is in any way connected with the agency the bloody man was reading from some written statement janet realized frustration making her hot again she hadnt known sheridans second name was patrick but then she hadnt known much about him at all had she she said i am not asking you to deny or confirm anything i am going to marry the man for christs sake i want to speak to someone to find out whats going on i am afraid i am not empowered to say anything more than ive already told you certainly not over the telephone wait please said janet urgently fearing another disconnection janet hurried on listen to me ive tried the number which john gave me and ive checked with the state department and know its not one of theirs although that was johns cover i can prove i am his fiancee because i have the power of attorney to dispose of his columbus circle apartment and also of some of the effects i can prove he bought me my engagement ring ive got about a hundred letters in his handwriting to me from beirut ive also lodged with our bank a notarized authorization in the name of a us embassy lawyer in beirut for access to funds in his account to secure the mortgage on a house in chevy chase whats the point youre trying to make ms stone interrupted the anonymous spokesman flatvoiced janet supposed ms was slightly better than maam but not much she said very simple really like i told you i tried the number and got the runaround just like youve been giving me the runaround so far i dont want that i want to be able to meet and to talk to someone wholl tell me what has happened to someone i love and intend to marry and whats being done to get him back to safety so i can marry him you appear to have given a lot of thought to how provably connected you are the remark briefly confused janet in her anxiety she had set out her links with sheridan without any conscious attempt at detail but able to think upon them now she acknowledged that the list had been comprehensive but then why shouldnt it have been she was going to marry him wasnt she most wivestobe could have recounted a hundred more things than she had done she was still about to query the mans remark but then understood janet said ive already spoken this morning to someone in the agency on the number and ill tell you what i told him im not interested in what you are doing or what john is doing or in any of this espionage crap that you all seem to think is a normal way of life i dont intend causing any trouble or any difficulty all i want is someone to tell me how everything is going to be made all right have i made myself clear i think you have ms stone so demanded janet she was unsure where the determination was coming frommaybe from the frustrated angerbut whatever the source she was grateful oddlygratefully againshe no longer felt in danger of collapsing into pleading tears you have somewhere we could get back to there wasnt any longer the insincere politeness janet recognized relieved she dictated her number and when hed read it back she said how long until you get back to me ive no way of knowing that maam it hadnt taken long for the bullshit to seep back into the exchange she said im very anxious id like to hear very soon ive got your number then dial the fucking thing janet thought in a fresh surge of frustration her voice betrayed no indication of what she was thinking ill wait then yes agreed the man wait janet did just that wandering aimlessly around the apartment and then irritated at herself remembered the continuous news broadcasts on cnn hurriedly she turned on the television sheridans kidnap retained its place as lead item and janet sat through two topofthehour repeats each time grimacing as the fatuous cia refusal to deny or confirm sheridans connection with the agency was parroted as it had been parroted to her that morning the library footage was similar to that of the previous night and once more there were comparison still photographs of sheridan and william buckley on one segment the beirut situation was augmented by a live studio interview with a supposed intelligence expert whose name janet had never heard before hands clenched she sat as the man recounted brief details of the obscene torture the earlier cia station chief had undergone before the expert finished janet found herself saying no please dont let it happen dont let him be hurt like she had the previous night janet snapped off the television impatient at no fresh news development she looked at her watch and then at the telephonethree hours since her contact with langley what was it that took so long she thought exasperated realizing it was lunchtime and that she had taken nothing other than coffee that morning janet went into the kitchen and stood looking at the refrigerator and the cupboards wondering why she bothered she wasnt hungry and did not want to eat anything anyway there were the remains of a bottle of wine she and harriet had failed to finish last night and janet considered it and then decided against that too shed never found solace from disaster in booze although she was expecting it she started when the telephone sounded snatching it off the kitchen extension to hear harriets voice what is it demanded harriet discerning the disappointment i thought it would be someone else from the agency yes what have they said nothing yet thats why im waiting its all over the newspapers yes of course said janet trying to curb her anxiety darling i really am waiting on this call can i get back to you ill come by direct from work announced her friend do that janet said at once eager to clear the line even though her telephone was equipped with call waiting which had not registered during harriets interruption still janet rang the switchboard operator downstairs who confirmed there had been no other incoming call in the preceding ten minutes she tried cnn once more and saw a replay of the previous newscast and the intelligence experts account of what had happened to the last cia officer snatched in beirut with no additional information and turned it off she walked from the main room to the kitchen and from the kitchen to the bedroom and then back into the main room there were some magazines disordered on a small table and so she tidied them all over the newspapers she remembered as she did so how could she have been so stupid janet called the switchboard operator in the lobby and explained she was expecting an extremely important call she was turning her telephone to answer and if the call came the operator was to ask whoever it was to hold as she was only going into the basement shopping area for a moment she moved impatiently from foot to foot waiting for the elevator to arrive and darted immediately inside when it did emerging before the doors were fully open into the basement she snatched up all the newspapers available in the store and was able to catch the elevator she had left before it was summoned to another floor on the way back to her apartment janet tried to read the account in one of the smallersized newspapers newsday but the bundle was too clumsy and she abandoned the attempt inside she dumped the newspapers onto a pile crossing directly to the telephone the message light was not on but she spoke to the operator anyway there hadnt been a call janet had bought the new york times the washington post newsday the new york daily news and the new york post she spread them all out over the floor at first only scanning each harriet had been right every paper had led with sheridans kidnapping the times and the washington post reports carried the byline of staff correspondents rather than ap or upi because their accounts appeared longer she read them first both reported that sheridan had been waylaid in west beirut as he drove just after am the previous morning from his apartment block to the fortified us embassy less than two miles away in the yarzy district eyewitnesses talked of his vehicle being blocked front and back by two other cars and of sheridan being bundled out at gunpoint no responsibility had so far been claimed but informed opinion was that the kidnap had been carried out by members of the islamic jihad the times pointed out that the warring factions in the lebanon were so fragmented that it could have been the work of a splinter group of what they referred to as the iranbacked hezbollah the party of god or simply a ransominspired snatch by any one of a dozen gangs running crime syndicates in the lawless city the washington post speculated similarly but their correspondent doubted it was a gangland seizure because all us embassy personnel followed a strict security pattern alternating routes and arrival and departure times at the american compound indicating that the kidnap was carefully planned the washington post story continued inside the paper and when she got to the continuation page janet saw a biography of john sheridan running alongside the news story at once she abandoned the beirut account there were three photographs of sheridan none of which janet considered very good inevitably there was comparison again with william buckley and part of sheridans supposed background was intermingled with information about buckley so janet had to read carefully to differentiate between the two she learned for the first time that sheridan had been born in billings montana had attended university there and majored in law his dead parents had been farmers and there was another photograph of a stiffly upright couple both sundaybestdressed at what appeared to be an agricultural show hed run middle distance in his university athletics team and according to university contemporaries whom the newspaper had interviewed sheridan had moved east almost directly after graduation those same unnamed sources described him as a serious studious person who at school had not appeared to attract many friends the biography repeated the absurd noncommittal statement from the cia at langley and then recounted sheridans postings in mexico and peru and egypt he was variously described as a political officer or a cultural attache there was a personal anecdote from a washington post staff writer who had worked in saigon during sheridans period there and who claimed to know the man sheridan had not been a mixer or a partygoer the journalist remembered he had played chess and enjoyed studying the culture of the country during his twoyear posting he had acquired a reasonable fluency in vietnamese the biography concluded by saying that sheridan was unmarried and had few friends in the washington area where he had been based for the previous three years after his reassignment from mexico what about me thought janet at once wasnt she a friend more than a friend she went carefully through the biography a second time feeling cheated and betrayed as she had the previous night stunned before the television set hearing of the kidnap it wasnt rightwasnt fairthat she should learn about the man she was going to marry from some dry newspaper account why hadnt he told her about montana and his family of being an athlete of liking chess and being able to speak vietnamese they werent things that needed to be hidden things likely to impinge upon whatever ridiculous oath of secrecy or silence or whatever it was she imagined they swore to uphold like members of some cloaked and closed society janet felt she was sharing him now with however many thousands or millions of readers read that mornings newspapers that he wasnt hers any more the new york times had also printed a profile it included everything published in the washington post although not so many photographsbut reported additionally that despite what the cia was publicly saying sheridan had for the past three years held the rank of supervisor in the middle east analysis section and was regarded as one of the top three middle east experts in the agency his loss said the newspaper was viewed extremely seriously both at langley and at the white house determined to avoid another assassination like that of buckley the state department had already made a formal diplomatic approach to damascus asking syria to bring all possible pressure upon whatever group had seized sheridan in addition informal contact had been made to every friendly or neutral embassy in the lebanese capital seeking information from their sources on the cia mans whereabouts janet had read the newspapers kneeling on the floor upon which they were laid she slumped back now on her heels wanting to feel relieved at learning that some effort was being made to get sheridan released but finding that reaction difficult she told herself that the word loss in the times report was just a journalistic usage and carried no special significance but it made her uneasy like the account of the diplomatic efforts made her uneasy again she tried to convince herself that it was exactly what the us government should be doingwhat she would have expected them to be doing and been angry if they hadntbut it seemed to hint at panic and if the government and the agency were panicking they clearly feared sheridan would be treated exactly like the previous cia hostage janet fought against the conclusion recognizing there was no reason whatsoever to speculate like that but she was unable completely to remove it from her mind it was a physical as well as mental agony to wait until four oclock in the afternoonthe skin on her arms and legs began to itch and became sore at her scratchingbut she delayed until then to avoid annoyance at langley at four she decided she had every reason to go back to them she went through the mornings explanation to the switchboard operator and when she was transferred realized at once that she was not speaking to the same secondary spokesman it meant a further repetition which she gave as calmly as possible even when the man began reciting the official statement and she had to cut him off by insisting she had been promised a call back by the person to whom she had earlier spoken the man asked her to hold and then returned to say your earlier call has been logged ms stone whats that mean demanded janet that its been logged repeated the man doggedly i heard the words janet said logging something is just recording the fact im waiting to speak to someone hopefully meet with someone im afraid i dont know anything beyond what ive told you maam stop calling me maam janet almost screamed she said you havent told me anything yet can i speak to whoever it was i had the conversation with this morning im afraid that isnt possible maam why not there was a pause as if the person at the other end were undecided whether he was risking an unauthorized disclosure then he said that person is no longer on duty today so when can i expect to hear from whoever is going to talk to me im afraid i have no knowledge of that maam for several moments janet had to clamp her mouth shut against a yell of frustration tightly she said can you find out for me find out and call me back ive been sitting by this telephone all day expecting some contact from you im afraid that would not be proper ms stone said the man at least varying his politeness why the hell wouldnt it be proper demanded janet ive no way of knowing what my colleague might have already done said the man wires could get crossed janet pressed her knuckles against her mouth creating a physical barrier how long she said her words distorted im sorry prompted the man janet took her hand from her mouth and said slowly and distinctly how long is it going to be before i hear from someone at the central intelligence agency about whats happening here and whats happening in beirut after the kidnap yesterday of john sheridan there was a hesitation then the man said im afraid i cant answer that maam is this the way dependents of cia officers are normally treated said janet regretting the anger as she spoke maam said the spokesman ive told you your earlier call has been logged and that a colleague is working on it but from what youve explained to me it would seem that you are not legally a dependent the words had a chilling effect cooling janets anger as if icy water had been thrown in her face youre telling me that i havent the right to know i dont wish to get into a dispute with you over this said the spokesman i was just expressing a personal point of view she was being blocked out janet decided as shed been blocked out when she called the supposed state department number and when she made that first approach to langley she said no one is going to try to help me are they maam ive already tried to make it clear how little i can assist you poor bugger said janet maam i was feeling sorry for john sheridan for ever getting involved she said quietly now i really dont think there is anything further i can help you with said the man dont forget to log the call will you urged janet slamming down the telephone the gesture didnt help and she sat there the renewed frustration trembling through her gradually she focused on the spreadapart washington post during that mornings conversations shed said she didnt want to cause difficulties it wasnt she who had imposed those difficulties janet decided they had she picked up the telephone again she explained yet again to the washington post operator and was connected at once to a voice that said simply city my name is janet stone she said i am engaged to be married to john sheridan would you talk to us about that ms stone asked the man at once i want to very much said janet im being shoved aside by the agency where are you when janet gave her address the deskman said we can have a writer and photographer there in fortyfive minutes they arrived in thirty the writer was a thin bony woman with prematurely graystreaked hair and the male photographer wore jeans and a tshirt and round metalframed granny glasses what can you tell us about john sheridan and yourself asked the woman as soon as she was inside the apartment everything promised janet j anet had little experience of newspapers or the other media and the reaction to her interview with the washington post overwhelmed her it was only eleven oclock that night and harriet was still with her when the telephone first rang it was the staff correspondent for the bbc who had read the piece in the first edition of the following mornings paper and wanted an interview at their washington studio to be transmitted by a satellite linkup with london for their breakfast program knowing there would be no contact from the cia that late at night she agreed hairnet offered to remain in the apartment just in case and it was harriet who relayed to her at the studio the calls from american bureaus of five london newspapers cbs nbc and abc the new york times newsday newsweek and reuters news agency she agreed to the american television interviews and spoke to the london times the daily telegraph and the daily mail but then exhausted asked the others to wait until the following morning it was threethirty before she got to bed the reuters reporter and photographer called from the downstairs lobby at seven their interview and picture session was just finishing when the delayed contact of the previous night started to be made not by telephone now but by journalists coming personally to rosslyn janet posed and talked to them all and agreed to fresh interviews for different programs with the three main american television networks with itn in london and with cnn it was late afternoon before she was able properly to read the washington post interview which had started it all although there was a story datelined from beirut it was immediately obvious that there had been no developments in beirut and her story was given the emphasis the post had divided it into two parts that on the front page turning later on to page nine focused upon her anger at the lack of help from the cia and janet was gladit was to force some response from the agency that she had approached the newspaper in the first place and then agreed to the media onslaught that followed there were photographs of the legal documents she had made available to them proving that she was sheridans fiancee including the document from the us embassy in beirut giving her control of his bank account which was reproduced in full the second insidepage story was a personality profile and janet was surprised at its depth there was reference to her diplomat father and a quote from her department head at georgetown university describing her as a brilliant academic and there were lengthy quotes from the letters that had passed between her and sheridan always concerning some remark about their impending wedding there were three photographs of herself and janet was disappointed she thought they made her look fullerfaced than she really was and in each she appeared strained which she supposed she was and she was obviously not made up which had been her fault not that of the photographer it had been a mistake too not to change from the jeans and shirt she had been wearing when they arrived she was reading with the television tuned to the continuous cnn news program as she had the previous day and was much happier with her appearance there it had been right to wear her hair pulled back from her face and the formal business suit she thought she looked concerned but not haggard when she had responded to a question about their engagement the camera closed in upon her ring she had been worriedly intertwining and then releasing her fingers which she couldnt remember having done the next telephone call was from her mother she said she had been out specially to buy all the english newspapers and there were stories and photographs in every one they had not expected her to appear on bbc television that morning and would have liked to have been told as it was they had only caught it by accident sorry said janet you didnt smile her mother said youve got a nice smile too i dont really think theres a lot to smile about do you you still havent heard anything nothing it cant be easy for them its not easy for me either we could still come across theres no point you going to be on television here again janet frowned at the thought that her mother was enjoying it like shed earlier imagined harriet was enjoying it remembering the itn interview she said probably i dont know youll just have to watch the various channels your father sends his love and says youre not to worry thats a janet began irritably and then stopped she said give my love to him you looked very pretty on television even though you didnt smile janet didnt know what to say thanks she managed call us the minute you hear something ended her mother predictably of course promised janet just as predictably janets hand was still on the telephone in the act of replacing it when it sounded again startling her hopefully she picked it up disappointed at harriets voice anything asked her friend a lot more interviews nothing from the agency youre the most famous girl in town bugger being the most famous girl in town the boss wants to help the boss janet asked not understanding senator willard j blackstone until that moment janet had not considered the possibility of political pressure from anyone in congress how she said cautiously i dont know exactly said harriet but he wants you to come up to the hill to see him he asked me to fix a time it will mean leaving the telephone darling said harriet do you really think you raise the chances of their calling by sitting next to the damned thing youve got a switchboard downstairs use it you set out to throw stones in pools lets make as many ripples as we can janet paused it would be wrong to lose the impetus she appeared to have created but she had not anticipated the effect of approaching the washington post and still had no proof it would achieve anything anyway at once came the balancing reflection even more reason to meet with an american senator then she said all right what time thats a matter for you really how about an hour suggested harriet janet looked down to her sweater and jeans and remembered the mistake of the washington post photographs and said an hour and a half ill be waiting assured her friend which she was when janet wearing the same suit shed worn for the cnn interview arrived at the dirksen building housing the senate offices harriet greeted janet at the entrance and cupped her elbow with her hand to guide her familiarly along the highceilinged corridors to blackstones suite blackstone was a senior fourterm senator with an office to match that seniority there was a cluster of outer rooms accommodating secretaries and aides a more expansive paneled chamber for his personal assistant and beyond that blackstones sanctum itself it was at the corner of the building with a view of constitution avenue and the capitol beyond the walls were lined with photographs showing blackstone with every domestic and international political figure janet could remember over the preceding ten years beneath the pictures there were enough leather couches and chairs for a large informal conference and to one side a conference table itself hedged by about a dozen upright chairs blackstones desk was against the windows occupying the wall space in between was a furled but staffed american flag held up by a special support blackstone rose as the women entered he was an impressive but carefully cultivated man he had a thick mane of completely white hair which he wore long and swept back and he was tall enough well over six feet to be able to wear suits tailored practically in the style of the frock coats of an earlier age waisted and then full again over his hips he came forward with both hands outstretched encompassed janets fingers between them and said welcome and how sorry he was and how he was determined to help as still holding her hand he led her to one of the side couches he pulled one of the easy chairs around to face her but sat forward elbows on his knees face between his hands in the wellpracticed attitude of a politician giving someone their undivided attention and told her to tell him all about it from the very beginning the voice was southern drawl tailored like the clothes after recounting the story of herself and john sheridan so often in the past twentyfour hours janet was able to do so automatically actually able to recall dates and places and even quote the official phrasing of the legal documents that had passed between herself in washington and sheridan in beirut and the agency refused to see you not actually refused qualified janet carefully i keep asking to be told something and all they say is that my original request has been logged blackstone made a vague gesture in the direction of his desk upon which janet saw for the first time marked and annotated newspaper clippings he said what makes you fear youre not being considered a proper legal dependent then the last man i spoke to at langley yesterday said janet he said in his opinion i did not appear to be i dont have any difficulty considering you precisely that said blackstone i want to hear that they dont either said janet you know what im going to do little lady asked blackstone rhetorically im going to poke a stick into the hornets nest im going to ask questions and keep asking questions until i get some goddamned answers for you and for myself i think youre being treated badly and i think americans are being treated badly i dont think we should sit back and let our guys out there in the field get pushed around by a bunch of fanatics and do nothing about it i think weve put up with just about enough humiliation there i think its time we kicked ass if youll forgive me the expression thank you said janet not knowing what else to say she supposed little lady ranked with maam and ms starting right now blackstone announced standing abruptly and crossing to his desk he snapped down an intercom and said ready ray ready senator replied a disembodied voice lets go urged blackstone returning to where janet sat and offering his hand she stood without his assistance following uncomprehendingly as the politician led the way into the paneled outer office but turned right through a door leading to the conference room she hesitated at the entrance conscious that the room into which she was being taken was already crowded and that the harsh lights she could now recognize as television illumination were burning in readiness she felt a push from harriet behind and continued on into the room at blackstones bidding she sat beside him on a raised dais unable because of the lights to see if any of the assembled journalists were those she had met before she heard blackstone insist that she had approached him for help and that he was going to give it he described her as a tragic little lady and talked about fanatics and good american boys in the field and too much humiliation which had to stop and how he intended asking questions until he got answers and janet realized blackstones earlier remarks in his office had been a rehearsed and prepared speech for this press conference she heard herself being questioned and replied that she was grateful for the senators assistance and that she still had not been told anything officially and thought illogically how glad she was shed worn her suit and not stayed in her jeans well demanded harriet excitedly as they drove back across the river towards rossyln listening already over the car radio to a report of what had taken place what did you think of that that shed been used by a publicityconscious politician anxious to clamber aboard a bandwagon janet replied mentally aloud she said lets hope it works the switchboard had one message when they went into the apartment there was no name or identification just a number but with a area code when she called it and identified herself a man said i think its time we met dont you see exclaimed harriet it worked i t was a typical office building on th street near franklin park janet had been surprised at receiving an address in washington rather than being asked to go out to langley which was what she had expected she supposed upon reflection that it was obvious the agency would have places away from their headquarters complex for meetings like this as the elevator ascended to the sixth floor janet wondered if it were in just such an office that sheridan had worked or whether hed been based at langley if he were the senior analyst the newspapers had described him as being she guessed he would have been out in virginia the suite number she had been givenconfronted her when the lift doors opened there was no identification plate the door without any apparent security lock or device opened into an expansive area dominated by wideleafed plants in a selection of woodchipped pots there were magazines on several small tables centered among lowbacked easy chairs and janet thought it was just like every doctors or dentists waiting room shed ever visited the receptionist was black and very pretty her hair braided and all the braids capped off with differentcolored beads which rattled at her every movement from a chain around her neck hung the sort of identification badge complete with picture that everyone in washington appeared to wear behind the receptionist two closedcircuit television cameras were positioned to encompass the entire room when janet identified herself the receptionist said of course as if she personally recognized her the woman passed the name on through the intercom box on her desk and immediately a freshfaced bespectacled man emerged from a cubicle behind he wore a waistcoated gray checked suit with a clubstriped tie pinned into place by a metal bar which stretched from each collar tip he too recited her name as if he recognized her and asked her politely to follow him into the rear of the building the office into which he led her was very small a partitioned box among a lot of other partitioned boxes it was bare of any personal photographs or mementos there was nothing on the desk apart from a single telephone and a blotter pad the pad was crisply white and unmarked there was another closedcircuit camera high in the left corner janet guessed the size of the room made more than one camera unnecessary the man gestured her to a seat and politely remained standing until janet sat he left his jacket fastened when he lowered himself into his seat so that the material strained around him but did not appear discomfited through the gape of the jacket janet saw he had an identification badge on a chain as well thank you for coming he said it was hardly likely that i wouldnt surely said janet she hadnt intended to sound rude but realized her reply could be construed that way he did not appear offended he said we think all the publicity has been unfortunate i think it is unfortunate i have been treated as i have replied janet on occasions like this the agency receives a lot of crank calls he said you thought i was a crank we had to be sure you mean you checked on me of course janet looked directly at the camera wondering the purpose of whatever it was recording she said i could have been told that there would be a delay i mean the man nodded and said our people didnt handle it well am i to know your name asked janet the man hesitated appearing reluctant then said willsher robert willsher so now that weve at last met mr willsher what can you tell me about john very little im afraid said the cia man through an allied embassy in beirut weve got some guidance that the kidnappers are fundamentalists but theres been no direct contact or demand so whats the purpose of the kidnap in the first place willsher shrugged humiliation of americans is usually sufficient there are a lot of our people held too many said janet accusingly whats the policy to be when there is contact is there to be a bargained deal official policy is not to surrender to terrorism said willsher rubbish rejected janet at once what was irangate all about and it failed im authorized to say that every avenue will be explored to secure sheridans release said the man what precisely does that mean what it says its impossible for us to be any more specific than that until we know whos got him and what they want you looked into my background yes frowned willsher so you know my university subject and from it will be aware i study the area reminded janet willsher nodded again understanding he said and because of your subject you should be able to appreciate how difficult it is for us do you just intend to wait asked janet or are you trying to make contact from your side you must believe were doing everything we can that isnt an answer to my question through arab governments with whom we have dialogue we have made it clear we want contact conceded willsher thats why your courting publicity didnt help would this meeting be taking place if i had not made some sort of protest i told you we had to be sure repeated willsher what harm has the publicity done from the outset the aim has been damage limitation said willsher pedantically he looked away from her appearing almost embarrassed then continued the cia as an organization is a particular target among these people we wanted as much as possible to minimize sheridans position janet felt the familiar anger begin to build up the man was discussing john as if he were some disembodied awkwardness not a human being going through god knows what sort of torment she said i did not disclose johns position in the cia i didnt even know he was connected to the cia until i heard it on a television newscast if youd been so goddamned anxious to deny any connection with the cia you could have done so by doing just that telling a lie and denying it that ridiculous statement saying neither one thing or the other was practically an outandout admission something else that wasnt handled particularly well conceded the man i know about william buckley said janet flatly so do we maam said willsher more forcefully than he had so far spoken and we dont want anything like it to happen again there must be something the government can do other than just sit around and wait said janet why not issue a public warning about retribution if any harm comes to him willsher shook his head you must believe me ms stone a lot of discussion and consideration has already gone into this the combined view of the agency and the state department is that a confrontational stance is not the right one to adopt what the hell was a confrontational stance thought janet maam and ms had reentered the conversation too she realized she said what is then it has been decided to wait until the demand then what we cant answer that until we know what the demand is around and around on the carousel thought janet she said that could take weeks months were prepared for it to take as long as necessary if it means getting john safely back janet supposed it was the right attitudethe only attitudebut she was impatient with it she wanted to be told that something positive was being done like offering a definite ransom or assembling some sort of gungho rescue squad she said just sit back and wait no said willsher patiently i told you everything that can be done is being done and it is the state department has made approaches to every arab country saying that the government will react in the strongest possible way without being specific what that might be if any harm befalls him i thought you were pulling back from confrontation these are diplomatic messages not press statements getting headlines willsher said and i think its important they remain that way i dont think what ive just told you should get to the newspapers the new york times has already come pretty close willsher shook his head no one has reported how we might react remembering her earlier impatience janet said what about when there is contact what about sending in some sort of snatch squad i thought id already made it clear ms stone that every sort of contingency is being explored including some sort of commando assault i dont think i can be as specific as that you dont trust me do you i dont think trust comes into it ms stone i dont know the specific proposals myself and if you did you wouldnt tell me probably not admitted willsher at once that wouldnt be particularly good security would it did you know john janet asked abruptly personally i mean willsher hesitated and then said we were on station together once some time ago but not together here in washington were you a friend willsher frowned once more head to one side we saw each other occasionally he said it wasnt really friendship will he be able to stand it asked janet urgently the imprisonment and and she stumbled to a halt and then blurted out whatever else there might be for the first time willshers reserved formality wavered he said johns a very strong man very tough janet laughed without humor thats the strangest part since all this happened i realize i never thought of him as someone with strength with resilience isnt that odd im not going to say anything ridiculous like dont worry but hes able to sustain hardship willsher said i hope youre right said janet dear god i hope youre right you must leave things with us now willsher said no more media hype or protests from senators for how long for as long as it takes ms stone gagged you mean i mean theres only one consideration for both of us which is getting john out and we think that means low profile you wouldnt abandon him would you janet demanded i dont understand that question maam i mean that it wouldnt be considered wise politics in a region in which america has already made a whole bunch of mistakes to consider john sheridan as being disposable janet paused remembering the phrase she said someone whos plausibly deniable no ms stone i can assure you that isnt the way were thinking id like to believe you mr willsher all i can do is repeat that it isnt so are you going to remain in contact of course how willsher paused and said you shouldnt have disclosed the telephone number that john gave you weve had to close it down and i shouldnt have been given the bums rush when i asked for help came back janet i thought wed cleared the decks on that i hope we have agreed the cia officer so how ive got your number no refused janet shaking her head i want something better than that willsher sighed looking down at his pristine blotter he said there are going to be more media approaches every conversation reverted to their sensitivity about publicity janet recognized she said i understand what youre saying i really do to refuse to talk would be as wrong as saying too much how about if i said there had been a meeting with an official of the agency who assured me that everything possible was being done willsher smiled suddenly an unexpected expression he said i think that sounds fine in return for which i get a number where i can reach you whenever i want insisted janet the smile died willsher said you have my word i will call as soon as there is news i want a number damn it willsher blinked at the outburst he said for you only i told you i understand there was the briefest of hesitations and the man scrawled out a number on a scratch pad and offered it to her across the table janet took it and saw at once relieved that it was prefixed by the langley area code willsher said were going to stay on top with this one you must believe me on that ill try said janet she rigidly maintained her side of the bargain confining herself to what they had agreed when the renewed newspaper and television inquiries came until after three days the only regular callers were news agencies the washington post tried to keep the story alive by publishing in their sunday style section more of the letters between herself and sheridan that she had made available that first day and janet spent an uncomfortable twentyfour hours until monday when she could reach willsher to explain the cia man said he understood and that there the feature hadnt caused any problems in the first few days janet rang willsher morning and night never once did he react impatiently by the end of the second week janet herself recognized the pointlessness and reduced her calls to one a day for his part willsher kept the terms on behalf of the agency as well reaching her at the beginning of the third week before any news outlet to tell her of the photographs released by the islamic jihad harriet hurried over in response to janets call and together they sat hands linked in front of the television janet whimpered aloud when the picture flashed up shocked by sheridans appearance there was no identifiable background and she guessed it had been taken against the wall of the cell in which he was being held he had not been allowed to shave and the beard growth was very white making him look much older his hair was unkempt and straggled in places almost to his collar and it was grayer than she remembered too adding to the impression of age the sports shirt was open at the neck and his thinness almost a frailty was more obvious to her from the bony ridges around his neck and chest than the hollow sunken cheeks sheridans eyes were sunken as well janet thought how similar he appeared around the eyes to how she had looked that day of the intended bathroom suicide beside her harriet said jesus and then at once embarrassed at the unthinking reaction tried to correct it by saying im sorry i didnt mean that and finally oh shit the commentary said the photograph had been accompanied by demands for the release of ten members of the group with whom the kidnappers were linked and who were currently being held in custody in kuwait if the kuwaiti prisoners were not released the american would be executed the still photograph of sheridan faded to be replaced by live footage of a state department spokesman in front of a map of the world saying that the demands were being considered and discussed with friendly countries janet took the first two calls herself but after that relayed her reaction through harriet saying that she was relieved at the evidence that sheridan was still alive and that she hoped negotiations could now be opened leading to his freedom so busy was her telephone that it was difficult to get a call out but she finally did willsher seemed to be expecting her kuwait normally refuses to be pressured janet said at once yes agreed the cia official just as quickly will they on this occasion the liaison is through the state department willsher said vaguely is kuwait being asked to concede its delicate willsher said theres a limit to the requests and demands we can make janet paused needing to force herself to ask the question so john is going to die no ms stone said the man always patient everything that can be done is being done i keep telling you that and youve overlooked something in their demand what asked janet they havent imposed a time limit for compliance janet was annoyed at herself for not having spotted the fact which was important probing to see if the official view were the same as her own janet said how do you see the significance of that a concession before we even start said willsher encouragingly they know a time limit would have boxed us in so theyve already accepted that persuasion can take a while weve got room to move yes agreed janet feeling a sweep of hope so lets not get too depressed too quickly willsher said encouragingly ill try not to let it happen janet said it was not an easy undertaking to keep two days later kuwait officially announced that it saw no reason to abandon its established policy of resisting terrorist pressure and that they would not comply with the demand involving the american citizen john sheridan the state department immediately summoned the kuwaiti ambassador to foggy bottom for talks with the secretary of state who was photographed bidding the diplomat farewell on the steps of the kuwait embassy the ambassador allowed himself to be interviewed he said that while his country sympathized with the hostage taking of a us national there had been nothing in his conversation with the secretary of state to make him think his country would alter its stance concessions to terrorism encouraged further and worse acts of terrorism three days after the kuwaiti rejection sheridans kidnappers issued another photograph of him this time apparently manacled to a metal bed or platform with a second statement threatening to send to the us embassy in beirut severed parts of the cia mans body to convince washington and kuwait of the seriousness of their demands the white house in turn issued a statement of its own deploring the threat as bestial insisting that any such act would be treated as common criminality to be prosecuted in any country in the world and called upon civilized governments to impose their combined efforts to resolve the situation in an unprecedented demonstration of cooperation between mikhail gorbachev and ronald reagan moscow published a condemnation of hostage taking and promised to liaise with western governments to bring about its cessation janet was inundated by fresh press inquiries invitations to television appearances and offers one as high as to write her own account of her romance with john sheridan and the pressure to which she felt subjected by the kidnap a talkshow agency in atlanta asked to represent her suggesting a countrywide lecture tour at an address with an assurance of a minimum of ten lectures senator blackstone tried to persuade her to appear with him on a televised evangelical church service when he intended asking watching worshippers to link hands across the entire united states in a silent vigil for the safe release of john sehridan janet refused them all sticking to the agreement she had made with willsher although she believed that continued publicity would have maintained the us public concern she regarded as necessary she did however insist upon another personal meeting and willsher set it up at the franklin park office block the day before the appointment the university authorities gratefully agreed to her taking an unspecified leave of absence after being besieged for so long in her apartment janet sneaked out the basement garbage entrance to hide in harriets georgetown house the next day with willsher janet carefully enumerated all approaches wanting to impress upon the cia officer that she was observing her side of the pact willsher said i think youve been very wise i dont particularly said janet i made a deal and ive kept to it so what have you got to offer in return you wouldnt believe the background pressure thats being imposed said willsher i wont unless its spelled out to me in detail agreed janet relentlessly the neat precise man coughed its unheard of for moscow to come out like they did it means that between us there isnt an arab government proeast or prowest that isnt involved doing what persisted janet weve positive assurances from syria of the cooperation of their troops on the ground and their intelligence service actively to try to find him willsher said in addition the president has been personally assured by israel that the mossad are pulling out all the stops you havent mentioned iran reminded janet pointedly and the only lead the islamic jihad and the fundamentalists follow comes from teheran and the ayatollahs who would you say has closest links janet considered the question and said france willsher smiled another president to president promise from paris in adddition the british have made available to us all their electronic eavesdropping facilities on cyprus and were flying overhead intercepts the length and breadth of the lebanon from the nato bases in turkey a fortnight ago nsa shifted one of its mediterranean satellites and put it in permanent geostationary orbit directly over beirut no one speaks on the telephone or the radio without us hearing whats said we can count the bricks in the walls all very impressive said janet im glad you think so said willsher misunderatanding so whats it achieved ms stone said willsher gently some hostages have been held in the lebanon for years seventeen hostages enumerated janet just as controlled and if were going to go on quoting statistics seven more have been tortured and killed all of which frightens the hell out of me because i dont want john sheridan achieving some kidnap endurance record or being tortured or dismembered or killed tell me demanded willsher holding his hands out towards her tell me what else or what more youd have us do tell me something we havent thought of you know why no other russians have been kidnapped after october yes i do ms stone willsher responded at once i know the kgb sent in hit squads and i know that fifteen shia fanatics were killed as a warning to leave soviet personnel alone but i also know that one of the four russians kidnapped in october was murdered before the rescue squads got to him there must be some way you can force the kuwaitis to give in pleaded janet desperately we cant said the cia officer we know we cant because weve tried that too that night in harriets georgetown house where shed first met john sheridan janet drank more than she normally did agreeing to brandy after the wine but the idea when it came was in no way a drunken one although that was harriets immediate thought when she belatedly realized that janet was quite serious harriet said thats absurd absolutely absurd why jesus christ darling for every reason im going to do it said janet feeling positively excited what if john dies janet gazed for several moments across the dinner table at her friend and then said thats almost inevitable the way its being handled so far which is what im trying to prevent the last time there wasnt anything i could even try to do to prevent the inevitable remember darling exclaimed her mother when janet telephoned five minutes later it would be wonderful to have you home not for long mother warned janet not for long i t was an overnight flight from america landing in london early in the morning janet had been unable to sleep at all and arrived feeling unwashed and grittyeyed it was not until she got through immigration and was waiting by the carousel for her luggage that janet remembered the original plan to be here with john for the wedding she half turned as if expecting him to be by her side an unthinking reaction of tiredness she blinked feeling stupid relieved that her bag came up almost at once so she could grab it and move away her parents were waiting right by the exit behind the barrier and the moment janet emerged her mother waved to attract attention the woman hugged her and released her and hugged her again while her father waited patiently for his turn and just hugged her and kissed her once when it came from the first kiss her mother began a nonstop jabber of questions without ever waiting for answers and over the womans head her father smiled and janet smiled back janet thought her mother twittered and decided the word was apposite she was a thin smallboned woman with jerky movements like a twittering bird her father was a complete contrast a quiet unemotional man who she doubted had ever done anything or said anything without considering it first from their time on postings together janet always thought of him as someone in black because he really had worn a kind of uniform dark subdued suits when it had not been striped trousers with black formal jacket now the suit was a retired country tweed but the sharp trouser crease and the waistcoat still gave a vague formality to it he seemed fuller in the face than janet remembered from her last visit but it was his hair that registered with her most although he had to be twentyfive years older than john her fathers hair was still almost completely black from those awful pictures that remained so vivid in her mind janet decided it was john who could be this mans father rather than the other way around responding minimally to her mothers backseat chatter janet agreed that she was tired and that it was nice to be back and that it had been a reasonable flightalthough already she could scarcely recall itand that it was awful what had happened to john and that she was managing to cope and that harriet had been wonderful and that everyone else had been wonderful too her mother proudly announced she had kept a scrapbook of all the newspaper stories and features knowing janet would want one janet who considered it the last thing she wanted thanked the other woman and said it was a kind thought her father picked the orbital motorway and as they drove south he looked sideways across the car and said you all right i dont know not really i suppose so was the pressure bad in washington not after i moved in with harriet we had the press camped at the bottom of the lane for a week im sorry said janet not sure what she was apologizing for they wanted photographs of you when you were a child intruded her mother from the back seat i let them have that one of you at the necropolis of thebes on a camel shed been terrified and it had shown janet remembered she said i dont mind whatever you did one or two papers have kept in touch but we havent said anything about your coming home assured her father im glad you havent im sure everything is going to work out all right said her mother janet was surprised it had taken so long it had usually been her mothers second or third remark in every conversation since the kidnap she said she hoped so wanting her mother to stop talking it was a gray presseddown day with the clouds low against the beginning of the sussex hills an uncertain mist kept the windows damp and the tires sounded sticky on the road beneath them the motorway was jammed far more crowded than the washington beltway and dirt sprayed up from the stream of cars ahead of them the traffic did not improve when they left the motorway to head further south into sussex on a lesserused road although it was not cold inside the car janet shivered and guessed it was another reaction to her tiredness her parents lived in a hamlet just outside cuckfield and it was still only midmorning when they arrived her father carried her case and her mother ran a bath and turned down her bed when she went into the bedroom janet was sorry for the impatience she appeared constantly to feel towards the woman it was she acknowledged quite unfair her mother was doing her best in her way to help and to be supportive janet further acknowledged that impatience had been her predominant feeling about everything and towards everybody since john had been taken hostage and that it wasnt either a constructive or useful attitude whatever that might be janet wanted to sleep and tried hard to do so but it was not the proper sort of rest more a submission to exhaustion she was suspended in a conscious sort of a dream one she knew to be a dream from which she would awaken mental images of john sheridan and william buckley kept being confused and she could recall whole tracts of commentary from television and newspaper coverage willsher featured prominently although not in the franklin park office but in the sort of lecture hall she used at the university and he was at the podium in the manner of an instructor admonishing her for not listening or understanding and making mistakes through lack of concentration when she did awake janet lay in bed although not balled up as she had when hank died but fully outstretched and reflective with her hands cupped behind her head so what the hell did she imagine she was doing by coming here and intending to go on as she did intend to go on what could she do that wasnt already being done with more expertise and more resources than she could ever have unanswerable questions so she stopped trying to answer them janet accepted that a lot of the rationaleif rationale were the right wordlay in her response to harriet that night of the decision in the georgetown house she had feltand still feltguilt at not being able to do anything to combat hanks cancer she knew it to be an illogicaleven absurdfeeling because she wasnt a doctor or a surgeon or a specialist and so there was nothing she could have done during those last few months but it still remained an impression that she could not lose would never lose she was determined that she would not feel guilty about john now there was something she believed she could do some physical movement it was possible for her to make was that all it would be just moving around to give herself the impression of some sort of useful activity janet closed her mind against the inrush of questions she was going to do not think janet got up in the late afternoon and agreed to tea she didnt want and looked at the cuttings book her mother had assembled she was surprised at the british media coverage engendered by the kidnap and hoped it would help she wished her mother hadnt given away the photograph of herself on a camel it was not until the early evening when her mother was busying herself over supper that janet was alone with her father it was he who initiated the conversation he poured drinkssherry for her and whisky for himselfand as he handed the glass to her said what does not for long mean im sorry janet frowned momentarily not remembering thats what your mother said you told her on the telephone that you were coming home but not for long janet sipped her drink unsure how to say it and then decided there was only one way im going there she announced now it was her fathers turn momentarily not to understand going where beirut for a long time her father stared across the room at her unmoving his face expressionless and when he responded his voice predictably was just as controlled he said thats ridiculous you wouldnt even get a visa cyprus then insisted janet since the war theres been as much lebanese activity there as in beirut anyway to do what asked the man a bloody sight more than is being done at the moment to find john her father shook his head still talking evenly its a fantasy darling theres nothing you can do i can if youll help me me youve still got friends in the foreign office and in the area he shrugged a few i suppose introduce me demanded janet personally in london by letter where you can in the middle east for what repeated the man they could make inquiries couldnt they isnt that how it was done in the embassies where you served questions from london relayed to you and in turn taken up with the authorities there isnt any authority in the lebanon any more not the sort of authority youre talking about argued her father you should know that better than most there is still diplomatic representation in beirut nominal though it might be janet argued back johns not the only person being held there must be some contact with these groups some links darling said the man gently dont you think the americans will have explored every possibility like that i think theyre just sitting around doing bugger all her father hesitated as if he were surprised at her swearing he said that isnt true cant be true and you know it i want to do something ok he said a diplomat whose entire career had involved patient argument and inevitable compromise what happens if people i know do have contacts with friends in beirut and those friends have the sort of links you think must exist and through the chain you do get some sort of information about john what then now it was janet who hesitated not having thought that far ahead tell the americans she said she indicated the scrapbook that lay on the settee between them and went on tell them and let them know that if they dont try to do something to get him out ill ask why through the newspapers get into a public slanging match you mean if thats what it takes havent you thought of an inherent danger i dont care what happens to me said janet thoughtlessly i wasnt thinking about you at that moment said her father still gentle i was thinking of what could happen to john if some suggestion were given as to his whereabouts and demands made that america do something to get him out do you imagine whoevers got him would just sit around and wait for it to happen janet bit her lip uncomfortably threaten she said retreating just threaten to go to the newspapers unless they did something as you mentioned it said the man what about you i said i didnt care thats stupid which is something else you know her father said still not raising his voice and again youve misunderstood lets not think of physical danger for a moment although of course we should youre a woman what sort of chance do you really think a womanany womanwould stand of achieving anything in any sort of middle east situation i know the area and i know the language and i know the dangers and the likely difficulties insisted janet youre still a woman a very determined one he shook his head more in sadness than refusal i do care he said i care and i feel sorrydesperately sorryfor whats happened your mother and i liked john enormously and hoped really hoped that you were going to get a second chance but this isnt the way darling leave it to the people who know what theyre doing you really could do more harmharm to john i meanthan good by trying to get involved like this janets eyes clouded with anger you know what youve just done she said youve just talked of john in the past tense like hes already dead and theres no possibility of our ever marrying that ive lost the second chance and youve lectured me like willsher the cia man patronized me and patted me on the head and told me to go home and be a good girl and stop making a nuisance of myself i havent had to wait until i got to the middle east to be treated like a secondclass person from you of all people i didnt expect that neither attitude her father went to the drinks tray and refilled his glass without inviting her to have another still standing by it he said im sorry i did not intend to talk of john as if he were dead i didnt intend to patronize either i will go insisted janet whether you help me or not i will go yes accepted her father shortly you will wont you so so what do i get help or do i get patronized do you really have to ask a question like that after tonight im not sure whats this sort of conversation going to achieve janet shrugged regretting the outburst im fed up daddy so fed up i love john and i really do think of it as a second chance and i want it so very much so im fed up being told to go away being told that everyone else knows better than me that i havent the right to know anything even her father moved from where he stood coming to her and pulling her to him you know ill do everything i can janet twisted to look up at him im sorry she said he shook his head dismissing her apology dont regard it as anything more than it is he cautioned i dont know yet whether anyone i know personally is in any position to help or if they will if they are its good just to have someone on my side she said ill always be that her father said janet was further encouraged the following day when her father emerged from his study after an entire mornings telephoning to announce that he had located two old diplomatic acquaintances one in london the other working out of the british embassy in nicosia cyprus exclaimed janet it isnt significant warned her father we dont know yet if hell be prepared to do anything its wonderful insisted janet refusing to be disheartened depression was however a feeling that was quick to come her fathers friend in london was named mcdermott and hed served under her father at the british embassy in cairo they met not at whitehall but over lunch at locketts nearby he was a tall thin pinkcheeked man with the habit of looking reprovingly like some schoolmaster over halfrimmed spectacles the frames had grooved the bridge of his nose and the sides of his head where his hair was white he said he remembered janet from her cairo visits during school vacations and she smiled unable to remember him and agreed that egypt had been a fascinating country hed read of sheridans kidnap but had not realized her association because she had been referred to in all the newspaper stories by her previously married name he was sorry he said the situation in the lebanon appeared regrettably quite intractable and ordered gulls eggs with lemon sole to follow mcdermott seemed genuinely surprised at the request for assistance which her father introduced into the conversation and which janet at once took up and expanded upon elaborating the early firstnight debate with her father when she finished mcdermott said at once and again apparently genuinely why are you asking me to do this i would have thought that was obvious said janet mcdermott put down his knife and fork not immediately looking up assembling his words when he did speak it was to her father rather than to janet and janet thought again that she didnt have to wait until the middle east to encounter the dismissive relegation of her sex you should know better than to ask me said mcdermott john sheridan is a foreign national an american what right has the foreign office to interfere the same rejection only reversed that shed encountered on her first approaches to the state department and the cia remembered janet it was like being on a roundabout with a forwardsandbackwards control but always in the same direction we were thinking of it more as a personal favor said her father a discreet sort of inquiry there is no such thing in the lebanese hostage situation lectured mcdermott weve had the special envoy of the archbishop of canterbury held for over a year a british television journalist for two how on earth can i get involved risk tangling up whatever negotiation might be going on to gain the freedom of britons by intruding into the affairs of another country its unthinkable it wasnt our intention to embarrass you said janets father diplomat soothing diplomat mcdermott retrieved his knife and fork this is a social occasion he said nothing official so there is no embarrassment he looked at last to janet please dont think im not sympathetic i am i recognize very well the predicament in which you find yourself that youre in a kind of limbo but there is nothing i can do either officially or unofficially youve made that very clear said janet tightly can i give you some advice asked the man of course said janet knowing he would whether she agreed or not leave it to the experts who know what they are doing smiled mcdermott like your experts know what they are doing with an archbishops enjoy still held after one year and a tv journalist for two snapped janet red spots of irritation pricked out on mcdermotts face but his voice was completely even when he spoke he said i understand your distress i wish there were something i could do i really do what did it take to get men like mcdermott and her father to lose control janet wondered perhaps their lives were too well cocooned for the risk ever to arise striving for politeness janet said thank you for agreeing to meet me at least mcdermotts attention was back to the other man always a pleasure to meet old and respected friends he said the food here is always very good dont you think very good echoed her father it was an absurd esoteric game with no written rules thought janet the exasperation burning through her she wondered what john thought of the food he was getting in whatever shithole he was tethered i warned you her father said as they traveled back to sussex you warned me agreed janet an additional avenue had occurred to her so perhaps the lunch had not been a complete waste of time still want to go on janet turned sideways in the passenger seat to look directly at the man i want you to understand something she said trying to match his unemotional tone of voice i shall go on until one of two things happens until john is freed and were able to marry or until i go to the funeral of someone whose body is said to be his her father chanced looking briefly away from the road towards her ill write the letter tonight for you to take to cyprus i want to try something else first said janet something ill arrange myself it took two days for janet to fix an interview at lambeth palace the priest named davidson was younger than she had expected for a member of the personal staff of the archbishop a scrubfaced spikehaired eager man whose solicitousness showed in that hed read all the cuttings concerning john sheridan by the time they met he said he was sorry as everyone seemed to do and janet thanked him when janet asked directly he replied he couldnt confirm or deny that any secret negotiations were taking place to free their envoy terry waite and janet heard the cia statement echo in her mind were negotiations to take place asked janet could they be extended to include john when the priest began to reiterate that he couldnt confirm or deny janet interrupted to say that she understood but could he record her request anyway davidson promised he would but repeated again that he knew nothing about any such negotiations in an obvious attempt to offer some comfort the priest added that they had an assurance from the british government that every possible pressure was being exerted upon every other government who might be able to assist not just for information about their own emissary and the british journalist but all other foreign nationals as well at the end of the interview davidson suggested they pray together and janet did feeling selfconscious because she had never been able to believe and therefore to pray not even when hank was dying a wasted journey her father asked that night i think he was sincere that he would try to include johns name if there were any negotiations said janet it had become a habit since her return from america for them to have predinner drinks in his study while her mother supervised in the kitchen what now because the airline office was convenient in london i bought a ticket to cyprus when the day after tomorrow her father nodded i know its a fatuous thing to say but be careful i will be as careful as i can i still wish you wouldnt go dont forget what i said in the car im hardly likely to ive got another favor what ive an inheritance right her father frowned across the rim of his whisky glass nodding yes can i have it now he smiled sadly very biblical he said the parable of the prodigal son had a happy ending remember turning the word she added and i dont intend being prodigal believe me dont you think the americans have tried bribery or even straightforward ranson he said and offered far more money than were likely to be able to afford weve had this sort of conversation before said janet i dont intend walking around with a satchel full of money i just want to have some available if its necessary her father gestured around the room encompassing the house this is part of your inheritance of course all i could raise in cash at such short notice would be about it was more than janet had expected she said i love you very much and then added hurriedly i love both of you very much ill want to know where you are all the time and for us to be in regular touch of course he indicated the letter of introduction that lay on his study table and said and go beyond that register properly at the embassy so that there is proof of your being on the island i want an instant and official reaction if you get into any sort of difficulty i promise her mothers unremitting chatter had dried up from the moment of her being told days before of janets intention to go to cyprus and she became further subdued that night at dinner when janet disclosed the airline booking everyone made an effort to find something else to talk about and failed so the evening became strained and clumsy and janet excused herself early pleading the need to get some rest before the impending flight the couple remained at the table and janets mother accepted brandy which she rarely did its madness she protested i know he agreed she could get hurt yes so you must stop her forbid her to go that wouldnt work not a direct confrontation there must be something you can do i hope so said janets father j anet had forgotten the mediterranean heat of the near middle east just as she was soon to realize she had forgotten much else about an area in which she was supposed to be an expert the heat engulfed her like oven breath as soon as she disembarked at larnaca dry and quite unlike the damp mugginess of summer washington by the time she reclaimed her luggage she was sweatingly wet there was no air conditioning in the mercedes taxi so she traveled with the rear window fully down for whatever breeze she could get against the dashboard the driver had a picture of a man in an elaborate frame made even more ornate by a bouquet of dyed straws and dried flowers in a small vase making it into some sort of shrine and janet realized she had not carried a photograph of john with her she wasnt sorry she didnt need a reminder or a shrine definitely not a shrine the route inland from the airport into nicosia took her near larnaca marina and the harbor beyond and there were signs faded and unrepaired advertising ferries to beirut she strained to see the direction they indicated but the ochre and white buildings were jammed too close together blocking her view the boundary of the town was quite abrupt huddledtogether houses giving way to rolling duncolored scrubland they began passing mules and donkeys almost completely obscured by their loads clothwrapped bundles on legs and the roadside was dotted with stickframed leanto shelters against the sun from which tiny children yelled and waved for them to stop to buy oranges or lemons or melons or carved souvenirs orienting herself janet looked south the troodos mountains were too far away from her to make out but she imagined a rise in the scrubland where it climbed towards them the british had made their listening facilities on the island available in the hope of hearing some telephone or radio communication about john she remembered from conversation with willsher troodos was the highest point of the island and she supposed that was where the technology would be sited would anything have been heard she doubted the cia man would have told her if it had the pale blue berets of the united nations peacekeeping force were janets first physical reminder of the haphazard partition of the island after the turkish invasion of and as they entered nicosia she passed another indication the turkishheld enclave wired off and controlled by guard posts gangsters said the driver as they skirted the turkish pocket janet did not reply she had gangsters of her own to worry about she chose the churchill hotel on achaeans street not for its fourstar luxury but because it was a place where telephones would be guaranteed to work they did she was connected without any delay to her father in england to give him her address and room number and to assure him she was all right he asked if she had contacted the british embassy yet and janet said hed been her first call because that was the promise shed made he told her to be careful which janet expected and she assured him she would be william partington had served under her father in the same position as the unhelpful mcdermott although in amman not cairo he was not available when janet called but a secretary promised he would be returning after lunch janet used the time to deposit her fathers bank draft for at a branch of barclays international within walking distance of the hotel although by the time she reached the bank she was bathed in perspiration again the size of the transfer intimidated the counter clerk who insisted upon her being greeted by an assistant manager janet patiently endured the ritual arranging for the money to be held on deposit and maintained in a sterling account the man presented her with a business card and asked that she deal personally with him and janet agreed that she would she reached partington on the second call the attache remembered her father at once and said he was delighted to hear from her and why didnt she come for supper with him and his wife the following evening janet said she wanted a more formal meeting although dinner would be fine later there was a pause from the other end of the line and partington said he was not particularly busy and would she like to come to the embassy that afternoon janet said she would very much janet showered and changed and managed to get an airconditioned taxi to alexander pallis street she identified herself to the reception clerk and at once partington hurried from the rear of the building partington was a contrast to her fathers acquaintance mcdermott just as tall but a bluff bulging man face reddened beneath the tan by the blood pressure of good living a crumpled lightweight suit strained by the effort of containing him all he shook her hand and said welcome and still holding it led her into the back of the building where at once gratefully janet felt the chill of better air conditioning than in the outer vestibule you in a spot of bother demanded the man something like that agreed janet offering the man the letter of introduction from her father partington read the letter carefully tapping a fingernail against his teeth as he did so from the movement of his head janet realized the man was going through it twice at last partington looked up subdued now and said i see please said janet at once dont say youre sorry everyone does then i wont he gestured to the paper he had placed before him on the desk your father asks me to help in any way i can which of course i would if i could but i dont see how were no way involved we cant be remembering her reflection about the troodos mountains on her way into nicosia that morning janet said i know that youre making british listening facilities here available to the cia partington sucked in his breath shaking his head as he did so not my province mrs stone thats an intelligence matter quite separate i wouldnt know anything about that wouldnt want to know janet felt the familiar rise of exasperation and tried to curb it she said this close to the lebanon there must be links between the british presence there and you here some partington agreed doubtfully before i left london i went to lambeth palace janet said she hesitated deciding upon an exaggeration and went on i talked there with a member of the archbishops staff about negotiations to free the britons being held your people in beirut must know of them hear things about other hostages partington moved his head again something else about which i have no knowledge you must believe me mrs stone if there are any contacts any negotiations theyd be restricted to the smallest group of people theyd have to be wouldnt they janet sighed wishing she could confront the logic she said what about here in cyprus i dont understand the question theres been a mass exodus from beirut to this island said janet there must be a lot of information passing back and forth people i could talk to partington leaned forward across the desk his face serious there has been a mass exodus he agreed ive heard areas of nicosia and larnaca likened to berlin in and its a pretty good description i mean there are people here in cyprus doing what people always do in a war situation profiting by it we dont get involved and neither should you its crooked and its dangerous and it wont do anything to help your fiance what areas demanded janet what people your father was a senior diplomatic officer to me in jordan someone i like and whom i consider a friend said partington i would be abusing that friendship by getting you involved with such people such places my father has asked you to help said janet jabbing her finger at the letter between them that wouldnt be helping partington said it would be doing the reverse exposing you to pointless danger that i wont do despite her efforts at control janet could not prevent the heat of frustration burning through her this man was her only contact her only hope she realized desperately there must be something she pleaded then hurriedly she added and dont advise me to leave it to people who know what theyre doing everyone tells me to do that too mrs stone said partington in a tone reminiscent of that frustrating lunch at locketts i know its difficult i can understand id like to think something of what you are going through but what other advice can there be look at the situation objectively whatpossibly sensiblycan you do youre quite alone you havent any resources youve no official backing and im a woman cut off janet partington hesitated and then said and yes youre a woman theres no point or purpose in our getting into a sexist or womens liberation discussion about it but the simple fact is that in this situation and in this area of the world as a woman youre at a disadvantage he paused again but continued if its any satisfactionand i cant imagine that it will bea man by himself without any resources and with no official backing would hardly be in an improved position anyway helpless you mean partington considered the question yes i suppose thats exactly what i mean helpless which was precisely how she felt janet realized angry at herself because she thought of it as giving way it had been another round about ride backwards and forwards in the same circle apparently moving but getting nowhere partington as unresponsive as he was remained her only contact she thought again she said it was kind of you seeing me as you have i wish i really do wish that there had been something more positive i could have done said partington i know you asked me not to say it but im very sorry for whats happened id like to accept your invitation said janet partingtons face creased in confusion and then he remembered and said oh yes is tomorrow night still convenient or would you like to call to confirm maybe i should call to confirm the man said im at the churchill janet said and my father particularly asked me officially to register here at the embassy you intend staying then yes why the diplomat asked just as direct im near to where john is adlibbed janet impulsively she added and i have been getting some help and guidance from the americans theyve an embassy here havent they partington sat regarding her steadily for several moments before he said ill see to it that you are officially registered will the churchill be your permanent address here i think so for how long im not sure janet said matching his stare please dont do anything foolish mrs stone i wont this isnt fiction you know not something in a novel you read by the pool or see in a cinema this is reality now it was janet who came forward to stress her seriousness now you must believe me mr partington i dont need reminding just how real it is having someone i love and hope to marry chained up as a hostage like some animal again for several moments there was a silence between them then partington said ill call about tomorrow youre very kind said janet grateful at least that she had the tenuous link into the embassy although she was unsure after this encounter how much practical advantage it would give partington accompanied her back to the entrance and waited with her until the summoned taxiairconditioned againarrived to take her back to achaeans street janet slumped dejected in the back of the vehicle going over in her mind the circular conversation shed had with the man increasingly one word echoed in her mind like another word that reverberated in her mind that night shed met john for the first time at harriets georgetown party helpless it came like a drumbeat helpless helpless helpless and then a second word intruded making the connection helplesswoman helplesswoman janet screwed her hands tight into a fist in renewed frustration suddenly like an additional taunt came the first snatch of a menstrual cramp and she felt even more frustrated she smiled her thanks to the clerk at the churchill who handed her the room key and went automatically to the elevator oblivious to her surroundings punching her floor number automatically she was helpless janet accepted it was pointlessabsurdto try to think otherwise partington had been right accusing her of romanticism the whole episode was some personal fantasy superwoman against the kidnappers based on nothing more than the flimsy hope god how flimsy that she might have got some assistance from her fathers former colleagues but she hadnt janet recognized forcing the objectivity and now she didnt knowdidnt have a cluewhat to do next there was a fresh wash of dejection and another menstrual taunt in her room janet discarded the key on the bed and slumped into the only easy chair gazing sightlessly at the slatted windows could she ask her father to intervene persuade him to call partington from england to try to pressure the man into offering more more of what where was the logic in imagining partington had any more to offer anyway partington was a bona fide first secretary head of chancery not an embassyconcealed intelligence officer janet accepted that as such partington would be shielded from contact with the legations intelligence emplacement a barrier against possible diplomatic embarrassment if any covert activity in a host country became public knowledge what about the lebanese enclaves the man had acknowledged to exist on the island there was little pressure she could expect her father to bring in having them identified janet realized in further defeat her father would side with partington upon the possible dangers rather than trying to help her learn where such places were so unexpected was it that janet jumped at the knock at her door remaining still for several seconds so that the summons came again louder the second time her surprise increased at the sight of two policemen their uniform englishstyle she did not know how to designate rank but from the epaulet markings one appeared to be of high rank mrs stone enquired the senior officer yes she said mrs janet stone yes detective chief inspector zarpas the man said very high rank thought janet through her bewilderment at their presence zarpas nodded sideways sergeant kashianis what do you want janet asked to talk zarpas said wed like to come in janet hesitated confused and unsure what for she said to talk zarpas repeated what about janet was refusing to move back from the door have you something to hide mrs stone i dont know what you mean ill explain if you let us in careful she remembered her father had warned her to be careful she said what proof of identity do you have zarpas a sallowskinned man whose wilting moustache made his long face appear even more mournful looked down at his uniform and then sighing extracted a warrant card from the lefthand breast pocket of his tunic and offered it to her janet stared uncomprehendingly at the greek but then saw that beneath his photograph the man was identified in english by rank still unsure janet stepped back opening the door further inside the room both men remained standing janet regained the easy chair hoping it put her in the most commanding position in the room although not knowing why she needed it zarpas perched on the dressing table stool the sergeant looked at the bed and apparently decided against it remaining upright he took a small pad from one pocket and a pen from another he examined the tip intently as if it were something he had not seen before why are you here on the island mrs stone demanded zarpas at once what right have you to come to my room and ask me questions janet said the right of cyprus law zarpas said easily so why are you here on the island janet did not immediately reply wanting the right answer business she replied at last ah zarpas exclaimed as if the reply were important he looked sideways at the sergeant kashianis was writing very quickly zarpas said what sort of business a friend of mine is missing in the lebanon again zarpas looked at the sergeant appearing to think the reply important and said what is the name of this friend there was no reason why she should not give it she decided john sheridan missing in the bekaa perhaps the what said janet what the hell was this stupidity all about thats where the hashish comes from zarpas said but then youd know that wouldnt you janet shook her head holding her hands briefly out towards the two men i havent got the remotest idea what youre talking about why youre here this conversation is completely unintelligible to me is it mrs stone zarpass disbelief was obvious isnt the with which you earlier today opened a deposit account for the purpose of buying drugs how janet began indignantly but then laughed so thats what this is all about she said relieved at last you didnt answer my question still smiling and shaking her head again janet said no it is not to buy drugs what then doesnt the name john sheridan mean anything to you for the first time zarpas faltered no he said think said janet john sheridan an american the look to the sergeant this time was for assistance kashianis kept his head down over his notebook no zarpas had to concede again with forced patience janet said he is the most recent american to be kidnapped in beirut check with the us embassy here in beirut if you like this still does not explain the or your presence here refused zarpas stubbornly i am john sheridans fiancee said janet i have come here to find out whats being done to get him out with there may be expenses said janet she realized discomfited that the explanation sounded unconvincing john sheridan is an american national yes his job zarpas had recovered supremacy now the embassy said janet awkwardly he worked at the american embassy in beirut wouldnt the responsibility and any expense involved in freeing this man if indeed he is held hostage by one of the religious groups be that of the american government said zarpas yes janet said the awkwardness worsened so why have you arrived in cyprus with to give herself time to think janet said how did you learn about the deposit it is a requirement by law that all large deposits are automatically reported to the authorities said zarpas officiously cyprus does not intend to become a financial center for drug trafficking or a conduit either im not trafficking in drugs erupted janet ive answered every question honestly can i tell you something mrs stone what every criminal i have ever known has sometime or other told me he is being completely honest the he isolated janet why did everything have to be divided superior male inferior female what could a prick do that a cunt couldnt they had to fit together to make something complete at once she became irritated at herself male to female female to male what the fuckwrong worddid it matter she sighedand wished she hadntand said i am drug trafficker i am a she stopped short of saying woman janet picked up a person trying to find out about another person whom she loves not a this time the sergeant looked up to meet his superiors gaze zarpas responded but came immediately back to janet so youve come to cyprus with what you believe to be sufficient money to buy information of which no one else is aware yes janet shouted in fresh indignation wheres the illegality in that abruptlyand disconcertingly because the sad face was not made for such an expressionzarpas smiled poor lady he said sex again janet thought immediately wheres the illegality in that she repeated zarpas leaned back against the dressing table and said on your part none what then dont you have peoplefriends or familytelling you that what youre trying to do is stupid too many shot back janet then youre doubly stupid not to listen its my money its your life shouted back zarpas my choice responded janet just as loud very good the policeman said abruptly softvoiced you really are very good does that mean you dont believe me it means im making no decision he paused and added heavily not yet that sounds like a warning take it to sound how you like can you help me janet demanded suddenly help you cyprus is crowded with lebanese since the civil war said janet eagerly you must have sources zarpas made a sad gesture with his head not immediately replying yours is a marked account mrs stone what does that mean that ill know if theres any abrupt withdrawals or deposits i asked you for help how about advice weve already talked about that go home mrs stone go to wherever home is before you get hurt the policeman hesitated hurt by whoever whatever if thats meant to scare me it doesnt janet said with a defiance she secretly did not feel it should do mrs stone its meant to scare you a lot what about helping me get out of cyprus we dont want you here for whatever reason you are here janet was suddenly overwhelmed by a feeling she could not immediately identify it was an impression of sagging fatigue but it had a form as if she were in an enclosed room from which she was trying to escape by beating against walls which would not yield but were instead closing inexorably in upon her ever tightening she actually straightened in her chair physically trying to slough off the attitude she said all i want is someone to help go home the policeman repeated stonefaced if i dont this isnt a bargaining situation you cant just expel me without reasonable grounds an unexplained deposit of in a cyprus bank account is sufficient reason i have explained it not to my satisfaction no janet said slowly not by yourself you cant make that decision by yourself again this time just momentarily zarpas faltered recovering he said do you imagine my recommendation would not be accepted i shall appeal to my embassy janet said she added im already registered there they know im here zarpas rose to look down upon her he said you are a very stupid woman janet looked up in reply feeling oddly superior despite their positions but said nothing for several moments zarpas waited expectantly but she did not speak imy governmentwill not have you cause any embarrassment to this island i do not intend causing any embarrassment to anyone janet said dont zarpas insisted making the warning positive the slightest embarrassment would be the reason to expel you wouldnt it janet intentionally did not stand to show them from the room and was distressed as soon as they closed the door behind themselves to find that she was physically shaking from the stress of the encounter there was no reason she told herself no reason at all shed fought back as strongly as the policeman had attacked won to a degree definitely no reason then to react like this like a she stopped short of the word refusing to acknowledge it even in her thoughts sexist bastard they were all sexist bastards as positively as she had stopped one slide of thought janet halted another because it had no purpose no point what actually had emerged from the meeting it all revolved around the money the policemans absurd suspicion that she was somehow involved in drug trafficking yours is a marked account she remembered she should have carried it from england in cash and put it in the hotels safe deposit the moment she arrived wise after the event janet told herself what about drawing it out and doing that anyway too late if zarpas were monitoring the money the worse thing imaginable would be to close it with a cash withdrawal trapped she accepted she had no alternative but to leave it where it was until she needed it for the real purpose for which she had brought it if she needed it janet thought in balancing difficult realism the sound at the door did not startle her this time as much as the first because she imagined it to be zarpas returning for some reason the surprise came when she opened the door it was not the policeman but a slightly built compact man with an outofdate crew cut rimless glasses a multicolored check shirt needle cords and brown topsider loafers well lookee here the man declared the accent as well as the expression was clearly american janet positioned her foot as firmly behind the door as she could wishing the room were fitted with a safety chain what do you want a little talk ms stone its been a busy afternoon for little talks said janet with genuine weariness and youve been a busy girl langley is real worried a southerner and proud of it guessed janet the sort who sang rebel songs at parties and had a special recipe for mint juleps with sudden hopefulness irritated at herself janet said have you heard something heard a lot of things ms stone a lot of things careless of any identification this time janet opened the door wider smiling in anticipation and said come in please come in the american did so as if he had the right almost strolling he swiveled on his heel examining the room and said pretty real pretty passingly janet thought the mans affectation to repeat everything was irritating she said what what is it whats what ms stone the news about john the man reached the easy chair and sat heavily thats the problem he said there isnt any a rash of dizziness made janet reach out to the dressing table for support momentarily she closed her eyes against the whirl please she said please dont play word games dont intend to maam dont intend to maam and ms earlier she said who are you who do you think i am i think youre someone from the american embassy here in nicosia attached to the cia janet said recovering i also think youre someone who watches too much american television miami vice a favorite of yours the mans face tightened and janet knew shed scored and was glad she didnt feel dizzy any more it was anger now again what the hell do you think youre doing here he demanded you didnt tell me your name with the sort of shit you can stir lady you must be joking lady to go with maam and ms she said is that what youre frightened of the shit i can stir were frightened for john ms stone were frightened that youre going to do some dumbassed thing and get him killed arent you frightened of that janet swallowed she said im frightened of his being killed certainly like im frightened that youre doing fuckall to stop it happening you got a lot of help and guidance in washington said the man you got told things you really shouldnt have been told so you know that isnt true i know nothing of the sort fought back janet glad now he was lower than her because she enjoyed being above him enjoyed too letting her anger out because it needed to go i got assurances and i got platitudes and its been over a month since he got snatched so where is he if the cia is allsofucking powerful why hasnt john sheridan been found and got out of beirut the american blinked under the assault clearly off balance youve got to understand he started but janet furious now interrupted cut it she said cut the crap about the difficulties and the intricacies and how it should all be left to the experts ive heard it ive heard it until its running out of my ears repetition seemed to be contagious she thought what do you think you can achieve by coming here demanded the man trying to escape sideways from the attack i dont know answered janet honestly i havent been here a day yet its johns life youre playing with its johns life youre playing with janet said tell me convince me by telling me of something positive youve done to get him out that youve made the right contacts and that theres a chance of his being released that you know where he is lady youre a pain in the ass thats exactly what i am agreed janet and im going to remain a pain in your ass and everyone elses ass until i get some fucking action am i supposed to be impressed because you know bad words the offended southerner janet thought furiously she said i dont give a fuck whether youre offended or not theres only one person i want to impress his names john sheridan the man brought his hands lightly together in mocking applause so youre going to poke around larnaca marina and the dives of zenon square and kitieus street and find out something we dont know and show us all how to do it im going to do whatever it takes however it takes to get him back said janet in a body bag janet swallowed against the threat hopefully she said whats the point in our fighting its not going to achieve anything nor is your being here getting in the way help me said janet hopeful still the american shook his head he said langley guessed youd do something like this when you suddenly left washington thats why we set up the arrival check here at the airport there was just one simple message if you did come for me to tell you to get out and stay out which ive done regard that as help its all youre going to get janet straightened irritated at herself now for pleading so you get out she said youve delivered your message the man was slow in standing not wanting the departure to appear to be on her terms remember what ive said lady remember what ive said get out messenger boy he left the room as slowly as hed stood but with his face burning janet almost slammed the door behind him but instead she closed it as quietly as possible she remained with her back pressed against it staring into the room she was shaking again worse than she had after the encounter with the policeman she hadnt known what to expect but certainly she hadnt considered this a procession of men with a procession of threats why not she demanded of herself wasnt that how willsher had behaved in washington and mcdermott in london and partington earlier that day not so openly or so brutally perhaps but there wasnt any real difference damn them she thought damn them all she stared at the telephone when it rang not at first moving to answer it when she did she instantly recognized partingtons voice im most awfully sorry the diplomat said tomorrow isnt as convenient as i thought it might be could we leave it that ill call you again of course janet agreed actually relieved she had larnaca marina to visit and the dives of zenon square and kitieus street as well the repetitious american hadnt been as smart as he obviously thought he was as she replaced the receiver janet realized unhappily that her period had started a woman she thought bitterly i t was raining the storm hurling itself against her window and making black what should have been the squinting brightness of early morning something elsethat this was not a place of perpetual sunshinethat she had forgotten oddly the awareness upset her more than the previous days confrontations shed imagined at least shed remember the weather in an area where shed spent so much time growing up her room overlooked the junction of achaeans with metokhi street and janet stood at the dripsplashed and trickling glass gazing beyond towards the turkish occupation in the center of nicosia on a clear day she supposed she could have actually seen the mountains separating nicosia from kyrenia but now everything was cloaked in bulgebellied clouds anxious to relieve themselves male or female clouds she wondered female they were squatting at least she thought the heat would not be so bad today and at once contradicted herself if the rain didnt let up it could be positively worse steamy and monsoonlike what would a day such as this be like for john wherever he was no air conditioning probably no window or vent to provide even air steamy or monsoonlike maybe not a hole in the ground or a bucket to pee into poor darling said janet aloud my poor darling she was talking to a different ghost she realized abruptly no hank was the ghost hank was dead john wasnt dead she was sure he wasnt dead knew he wasnt dead john was alive alive and waiting to be rescued im here she said unashamedly no longer seeing the darkened rainlashed view beyond the window im trying please believe that im trying john would believe her she knew would trust her not like everyone else janet squeezed her eyes shut against the rain and the imagery not opening them until she turned back into the room the weather didnt matter nothing mattered more than finding the waythe link or the thread or whateverto john and she would find it no threatening policeman with absurd moustaches or threatening american with no name or patronizing diplomat was going to frighten her away beat you she said to them now louder than the first time shed talked to herself but still unashamed im going to beat the lot of you bastards around her the hotel stayed eerily quiet the rain splattered noisily and insistently against the window beat you repeated janet quieter now and more to herself than before a personal encouragement she put on jeans and a baggy workshirt and loafers in the hotel coffee shop where she ordered coffee with rolls janet tried to study everyone around her was she under surveillance from zarpass people or from the americans several times other customers answered her staretwo men hopefullyand very quickly janet stopped trying she was she acknowledged the amateur that she was constantly accused of being so what chance did she have if everyone else was professional none she answered herself another fantasy exercise preposterous to attempt then unsure how the cypriot policeman intended to monitor her movementsbut knowing that hotel cab drivers would be an obvious sourcejanet disdained a taxi deciding instead to rent an avis car she drove towards larnaca twice she stopped at leanto souvenir stalls to let traffic pass and staged another more protracted halt at kosi for more coffee that she did not want by that time the clouds had pulled back to the mountains where they belonged and everywhere was drying out the roads and the houses steaming under the displaced and disgruntled sun janet chose a table outside the cafe which the waiter had to wipe dry as he did the seat and she sat at once and tried to memorize the cars that went by directly after her there were so many that quickly she became confused a feeling of impotence started to rise but she refused to let it grip her what was the point of becoming upset at an inability to do something for which she wasnt trained she entered larnaca on grivas digenis avenue and kept driving eastwards and by the time she passed the zeno stadium she was getting snatches of the sea silvered now by a white sun from an unclouded uncluttered sky she spotted one of the faded and bent direction signs to the beirut ferries at karaolis and demetriou so she went to the left there was a dogsleg she was forced to follow and when janet reached the tjunction she looked for some other marker and almost at once smiled at the sign for kitieus street at last she thought something was becoming easy it had taken long enough she turned left because she could tell it to be the route into the center of the town seeking somewhere to park the car and again practically immediately saw the othello cinema she drove into its car park and despite her previous resolution remained in the car after stopping it alert for any car following her in none did the asphalt was already baked hot underfoot when janet stepped from the car she hurried away from the vehicle and the cinema apprehensive of some challenge against her parking there but none came on kitieus street she hesitated unsure which direction to take until she saw a sign to the marina following it she realized the street led directly into the square that the crewcut unnamed american of the previous afternoon had identified and illogically she felt further encouraged she went down one side of zenon square to emerge on athens street and stopped gazing out over the sea beirut was in a direct line she knew just over a hundred miles only a hundred miles between her and john dear god how she wished it were as easy as that simply measured in distance im trying she thought echoing in her mind her empty bedroom conversation of that morning im trying my darling the marina and pier were very obvious behind the harbor groin janet walked unhurriedly past the hotel and apartment blocks glancing up to the balconies and loggias where oiled people were already spreadeagled and relaxed grilling themselves no worries beyond diarrhea incorrect camera exposure and forgetting to send holiday postcards to their mothers thought janet enviously the bent arm of the pier and the furthest barrier of the marina created an almost enclosed square for the yachts and motorcraft to be moored against the spreadapart fingers of the floating pontoons janet hesitated near the bar named appropriately the marina pub gazing down at the assembly shed found the marina and shed found zenon square and shed found kitieus street and what the hell was she going to do now how from among all the innocent yachtsmen and holidaymakers in the bars and restaurants was she supposed to isolate someone with links to religious fanatics or gangsters in beirut janet fought against this new despair forcing herself forward into the marina just needing the movement all around the boats fittings tinkled and chimed like chattering birds and the floating dock pontoons shifted just slightly but disconcertingly beneath her feet remembering suddenly johns fatbellied boat in which theyd spent so much time the previous summer janet stared about her looking for something like it she took her time before giving up resigned unable to find anything even vaguely resembling it but this was hardly johns sort of place this was designer deckwear and remembering the ice for the drinks before casting off and getting back in time for cocktails janet continued slowly up and down the docks gradually discerning a pattern the crafts were graded the smaller boats assigned the area near the pier but increasing in size finally to the large oceangoing vessels against the far edge of the marina where the offices and chandlers appeared to be janet hesitated trying to encompass the entire area she supposed the small boats to her right were capable of reaching the lebanon those with sails certainly but it would be an uncertain crossing from her limited sailing experience janet guessed the middle pontoon which she had not yet reached was where the yachts began which could comfortably make the journey she went to it and strolled casually seawards head moving from side to side as she studied each mooring the yachts seemed roughly divided equally half open either occupied or preparing to sail half secured and battened near the pontoons end a yacht was open but with its sails reefed and its fenders out journeys end janet read from the stern markings registered at falmouth in the stern a woman lay prostrate on an airmattress a bikini wisped over her nipples and crotch twice as much material employed in the hardscarf protecting her blonde hair from bleaching further in the sun wonderful day said janet the womans eyes opened in apparent surprise she remained lying as she was wonderful day repeated janet the woman moved but slowly easing up on to her elbow and using her other hand to shield her eyes while she squinted up at the pontoon what you sail all the way here from england asked janet unwilling to repeat her fatuous opening for a third time two years ago said the sunbather we leave it here now you have a boat here on the marina janet squatted to take the sun from the other womans eyes shaking her head just looking around and admiring she said how often do you get out the woman shifted bringing her legs up in front of her and wrapping her arms around them not as much as we should unfortunately janet hesitated not knowing how to continue ever get across there she said clumsily jerking her head seawards the woman actually looked beyond the marina and then back again frowning where she demanded lebanon said janet she was handling it all very badly she thought but how could she handle it the woman snorted a laugh incredulous are you serious she demanded i just wondered said janet retreating youd have to be out of your mind to go anywhere near that coastline insisted the woman maybe i am thought janet she said some people must the woman cocked her head curiously to one side and did not respond immediately when she did the words came slowly mad people like i said janet desperately searched for another way to phrase the question but could not find one directly she said know any the woman pulled herself tighter together on the mattress and stared at janet janet guessed the woman was trying to memorize her features and thought oh shit abruptly the woman said whats going on nothings going on insisted janet just chatting who are you english tried janet that wasnt what i asked i can tell youre english stone she said trapped janet stone why so much interest in the lebanon no reason shrugged janet deciding against telling the woman anything just chatting like i said she straightened to relieve the cramp from her legs i dont know anyone whos mad enough to sail to beirut insisted the woman and if i did id be suspicious of them because theres only one reason to go there and thats to smuggle and my husband and i are not smugglers a defense against an unvoiced accusation wondered janet or did the woman suspect her of being an agent provocateur it was immaterial either way she said it was nice talking to you the woman did not reply but remained gazing at her intently janet started to walk away realizing at once she was going in the wrong direction further along the pontoon towards the open sea there appeared to be no more occupied boatsand if there had been janet realized she could not have attempted another conversation of the sort shed just had with the woman whom she guessed would have hurried along immediately to inquire after shed finishedand to retrace her steps meant passing directly in front of her janet guessed the woman would be staring at her and saw that she was when she turned at the pontoon head to walk back at the yacht janet hesitated and said bye now the woman nodded but didnt speak janet continued on tensed against a sensation going beyond helplessness to hopelessness stop it she demanded of herself stop it stop it stop it shed only just started hadnt started so it was infantile to become depressed because the first person to whom shed tried to speak and spoken to like some mental defective at that hadnt been the premier hostagefreeing tour operator of the middle east worse than infantile stupidly infantile at the larger linking pontoon janet turned and looked back in the direction from which shed just come the bikiniclad woman on journeys end was standing now gazing towards her for her own satisfactionand not even sure what that satisfaction wasjanet slightly raised her hand and jiggled her fingers in the smallest of farewell waves before going consciously out of sight towardsand behindthe larger boats it was right that she should not become depressed so soon but just as important not to continue in the gauche manner in which she had just behaved one more episode like that coupled with the sort of gossip janet guessed to be the glue that kept a marina like this bonded together and her next encounter with the disbelieving chief inspector zarpas would probably be in a police cell but how janet halted at the next outthrust leg towards the sea looking up along the larger boats but not making towards them yet journeys end registered in falmouth she remembered mistake upon mistake it was always possible of course that an englishregistered vessel with englishspeaking occupants could have the sort of links she sought but other registrations and other nationalities were far more likely such as cyprus obviously the lebanon itself or syrian or greek turkish too although those would not be moored on this part of the island still too wide a spread she thought gazing generally over the marina there had to be over a hundred yachts moored here at least janet tried to think of a way to narrow her search down to the most obvious choices smiling when the idea came to her language she decided so what were the most likely languages french had been the tongue of the lebanon before the outbreak of the troubles in the early s but since then the country had been awash with syrians and iranians and palestinians arabic then as a second choice maybe no longer second but equal janet felt a brief pop of encouraging relief french and arabic and she spoke both of them unwilling to be seen by the englishwoman janet ignored the immediate pontoon going on until the second before setting out along it behind the protective hedge of two sets of anchored and tethered vessels as before she walked slowly intent upon names and registrations up one side and down the other she walked never once seeing a registration to fit her idea twice she heard french being spoken both times from yachts identified from french ports and janet realized she had not reduced her search as effectively as she had imagined both vessels were crowded with bathingcostumed groups already drunk and she decided it was pointless attempting any sort of conversation on the last possible pontoon three berths along janet saw a blueandwhitehulled boat listing latakia as its home port the name sea mist was picked out in arabic script below the title in roman print which janet presumed was required by some international maritime agreement the sails were stowed but there was a man in the stern hunched over what appeared to be an engine flap he was balding and a sagging stomach hung over his belt straining the tshirt to contain it marhaba said janet the glance was barely perceptible but janet knew he had seen her he gave no response her dismissal as a woman janet recognized she said h ather illak without bothering to look up the workman said no it belongs to someone else heloo it is adequate how did a western woman learn arabic he looked up at last curiosity winning blatantly studying her body i teach she replied in english also but not arab ways he said dismissive again he moved to go back over the engine cowling syrian registered said janet stopping him so do you sail there often of course he was leaning against the flap but not bothering with the engine now i am told it is dangerous not the syrian coast lebanon then awaih bas meen faraa maoh lubnan he said testing her by reverting to arabic some care about the lebanon janet answered him at once not enough do you ever sail there the man lounged inside the yacht looking at her for several moments but not replying then he said the lebanon you mean janet nodded again there was a hesitation the pontoon heaved beneath her feet and she saw that the tshirt was stained not just with engine oil but with sweatmarks under the arms with intentional awkwardness the man said i wouldnt know bastard decided janet she thought of the word in arabic too wondering how he would react if she openly called him akrout she said some must i suppose you worked this dock long there was a shoulder lift the only response janet could feel the perspiration making its own pathway down her back a lot of it was not because of the sun trying to stir his obvious chauvinism janet said it would take a brave man to risk sailing there or a fool he said not responding to the taunt either do you know such people demanded janet direct once more the exaggerated shrug came again he was playing with her janet decided acting out his own strange charade perhaps you know where such people gather persisted janet the man looked beyond her generally towards the town around he said it was time to be even more direct janet guessed she had nothing to lose she said i have in sterling i would give to learn the names of places where such people gather the mans lips parted in a smile made unpleasant by two teeth missing in the front i have heard things he allowed like what you said janet took the money two notes and one from her shoulder bag and folded them to make the amount look thicker she did not offer the small bundle to the man he held out his hand the names janet insisted keeping hers by her side the man said nothing remaining with his palm outstretched janet peeled one note from the remainder and passed it over the sliver of water separating them the man just stopped himself snatching at it theres the marina pub he said jerking his head back towards athens street a place called the rainbow on kitieus street ive heard another meeting place is the archontissa restaurant although at night not during the day and at night theres the byzantium restaurant it has a nightclub too and the sanacosta mostly around the center of town although the byzantium is out a bit along artemis avenue i can find them said janet eagerly she was about to pass over the rest of the money and then hesitated what about the name of a person she asked do you know anyone the man made a beckoning movement with his hand for the other as janet gave it to him there was a head shake of refusal dont know any people he said thank you for the places at least said janet it was actually working she thought excitedly as she climbed from the marina at last it was working and she was getting somewhere not just one place but several surely from all the names she had she was going to be able to find somebody because it was the nearest janet went first to the marina pub at the end of the pier it was just past midday when she got there it was already jostled with a combination of sunpink tourists and weathertanned occupants of the marina through the expansive windows janet could make out the yacht of the hostile englishwoman although she was no longer on the air mattress the workman on the sea mist was back at the engine hatch janet got a seat near one of the windows and ordered kokkineli rose gazing around she wanted someone who was resident on the marina at least and janet realized at once that at this time of the day the place was too crowded to make any guesses and certainly not any approaches she made the wine last finally ordering another andalthough she was not really hungryjustified her lingering occupation of the table by choosing a sandwich of spitted lamb in an envelope of pita bread it was almost three oclock before the clientele thinned she attempted to get into conversation with a group at the bar whom she overheard talking in both french and arabic but was rebuffed she got a friendlier reception from two men and a woman talking french but after half an hour of conversation discovered they were cruising from cannes had never been to the lebanon and had no intention of attempting to do so her hopes soared on her third approach almost at once the couple talked of being lebanese actually residents of beirut eagerlyalthough not showing itshe let them lead the conversation only occasionally risking the intrusion of a question not wanting to hear the story that gradually emerged and even more unwilling as it did so to confront the gradual descent of her hopes the man had been a highrise store owner whose premises had been situated literally between the maronite christians and sunni moslems when the war broke out with those first shots in april in the civil war which was not a civil war any longer because no one knew what it was any more he had been cautiousa halfboastful smile at this stage of the historyalthough he had never imagined who could it would degenerate into what it had now become but theyd been able to get out so little of their capital far too little theyd already had their yacht good fortune when there was so little which was now their home their livelihoodthe highrise in the most desirable district of beiruttheyd seen destroyed by the successive exchange of gunfire and mortar and artillery until it had been cut from its multimillion multimillion in any currency you like size as if some giant hand had been slicing pieces off a special cake theyd fled before the anarchy of course risked just one return the formerly proud skyscraper had been a disappointing bump of concrete and steel the girders and the rusting frames appropriately like the bones of something long dead and picked clean like things were picked clean by vultures they had two souvenirs the front door key and a fish mold the vultures had somehow inexplicably missed in the rubble the woman said shed never been able to use the mold again how could she both smiled and accepted janets offer of more drinks the woman kokkineli like janet was drinking the man ouzo which he milked white with water with obvious nostalgia janet clung to the fact that she was establishing contact with lebanese and obstinately refused to accept the encounter as a failure she was met with shrugs when she asked if they maintained contacts with anyone in beirut still deciding her sad story matched their sad story she volunteered an account of herself and sheridan exiles know everything about the countryand the cityfrom which they were exiled and the couple immediately recognized sheridans name the woman clutched janets hand and said she was so sorry janet smiled her gratitude as if it were the first time anyone had ever expressed regret it wont work what youre trying to do warned the man i need guidance a name cut off janet unwilling to get back on to the carousel the only people who go back and forth are smugglers said the man there are a lot of shortages in beirut things people need and for which they are willing to pay im looking for an intermediary someone who knows not a priest i paid a man once conceded the lebanese it was before we went back ourselves i wanted to know how badly damaged my block was he sniggered an unamused laugh actually had thoughts of going back and trying to run it again can you believe that what man where demanded janet disinterested in rhetoric nicos said the man he called himself nicos what family name said janet with intense urgency the lebanese shook his head just nicos nothing more than nicos hes careful you see where persisted janet the lebanese gestured behind him towards athens street there is a hotel the four lanterns he said at night there is a discotheque he is often there practically on zenon square remembered janet on one of the side roads leading towards the sea will you take me to him uncertain looks passed between the couple the man said it is not good i dont think we should get involved just an introduction pleaded janet not even that just point him out to me looks were exchanged again the woman said why not well point him out conceded the man thank you said janet swallowing she felt fullup ballooned with satisfaction janet offered more drinks but they chose coffee instead janet joined the woman with glykos the sweetest of the turkish preparations but the man took sketos without sugar janet sat patiently through the production of photographs admiring the skycraper before its destruction and pictures of the couples summer home in the lebanese mountains the lack of formal introduction between them appeared to register at the same time with some small ceremony the man took a card from his wallet identifying himself as mohammed kholi and janet repeated her name apologizing for not carrying cards kholi said he remembered her name from the accounts of herself and sheridan at kholis suggestion they left the marina bar and wandered along the harbor janet asked about their yacht and kholi pointed to one of the furthest arms of the marina and said it was blue with a white superstructure and could she see it the boats seemed to be predominantly blue but janet thought she isolated it politely she said it looked very nice so completely different from what ive always been accustomed complained mrs kholi like living in a box i hate it youd better become accustomed to it remarked kholi realistically kholi said they were too early for the discotheque and invited janet to be their guest for the rest of the afternoon and although she did not want to drink or eat anything more she said shed be delighted to accept kholi bundled the two women into a taxi and sat beside the driver before giving a destination that janet did not hear they drove away from town with the sea to their right and at the junction with timayia avenue janet saw the direction to dhekelia best hotel in larnaca assured kholi when they arrived at the palm beach the man chose their seats in the covered balcony overlooking the sea and insisted upon a bottle of arsinoe white wine janet sipped it and said it was excellent managing to control any facial reaction to its sweetness on the second glass kholi pressed janet upon what she hoped to achieve janet replied honestly that she was not sure just information she said anything more than the sort of silencethe not knowingthat there is now dont expect too much from this man nicos warned kholi all he had to do in my case was walk along a street and look at a building to see how badly damaged it was i wont expect too much promised janet kholi offered dinner but janet refused anxious to get to the club and the other woman said she was not hungry either kholi said it was a pity because he thought the palm beach did the best lamb on the island it was eight before they moved and janet thought abruptlywondering why it had taken so longthat she was still wearing the same jeans and flat shoes in which shed left nicosia that morning and she had not even washed her face or repaired her minimal makeup since then there was nothing she could do about it now apart perhaps from rinsing her face in the lavatory but that would mean making up again so why bother janet recognized the route on the return journey deciding she had oriented larnaca in her mind now kholi stopped the cab near the sun hall hotel waving away janets offer to settle the fare and led them protectively into the nightclub entrance of the four lanterns where again he insisted on paying it catered very much to tourists realized janet the moment she entered there was a disc jockey booth alongside a deserted stage in front was a circular dance area over which hung the sort of multifaceted revolving glass dome that reflects light from variously aimed and colored spotlights there were oases of tables illuminated by candles in round pots and hedged by tub seats and around the wall which dipped and undulated into the room were bench seats that met other tables around each of which on the room side were more tub seats the bar was the brightest area in the discotheque with more lights and more multifaceted reflecting glass behind the barmen bottles were racked directly in front of long highly polished sheets of further reflecting glass kholi led the way to the bar and three adjoining stools janet examined herself in the bar mirror and decided that in this light the fact that she had been away from a wash basin and a makeup bag all day was not as noticeable as she had feared it would be janet declined any more alcohol grateful at seeing perrier but wishing it had been iced when it was served the club was only half full but the music was stridently loud more to attract waverers outside in the street than for the immediate enjoyment of those whod already paid their entrance fee janet and the kholis attempted conversation but the volume defeated them and eventually they abandoned the effort remaining side by side and outofplace in their surroundings janet felt distinctly uncomfortable it was ten oclock when kholi nudged and gestured towards the far end of the bar nearest the door the man standing there was young not much older than twenty janet guessed and very aware of himself preening to the mirrors reflection the deep and even suntan was accentuated by the way he was dressed tight yellow shirt smooth around his flat waist white trousers matchingly tight around hips moving in time to the music his hair was very long and curled low over his neck around which was looped a thin gold chain when he gestured for a drinkperrier janet noticedthe light struck off a stone in a ring on his left hand the smile of thanks flashed almost as much as the ring stone nicos whispered kholi unnecessarily introduce me urged janet despite their earlier agreement the lebanese hesitated looking for guidance to his wife who grimaced with the corners of her mouth down in a sowhat expression kholi moved cupping janets arm to move her with him she followed the man around the crush of the bar and saw nicos turn and look without any recognition at kholis touch to his arm the mans face remained empty despite kholis mouthtoear explanation only opening in recollection when kholi took the earlier department store photograph from his pocket and offered it to the man she wants something out of beirut too said kholi indicating janet for the first time nicos looked at her janets impression of being mentally undressed was strong closer the selfassured smile was even brighter what demanded the man somewhere quieter janet said the smile widened sounds interesting janet felt herself sweating with the sort of discomfort shed known talking to the arrogant crewman you interested in a business deal an explosion of music kept the answer from her realizing she had not heard nicos repeated im interested in everything business janet repeated in further insistence theres a quieter bar upstairs in the hotel the man suggested we can get a return ticket for here i shant be coming back said janet n icos led the way into the upstairs bar and to a table overlooking the nowdarkened sea and announced i will take zivania janet order the brandy for him and another perrier for herself conscious of his changed attitude there had been a swagger when he had left the downstairs club but here without an audience there was no pretense she was glad as if in confirmation of her thoughts he said seriously what is it this business in beirut janet talked intently alert for his reaction he sat with his hands around his glass but not drinking and not looking directly back at her either his eyes down to the table as if he were deep in thought when she finished he did not speak immediately well she demanded can you help his eyes came up to her at last i dont know he said simply janet frowned at the unexpected honesty you do have contacts in beirut dont you some he said i dont know if they could help on this though will you try nicos shrugged and said before it was just to look at a building take a photograph this is different i accept that dangerous how much the smile flashed briefly just information right if he is ok whereabouts in beirut hes being held the whereabouts particularly nothing declared the man nothing payment on results he said in another announcement i will try to find out where he is being held see if i can get a photograph to prove it if i do that then i get if i discover nothing i get nothing janet smiled tentatively i did not expect that she admitted it is fair very fair so we agree oh yes janet said urgently very much we agree when can you go nicos held up his hand stopping her there is more to discuss he said i have to find someone to take me across make arrangements to get in yes janet said cautiously there will be expense janet hesitated how much the shrug came again i do not know how much they will ask there is always the risk of losing the boat of getting shot even you must have some idea nicoss eyes were fixed on the table again i will need to make a deal on the spot not be able to go back and forth to discuss it of course how about this suggested the man i take trust me to be honest i will tell you what the boat costs and what the bribes cost and what is left over comes off the weve agreed if i cant find out anything i give you back whats left fair again fair again janet agreed how long to get the money tomorrow the man nodded then tomorrow i start i am very grateful said janet i havent achieved anything yet for agreeing to try said janet they arranged for him to come to the hotel at ten the following morning and janet left she tried to think objectivelyhe was right he hadnt achieved anything yetbut she found it difficult to control the euphoria everyone had sneered and laughed and dismissed her but shed done it shed made a contact and he was going to go into beirut and find something out about john she just knew he would it was near midnight when she got back to the hotel and janet sagged with tiredness despite which she bathed wanting to relax as much as remove the dirt of the day but when she went to bed she still found it difficult to sleep managing little more than to catnap throughout the night she got up just after it was light staring out over the gradually awakening city impatient for the hours to pass until nicos arrived she did not bother with breakfast and was down in the foyer waiting for him half an hour before the agreed meeting he arrived promptly on time subdued today in gray trousers and white shirt and once more without any swagger he carried a briefcase the sort that locked by coded numerals adding to the businesslike impression they took a taxi to the bank and he waited while she sought out the assistant manager who had taken her deposit and arranged the withdrawal of the janet accepted the money in a thick manila envelope and handed it straight to nicos who put it in the briefcase and twirled the numbers how long asked janet on the pavement outside the bank i dont know said nicos you are going to remain at the churchill yes ill contact you there as soon as there is something just wait it might take time be as quick as you can she urged ill be as quick as it is safe to be he said back at the hotel janet realized practically in surprise that all she could now do was wait she telephoned england to assure her father she was all right holding back with difficulty the temptation to tell him about nicos saying merely that she thought she had made a useful contact and was hopeful of it leading to some sort of news about john in the afternoon she sunbathed by the pool managing to doze after her fitful night and had just returned to her room when partington called from the embassy extending his delayed invitation for dinner the following night janet accepted deciding she could always cancel if there were news from nicos and took care the following morning to tell both the reception desk clerk and the switchboard operator that she would be by the pool if anyone tried to get in touch with her she became bored with sunbathing by lunchtime she remained by the pool to eat but in the afternoon risked leaving the hotel briefly to walk to laiki yitonia to watch the lace makers at their openair stalls and wander through the silk booths after an hour she became worried that she might have missed contact from nicos and hurried back to the churchill there were no messages partingtons wife was named anne she was a constantly moving flustered woman who reminded janet of her own mother and the evening became a further reminder of how fervently her mother had welcomed visitors from outside the insular claustrophobic embassy enclaves in which they had served abroad the beef was proudly served all there is here is lamb you know and partington poured french wine anne partington said she hoped janet didnt mind but william had told her about the kidnap and wasnt it awful but she was sure it would all be all right when his wife was in the kitchen preparing the coffee the attache asked how much longer she intended staying im not sure said janet have you seen anyone from the american embassy yes janet said there did not seem any purpose in elaborating what news was there none said janet they warned i was interfering that i should get out its good advice twentyfour hours earlier the repetitive attitude would have depressed her but it didnt now janet said ive only just got here partington looked towards the kitchen door and then back to janet he said there was a secure radio patch today with beirut janet came forward across the table and i only talked generally about waite and the journalist and then i asked about any other nationals the man faltered i dont know why i began this conversation what do you mean janet demanded anxiously just that that there wasnt any point theres no news there was more than that janet insisted reacting to instinct everyone is very depressed there partington said a grudging concession what did they say that it was difficult to get the smallest scrap of reliable information more than that janet said again partington shook his head refusing to meet her eyes im sorry he said for christs sake what is it the diplomats eyes came up to hers they said it was hopeless absolutely hopeless that theres no way to establish any sort of link the whole place is a shambles lost ive made a contact thought janet triumphantly she said thank you for bothering to ask the conversation was at an end when anne partington returned with the coffee proper stuff not this turkish sugar water that rots your teeth the souvenir snapshots were produced one of her parents with the partingtons on some horseback expedition in jordan even then janet saw her father appeared formal in a very dark riding habit anne said they were wonderful people and janet agreed that they were and the woman said if she intended staying long she should come to supper again and janet said that would be nice and that perhaps they could talk on the telephone janet drove as fast as she felt safely able back to the hotel hurrying anxiously to the concierge desk trying to isolate her pigeonhole on the keyboard before she reached it there were no messages the following morning not wanting another day by the pool janet walked to kyprianos square and went around the byzantine museum trying unsuccessfully to become interested in the icons she was back at the churchill by noon the concierge smiled up at her approach shaking his head before she reached the desk after lunch she strolled to the old quarter and toured the sixteenthcentury venetian walls and bought a cheap red clay replica of a spouted oil lamp deciding it would be something they could keep after john was released to remind themselves of the whole episode when it was all over there was nothing waiting for her when she got back to the hotel janet ate dinner early because she became fed up with the four walls of her hotel room protracted her coffee with an unwanted brandy and was back in her room by nine dallas was on television with greek subtitles she watched ten incomprehensible minutes and then turned it off in bed with the light out she stared sightlessly at the ceiling conscious as the hours passed of the hotel and then the city growing quiet around her she finally slept after a fashion but there was always part of her consciousness alert so that when daylight came she felt as if she had not slept at all she was the first by the pool with her choice of loungers and umbrellas she lay on her back then on her front then on her back then on her front again she checked her watch anxious for lunch to break the tedium and was unable to believe it was only ten oclock when she checked with the pool attendant she found her watch was fast it was only ten to the hour janet was lying on her back again when the shadow came between herself and the sun breaking the brightness despite her closed eyes she lay waiting for it go as the person passed but it didnt and so she opened her eyes initially unable to see who it was the reception desk told me i would find you here said you were waiting for a message janet pulled herself into the shadows of her umbrella raising the back of her lounger as she did so better able to sit up detective chief inspector zarpas was in civilian clothes today a fawn summerweight suit already creased and with his shirt collar undone and stretched apart from the knot of his tie janet was surprised at the contrast from his smartness of their last encounter she wondered where sergeant kashianis was with his notebook hello she said who are you expecting a message from mrs stone janet hesitated an embassy she said as the thought came to her either the english or the american ive talked with representatives of both who else have you talked with i dont understand the question zarpas looked searchingly around him and smiled permission to take an upright chair from a nearby table he brought it back sat gratefully down and took a photograph from his pocket offering it to her not him perhaps janet looked at the official frontfaced photograph of the man she knew as nicos thinking how similar it was to the official pictures of john sheridan as if they were all taken by the same photographer a hollowness formed deep in the pit of her stomach why should i have expected to hear from him thats what i want you to tell me said the policeman i said i didnt understand said janet desperately didnt he even give you a name please pleaded janet nicos supplied zarpas nicos kholi janet closed her eyes briefly hoping the policeman would imagine it was a reaction to the sun the hollow feeling grew worse a gouging sensation with difficulty trying to convince herself she was clinging to a thread of truth janet said i do not know anyone named nicos kholi how about mohammed kholi and his wife who hang around larnaca marina a lot stubbornly janet shook her head zarpas sighed pulling at the ends of his drooped moustache with his right hand he said mrs stone we know all about the withdrawal the assistant manager has made a nearpositive identification from that photograph as being that of the man who was with you when you took the money all in cash from your account because it was such a large withdrawal the numbers of the notes were recorded after we arrested kholi in larnaca this morning we went back to his apartment we found all in notes the numbers matched against those supplied by your bank oh christ said janet despairingly to go into beirut after your fiance yes nodded janet tightly after the mother and father told you a story of losing everything in the war showed you photographs yes said janet again theyre very good at it said zarpas done it twice before are they lebanese zarpas snorted a laugh greek cypriots he said theyve never been to beirut in their lives his name is not mohammed either hes a tour guide around the ruins at paphos when he isnt conning drinks out of sympathetic tourists with his ruined refugee story he bought a lot of drinks that night it was an investment wasnt it why was nicos arrested zarpas hesitated and said he picked up an australian girl at a discotheque in larnaca slept with her when she woke up all her money travelers checks and jewelery were gone so was he usually the girls are too embarrassed to complain and explain she wasnt took us back to the discotheque and identified him we found a necklace most of her money and her travelers checks along with your stuff at the place he shares with his parents lucky girl said janet unthinkingly not really said zarpas solemnly hes got syphilis itll take some time to see whether she has too janet tried to think of something to say and couldnt zarpas said well need you to make out a formal complaint for a charge to be brought what about the australian girl she thinks shes contracted venereal disease reminded the policeman shes making every accusation she can think of so youve got a case zarpas stared pointedly at her dont be stupid no said janet determinedly the publicity could be dangerous for john and make her look naive too stupid like the man was already accusing her of being but for different reasons its janet said nothing if you dont make out a formal complaint you cant recover the weve got back what about the others who were tricked they wouldnt formally complain either neither will i said janet stubbornly well try to spare you as much embarrassment as possible zarpas promised probing for her reluctance i wont do it whatever accusations the other woman makes the maximum nicos could get is a year which he wont itll be six months top more likely three set out zarpas with a charge of willful deception in the sum of which we could bring if you complain i could get the whole family off the streets for more than a year janet shook her head her mouth tight together the silence echoed between them zarpas broke it i felt sorry for you the first time didnt like bullying you although i had to you know my feelings now i despise you mrs stone i think you are a spoiled rich stupid woman posturing like someone out of a cheap book im not any of that janet tried in weak defense get out of cyprus we dont want you here wont have you here have you ever heard of an expression called stitching up no its what policemen do when they know someone is guilty but cant prove it they arrange incontrovertible evidence to get a conviction on something else elaborated zarpas thats what im prepared to do with you im prepared to fix a reason to get you expelled from this island if you dont leave under your own volition i actually want to stitch you up no janet shouted careless of the looks that came from around the pool thirty minutes later after their hostile parting janet lay face down on her bed weeping uncontrollably for the first time since sheridans kidnap both hands clutching her pillow and pulling it into her face how she said how j anet was lying stiffly on her back her eyes open when the maid came into the room in the morning and for several moments the girl didnt realize the roomor the bedwas occupied so still was janet the maid gave a tiny mew of surprise and backed away apologizing giggling near the door in her embarrassment janet remained where she was scarcely aware of the intrusion scarcely after another nearsleepless night aware of anything shed gone through all the emotionsanger and frustration and helplessness and despair and back to anger againuntil now she was used up quite empty wrong to be that way she told herself that was how she had collapsed when hank had died when shed given up wouldnt give up this time it would be weakwomanlike tried to intrude into her mind but she refused to let itto give up so shed been conned always a possibility shed actually be warned against it but it would be immature to accept the first setback as a disaster and give up again although in a different way what realistically had she lost five thousand pounds a lot of money but not the end of the world certainly not the end of john sheridans life also she supposed shed lost face and credibility in the eyes of a cyprus policeman and about that she couldnt give a shit apart from the difficulty that his threat might cause her she simply had to try again janet got out of bed and spent a long time under the shower trying to wash away the lingering disappointment by ten shed had another hire car delivered and by tenthirty she was on the road to larnaca not bothering with the attempts of the previous journey to spot any cars which might be following her because shed already accepted the futility of that in larnaca still unsure how to proceed janet decided upon more reconnaissance because the arab boatworker had told her the byzantium restaurant was away from the center of the town she drove on to locate artemis avenue and then the gathering spot that had been identified to her although it was nearly lunchtime it appeared practically deserted the nightclub annex obviously was shuttered and unlit janet made a threepoint turn to drive back in the direction of the town center but when she asked directions she discovered that the sanacosta was even further away on the dhekelia road along which the kholi family had taken her to soften her up for the deception as she passed the palm beach hotel janet became aware that she was actually blushing embarrassed at how easily shed been tricked practically deserved it in fact right then to feel embarrassed but the other feelings of that long night hadnt been necessary the sanacosta seemed even more deserted than the restaurant on artemis avenue and janet reluctantly saw that if she were going to attempt contact in either she would have to wait until the evening she returned to the town center and left the vehicle as before in the othello cinema car park the rainbow was busy although not as crowded as the marina pub had been janet ordered kokkineli and remained standing at the bar gazing around this was not really the way she forced herself to admit this was the way to get laughed at or conned again maybe but without a better sort of introductionthe proper sort of introduction by someone who knew the right peopleshe was wasting her time imagining movement was productive activity in fact who then she didnt know anyone apart from the hostile unnamed american and he certainly wasnt going to provide any introductions yes she did know someone janet gulped at her drink and then decided she did not want to finish it anyway leaving her glass halffilled on the bar she hurried out into kitieus street and walked around the square to the marina not able from the level at which she was walking to establish whether the sea mist was still at its moorings she glanced along the earlier pontoon as she hurried by and saw that the english yacht and its bikiniclad sunbather had gone with two pontoons still to go janet faltered and then stopped able to see now the other mooring she was seeking the space was occupied by a different vessel a highbridged motorcruiser big game lines upright in their prepared sockets two fighting seats still with their belts and harnesses in the stern she could not see anyone aboard but some sort of motor was running pumping bilge water out in little spurts disappointment rose within her she remained where she was for several moments and then turned back towards the entrance to the marina and saw him the arab was just beyond the marina wire looking away in the direction of the pier as if he were searching for someone he wore the same stained tshirt as before she hurried along the slatted heaving pontoon anxious he should not walk away before she reached him almost within hailing distance he looked into the marina and saw her too his face opened in frowned recognition marhaba she said out of breath the lady who speaks good arabic i thought you had gone gone he appeared apprehensive janet nodded back towards the mooring the yacht you were on the other day its sailed i fix engines said the man i misunderstood i thought you were a crewman the man hitched himself on to a low wall one leg swinging and youre still here too janet nodded still looking she said cautiously no more mistakes she promised herself he gestured generally in towards the town they could both see the marina bar what happened no luck she said such people do get there sometimes said the man urgently janet abruptly gauged the cause of his uncertainty the arab thought she was going to demand her money back just as quickly she said im sure they do i wasnt doubting you he relaxed visibly not easy to find he said thats why im glad i ran into you again he tensed again slightly why janet indicated the bar in which she had been tricked i am not going to get anywhere trying to find people by myself am i i need more than just places the man looked away from her to the ground janet saw for the first time that he wasnt wearing shoes his feet were horny and calloused as if he never did very quietly practically to himself he said maybe it is possible what she demanded what may be possible the arab waved towards the marina and said any idea how much those sorts of yachts cost janet forced herself to be patient realizing it would have to be at his pace no she said thousands he said half a million some of them easily a lot of money janet agreed to keep the conversation going would you take a yacht costing that much somewhere where it might get damaged destroyed even probably not dear god what sort of game was the awkward bastard playing now always important to consider the cost of things awareness registered with her janet said im prepared to pay for help for a proper introduction pay more than last time but its got to work the man looked back to her smiling his gaptoothed smile keep thinking about money he suggested what sort of boats dont cost half a million and can sail much more safely in lebanese waters i dont began janet and then stopped fishing boats she said big industry here in cyprus fishing lot of boats how much janet asked directly fed up with the constant pirouettte what exactly do you want to meet a man men who go there who know people who can find out things what sort of things she would have to tell him there is a man a hostage i want to find out about him the arabs face clouded that will not be easy i understand that dangerous perhaps the people i am thinking about will not want to do it will not be able to do it he said ask janet pleaded the man nodded head bent again in apparent thought he said i will ask now he looked up squinting against the sun in the cloudless sky now the boats are out not yet returned from the morning catch he said professionally when late afternoon maybe if i can find them janet guessed the vagueness was being intentionally introduced she said one hundred pounds he shook his head sadly for something like this two hundred one hundred and fifty countered janet and that must be for an introduction to people who can really help i wont pay for nothing two hundred repeated the man she was in no position to bargain and he knew it conceded janet she said two hundred but its got to be for something definite a positive worthwhile introduction i cant guarantee that they will agree not for something like this ive accepted that janet reminded him tonight in the square said the arab seven youll know something by then youll have the money it would mean driving back to nicosia thought janet but she had nothing else to do until that nights appointment she said ill have the money ill try to have arranged something there was none of the euphoria during this journey back that there had been on the previous occasion when janet thought she had made a contact it looked promising certainly but then so had the encounter with someone whod turned out to be a syphilitic thief this time shed want more be less gullible im learning thought janet expensively but learning janet did not bother to go through the assistant manager this time because the amount was so small joining a line for an ordinary counter withdrawal from the hotel she telephoned england to give her parents assurance about her safety dismissing her fathers query about her hopefulness during the last call by quickly saying that the approach that had looked so good then had turned out to be nothing which was not really a lie she lunched by the pool and that afternoon lay by it for the first time not feeling bored right not to become euphoric or even excited but borrowing a word from the telephone conversation to england she decided she was allowed to be hopeful unsure what to expect that evening janet dressed once more in jeans and an evening shirt and flat shoes she chose a handbag with a long strap which she could loop across her body and at the moment of departure stood looking at the money she had withdrawn from the bank impulsively she stuffed it into the rear pocket of her jeans not her handbag shed made the withdrawal in notes and it lay flat and unobtrusive the route now was very familiar to her cautiously she had allowed herself more than enough time but there were no traffic holdups so she was early she parked in her accustomed place and strolled along the front and cut up to the square from the seaward side she saw him at once he was sitting on a bench near the tourist information office hed changed into a blue workshirt faded but clean lightcolored baggy trousers that had long ago lost any crease and opentoed openheeled sandals janet knew he had not seen her and so for a few moments she remained in the shadow of a large and unidentified building watching him he looked very relaxed apparently quite content for her to seek him not bothering himself to find her he saw her when she began to approach smiling but not standing when she reached the bench he patted it for her to sit she remained looking down at him for a few moments and then lowered herself on to it leaving a wide gap between them well she said at once he nodded satisfied with himself i have found people who are prepared to talk to you they can find something out that is for you to decide when you meet them tonight yes right away we had a deal which was for proper useful contact janet said remembering the lost you get nothing until i meet your people she paused realizing that the bargaining positions could be tilting in her favor now and that they can do something she added he looked steadily at her not responding for a while then he said you have a car yes well need a car its out of town and she would be in it with him by herself thought janet recalling the obvious sexual examination of their first encounter where she asked apprehensively about five kilometers on the road to dhekelia even the same route as before janet said what are the arrangements there are three men who jointly own a boat said the man they sail out of here although they live nearer to dhekelia they fish the mullet it is better on the lebanese coast they say they know people do you believe them the shoulders came up and down expansively who believes he said who indeed janet agreed are you frightened to come with me the man asked should i be janet asked avoiding question with question no why did you ask then youre a woman he said openly that has no importance if you are sure it was becoming pointlessly coquettish on his part decided janet wanting to shift direction she said how are you called he hesitated and she waited curiously at last he said haseeb haseeb what just haseeb first nicos now haseeb no family names thought janet she said what are we waiting for haseeb i will get my money if i get what i want he rose decisively and janet followed him up from the bench which direction he asked janet led away from the square and along kitieus street to the cinema car park it had filled up by now with patrons vehicles many sloppily parked so it was difficult for her to maneuver out knowing the direction from her previous reconnaissance janet turned left even before she reached the square where theyd met she was conscious of his body odor permeating the car janet waited until they were running parallel with the sea on makarios avenue before slightly lowering the window on her side hot night he said seeing what she had done very it is not for haseeb said as they got on to the dhekelia road he shifted as he spoke using the back of her seat as a handhold to turn in his own seat to look into the back of the vehicle janet pulled away from any supposed accidental touch and said what are you looking for nothing he said turning back it had been her handbag she guessed in those brief moments alone in the car in the cinema park shed put it beneath her seat they passed the palm hotel and the sanacosta restaurant and nightclub and all the other hotels necklacing the seafront road the concentration of light began gradually to diminish very quickly becoming just the occasional pinprick of a local house or the rickety uncertain illumination of a shanty nontourist bar not long now haseeb said it was so dark now it was difficult for janet to distinguish him across the other side of the car good she said although dark inside the car it was a clear night outside the moon so bright it marked a glittered reflection against the rolling sea to her right through her open window janet could just hear the hissed growl of its arrival against the shore engines rough he said expertly dear god dont let the car break down thought janet she said it goes tappets haseeb said janet had no idea what he was talking about she said how much further haseeb gestured vaguely ahead just around the bend hed said five kilometers janet remembered theyd traveled much more than five kilometers shed been stupid not to register the mileage when theyd set out what time are they expecting us when we arrive haseeb said i thought wed be there by now there the man said janet could not at once make out the place to which he was pointing and then on the seaward side of the road she became aware of a cluster of dull lights around a roadside stop closer she saw it was not directly against the road but down a short dirt track that dropped frighteningly downwards as soon as she left the road dust billowed up around them and rocks and ruts jarred through the vehicle from beneath there were no other cars in the clearing made for parking just two motor scooters and some bicycles this is it haseeb announced practically with the pride of ownership it was a low singlestory building of maybe three rooms there was a long rectangle which she could see through uncurtained windows forming the public cafe part with a kitchen adjoining alongside in darkness was what she presumed to be where the owner lived or maybe he lived somewhere else and it was a storage area there was a door cut into the side of the cafe leading out on to an open verandah beams extended from the main building and trellis had been linked to them to make the foundation for a grape vine the vines were already intertwined but they were thin and sparse and janet couldnt imagined they provided much shade during the heat of the day cables had also been looped through and from them at intervals unshaded bulbs hung down they were mostly ordinary white household bulbs but just occasionally an effort had been made with colors there were several red and a few blue the verandah was set with tables half of which were covered with red checked table cloths to designate that they were for people who intended to eat the rest were uncovered all were set with metalframed canvasbacked and seated chairs as janet got from the car she caught an overwhelming smell of longused cooking oil from the kitchen as she followed haseeb up slatted wooden steps to the verandah she saw a family of cats several kittens were chasing and snatching at insects she could not see from all around came the crackle and chirp of cicadas in the undergrowth beyond the cafe there were only locals and less than a dozen of them on the eating section of the verandah and janet walked its length conscious of their absolute attention two men actually stopped eating with their forks suspended before them to watch her pass haseeb led the way to one of the unclothed tables at the very rear in a corner so that walls blocked it on two sides three men sat at the table two wore shirts and trousers but janet was intrigued that the third man wore a suit dark although in the poor light she could not be positive of the true color with a tie neatly knotted into a white shirt which appeared fresh and clean the three observed her approach and remained seated when she got to the table as haseeb had remained seated in the larnaca square with the sort of pride with which hed identified the cafe haseeb announced to the three this is the woman the suited man nodded to a chair which would put her facing him unhelped janet withdrew it from the table and sat down haseeb hesitated and then uninvited sat down at another edge of the table directly unwilling to begin any more word games janet said im told you have contacts in beirut perhaps the suited man said he wore a drooped moustache like chief inspector zarpas she wondered if the policeman had by now monitored the withdrawal shed already decided it could be easily explained as living expenses if he demanded an account she said im looking for someone to make inquiries for me the man jerked his head towards haseeb he explained can you do it perhaps he said again depending on what being able to find the right people and the money how much money how much have you got i can pay assured janet quickly she added i can pay if the information is good ten thousand said the moustached man janet lowered her head caught by the sensation of deja vu the same amount demanded by the cheating nicos kholi looking up she said with odd formality if you can provide positive information about the man for whom i am looking i will pay you there was a stir from among the men around the table janet detected another odor competing with the smell of cooking oil and realized it was the stink of fish then she remembered that they were fishermen a young boy carrying an empty tray emerged from inside the restaurant looking at them expectantly haseeb immediately ordered brandy and the three other men indicated their glasses for more it was ouzo janet saw she shook her head the man waited for the boy to go and said i think we can do a deal what sort of deal demanded janet the suited man looked to his two companions janet saw that one was younger than the other but both had long and very curly hair and long faces with similar long aquiline noses and wondered if they were father and son the elder of the two moved his head in agreement and the younger taking his lead from the gesture did the same the moustached spokesman whom janet assumed to be the captain said today is monday we sail later tonight you could come here again on thursday yes said janet eagerly by thursday we will have spoken to people we will know if we can help people in beirut you mean the man nodded and said you can have the money by thursday yes said janet again then it is agreed said the man positively there was another pause while the drinks were served when the waiter left for the second time she said what time thursday midday do you really think you will be able to discover something not until you tell me the name the man said sheridan supplied janet anxiously irritated with herself john sheridan english american when was he taken february anyone claim responsibility hezbollah any particular group janet shook her head no the man remained silent for several moments then said we will try i am grateful you have no reason not yet janet pushed her chair away from the table as if to stand up and said ill be here on thursday if demands were going to be made for some money in advance they would come now she knew wait the man said what janet asked money for the drinks the man said five pounds will cover it janet led the way back to the car aware of haseeb watching her stow her handbag beneath her seat as they regained the road he said it is good i dont know i think so said janet cautiously she was encouraged that no money request had been made a small omen but important there was still thursday of course what precautions could she take against being cheated then when she would have the money i want to be paid demanded the arab beside her ahead janet could see the brightness of the hotels along the dhekelia road she wanted the safety of their surroundings before handing over the she said those men how are they called the boss is named stavos said the man ive heard the older one called dimitri i dont know the other i think they are related greek thought janet what family name i dont know they were among the hotels now janet eased the money from her pocket and handed it across the car as she continued driving she was conscious of the man slowly counting it i could take you again on thursday no really she was aware of his shrug of acceptance aware too of the even brighter lights marking the approach to larnaca hopefully haseeb said you would like a drink no janet said quickly again there are people expecting me back in nicosia had she answered his look across the car she wondered if his disbelef would have been obvious sure of her way through the town now she slowed at the junction with grigoris avxentiou avenue knowing she could cut down it to gain the nicosia road this all right for you fine he made no immediate effort to get out of the car with the vehicle stationary janet turned further towards him but pressed with her back against her door as far away as possible goodbye then she said pointedly and thank you still he stayed edging his arm along the back of his seat towards her get out of the car she said she kept her voice calm inwardly fear was churning through her she moved her hand towards the horn button abruptly unexpectedly he smiled his ugly smile and said ok opening the door as he did so he slammed it behind him and walked away without once looking back janet started the car and drove hurriedly off the fear coming out now in the trembling that vibrated through her so she had to grip the wheel more tightly she was still aware of the stink of fish mixed with the stronger smell of haseebs odor and she wound her window competely down trying to blow itand her nervousnessaway it was ridiculous an overreaction to behave like an offended virgin shed known the danger and shed confronted it and nothing had happened anyway there were far more important more positive things to think about like three men who had not sought money in advance and who should by now be at sea heading towards the lebanese coastline how in three days time to decide if anything they might tell her was worth or whether once again people were trying to cheat her and how to stop being cheated three days she calculated again time to think and to plan f or the first night largely from the fatigue of her previous sleeplessness janet slept soundly and awoke the following morning absolutely refreshed wishing there was something some activity she could use to fill in the intervening days she telephoned her father who asked at once when she was coming home janet was offbalanced by the demand she said she had what she thought was another hopeful lead and because of it had no plans whatsoever at that moment to return he pressed did she genuinely think there was any purpose in remaining on the island janet replied that if there wasnt any purpose then obviously she wouldnt stay so what was it then that was so promising remembering the first disappointment janet held back saying she thought shed met people who had contacts in beirut your mother and i are worried now weve had time to think about it your being there doesnt seem very sensible at all im all right hasnt partington been able to help with anything no said janet then added i had dinner with him and his wife there had been some link with beirut the word was that it was hopeless there pounced the man at once if people on the spot say its hopeless what chance do you stand daddy weve been through all this i think you should come home i dont want to fight about this neither do i said her father lets not then set yourself a time limit at least why demanded janet whats time got to do with it you cant stay there forever i dont intend to said janet but im certainly not coming home yet the conversation depressed janet dampening the enthusiasm with which she had awoken trying to remain objectiveand thinking too of their ageshe supposed it was natural that her parents should become increasingly concerned the longer she stayed but she really hadnt been on cyprus long less than two weeks and the change in their attitude seemed abrupt disorienting to force the argument out of her mind janet tried to consider her other problem how not to be cheated out of more money remembering as she did so the policemans threat to monitor the account a withdrawal could be the immediate trigger for that other more worrying threat of his manipulating something to get her expelled from the island the timing would be crucial shed have to make the withdrawal on her way to the cafe on the dhekelia road not giving zarpas any time to intercept or question her and then what uncomfortably janet accepted yet again that she didnt know although they had parted with half promises of meeting again partingtons call was unexpected and janet responded at once and not just because she had time to occupy before the thursday meeting partington remained her official link the conduit she still might have to use they met at the ekali on st spyridon street and without partingtons wife this time janet let the diplomat guide her through the meze the cypriot way of eating fish and meat and vegetables ferried in practically continuous procession from the kitchen it all came too quickly for her properly to enjoy so hows it going asked partington i dont know not really said janet guardedly youre wasting your time you know maybe janet said she paused revolving her wine glass between her fingers and then said lets talk hypothetically for a moment lets sayjust saythat i was told something that looked good some sort of new information partington was staring intently at her across the table and momentarily janet wondered if she should not have delayed this conversation until after thursday all right lets just say that agreed partington it would have to be properly assessed judged whether it was accurate or not wouldnt it go on so who would do it why dont we stop talking hypothetically challenged the diplomat why dont you tell me what youre really saying im not saying anything at the moment at the moment damn thought janet she said there might be a possibility of my learning something who from i cant say why cant you wont say janet qualified why not partington repeated because at the moment theres nothing to say its all too vague dont partington said dont what dont go on get any further inveigled in whatever it is youre caught up in this isnt what i want to hear its the only thing you need to hear im not giving up when the hell will people accept that i wont help you janet encourage you i told you id seen the americans yes partington agreed curiously actually they saw me the woman admitted warned me off if i tried to tell them anything they wouldnt listen im not sure im following would you listen janet asked openly i told you before that we couldnt get mixed up in this im not asking you to get mixed up in anything janet pleaded ive told you the americans wouldnt listen to me but they would to you which would make it official no janet protested i know the way embassies work all about the backdoor conversations partington shook his head not about something as sensitive as this its too important which you know it is i couldnt become linked unofficially it would have to be official all right then will you pass on anything officially partington leaned closer towards her over the table tell me what it is he insisted tell me who youre dealing with how they operate where they operate what theyre doing everything only when i know everythingand i really mean everything will i ever begin to contemplate answering your question it was not an outright refusal janet knew she was seeking a supportive straw in fact it was as firm an undertaking as she could have expected from what shed told him i cant not yet when janet opened her mouth to speak and then clamped it shut a few days she said instead this week im not sure said janet trying to escape the pressure i hope so but maybe not so soon what guarantees have you got janet smiled thinking the question naive and surprised the man posed it what sort of guarantees could i have exactly said the man turning her answer against her dont do it he repeated by yourself you cant do anything that is going to get john free janet sipped her neglected wine refusing to get on the roundabout thank you for listening she said and for saying what you did what you were able to say that is i havent said anything given any undertaking partington insisted at once always the need for a diplomatic avenue of escape thought janet she said i havent inferred any undertaking for the first time for many minutes the man looked away from her he said i feel im failing your father dont sit with your hands between your legs then thought janet irritably she said if there is a need for us to talk about what weve been discusing now and its out of office hours can i call you at home of course you can i appreciate that i cant say anything to stop you you know you cant then partington began but janet cut in be careful she completed yes he said seriously for gods sake be careful janet returned unhurriedly to the hotel quieted but not completely disheartened by the encounter and when she entered the foyer her mood lifted abruptly at the sight of a group of american tourists crowded around the cashiers desk negotiating the exchange of travelers checks briefly she stood watching realizing she knew the way to protect the money demand wondering why it had taken her so long to think of it the last intervening day dragged boringly by and janet was up once more at first light on thursday impatient to begin she made herself eat and thought as carefully as she had before about how to dress and as before decided upon jeans and a shapeless shirt she checked the car the oil and the water as well as the fuel and timed her arrival at the bank to give herself two hours to reach the meeting spot without the need to return again to the hotel at the bank she insisted upon a bearers letter of credit endorsed in her name waiting while the official went through the procedure alert to his using the telephone he didnt not that she saw but janet knew a message could have been passed to zarpas through any of the clerks and lesser officials whom the man apparently felt it necessary to consult she left the bank imagining their continued concentration and was glad she had not parked the hire car where they could have identified it to record the number the encouragement was shortlived it would only take zarpas minutes to find out at the hotel she guessed the journey to larnaca took janet longer than shed scheduled because there was a delay of nearly thirty minutes getting around a vegetable lorry which had overturned shedding its load on the outskirts of markon she drove fast afterwards to catch up and still reached larnaca with fortyfive minutes in hand she headed directly out upon the hotellined road seeing no reason why she should not get to the cafe ahead of time she did by fifteen minutes but the three men were already there sitting proprietorially at the same outside table drinking ouzo as they had been the night of the first encounter as before they studied her approach across the open area each quite expressionless the smell of bad cooking oil was as bad as it had been on monday and janet wondered if that were why they occupied the verandah instead of the inside area the captain identified to her as stavos still wore his suit when janet got close she could see in the brighter daylight that it was very old greasy with age im glad to see you here she said there was an arrangement the moustached man reminded her janet pulled a chair away from the table so that she could sit directly opposite him and said well instead of replying the man looked slightly over her shoulder and janet turned to the attentive boy with the tray impatiently she ordered beer because it would come capped and the men indicated three more ouzos turning back to stavos she said have you found out anything yes said the man simply quite a lot although janet had rigidly controlled any hope during the intervening days refusing to let herself imagine they would come back with anything at all there had always lurked in that lockedaway part of her mind the supposedly ignored faith that they would in fact be successful she turned the opening key now on that optimism and it engulfed her a dizzying burst of excitement she had to close her eyes briefly against the sensation and was glad she was sitting down because inexplicably her legs began to tremble thank god she said but quietly to herself oh thank god we had an agreement stavos said flatvoiced and unemotional i have the money janet said anxiously all of it please tell me what have you found out the money insisted the man monotone janet began to take the bearer letter from her pocket but he raised his hand stopping her from the rear the waiter approached and set out the drinks janet remained unmoving until the man said all right and then she completed the movement handing him the document stavos stared down frowning with incomprehension what is this janet leaned across indicating the amount a letter of credit for she said it is not money it becomes money how janet pointed again to the endorsement once i sign it once im satisfied with what youve got to tell me any bank on the island will exchange it for cash the elder of the other two men dimitri leaned close to the captain and spoke so softly that janet could not detect the words stavos nodded and looked back at her he said you didnt trust us i was tricked before i lost my money replied janet she wondered if the medical tests had been completed upon the australian girl stavos turned it over in his hands examining its blank back as if expecting to find something there he said all you have to do is sign it thats all this time janet discerned the nod of agreement between the two older men stavos added water to his drink watching it whiten and then said sheridan worked for the cia yes she hadnt told the man that she remembered premature to believe it significant it was fairly public knowledge not difficult for him to have discovered they were extremely indiscreet the americans said the man it was commonly known what his position was within the embassy i dont know about that janet conceded they were very stupid after what happened before janet gauged that to be a clear reference to william buckley would a cypriot fishermanall right a cypriot fishing boat captainbe that familiar with the circumstances without some informative links on the mainland she said please be honest with me have you found someoneanyonewho knows stavos did not reply at once then he said people who want a message passed i dont understand beirut is very much divided now said stavos in east beirut it is difficult to believe there is any sort of conflict it is practically like it was before the battleground is in the west where the shia the hezbollah fanatics are janet nodded her head in agreement further impressed by his knowledge i know all this she said there is a particular district continued stavos as if she had not interrupted the basta area what about it it is in the basta district that sheridan is being held the man announced once more janet felt reality swim away from her they could have been discussing the whereabouts of a casually met acquaintance as she and harriet used to talk about people after one of harriets georgetown parties she swallowed and said where in basta there was the shrug that janet had hoped not to see i dont know that stavos said it sounded convincing but it was not information worth janet decided nothing in fact that was positive at all she said what do you mean about meeting people who want a message passed the group that are holding him want a public statement made by the american government what thats what i was told stavos insisted that if washington publicly apologized for spying for interfering in the area then sheridan would be set free this was something the sensationthe excitement and the reliefflooding through janet now was more intense than the initial optimism where is it this statement there was another shrug i was not given it they thought you would need proof we talked about a photograph before remembered janet more than that said stavos they are prepared to meet you there were no promises not undertakings but i had the impression you might even be taken to see him if you could bring back a photograph of the two of you together the authorities would know that you were speaking the truth wouldnt they have to react janet found it impossible initially to speak thoughts crowded her head and the words clogged in the back of her throat she coughed see him she said incredulous a photograph together nothing definite was said the man repeated cautiously just an impression how could i do this janet demanded recovering how could i get to west beirut meet these people with us the man replied as if he were surprised by the question how else you would take me how otherwise would you know who they were how to meet them when you could go today now she could janet realized she even had her passport in her handbag although she did not imagine their entry was going to be official yes she said pressing her legs beneath the table in an effort to quieten their renewed trembling yes i can quite easily go now dimitri turned sideways again for another inaudible conversation the captain listened nodding in agreement he looked over the table at janet and said we have kept our side of the agreement i think so said janet so we get the money when we get back said janet you can keep the letter and when we get back we can go to a bank together and it will be cashed there was no way she could be cheated the bearer document was nonnegotiable without her signature stavos looked down at the draft and then handed it sideways to dimitri who studied it for several moments before returning it passingly janet wondered if either of them could read english which bank demanded stavos any bank assured janet here in larnaca yes the captain folded the letter carefully so that the sides aligned and just as carefully put it into a worn and scuffed wallet which he eased into a rear pocket of his trousers making sure that the flap was buttoned over it he looked up at her it is agreed you are ready yes said janet i am ready this time stavos paid for the drinks janet filed out between the men dimitri and the younger man ahead stavos behind stavos said we will take your car janet had imagined their boat would be nearby and was surprised they had to drive somewhere stavos got authoritatively into the front passenger seat and the other two men wedged themselves into the back the smell of their work was stronger in the confined space and janet wound her window fully down which way she asked stavos gestured on towards dhekelia janet jolted out of the car park and turned along the bay driving with it to her right the sweeping beach was crammed with oilshiny tourists and technicolored umbrellas the lowering sun was on the other side of the car and janet was glad she had the shade the men seemed untroubled by the heat and uninterested in anything around them stavos stared directly ahead and in her rearview mirror janet saw the other two were doing the same she passed the signs to leivadie and xylotymvou before stavos gestured to his right and janet saw a huddle of working boats in the fishing shelter closer janet saw there was a public car park stavos said leave the car there janet did locking it and following stavoss lead crossed the main road to walk parallel with the beach at this part of the bay sheets of nets hung from their poles or were laid out on the sand drying and a lot of lobster pots lay in apparent disorder flocks of gulls screeched and argued overhead suddenly dipping to scavenge what bits there were still among the netting the smell was overwhelming and there were no holidaymakers or parasols for a long way the working area was quieter than janet had expected too practically deserted in fact with no one in any of the boats to stavos she said where is everybody this is the between time he said the morning boats are back with their catches he indicated the drying nets those are theirs he said the night boats wont go out for another three or four hours when do you normally fish when it suits janet look at her watch it was pm what time will we get to beirut depends on the sea the forecast is good so i would expect around midnight they are expecting you i know a way to make contact so i could be taken to see john tonight janet asked feeling another sweep of excitement that will be for them to decide stavos said he halted at the waters edge and said something in greek the younger man waded immediately out to a flatbottom dory tethered to a buoy about five yards offshore he did not bother to remove his shoes or roll his trousers up by the time he reached the boat the sea was up to his thighs he released the line and hauled it into shore in the daylight janet guessed he was younger than shed first thought probably little more than twenty to dimitri she said your son cousin said the older man it was the first time janet had heard him speak the english was thickly accented the man halted the dinghy about a yard offshore and stavos said i could carry you out no janet said at once she quickly took off her shoes and waded into the water without attempting to roll up the bottom of her jeans remembering sheridans teaching she got easily into the boat wedging her behind over the gunwales first and then swinging her legs inboard both men followed without bothering to remove their shoes the youngest man rowed pulling them out to the fishing boat anchored furthest from the shore as they passed the stern janet saw there was no name but a lettered number she thought it was c but the marking was worn by sea and weather so she could have been mistaken the younger man vaulted easily from the dinghy into the larger boat while the other two steadied it against the side he leaned over reaching out to help her janet accepted his offer after hauling her halfway out he changed his grip cupping both hands beneath her arms finally to bring her into the boat it meant his fingers brushed briefly against her breasts janet pulled away at once deciding it was an accident the man appeared unaware of what hed done paying her no overt attention instead taking the line from stavos to trail the dory to the stern where it would be winched from the water into its davits janet thought the condition of the fishing boat was appalling she was accustomed to sheridans immaculately maintained vessel with its neatly curled and stowed lines tightly reefed sails scrubbed and stoned deck and burnished metalwork this boat was squat and bulgestemmed lobster pots discarded where theyd clearly fallen weedclogged nets tangled and lumped in the stern amongst it all were bamboopoled fishing lines and several ropes of cork floats there was a central wheelhouse and alongside a minute cowl over steps leading below to what janet supposed were cabins or at least some sort of sleeping accommodation directly behind amidships was the engine flap which dimitri already had open his body upended over the machinery the working area where janet presumed fish were gutted or prepared on homeward journeys was behind the engine area there were actually knives in some kind of frame and the deck here was slimed with guts and scales which had not been washed down from the previous trip and which inexplicably had escaped the seabirds perhaps thought janet even they had been unable to confront the stench it was more than soured and rotting fish and their innards there were exhaust fumes from the diesel engines which at that moment shuddered into life and the smell of the diesel itself and then something more for which she could find no comparison or identification just a general odorous miasma of dirt and neglect theres a bench in the wheelhouse stavos said looking more intently janet saw that a plank had been fixed along the bulkhead furthest from the wheel itself it was padded with various pieces of sagging cloth and blanket some of which hung down like lank hair to reach the decking pointing to her wet jeans bottoms janet said ill stay outside for these to dry please yourself shrugged the man going towards the bench himself neglected though the boat might be there was nevertheless an oddly disjointed sort of efficiency about the fashion in which the group got it underway janet never once saw stavos give any obvious command but the other two men went through what appeared an established routine slipping anchor and stowing things unstowedalthough doing little to clear the mess rather moving it from one jumbled area to anotherand preparing themselves and the vessel for sea janet tried to find herself a convenient place on one of the clearer sections of the deck directly in the dropping sunlight although it was still comparatively hot her trouser hems clung uncomfortably wet and cold around her ankles sometimes actually making her shiver and she was anxious to dry them as much as possible the ship had a flat stern and she wedged herself into the corner it made with the starboard rail stetching her foot out on top of a lobster pot to catch the warmth because she was thinking about her feet she turned to the two seamen and saw both had unseen by her discarded their footwear and rolled up their sodden trouser bottoms they moved flatfooted and assuredly around the boat their toes splayed almost like fingers as they felt their way janet was not conscious of their clearing the lee of larnaca bay but realized they must have done so by the increased movement of the boat it obviously had a shallow draft and the square back made it even more vulnerable so very quickly it began to pitch and roll although the swell was comparatively small janet had to take her leg down from the pot for balance in the wheelhouse the moustached man hung nonchalantly against the spoked steering a spilling handmade cigarette stuck precariously to his bottom lip she decided against going there yet the sun was losing its heat and the sea was becoming dulled from bright silver into soft gold there were a lot of yachts and pleasure boats both sail and engine driven some she thought were too small to have ventured this far caught by the thought she looked back surprised how low cyprus was becoming on the skyline it was just a continuous black and vaguely undulating shape from which it was difficult to pick out positive landmarks from the direction she imagined they had come janet guessed a hazed white area to be the pier and marina at larnaca but she couldnt be sure she wondered how stavos navigated there did not appear to be any aerials or electronic equipment but she knew there had to be a radio at least the younger man plodded widefooted from the stem of the boat towards her the other was bent over pots finally putting them into some sort of order on the opposite side of the stern he saw her look and smiled surprisingly whiteteethed and janet smiled back deciding it was ridiculous not being able to properly address him she said how are you called he hesitated still smiling and said costas the other man continued working over the pots but said something in creek costas responded and dimitri spoke again louder this time the younger mans reply was just one word and janet wondered if it were an obscenity janets jean bottoms were drier but not by much and she acknowledged there was hardly enough heat left in the sun to make any further improvement what did it matter she asked herself not knowing why she was even thinking of something so inconsequential what did anything matterthis awful stinking ship or or anythingbeyond the fact that she was on her way to beirut to beirut and people who might actually let her see john people who certainly knew about him and wanted her to convey some message back to america to gain his freedom and she could most definitely get any message conveyed janet knew after her experience of publicity in washington she didnt give a damn what sort of crap it wasshed get the koran published if that were one of the demandsjust as long as it got john out from wherever he was she should janet supposed be feeling some sort of i told you so satisfaction from what shed achieved but she didnt just relief excited relief any other emotion would have been an intrusion unnecessary the only satisfaction she sought was that of having john back with her safely it was the halflight of the mediterranean now cyprus lost beyond the horizon from which night was proudly approaching in a tumble of black clouds there was a wind coming too and the boat began to rise and fall more steeply as the swell increased janet shivered tightening her arms around herself the jeans were adequate but the shirt was for the heat of midday not the numb of an open boat at night the smell was getting to her as well combining with the riseandfall movement she swallowed deeply against what lumped in the back of her throat tightlipped against showing the slightest weakness here janet became conscious of costas before her offering a bottle janet could see that it was unlabeled but nothing else no thank you make you feel better im all right its brandy he said belatedly no really thank you all the same if her discomfort were that obvious it was ridiculous remaining any longer beyond whatever little protection the wheelhouse would give janet accepted now that it was completely dark the excuse about drying her clothes didnt apply either using the rail greasy to her touch for as much support as it would give janet groped amidships to the tiny hut nearer she saw that stavos had lighted the red and green navigation lights and that there was also a dull white light in the place itself she got to the door and said i would like to come in now please from his look it was almost as if he were startled to find her on his boat at all he jerked his head towards the bench and said of course janet eased her way into the tiny hut and sat on the lumpy padding close to the open door the door slid back and forth on runners she saw there was a matching entrance on the far side of the wheelhouse but it was secured by an inside bolt in front of stavos was a sloped chart table but there were no charts on it what she could see was a magazine well thumbed with what appeared to be a naked girl on the front it was partially concealed by pages of a newspaper which stavos was reading there was also an empty tobacco tin acting as an ashtray and there was a radio although not the type janet expected it looked like the sort of transistor those larnaca bay holidaymakers would have had as the thought came she heard very softly a wailing pop song coming from it the radio was taped against the side of the chart table and swung back and forth like a pendulum with the rocking of the boat beneath the table was a tangle of ropes and lines stavos had taken his shoes off like the other two crewmen and rolled his trousers up how much longer janet asked stavos grunted away from his newspaper he looked briefly through the saltrimmed glass out into the completely empty blackness of the night then at his watch and said maybe two hours maybe less janet checked her own watch and said before midnight then maybe said stavos a man of definite opinions thought janet she said are you sure you will be able to find the people tonight i said i would come back with a decision with something said stavos abandoning his newspaper altogether and turning to her so they are expecting you they said they would be ready costas appeared at the doorway next to her he still carried the bottle and in the better light janet thought his face appeared flushed he said something in greek and offered it to the captain but stavos shook his head in refusal the young man then smiled at janet moving his outstretched arm so that the bottle was towards her no thank you she said again the doorway was completely blocked by the arrival of dimitri he spoke in greek to stavos who glanced briefly at his watch before replying and janet guessed it was a query about an arrival time the younger man remained looking at her smiling janet smiled back costas took a swig from the bottle and said good stuff the best im sure janet said stavos said something brief and sharp and costass smile flickered off he replied equally brief his face sullen no one moved for several moments and then the younger man screwed the metal top back on to the bottle would you like to eat stavos asked suddenly theres some fish and bread olives too wine as well im really not hungry janet said swallowing against the sensation that came once more to the back of her throat at the very thought of consuming anything its going to be a long night ill ask if i get hungry anxious to switch the conversation from food janet gestured to what she thought was a gradual lightening ahead and said is that it beirut without looking stavos said yes here thought janet im here she said how much longer now maybe an hour janet sat practically oblivious to anything and anyone around her occupied only upon what was ahead there was a definite break in the darkness now an actual horizon line although she could not make out the shapes of buildings she was surprised at so much light without positively thinking about it shed imagined it would be a place of enforced and protective darkness like the second world war blackouts in england that her parents had described she strained to hear any sound and realized thatridiculouslyshe was listening for the sound of gunfire all she could hear was the grating reverberating throb of the engines behind her soon my darling she thought ill be there soon stavos broke into her reverie he said theres a part of the harbor to the west where we can go alongside youll stay aboard while i go to find them why cant i come with you west beirut isnt a place for evening strolls rejected the captain its safer this way how far is it from the harbor to where you expect to meet them not for it cant be that dangerous then this is how it is going to be done stavos said loudly janet winced not wanting to alienate a man upon whom she was so dependent im sorry she said at once of course beirut was more discernible now and janet saw that the brightness was not as uniform as she had imagined it to be the street lights and house and building lights and even the lights of cars moving along coastal highways were all to the east which stavos had described as safe practically like it was before janet remembered it was much darker to the west and what she calculated to be the south the war areas street illumination was intermittent over large areas none existing at all and there were hardly any building lights either nothing seemed to be moving on the roads if there were cars they were driving without headlights stavos extinguished the dull white bulb inside the wheelhouse leaning forward in complete darkness against the glass which he scrubbed with his hand to remove something obstructing his view the harbor like the city was divided by light to janets left a lot of boats and ships showed themselves at anchor or against jetty or harbor moorings but in the direction in which they were moving very slowly hulls and outlines were black and indistinct whatever was showing nothing more than the barest glimmer stavos began to talk in creek and janet became aware that dimitri was between the wheelhouse and the front of the ship as a relay and that costas was in the actual v of the stem guiding them through the channels and past obstructions a shout came louder than the rest and stavos jerked the gear lever into reverse but they still came against the mooring hard bouncing away from the wall so the man had to go back and forth between the gears to maneuver himself into position again the two crewmen jumped onto the jetty with securing lines and at once stavos turned to her he said you must wait yes janet said she added in the dark it is better why just better i cant see anything it wont be long he brushed past her to get out of the tiny hut and there was a mumble of inaudible conversation near the shoreside rail where janet assumed the other two men to be blackness was all around her stifling like a blanket that was too thick she felt positively hot despite the coldness of the night she got up and groped to the other side of the wheelhouse twitching her fingers until she located the bolt and tested it to ensure that it was locked to be doubly sure she found the opening handle and tugged against it the door shifted but only slightly reassured janet returned to the bench and sat down it was getting easier to see janet decided the blackness wasnt blackness any more but a kind of gray her eyes had adjusted so that she was able to make out shapes and objects able to differentiate black lumps gray lumps black lumps gray lumps boats and boat equipment she supposed what else could they be but she could not definitely be sure with her improving vision janet tried to locate dimitri and costas but she couldnt everything around was totally quiet and unmoving just the lap of water and the creak of the boats black lump creak creak gray lump creak creak maybe theyd all gone together which would mean that she was all alone on the boat janet wasnt hot now cold she shivered violently and remembered that when shed done that as a child her mother had invoked a folklore expression about someone walking over her grave drink janet yelped in surprise shed imagined herself deserted and had not heard costas approach you frightened me she said im sorry i saw you shiver you were watching me yes i didnt know you were there no wheres dimitri somewhere has he gone with stavos maybe he was blocking the open door and through all the other smells janet could detect the scent of brandy she said theyll be back soon fully adjusted to her surroundings now janet saw the shoulder hump perhaps he said why not try a little drink its very good for the cold just a little drink janet felt the bottle against her arm i dont want to drink she said youre very pretty thank you you werent upset by what i did when i helped you into the boat i dont remember what you did helping me into the boat lied janet oh christ she thought youre very firm big i dont understand what you are saying big tits janets immediate impulse was properly to scream this time to drive him away with the fear of someone intervening to arrest him and then she remembered where she was and how she couldnt expect anyone to intervene that more than at any time in her life she was completely and absolutely and utterly alone pressing control upon herself she said dont talk like that why not i dont like it i like it like big tits please dont shouldnt wear baggy shirts like that covering them up want to see them dont costas please dont janet cringed when she felt his hand he missed at first groping her waist but at once moved up cupping his hand beneath her breast and feeling for where he imagined her nipple to be squeezing hard he didnt have her nipple but it still hurt and janet snatched a breath but refused to cry out in case that was what he wanted liked that he said feels good so did i janet forced herself to say i liked it too the man giggled and janet was engulfed in more brandy breath his hands moved over her breasts kneading and squeezing hurting her badly he said knew you would big tits janet edged slightly away from him further along the bench id like that drink now she said costas stumbled awkwardly into the wheelhouse entrance colliding with either side sure he said here it gave janet the excuse to stand up and get further away she reached out toward him one hand grabbed for her but she was able to evade it the bottle she said wheres the bottle here he said and this time the other hand connected and she felt the coldness of the glass janet had edged backwards all the time risking his inevitable entry into the tiny hut she felt out putting her hand against his chest and said give me room to take a drink then costas stopped coming towards her and janet raised the bottle to her lips keeping them pressed tightly together with her free hand reaching behind for the bolt to the other sliding door she scraped her foot against the deck as loudly as she could to mask any other sound she made knowing where it was she was able at once to locate the opening handle she jerked sideways against it anxiously starting to turn to run through it nothing happened it moved just slightly as it had when shed checked it earlier but it remained rigid janet tried once more harder this time but it refused to budge and she realized there were additional outside locks or securing bars on top of one horrified realization tumbled others all as terrifying that shed encouraged a drunken man intent upon rape into believing she wanted him sexually that unquestionably he was stronger than she was physically and would succeed that they were together in the smallest of places that she was trapped good stuff he mumbled very good have another drink trying to delay what was inevitably to happen janet raised the bottle again feeling the cheap liquor burn her lips a little got through making her choke he was against her pressing her to the door through which she couldnt escape one hand cruel against her breast the other trying to work its way between her tight legs fingers spidering through the cloth in what he believed would stimulate her sex but worst of all he attempted to kiss her smearing an open wet mouth against hers trying to drive his tongue into her janet bit down against the inside of her lips desperate to seal them not caring if she bit herself to bleed she was going to bleed anyway elsewhere his body ground into her thigh and she could feel his erection it seemed huge bleed a lot she thought not so tight he mumbled stop being so tight janet pushed him away not here she said shortbreathed it wont be comfortable here theres nowhere for me to lie costas backed off slightly she could see that his head was uncertainly to one side he said down below theres down below bunks sort of lets go below with absurd courtesy the man offered his hand to guide her repelled janet still took it and allowed herself to be led from the restriction of the wheelhouse actually gulping at the air the moment she got beyond the door she stopped he stopped with her his free hand groping at her breast again trying to get his fingers into the opening of her shirt to touch her flesh janet let him because it was not an immediate danger the tiny cowl to her right leading down into god knows where was the immediate danger i like a party she said costas sniggered popping a button to make room for his hand and said ill give you a party ill give you a party youve never had before here offered janet raising the bottle between them have a drink yourself still with one hand loosely inside her shirt costas took the brandy with the other tilting his head in a gesture of macho bravado to take a swig janet was perfectly able to see she waited until his throat visibly started to move to take the liquor and then drove her hand upwards with all the feardriven force she could manage which was a lot the heel of her hand precisely caught the bottle at its very bottom ramming the neck of the bottle fully up into the mans mouth there was a snap of breaking teeth and a scream of agony and still janet kept thrusting holding the bottle now and screwing it further into his mouth wanting to drive it down his throat costas floundered backwards gagging and tripped over something littering the deck going down the bottle was jerked out of her hands smashing as he threw his head sideways the man lay on his side choking janet looked desperately around for some other weapon whimpering with fresh fear as she was grabbed from behind dimitris arms wrapped around her trapping her own it was not a sexual attack he was restraining her trying to pull her away in front she saw costas pushing himself from the planking struggling to get up he was still spitting the blood from his mouth janet strained outwards to break the older mans grip but couldnt dimitri spoke directly into her ear and not to her but to costas and in arabic now ya himar allak titrikha ial baieen briefly for no more than secounds janet stopped struggling why should she have been left what did it mean that she was for the others her stopping deceived the man holding her she was aware of his slight relaxation and she jerked suddenly turning to bring dimitri around between herself and the younger man dimitri moved with her and at once there was an angonized yell and the grip fell away freeing her janet turned to face the man he was hopping on one foot and in the heel of the other she could see embedded the jagged base of the broken brandy bottle and janet remembered their being barefoot during the voyage costas was almost upright now crouched and about to run at her janet shoved out driven by anger as well as fear she caught dimitri fully in the back and without any balance dimitri hurtled into the other man they both fell and there were fresh yells she guessed theyd gone on to more broken glass and hoped they were pieces that hurt badly like the base embedded in dimitris foot janet gazed frantically around not knowing what to do there was scuffling from behind and she saw costas pulling himself upright once more she ran without thought to the stern grunting as she hit against something she felt out not able to tell from the feel what it was and then realized it was the frame holding the gutting knives she had seen when she boarded that afternoon she grabbed at one holding it outwards between both her hands level with her waist turning back towards costas he was coming towards her cautiously crablike bent and with his body half turned his face appeared covered with something black and janet guessed it was blood when he spoke the words were slurred by the damage she had caused to his mouth hurt you he said you cant believe how im going to hurt you break you in thats what im going to do really break you in dimitris voice came from behind still in arabic janet couldnt see him and guessed he was lying where hed fallen homme bidhum yaha ma bitoud tiswa who wanted her for themselves how would she be no good split apart janet thought she knew and felt the vomit rise to her throat anna biddi yaha abilil kill costas shouted back he wasnt going to have her first janet determined no one was going to have her she stood where the boat was darkest shed just be a black outline so he wouldnt have seen the knife could she kill him intentionally drive the knife into his body hurt her hed said hurt her badly yes she could kill him stab him at least to make him stop he was very close now no more than a yard or two she was aware of his tensing to jump at her trickni hill anni janet spoketold him to stay awayin arabic and he did stop surprised she knew the language the halt was only brief she saw his crushed lips pull back in the grimace of a smile and he answered her in arabic calling her a whore and then he came at her he just rushed arms stretched forward to grab her and he actually had her shoulders before he ran on to the knife he gave a great gasp sucking in his breath in pain and in shock and staggered backwards looking down the knife was in very deep janet was only able to see the handle protruding from the lefthand side of his body costas sagged as if he were about to collapse at the knees tried to straighten but couldnt not completely and finally toppled over his legs quivered upwards forming his body into a ball and a long groan gurgled from him janet ran she used one of the mooring ropes as a handhold balanced herself on the rail and then jumped over the narrow ditch of sea on to the jetty after the hours on the ship janet felt immediately unsteady on a solid footing and had to snatch out for a bollard for support it gave her the opportunity to orientate herself she was about halfway along a narrow mooring finger maybe two hundred yards long and ten yards wide underfoot she detected cobbles and guessed it was a very old part of the harbor construction there were bollards like the one she was holding roughly twenty yards apart along either side and every so often small sheds and buildings which she supposed accommodated the fishing tackle and equipment of boats permanently using the berths the mooring on either side of where they had tied up was empty which would have accounted for the noise of her struggling not being overhead she doubted if anyone would have bothered to intrude if they had been detected her mind was disjointed thoughts only half forming before others presented themselves to get in the way janet tried to concentrate to assess the situation she was in and to find a way out confronting literally the need to find a way out she realized abruptly she was still trapped she had to clear the jetty feeling steadier at last she set out towards the port the sea to her back heading into the shadow of the first storage hut it was fortunate she did because she was completely hidden when she saw the movement ahead three men maybe four walking in a group with their heads close in conversation janet stopped easing slightly backwards and then around the tiny building keeping it between herself and the group the mumble of words came to her as they got closer she strained not sure at first then definitely identified stavoss voice the talk was in arabic there was something about a problem and then she heard taught and the slap of a fist being driven into the palm of a hand and the splatter of laughter she missed the beginning of a sentence but caught morale of the men and there was more laughter someone said they were very pleased and stavos replied that he would like to be able to do more business when they reached the hut janet edged around it keeping it between herself and them shed actually reversed their positionsso that she was on the landside and they had passed towards the seawhen she heard a muffled shout in arabic and recognized dimitris voice shes got away he said janet ran she did so as quietly as possible and stayed in the shadows so that they would not see and reckoned shed gained about thirty yards before she heard the shout behind and the slap of feet in pursuit uncaring about being heard or seen any more she fled headlong legs pumping arms jerking leaping and dodging over ropes and boxes there were dark movements of curiosity from some of the boats she went by but no challenges behind she heard stop stop her and someone started to move from a boat to her left but she ran faster and passed it before anyone could get in the way there were a few lights on the harbor wall and she saw it was too high to clear in a single jump she managed to get over by leaping onto its top and then dropping down she still seemed to be in the port area there were cranes and trucks with lifting gear and offices to her right the clear area was to her left she went in that direction aware too late of an enclosing wire mesh fence she changed direction running parallel and looking for a break there wasnt one the men were over the wall now she jerked to a halt gazing around seeing as she did so that they were fanning out from where theyd landed to entrap her from either side they werent even bothering to run any more strolling quite confidently enjoying an unexpected game janet started off again towards the offices which made up a continuation of the fence they were lighted and she saw figures in two of them but knew from the assurance with which the men were closing in upon her that whoever the officials or clerks were they would not protect her she snatched at the first door it was locked and from the men close behind she heard a snigger and one shouted something to another the second was locked too she thought she could hear their footsteps now so near were they then the third door gave she thrust through hearing the outraged shout very close but had the sense to turn as she slammed it to seek the key she twisted it in the lock as a body hit on the other side the door lever flapped furiously but uselessly up and down janet threw herself along the corridor ready to thrust anyone aside but no one emerged from any of the offices behind there was hammering and yelling and she heard thumps and grunts as someone tried to break the door in the street exit was secured but the key was in its hole janet opened it began to go through and then halted as the idea came she ducked back extracted the key and stopped outside long enough to lock it behind her as she panted across the harbor road she heard the sound of someone rattling the metal of the fence in frustration there was a shout but she didnt hear the words it was a long time before janet stopped hurrying she twisted and turned along the cratered and rubblestrewn streets pulling into the shadows when she became aware of any movement around her always trying to go eastwards to what she imagined would be safety janet was shocked by the devastation whole streets were lined with humps of brickwork and concrete no glass or windows remaining anywhere although from the soundsscratching and slithering and the occasional moving shadowshe recognized that people lived in the warrens formed by the debris there were movements and shadows from the burnedout and sometimes overturned shells of vehicles too and she realized they made homes for more people several times there were calls of challenge always janet pulled deeper into whatever darkness she could find never replying dogs barked and yapped frequently none came near the immediate danger receding janet felt increasingly weakher knees actually threatening to give out more than oncefrom the delayed terror of what might have happened and the exhaustion of getting away she had to stop several times just to lean against a rubble pile or sagging wall pulling the breath into herself in the effort to stay calm thats what she had to do stay calm not panic stay calm and cross whatever the dividing line was and go somewherea hotel or an embassy or a western airline officewhere she could explain what shed been through and get help get away christ shed been lucky luckier probably than shed ever know the shadows gradually stopped seeming so dark and during one of her stopsto rest again her quivering legsjanet stared upwards and saw that the sky was lightening dawn early dawn at last could not be far off would it be more difficult to cross in daylight rather than darkness cross what was there an actual border between the east and the rest of the city like there was in berlin or was it just an understood demarcation one street devastation the next street sophistication she pushed herself up from a concrete mound and groped on finding it difficult to properly walk managing little more than to get one foot in front of the other trying not to scuff too loudly as she did so the light increased and the movement all around grew a few people actually passed on an early errand or on the way to work no one gave her more than the briefest passing attention the hotel appeared suddenly in front of her like an oasis and for the initial seconds janet could not believe that it was there staring at it as if it really were a mirage that would disappear but it didnt it was shellpocked and there were some sandbags and a few of their windows were taped against bomb blast but it was definitely a hotel there were people moving about inside and there were lights on more lights than there had been in any other building she passed she dragged herself forward stumbling on the steps up to the revolving doors and stopped directly inside to gather her strength against breaking down at reaching safety at the desk it seemed to be changeover time from the night today staff they frowned startled as she approached and janet looked down shocked at the state of herself her jeans were tattered and her blouse was ripped and only held across her by one remaining button there was lot of blood which must have come from costas changed brown by the dust in which she was caked please help me she said im english englishamerican my name is stone janet stone the fiancee of john sheridan said an american voice behind i t was not one man but several anothernot the american whod first spoken because the voice was differentsaid jesus youre right and janet looked blankly at all of them the first man came closer smiling and with his hand outstretched whelan jim whelan cbs i did an interview with you in washington when sheridan first went missing just been posted here myself limply janet took his hand not remembering looking beyond him to the other men whelan said welcome to the summerland hotel home of the international press corps he said the first man who had spoken came to her now henry black he said washington post and do you look as if youve got problems janet burst into tears she tried to stop but couldnt and they sat her in the foyer and got coffee she didnt drink and waited until shed recovered when she did it seemed as if the group had grown larger other people introduced themselves there were more americans and three or maybe four englishmen and an englishwoman stringing for two london newspapers as well as some french and germans far too many names for janet to remember she was aware of cameras going off and shunned away wishing they wouldnt and a softvoiced argument began between the americans shed first met and the photographers janet said she wanted to wash to try to clean herself up and the cbs reporter arranged a room for her and the englishwoman whose name she finally got as ann became a selfappointed guardian telling the other reporters they would have to wait janet bathed and washed her hair getting rid of her fatigue as well as the dirt and when she emerged from the bathroom found the other woman had set out some of her own clothes for her to borrow a skirt and a shirt and a sweater everything was slightly too big but didnt appear so when janet surveyed herself in the mirror while shed bathed janet had fully regained control now she assessed the problems she was an illegal entrant certainly but that wasnt the most serious the most serious had to be the stabbing aboard the fishing boat perhaps more than a stabbing perhaps a killing her word against against how many she didnt know but shed definitely be outnumbered stavos and dimitri would get the others to lie against her to concoct any sort of story they wanted so she needed protection official professional protection before even surrendering herself to whatever beirut authority existed and public outside protection too which meant the waiting pressmen downstairs janet cooperated with everyone and everything she gave a combined press conference and then individual interviews and posed for still photographs and the television cameras because he had been the first to approach her she asked whelan to take her to the british embassy and there even before she explained her situation she set out the cooperation she had given to the world media openly using it as a threat although she was not sure against what the embassy officials name was john prescott his position within the legation was never made clear to her he was a precise neat man and surprisingly slight the word that came to janet the moment they met was dainty he listened without any outward reaction small hand against his small face making an occasional note in careful script when she finished he asked her to wait in the office and was gone for more than an hour he returned with another man whom he introduced as robertson and identified as the embassys legal advisor the lawyer was a heavy floridfaced man he reminded janet of partington in the nicosia embassy robertson asked her to repeat much of the story which she did and when she finished he complained redfaced that it would have been much more sensible for her to have come direct to the embassy instead of announcing it in advance to the press janet didnt apologize prescott pedantically explained that as her first marriage gave her certain rights to american citizenship he had felt it right to involve the us embassy as well as themselves he had also been in communication with the british embassy in beirut and had sent a full account to the foreign office in london it was all very difficult and complicated he said janet wondered what they were waiting for until thirty minutes later two other men were ushered into the rapidly overcrowding room only one provided a name it was william burr and he described himself as an attache at the us embassy he said youre causing us all a lot of headaches ms stone a whole lot of headaches were getting far too accustomed to hearing your name to the englishmen burr said you arranged an interview robertson nodded and said three oclock where here said the lawyer within british jurdisdiction it gives her the protection of the embassy very wise agreed the american janet thought his hair was surprisingly long for a diplomat he had a very freckled face and wore the sort of heavy moustache she remembered being popular among young people in the late s when shed first gone up to the university the other unnamed american was much younger an openfaced bespectacled man who moved his head obviously between every speaker janet wondered if he were a lawyer like robertson interview with whom she demanded police and immigration said robertson five lebanese arrived so it was necessary to move into a larger room it was dominated by a conference table and prescott carefully sat her between himself and robertson on one side keeping the beirut officials on the other the americans sat at one end like referees janet answered the questions from two of the lebanese one police the other immigration a third man bent constantly over his pad keeping verbatim notes after an hour the policeman had a whispered conversation with his companion who nodded and asked for the use of a telephone prescott led one who had so far taken no part in the questioning to the smaller office in which theyd first been and the interrogation resumed it was not as demanding as hostile even as janet had expected both questioners frequently smiled as they put their queries and the immigration inspector often nodded to her replies as if he were in agreement with what she were saying when the lebanese official returned to the room there was a muffled conversation between the group and the questioner produced a detailed map and asked janet to identify the berth against which she believed the fishing boat had tied up the previous night when janet did so the man asked robertson if they would agree to janet accompanying them upon a launch to point out the spot leave the embassy you mean demanded the lawyer the lebanese lowered his head acknowledging the point of the question my colleague and i are happy to agree with the protection of the embassy extending with you presumably one or all of you will wish to come too why intruded janet why do you want me to do this she was frightened of going near that stinking hulk again of actually confronting stavos and dimitri and whoeveror whateverelse might be aboard there is no fishing boat of the sort you have described anywhere in that part of the harbor no cyprusregistered vessel at all announced the policeman simply which means began the american but the lebanese cut him short in agreement that there is no incident involving a stabbing for us to become involved in said the man the british lawyer and burr accompanied janet they drove in a british embassy car to a different part of the harbor in the east of the city where there were police in uniform and as many sparkling and glittering yachts and boats at their moorings as there were in the larnaca marina all four lebanese crowded aboard the officially designated harbor launch which looped out to sea and then came in at janets hesitant direction as she tried to recall her approach the previous night in the daylight she was better able to make out the division between the parts of the city and the port when she became almost certain of the jetty she squinted shorewards to locate the fencedin part near the offices where she had been hounded by the pursuing men she found it running her eyes from it as a marker and decided she was right there she said youre sure robertson asked positive its the jetty you picked out on the map said the lebanese policeman as i said we have no official record of any vessel from cyprus having put in there during the night and most definitely as we can all see there is no cyprus fishing boat there now so any stabbing inquiry ends burr pressed instantly the lebanese gave an expansive shrug of course it happened janet insisted nothing happened for me to investigate the man said with matching insistence robertson waved his hands in a pressingdown gesture to janet as the launch turned to cut its way back across the harbor to the pier where they had boarded the lawyer said which just leaves the matter of illegal entry i think i need to make telephone calls said the immigration man avoiding any immediate commitment more had happened ashore than at sea during the hour they had been absent from the embassy there was a cluster of reporters and television cameramen actually around the building when they reached it they surged forward in a glare of camera lights as they saw janet in the car yelling unheard questions and it was difficult for the driver to edge by them and at the same time to negotiate the dogs tooth barriers set up at the entrance to the british compound against any terrorist car suicide attack the car managed it but only just prescott was waiting at the side entrance when the vehicle stopped as they got out robertson demanded what the hells that all about prescott waited until they had assembled back in the larger room before answering then he said some developments in cyprus a man was arrested in larnaca today trying to negotiate at the hellenic bank a bearer letter of credit made out in the name of janet stone shed guessed stavos had not understood remembered janet served the bastard right she said what about the one i stabbed prescott shook his head ive no information about that i queried it and nicosia say they dont know anything about a stabbing the police have located the boat apparently there is a lot of blood but as far as i can understand the story is that a crewman had an accident with a bottle or some glass and theres always a lot of fish blood around anyway on a boat like that the american who had so far not spoken said apparently ms stones interviews have gotten a pretty big play worldwide and theres still tomorrows papers to come whats happened in cyprus has added to the interest the pressure for official statements and more interviews isnt just coming from those guys outside in the road theres a whole bunch at our legation too i think too much has been publicly said already robertson complained with lawyers caution there is a legal situation prescott agreed theres been an official request from the cyprus authorities through our nicosia embassy for mrs stone to be returned to help police inquiries there that would seem to take care of the matter of illegal entry the lebanese immigration official said at once the cyprus situation obviously takes precedence in importance and the most common resolution to illegal entry in any case is usually deportation to the port of origin which will be the outcome here janet found herself only half listening to the quietvoiced discussion going on around her could it only be hoursless than one whole daysince shed stabbed a man trying to rape her and fled in terror from other men intent on god knows what she found it difficultinconceivableto believe it was all being settled as easily as this to the lebanese she said can i ask you something of course smiled the immigration man i came here for a reason a purpose said janet hurriedly not wanting to lose what she saw as an opportunity i was trying to find out anything about my finance john sheridan do you know anything can you help me find him where the hell is he the effect throughout the room was very obvious a physical stiffness appeared to tighten each man and their faces went blank except for that of robertson whose suffused features became even redder it was the lawyer who spoke he started in cliche to say i really dont think this is either the time or the but janet stopped him erupting in frustrated disbelief this is exactly the time and exactly the place for christs sake she yelled this is beirut this is where hes held so what the fuck is anyone doing about it janet hadnt meant to say fuck and as soon as she did she regretted it trying to recoverbut at the same time refusing to back away from the stonemasked menshe said well isnt it isnt this where john and all those other poor bastards are held with no one doing anything about it isnt it the lebanese shuffled awkwardly appearing to move away from the general group to form a separate muttered gathering janet was aware of a shoulderhumped eyebrowraised exchange between the british and american diplomats well she demanded still not giving in isnt it youre not helping ms stone burr said who is janet pressed on tell me just whohowanyone in beirut is helping john and all those others come on tell me the immigration official emerged as the lebanese spokesman he said none of this is our business our responsibility janet sighed focusing on the american whose name she knew what about you mr burr youre a united states diplomatic officer officially assigned to a country in which americans are being held hostage for whatever reason god or allah knows do you consider it your business your responsibility youve had a traumatic time ms stone soothed burr hopefully lets not press it shall we im not taking that cop out rejected janet in further refusal ok ive had a traumatic time i nearly got raped and i stuck a knife in somebody whom no one seems able to find any more and i dont know if the bastard is alive or dead and despite what he tried to do and although hes a bastard i dont want him to be dead although he deserves to be but im still not hysterical im not hysterical and i havent lost control ive got here and i dont want to leave here until i get some idea whats happeningif anything is happeningto find john sheridan it was the nameless american who spoke he said lets talk about this sometime else ms stone why later ms stone not later now theres nothing to say not here not now came in burr defensively we know nothing said the lebanese policeman who had not spoken for a long time theres nothing we can say to help you janet experienced a familiar sensation the feeling of having something that blocked out the lighta blanket maybepulled over her head shutting out her access to everything and anything beyond as she herself had literally pulled the blankets over her head when hank died the american without a name spoke not to janet but to the british diplomats he said weve got a helicopter going to cyprus later today wed be happy to offer transportation to ms stone thats very good of you prescott said in apparent acceptance wait a minute protested janet just wait a goddamned minute why isnt anyone answering me directly to prescott she said what the hell right have you got to make arrangements on my behalf every right the tiny man said at once and with a forcefulness strangely out of keeping with his stature you are a distressed person of original british nationality seeking the protection of this embassy the lebanese authorities have agreedwith exceptional understanding for which we are extremely gratefulto take no action whatsoever against you which they clearly could have done had they so seen fit i am entirely and legally entitled to repatriate you to your port of origin in the most costeffective and efficient way that presents itself that way has presented itself absolutely and utterly correct robertson said the blanket was doing more now than just blocking out the light there was the familiar stifling sensation too thanks janet said intending sarcasm you know what i think ms stone burr said throwing it back at her i dont really think youve any idea just how much youve got to be thankful for the truth of the remark pompous though it was further punctured janets attitude she felt weighed down and not just from the exhaustion of not having slept for longer than she was able to remember trying for a pebble to throw back against the boulders she said id like to meet the press no robertson said at once why not for the reason thats already been made clear said the lawyer continuing professionally he went on there is in custody in cyprus a man who is alleged to have fraudulently attempted to convert a money order in your name to his own benefit anything you might say could materially affect whatever evidence you might give at his trial if you want the legal definition it is sub judice what evidence janet said fighting back i dont wish to continue this discussion robertson said but if you are considering not supporting the charges that could be brought then i would consider you a very stupid woman and i consider you a very arrogant man janet paused encompassing everyone in the room i consider you all very arrogant men interested in only one thing getting rid of a potential embarrassment as quickly and as easily as possible janet waited for a reaction but there wasnt one and their absolute dismissal was the most crushing part of the encounter to the lebanese robertson said formally do you entrust custody of mrs stone to the british authorities appearing relieved the man immediately said yes to the americans robertson said on behalf of the british government i would like to accept your offer of transportation youre welcome burr said i wont go janet shouted desperately and without thought i wont go until i have found out something about john you dont have any choice in the matter said robertson flatly youre being expelled and in the circumstances in the best way possible as ive just told you youre a very fortunate woman there was another futile journalistic rush towards the departing car which had to slow at the barriers and by doing so provided the opportunity for yet more photographs and more unheard questions before it accelerated on the outside road to run parallel to the sea towards the american embassy the sun was very low half over the horizon and janet thought that at this time the previous night she had still only been approaching the lebanese coastline burr was beside her in the back with the other american in the front but turned towards them janet had been conscious of the man hunching against the burst of camera bulbs and on impulse said you were with john werent you with the agency i mean i knew him the man conceded you never told me your name the way you run to the newspapers its dangerous even to tell you the time of day said burr beside her i know the lecture by heart said janet people are supposed to learn from lectures said burr why havent you because none of them have had any useful information smart burr acknowledged very smart janet ignored burr concentrating upon the man in front of her ok so dont tell me if youre in the agency or not i couldnt give a damn but i know you are so you must be involved in trying to find him for gods sake tell me whats going on i the man started but burr said no cutting him off then the man said i was only going to say that i would like to but i cant lets cut it right there shall we burr said no janet protested lets not cut anything i want to know i want to know anything theres nothing to know burr said its a cold trail i dont believe you janet said it cant be ms stone burr said weve got americans somewhere in this asshole of a country whove been missing for years not just weeks theres nothing that hasnt been done that could not have been done to make contact to negotiate or to plead or arrange their freedom to normal people you can talk discuss things but these arent normal people theyre fanatics nuts so what the hells the answer weve got to wait burr said fatalistically all the lines are out they know we want to hear from them all we can do is wait for them to come to us come to us and give us their terms and their demands so we can see where we go from there where do we go from there persisted janet do we deal or do we come up with the line that we wont condone terrorism which is a load of crap after irangate i dont make policy ms stone said the diplomat with sudden weariness i just try to interpret it sometimes it isnt easy the car had to make its way through another press throng at the us legation which was protected by more concreted antiterrorist barriers than the british building and once more janet was conscious of the american in the front seat moving to conceal himself as much as possible from the cameras inside the compound burr said im going to issue a very short statement just that you have cooperated with the authorities here in beirut and that you are returning to cyprus to help with some police matters there why dont i take ms stone with me until the helo gets here the other man suggested just as long as i know where to find you burr agreed janet followed the younger man from the car past a marineguarded sandbagged pillbox and into the embassy through a side door not the main entrance the man courteously opened doors and stood back every time they had to move through one section of the building to another they did not stop until they reached what had to be the very rear the final door was operated by a combination lock and janet remembered the briefcase carried by the first man whod tricked her absurdly she could not immediately recall the name nicos she thought nicos kholi she followed the man into an office harsh under fluorescent lighting with no outside windows everything was practical and functional just a desk three filing cabinets side by side and sealed by thick iron bars which padlocked through the handles of each drawer and one chair for a visitor he gestured her to it and janet sat down the names knox he said george knox im glad theres the chance for us to be alone for a few moments i dont understand said janet ive got something for you the man reached into a side drawer of the desk and then stretched out towards her it was not until she accepted what he was offering that janet realized it was a photograph and her eyes instantly blurred at the image of sheridan it was a color print obviously taken somewhere in beirut there were palm trees in the background and the edge of a swimming pool sheridan was wearing shorts and a shirt and topsiders without socks and appeared to be smiling at someone beyond the camera john really was my friend disclosed knox hed actually invited me to your wedding j anet had a strange feeling and in the initial few moments could not decide what it was then it flooded in upon her an awareness that for the first time in too many daysweeksshe was being treated with understanding actual friendship and not as an irritant to be kept at arms length and moved on to become someone elses problem her reaction was one of relief and something more a brief sensation of actual relaxation it became very obvious as knox talked that he and john had been friends close friends in fact the young cia man knew about their boat and the house in chevy chase and even the circumstances of their meeting at harriets oppressive georgetown party janet listened to it all waiting and when knox paused she demanded why tell me how it happened why nothing appears to be going on to get him out in this more confined space knoxs habit of studying a speakers face almost as if he were lipreading was more pronounced than it had been at the earlier conference he gazed intently at her weighing his reply then he said it was what john was trying to do a mission you mean very much a mission said the man weve got a whole bunch of americans caged up here somewhere i know the figures stopped janet impatiently the names even what was john trying to do remember what bill said in the car coming back here about all the lines being out of course nodded janet thats what john was doing what the mission was knox said he was trying to set up the contacts to initiate the negotiations to get our guys out and then the sonsofbitches grabbed him just like terry waite said janet probably one lot got the idea from the other agreed knox john had been working at it for months reckoned he was making real progress hed disappear for days at a time actually go into south or west beirut at times he went deep into south lebanon near the israeli border hed come back covered in filth and with a beard this long and every time say he was getting just that bit closer so they were cooperating the hezbollah janet said knox shook his head some not all he qualified its a mistake to think theyre a cohesive group by whatever name they call themselves obeying just one ayatollah theres dozens of cells groups sometimes not much bigger than ten twenty men theres liaison between a few communication at least but mostly its fratricidal war and some arent even operating in the name of allah theyre just gangs out for a buck is that what you think happened to john that he was seized by some group rivaling that with which he was dealing its as good a guess as any said knox that and the fact that he was cia in the first place wasnt it absurd to send another cia officer out at all erupted janet regretting the outburst at once it hadnt been knox who initiated the assignment someone had to do it said knox unoffended john was bureau chief here considered it his responsibility yes janet agreed distantly that was the sort of attitude john would have there were reports some files of course the american said we had leads to follow but a lot of it was in johns head personal relationships he hesitated the sadness obvious on his open face so far nothing there was another pause then knox added youve no ideareally no ideahow it hurts to say that is there someone else janet asked someone else trying to pick up where john stopped janet asked putting out more lines for several moments knox gave no reaction then bluntly he said no no one trying at all were tapping all the sources we can knox tried to assure her our liaison with all branches of lebanese intelligence is good through them we have a feed into some parts of syrian intelligence particularly the army and a dialogue of sorts with a few of the amal shias themselves but no one is out specifically looking and negotiating not like john was out specifically looking and negotiating its specifically forbidden since when janet asked anticipating the answer since john got snatched knox confirmed with anyone else janet would have been outraged disgusted but she couldnt feel any anger at the man who had been johns friend she sagged with fatigue what am i going to do she asked limpvoiced i dont know what to do not any more no one does said knox thats the biggest bastard and personally i think theyre aware of it and it gives them a buzz to know just how helpless great big uncle sam really is is he dead janet blurted abruptly do you think theyve killed him already knox hurried from behind the desk and put a comforting hand on janets shoulder hey now he said hold back a while i dont know how much longer i can hold back said janet emptily i feel so lost far worse this time than when hank died then at least i knew knew when i forced myself to accept the truth its the its the not knowing yes agreed knox thats what it is thank you said janet for being kind i mean recalling her impression upon entering the room she said it seems to have been a long time i wish there were more i could do a lot more janet looked down at the photo which she still held in her hand she said this is something she raised her eyes i dont know whats going to happen back in cyprus but i think ill stay on for a while at the churchill will you get me there if anything comes up if anything comes up ill get a message through if i have to bring it myself knox promised he went back around the desk checking his watch als late he said al she queried al hart our guy in nicosia hes coming in on the helo to escort you back i thought youd met already a name for the other anonymous american janet realized she said yes we met he told me to get out why dont you janet implored the man gently when youve done whatever they want in cyprus why dont you go back to england or to america getting mixed up in what happened here isnt going to get john out its just going to get you hurt maybe badly hurt maybe she said vaguely i dont know there was a summons from beyond the combinationlocked door and janet started slightly at the unexpected intrusion knox pushed an unseen release button somewhere beyond the desk and janet half turned expecting to see the american with whom she had returned from the british embassy instead it was the cia officer who had confronted her within hours of her arrival in cyprus here we are again he greeted the lady who knows bad words and cant take good advice im very tired said janet wearily youre goddamned lucky to be able to feel anything said the american he came into the room seeking a chair when he saw there wasnt one he hitched himself on the corner of the desk and said to knox how about this george today im a baby minder is this really necessary knox asked mildly what are you talking about shes been through quite a lot knox said i dont think the humphrey bogart routine helps much hart frowned and began to go red janet remembered how hed left her room at the churchill with his face burning what the hells wrong with you why dont we just leave it knox said disinterested in an argument knoxs dismissal appeared to anger the other american further he looked from knox to janet and said cosy times eh shut up al for christs sake said knox youre making yourself look like a jerk hart said not as much of a jerk as mrs stone here made herself look oh no siree the hostility didnt frighten janet rather it revitalized her janet decided the abrupt and unexpected kindness that knox had shownand for which shed been so gratefulhad lulled her and that she didnt need to be lulled she needed to face antagonistic attitudes like al harts who unquestionably was a jerk to fight back she said what about the man i stabbed have you heard anything ive heard a whole bunch of things hart said a whole bunch of things like just what they had in mind for you for instance what janet asked sure she knew did you thinkdid you really thinkthat they had an inside track to some fundamentalist group holding john hart demanded intent on conducting the conversation his way yes janet admitted i believed it they were cypriot fishermen who knew the area so why couldnt they have had cypriot fishermen hart echoed in artificial incredulity oh jesus lady dear jesus theyre scum arabs the best guess is from around jablah or baniyas on the north syrian coast theyre all members of the same family uncles and cousins and stuff like that the family name is said to be fettal although that could be so much bullshit like whatever names they used with you the nearest theyve ever come to catching fish is buying some at the market to spread the guts and mess about their boat to make it look like fishing is what they really do but what they really do is smuggle anything hart paused looking down at her or in your case anybody and did they have a market for you do you know where you were heading little lady they had you already sold as a whore you were on your way to some amal militia camp in south beirut and were not talking perfumed harems with satin sheets and scented fountains were talking being tethered like the piece of meat they were going to use you as in some hovel while they stood in line to hump you the next in line hauling the other guy off if he took too long were talking gangbangs and open mouths and whatever other trick you had to perform for christs sake al shut up knox erupted what the fuck do you think youre proving they had spoken arabic janet remembered like she remembered some of the things that theyd said break you in thats what im going to do really break you in and then the protest shes no good split apart and the reply going to have her first janet spoke with conscious evenness almost casually determined not to give hart the satisfaction of knowing how much hed sickened her she said so what about the man i stabbed what happened to him zarpas didnt say anything about a stabbing hart said at last visibly disappointed at her lack of reaction how many are in custody janet persisted two the one who ran the boat and an old guy so where was the one shed known as costas had haseeb the arab engineer from larnaca marina known she was going to be sold as a whore other lessformed questions tugged at janets mind the american had spoken easily of the cypriot policeman as if he knew him but then there was every reason why he should and zarpas would be handling the currency case wouldnt he because it was he who had continually warned her theyd both warned her in fact practically within minutes of each other that first day janet looked up at the lounging crewcut man her head to one side and said curiously it was you wasnt it youre not getting through to me lady that first day in nicosia janet said when you came to my hotel room and warned me off it was you who mentioned larnaca marina and zenon square and kitieus street im hearing the words but im missing the meaning i thought youd made a slip at the time janet continued in growing conviction but do you know what i think now i dont think you made a slip at all i think you knew id go there and you knew id get ripped off and then you thought id have to get out like langley told you to make me get out bullshit hart said but there was just the slightest flush did you do that al demanded the other american did you set her up like she thinks you did of course i damned well didnt protested hart what sort of questions that the sort of question that needs an answer knox said i told you no i know what you told me knox said whats the truth i didnt set her up hart was redder now it would have been hard getting in ahead of everyone else whats that supposed to mean janet asked hart stared directly down at her a nerve in his left cheek twitching in his obvious anger think about it lady think about how zarpas knew where you were and how much money youd deposited within hours of getting to nicosia and how i knew where you were to come in heavy with a warning right after him the bank was required to make a report janet said unsteadily you said you had a watch out at the airport a bank report would have taken weeks to get through the system even if such a requirement existed dismissed hart and i havent the resources to run any sort of check on airport arrivals not that quickly anyway so how janet asked partington the american said he warned zarpas that you were there and what you intended to do all zarpas had to do in turn was demand the banks call him immediately after youd made the deposit but you janet asked emptily partington again why janet said i dont understand why she stumbled to a halt there was no reason no purpose and he didnt know where id put the money anyway hart leaned slightly forward to make his point ms stone i want you to understand something i dont really give a damn whether you get taken for every penny youve got or whether you really do end up in an arab outhouse along with the rest of the animals but i do care if anything you do causes one of my colleagues to get killed thats why i want to see your ass out of here but others are concerned about you personally partington didnt know about the money janet insisted lady hart said partington knew all about the money because your father called him from england before you even landed told him what you were likely to do and asked him to pull every string he could think of to get you on the next available plane out of the island and back somewhere sensible my father janet said disbelieving your father hart said he worries about you from behind the desk knox said you know al i always knew you were a shit i just never knew until now exactly how much of a shit you are its something its really something i t was a military helicopter attached to the base at akrotiri so the comforts were minimal conversation was impossible and janet was grateful she did not want any talkany contact at allwith al hart after takeoff from the american compound in beirut janet pulled as far away from him as possible on the continuous porttostarboard seat and after they landed she tried to distance herself similarly in the back of the waiting police car hart seemed unaware of what she was doing if he did notice it he didnt appear to care not wanting to talk any more to her either there was still some heat in the day and the vehicle had no air conditioning almost at once the interior became eyedroopingly hot very shortly after picking up the motorway for the drive into the capital janet felt her lids closing and let it happen janet started frightened into bewildered wakefulness her body aching not immediately able to remember where she was or what she was doing babbling what no before becoming properly aware of her surroundings someone was shaking her shoulder it was the notetaking sergeant kashianis who was leaning into the car to shake her zarpas stood behind him janet heard a slam another noise that made her jump and saw that hart had left the car and closed his door this way please said kashianis janet got unsteadily from the vehicle needing the door edge for support until she became properly awake she ached very badly seemingly at every joint and her eyes were sticky and still heavy it would have been very easy for her to go back to sleep this way please urged the sergeant again janet made an uncertain path into the police headquarters aware of zarpas and hart ahead of her their heads lowered and close together in intent conversation the air was heavy inside but there was at least a desultory fan in zarpass office it was a disordered cluttered box of a place files and dossiers haphazard on top of cabinets which supposedly should have contained them others overflowing on to the floor the police officers desk was mountained with more paperwork in peaks and foothills in a glass vase were yellow longused water and a sad flower head lolled to one side already atrophying and janet wondered why he bothered zarpas shifted dossiers from a chair for janet to sit in kashianis took another chair alongside the desk and arranged his pad and pencils there zarpas sat behind the desk yet again hart had nowhere to sit there was no space in the disorder for him to perch on the desk as he had in beirut janet was childishly glad so you didnt bother to listen zarpas began i really am very tired janet said she vaguely remembered saying something similar to hart and wished she had thought of a better rejoiner were all very tired of it mrs stone said the cypriot do you normally share interviews with american intelligence personnel fought back janet when it pleases me to do so replied zarpas unimpressed and for our mutual benefithis and my own mutual benefitat the moment it pleases me to do so zarpas paused looking towards the american as if inviting the man to say something as well hart remained silent the cypriot announced weve found the man we think you stabbed dead demanded janet no longer lethargic not yet said the policeman someoneor maybe some peoplethis morning dumped him on the steps of the hospital in homer avenue there was a deep stab wound to the stomach and a sepsis had developed because it had not been properly treated there also seems a possibility of tetanus not dead accepted janet the relief sighing from her not yet repeated zarpas what does the bastard say zarpas blinked surprised at hearing a woman swear he said its not been possible yet to take a statement from him hes in intensive care what about the others they claim the idea of selling you to a shia group in beirut was that of the man found on the hospital steps this morning id guess they abandoned him expecting him to die if he does die theres only the fraud involving that letter of credit to worry them isnt there still serious but still a lesser charge the captain went ashore to negotiate with whoever it was in beirut insisted janet good said zarpas obtusely thats what i want i want a full and complete statement i want you to tell me everything for a prosecution asked janet cautiously of course janet tried to imagine how absurd she would appear in court recounting the events but found it difficult properly to encompass she said they werent able to cash the credit letter were they i havent suffered any financial loss not this time said zarpas his voice loud im not letting you refuse this time you cant force me to testify rejected janet no ones trying to force you to do anything came in hart speaking for the first time but you have the right of american residency from your marriage washington likes american residents to cooperate in matters of law and order you own an apartment in washington and have got a pretty highpowered job at a university there it would all be very inconvenient if you couldnt live in the united states any more wouldnt it what the hell are you saying im not saying anything said the man innocentfaced just posing a thought why demanded janet why what said hart playing word games you want me to be publicly discredited dont you discerned janet in awareness ive caused you a lot of awkwardness and you want me labeled in a court as an emptyheaded fool who didnt have a clue what she was doing i dont know what youre talking about said hart then why make the threat what threat it was a mental struggle for janet to keep up she said about my residency being revoked the american turned towards the policeman did i say anything about ms stones residency zarpas shook his head not that i heard janet looked between the two men moving her own head in understanding to zarpas she said so this is it is it this is what you call a stitchup unless i make a statement and appear in court and end up looking a complete idiota laughingstock that no one is going to take seriouslyi lose my right to remain in america im sorry said the policeman i really dont understand what youre saying a feeling of being lost engulfed janet of being lost and too weary to fight and wanting to give up and actually do what they wanted to go home she said and youd deny it if i complained talked to the newspapers for instance ms stone said hart patronizingly what right do i have to threaten your right to live in america any complaint would be demonstrably untrue and this is why i was flown here by an american helicopter and why the cia can take part in a cypriot police interview said janet you really have created a complicated little scenario to get rid ofor rather to ridiculea nuisance havent you all i am asking is that you make a complete statement to enable a prosecution to be brought against men who tried to defraud you out of said zarpas formally i am not going to comment upon the foolhardiness of preparing to give men you didnt even know or the wiseness of getting on a boat with them expecting to be introduced to more men you didnt know in the lebanon from where he stood near the overflowing filing cabinets hart made a snorting laughing sound it did sound ridiculous now conceded janet would sound ridiculous it hadnt though at the time to the patiently waiting kashianis she said why dont we get it over with zarpas only let her talk briefly before intruding with a question which became the way the statement was recorded janets responses to questions but written down in the form of a continuous narrative zarpas was very particular carefully bringing out every detail of the voyage and stopped her briefly but completely while he issued telephone orders for the arrest of hasseb as a possible accomplice when she finished her account janet said what about if the man dies wont i be guilty of something zarpas brought the corners of his mouth down in a doubtful expression i would have thought that could be considered justifiable selfdefense said the man and although if he does die it will be on cyprus territory the wound he suffered would appear to have been inflicted outside cyprus jurisdiction and no accusation has anyway been brought against you has it the other two want him to die janet supposed it was the tiredness but everything seemed very difficult to comprehend there were disorientating lapses in her concentration so that sometimes zarpass words were quite clear but other times what the man said seemed indistinct janet supposed she should be grateful for the reassurance about the stabbing she said have you finished with me now there will be the need for clarification maybe more questions zarpas said i will want to know where you are going to be at all times house arrest janet asked cooperation contradicted zarpas hart said and lets not have any more nonsense ok lady youve caused an awful lot of flak and achieved absolutely zero lets leave it at that let us the professionals worry about getting john out janet was too exhausted to argue as she had in the past couldnt think how to argue any more she said i would like to go zarpas provided a car and driver janet traveled with the window down and the wind in her face trying to revive herself and when she got to the hotel it was besieged with reporters janet let herself be bustled into a side lounge and responded to the questions but insisted that the television and radio interviews be conducted at the same time because she did not feel able to do them separately it still took a long time more than an hour and janet was so weary at the end that she had literally to force one foot in front of the other to walk to the elevator and from the elevator to her room she let her borrowed clothes lie where they fell and burrowed into bed scarcely aware of where she was sinking immediately into sleep she thought at first that the sound was in a dream not responding for several minutes to the ringing telephone and even when she lifted it she had to struggle for consciousness she did not completely succeed so that she could not follow what the man was saying for several more minutes an indepth long feature the man was saying i was at the conference downstairs but i want much more i would appreciate our being able to meet not today mumbled janet far too tired tomorrow tomorrow will be fine said the voice ill call around ten janet was asleep again and didnt hear the stipulated time w hich was why she was bewildered when the call came awakening her she was aware of her surroundings but momentarily unsure whether it was the same day that shed stumbled into bed or the following one the forgotten man to whom she was talking spoke of yesterdays conversation which gave janet a guide she lied and assured him she remembered but explained that she was running late and he asked how long and she said thirty minutes and he agreed that would be fine he said he would recognize her when she came into the lobby area while she was showering janet wondered how to get the borrowed clothes back to the journalist in beirut and decided pleased with the resolve to entrust the chore to al hart she wished there were more she could do to disturb the bastard as janet emerged from the elevator the man approached her he thanked her for agreeing to the meeting and offered a card identifying himself as david baxeter she saw that the publication for which he wrote was based in vancouver he was a slight but wiry man with tightly curled hair that topped his head without any obvious attempt at style and the mannerism of gazing directly into her eyes making her the only focus of his attention baxeter wore a gray sports jacket over gray trousers and the striped tie was predominantly gray too there was no identifiable accent in his voice at all certainly not canadian he was very softspoken she welcomed the idea of coffee and they sat indoors but overlooking the pool as she was seated janet supposed that sitting by the pool was the only way she would be able to occupy her time now until whatever hearing or trial took place it wasnt giving up or knuckling under to partington and hart and zarpasor to her father whose actions shed think about laterto abandon the idea of doing something personal entirely by herself it was finally confronting the common sense she had locked away and ignored from the moment the absurd idea first occurred to her in washington it had been stupid to imagine that alone she janet stone could do somethingdiscover somethingthat the professional agencies couldnt maybe she actually deserved the sneers and humiliation that would come with the trial after the coffee was served baxeter produced a small pocketsized tape recorder which he placed between them hurriedly asking if she minded the interview being conducted that way janet only half paying attention shook her head and said it was fine wishing it were over before it began with difficulty janet concentrated upon the interview maintaining the publicity was probably the only way for her sensibly to help john from now on baxeter was a very patient and courteous interviewer in almost every question he called her mrs stone and more than once apologized in advance if what he asked might distress her and just as frequently said they could stop to rest whenever she wanted and as she had the previous day in beirutcould it really only be the previous day it seemed like weeks agojanet thought how unusual it was to be treated with anything approaching sympathy or understanding it became a very long interview baxeter took her back even to before she and sheridan met to her time at oxford and her marriage to hank and appeared particularly interested in her position in middle eastern studies at georgetown university he changed the tape twice before even reaching the time of sheridans posting to beirut when the third tape was nearly exhausted baxeter said solicitous as ever i must be tiring you ive nothing else to do janet said and thought it sounded rude i mean im quite happy to go on as long as you want its lunchtime baxeter announced why dont we take a meal break she really didnt have anything else to do janet thought sure you can spare the time its a monthly magazine baxeter said ive got a long lead time then lunch would be fine it was baxeter who suggested going away from the hotel to the tembelodendron where he diffidently suggested he order for both of them janet agreed disinterested in food but enjoying being fussed over he got into a discussion with the waiter about how to cook the lamb and when it was served it was delicious baxeter took as much trouble over the afames wine and that was just as good the thought came to her that there were things about the man that reminded her of john the reflection passed as quickly as it came he said he had not been born in british columbia he had been in england when the magazine hired him as their middle east correspondent and chose to live in cyprus because it seemed the most convenient jumpingoff spot although he had considered moving to rome he knew cairo and amman better than she did and janet had to apologize that it had been years since shed been to either capital and that when she had she had been a schoolgirl anyway she guessed both places had changed baxeter said amman maybe but not cairo the traffics just as bad and the sewage smell is awful i remember the smell janet smiled who could ever forget it do you think ive been ridiculous janet blurted abruptly what he said startled me ridiculous coming here as i did and doing what i have done everyone says ive been stupid getting in the way baxeter did not immediately reply for several moments he gazed not at her but at the wineglass he held before him in both hands and then he said i think youve been naive certainly and youve been as lucky as hell but no not ridiculous youve definitely made it so that people cant forget the plight of john sheridan that surely has got to be an achievement id like to think so it is important to you what people think janet shrugged im sorry i didnt intend to be selfpitying i guess a lot of things have gotten on top of me its understandable baxeter said quite a lot of things have happened to you after all all to too little purpose that is self pity he said gently janet smiled i was thinking of john more than myself what are you going to do now i dont know admitted janet get the court business over i suppose hope something happens while im here that theres some news i mean what if there isnt pressed the man go home i guess there doesnt seem any point in hanging around home where america or england america said janet i dont think of england as home any more its to america that john will come back isnt it baxeter was slow responding to the question yes he said finally hell come back to america you dont believe that do you challenged janet you think hes dead or that he will be killed the man reached across the table covering her hand with his stop it he said forcefully youre giving up and you are letting yourself go into a trough of selfpity he was right conceded janet despite all her attempts to think otherwise that was exactly what she was doing thanks for the warning she said baxeter took his hand away shrugging and to answer you i dont know the hezbollah cant be anticipated secondguessed you know the shia tradition of taqqiyah approving of something contradictory to your faith if the need arises janet translated literally baxeter nodded its the catchall he said provides a religious excuse for anything so you do have an opinion janet said ok so you dont know but you think it could happen that theyll kill him id like to think more was being done to make contact to negotiate he said not really answering exactly thats what i cant stand what infuriates me theres been a demand why the hell cant america pressure kuwait into releasing the people its holding kuwait never has baxeter pointed out so why dont they establish a precedent said janet irrationally america sailed protective convoys around kuwaiti tankers during the iraniraqui war protecting the kuwaiti economy so why cant the state department tell them that unless they release the prisoners theyre holding washington wont help in future i would have thought that an option agreed baxeter they tortured the other cia man to death you know janet said i know thats what i think about sometimes janet said whats happening to him the awful things that are happening to him welcome back baxeter said janet frowned what do you mean youre fighting again baxeter said not giving up or feeling sorry for yourself janet smiled slowly you manipulated the conversation very cleverly i want a story on janet stone the fighter not janet stone the quitter he said and have you got it not yet the man said id like to continue the interview this afternoon they returned to the hotel but as soon as janet entered she was paged for messages she accepted them in the foyer baxeter beside her there had been a telephone call from partington who asked her to call back and another from her father with the same request the third note had no name just a nicosia telephone number with the suggestion she ring it to learn something to her advantage what could that mean she asked baxeter any one of a dozen things its practically cliche ill call it of course after whats happened so far dont you think you should be careful by doing what you surely dont expect me to ignore it no he agreed i dont expect you to ignore it so couldnt you do with some help i thought wed already talked about how little of that there was around why dont we suspend the interview until tomorrow and why dont you let me try to help you janet stood looking at the man for a story she asked suspiciously if it leads to anything worthwhile then yes what else baxeter answered honestly but i promise that if it does look good i wont publish or do anything that would endanger john until hes got out janet felt a sweep of relief at the thought of there being someone at last with whom she could at least discuss things she said you really mean that my word id appreciate your help very much accepted janet meekly j anet felt no intrusion having david baxeter in her room rather she felt a continued relief at having someone to do something for her she sat in the only easy chair while he perched on the edge of the bed which was conveniently near the telephone the man appeared to be switched through several different numbers and extensions at the main telephone exchange sometimes announcing himself to be a journalist and other times not as he sought to trace the anonymous number it was an hour from the time he started when he smiled up towards her a public kiosk on ayios prokopios its the road that leads towards the troodos mountains he announced oh janet said why disappointment she shrugged i dont know i was just expecting something different if whoever it is really knows something theyre hardly going to deal from their homes are they no janet said cheering up i wasnt thinking call it baxeter insisted theres got to be some demand obviously say you need time to think about it and that youll ring back thatll give us time to talk it through they exchanged places and janet dialed feeling for the first time vaguely selfconscious at getting involved in a negotiation in front of someone else she sat looking directly at him while the number rang without any response after several minutes janet said hand cupped unnecessarily over the mouthpiece no reply put it down he suggested janet did so and said what now wait a few minutes then well try again it became very quiet in the room and janet wished there were something else she could do there were the calls to her father and partington she remembered and at once decided against making them in front of the man now she said finally its been less than five minutes baxeter said but ok try it again this time the receiver was lifted on the third ring a voice in english said this is a public telephone box i was told to call it she said janet stone yes glad you called the message said you knew something to my advantage we do what we know where to look look where here in cyprus and from there where to look in beirut it was all so familiar she said what do you want a thousand at least the rate was going down she thought wearily following baxeters suggestion she said i want to think about it no tricks what do you mean no tricks were not dealing with the police no police she promised how long thirty minutes it took much less than that for janet to recount the complete conversation to baxeter who listened with his head intently to one side as she finished the account janet said its a con isnt it its got to be it sounds like it agreed baxeter and i supposed you had to expect it after all the publicity and the fact that a lot of people now know youre at this hotel he hesitated on the other hand can you afford to ignore it can i afford literally to try to negotiate came back janet i know zarpas has my bank account under permanent watch the counter clerk would keep me waiting and by the time i got the money hed be behind me asking what i was going to do yes baxeter said he would so its pointless the whole things pointless why dont i let you have the money you echoed janet the magazine then but why should you magazines and newspapers pay all the time for stories and articles he pointed out and we already agreed that if this came to anything id be able to write exclusively about it after john got out he smiled actually he added at the going rate is very cheap shed been offered much more in washington at the beginning remembered janet but what if it is a con and you lose your i cant said baxeter simply when you call back say that youll need time to collect the money ask for he paused trying to decide upon a period ask for three hours in that time i can ensure that all the bank note numbers are recorded if its a genuine call leading to something ill have wasted a cashiers time if it is a fraud then i report it to the police with the numbers and the money becomes valueless wheres the risk it seems almost easy janet conceded reluctantly where can it go wrong janet thought for several moments wanting to find the flaw eventually she said i cant find one remember baxeter urged three hours agree to whatever handover arrangements they want it doesnt matter he got up and left there were still a few minutes before the second call and janet remained staring at the door through which baxeter had gone she supposed a lot of people would have sneered at the professional cynicism of his becoming involved but janet couldnt be one of them she sincerely believed he would hold back on the publication of anything that might endanger john and baxeter seemed able to think quickly and clearly about possible pitfalls at the moment it was an incredible comfort to have someone upon whom she felt she could rely someone who didnt react to everything she did as if she were mentally defective ok so maybe that was just more professional cynicism someone behaving as he had to behave to do his job janet decided she couldnt give a damn it was just good not to be entirely alone any more her call was answered on the third ring i agree she said you didnt have any choice did you the man said no janet said no choice at all there was a satisfaction in knowing there was no way the gloating bastard could cheat her or rather cheat david baxeter do you know the walled part of nicosia no to the west there is the paphos gate thats where we want the money brought i need time to get it janet said two hours not enough i need three thats too long i cant do it in two the deals off then all right its off you dont mean that goodbye wait janet believed she detected a muffled conversation with other people around the man to whom she was talking the voice returned to the line three then what do i do when i come to the gate nothing well recognize you youre a wellknown lady i want to know what im getting for my money i told you before where to look ill want proof therell be a photograph and remember no tricks janet thought again of the other calls she had to make but she did not immediately redial who to call first she decided upon england her mother answered gabbling off the moment she recognized janets voice the woman complained that the television and still pictures from beirut had made her look simply terrible as if it had been a longarranged photocall for which janet had days to prepare and demanded to know what janet imagined she was doing getting on a boat with such men in the first place it took janet several attempts to cut across the babble and get her father to the telephone he began in much the same way as her mother and it was difficult again to stop him in the end she shouted i know what you did she yelled what her father said you telephoned partington and told him you wanted me stopped any way that was possible said janet still shouting you want to know how it happened thats how it happened partington and the local cia man set me up to be robbed and cheated and made to look stupid so id have to come home like the silly little girl you think i am you happy now you happy that i almost got raped and that the man i stabbed might still die that i was being shipped off to become a gangbanged whore in some backstreet shed the fury was pouring out of her and she had to stop breathless when she did so it was very easy for her to hear that her father was crying love you he sobbed did it because i loved you the answera lot of answerscame to janet but she didnt bellow them back at the man because there wasnt any anger not any more instead quietvoiced now she said just leave me alone ok dont interfere any more come home he pleaded please come home i cant now janet said theres the court hearing youre only a witness you could come back and then return to cyprus when it was necessary for you to give evidence i dont want to come back not yet janet said stubbornly dont try to do anything else her father said still pleading i am not going to try to do anything else janet lied would baxeter want to come to the paphos gate meeting with her she was at first surprised at the thought but then accepted it because it wasnt surprising at all she would have some protection some safety if he did im sorry her father said so very sorry i didnt know how he stumbled to a halt couldnt have stop it daddy said janet knowing the blur of tears herself now im ok the police accept the stabbing as justifiable selfdefense and say that it didnt happen in their jurisdiction anyway im not hurt not physically anyway can you forgive me no thought janet at once not completely she could not forgive him didnt know if she ever could she said of course i forgive you i really am you told me that janet stopped him look after mummy please come home he said well talk about it another time do that her father said keep in touch dont stop keeping in touch i said ive forgiven you she felt no difficulty no discomfort in lying to her father even though she could not ever recall lying to him before she decided that everyone was cynical to achieve a purpose when the need arose i love you he said again i love you too janet said was that a lie too a response fitting the circumstance of the moment of course not shed have to be careful not to become too cynical naive though shed been until now she should have done it differently janet knew at once the confrontation and the anger should have been directed at partington whod triggered everything and not at an old man whom she lovedof course she loved himwhod done something he thought was best without any idea of what his action might bring about could partington have had any conception either no matter she should have vented her anger upon the embassy official and not her father because now she felt drained too drained to shout at anyone else she wouldnt bother with partington until the following day where was baxeter janet realized she was anxious for the man to get back and was at once surprised at the awareness why the hell should she worry about the return of a man she hardly knew because of john the answer presented itself at once and janet openly smiled at it of course that was the reason despite her apprehension about the paphos gate meeting there was always the chance that it mightjust mightbe genuine and so the sooner baxeter came back the sooner they would discover whether or not it was worthwhile that was it janet hurried to the door when he knocked she smiled and baxeter smiled back one of his teeth to the left was crooked but not unpleasantly so he put a carefully wrapped bundle on the side table and said well they didnt want to agree to three hours but finally they did reported janet the paphos gate he promised there would be a picture of what he didnt say easy to get lost inside the walls baxeter said reflectively its the divided sector janet said arabs would not be able to move freely inside would they baxeter shrugged his shoulders depends on how well they know their way around what about the money baxeter nodded towards the package and at the same time took a long narrow strip of printout paper from his inside pocket every number carefully recorded he said i really am most grateful for everything you are doing ive got a professionally vested interest if this leads to anything it will be as much to my advantage as to yours he said i actually think ive got more to gain than you disputed janet and im still grateful weve time for a drink downstairs before we go said baxeter that ok with you youre coming with me then didnt you expect me to janet let her hands come up and fall in uncertainty i didnt know she said lets talk about it downstairs janet brushed past the man as she left the room and she was aware of his cologne it was strong john had never gone in for things like that janet remembered janet asked for coffee baxeter chose scotch janet watched the barman pour caught by a familiarity but unable to think what it was glenfiddich she saw remembering she and john had drunk glenfiddich that first night in nathans she physically shifted in her seat uncomfortable with the memory somehow it seemed wrong when she was with another man which she acknowledged to be a stupid feeling but one she had nevertheless she said the person i spoke to kept on about not involving the police no tricks was how he put it i asked how i would recognize him and he told me i wouldnt that hed recognize me youll have to make the actual meeting by yourself agreed baxeter theyll be watching obviously they wont approach if im with you where will you be janet hadnt intended to sound nervous baxeter became serious and reached across the table for her hand as he had over the luncheon table dont worry he said ill be right there very close nothing bad is going to happen to you not this time thank you janet said not looking back at him she shifted her fingers away from his touch sorry he said withdrawing his hand theres nothing to apologize for the paphos gate is a clever choice resumed baxeter briskly theres a main highway directly outside and three other major roads forming other good escape routes ill stay in the car directly opposite the gate so ill be able to watch you all the time what if janet straggled to a halt forcing the question she said what if they do make a grab at me scream said baxeter at once scream and run back towards me theyll want to see the money so well loosen the package if they go for you drop it so the money breaks out itll deflect them but theyll get the but they wont get you said baxeter and the moneys useless anyway i janet stopped again what nothing janet said brisk herself now wed better get going they had driven to lunch in janets hired car but this time baxeter led the way to his vehicle when janet saw it she faltered glad he was slightly in front and didnt see her reaction it was a volkswagen unlike johns this one was dirty and there was a dent in the rear wing it must have been a longago accident because it was already rusting baxeter let her in before walking around to the drivers side and while he was doing so janet saw that the car was uncared for inside as well a sweater and some very old newspapers were discarded on the rear seat and the ashtray overflowed with chocolate bar wrappings baxeter saw her looking when he got into the car and said i gave up smoking six months ago now all i do is eat sweets the risk isnt lung cancer any more its diabetes the man drove familiarly towards the old part of the capital joining up with the road system that looped entirely around the walls thats the museum baxeter identified as they went by the building and up ahead is the post office block thats where im going to park the paphos gate is right opposite he hesitated looking sideways at her i wont be more than twenty yards away at any time i wouldnt have thought it would have affected me so much as this janet said embarrassed i would have been surprised if it hadnt said baxeter he stopped outside the telecommunications complex and pointed across to the meeting place there he said im very close yes janet agreed you all right fine baxeter had driven with the parceledup money on the floor beneath his legs he lifted it on to his lap and peeled away the tape holding the package together he offered it to janet and said pull the paper back from the top like that then theyll be able to see the money janet took it wouldnt it be wonderful if it worked if this really were something wonderful baxeter agreed janet got out of the volkswagen and wedged the parcel under her left arm with the tape loosened the package felt unsteady and she put her other hand across her body frightened of dropping it and scattering money everywhere she had to time her crossing of egypt avenue to dodge the approaching cars people thronged the area directly in front of the gate and janet hoped she would not be lost from baxeters view among the crowd although it was midevening there were still some fruit stalls loaded for business and groups of souvenir vendors and postcard sellers stood at either side of the gate itself janet slowed when she reached the gate standing first to the right and then crossing over to the far side she pretended interest in a copperwork stall which was a mistake because the bent clawfingered man began trying to thrust bracelets and necklaces upon her to escape janet went across to the other side of the gate she wanted to check the time but didnt because it would have meant turning her arm to see her watch and risking dropping the money she wished she had gone to the toilet before leaving the hotel she looked back towards the post offfice complex she could make out the volkswagen but not as clearly as she would have liked baxeter would be able to see her janet thought in selfassurance she was sure he was absolutely dependable right on time janet gasped in surprise half turning illogically janet had expected the man to come from outside the old part towards her but he had emerged from the inside through the gate he wore a loose qumbaz a robe going right down to the ground and so voluminous it was impossible to tell if he were a thin or fat man and around his head and concealing his lower face was wrapped a red and white bedouin kaffeyeh hed spoken english and janet could not detect the sort of intonation she would have expected from an arab what is it you have janet demanded that the money yes let me have it i want what you have first let me see it janet parted the wrapping as baxeter had shown her determinedly closing it after a few moments now you from beneath his robe the man brought an envelope holding up but away from her here he said all i can see is an envelope still keeping it away the man reached inside half pulling out what appeared to be some sheets of paper and a glossy print its all here janet felt the jump of excitement deep in her stomach whats the photograph of the house what house where he is in beirut the excitement grew flowing through her trying to control it she said what else the address where to go here where youll get the address in beirut i dont understand why youre doing it this way she protested no tricks remember said the man if youve involved the policeif im jumped uponthen i wont telephone the house where im sending you to say everything is all right if they dont get a call within five minutes theyre going to leave the same if the money is phony when ive a chance to look at it closer cautious eh very janet agreed it seemed a reasonable explanation for what the man was doing give me the money the man demanded the envelope janet insisted he offered it tentatively and janet matched his movement holding out the package but to receive it he had to give her the envelope freeing both his hands he grabbed at it turning as he did so scurrying back into the walled city janet was moving fast too she ran back across egypt avenue careless of the cars this time and darted inside the volkswagen let me see he tugged the material from inside the envelope spreading it out on his lap nodding but not looking at janet as she recounted the conversation he studied the map and the directions more than the photograph its right around the other side of the citadel he said in the palouriotissa district he handed the map across to her and said ill drive you map read janet held everything up close in front of her face trying to work out where they were going as baxeter turned the car reached the junction and began skirting the walls along stasinos avenue it says its a twostory house she read number in the culdesac off mareotis i know mareotis said baxeter i think this really is something said janet ive got a feeling about it traffic clogged ahead of them baxeter pumped the horn and said come on come on it took almost thirty minutes to complete the loop and come up to king george square from which mareotis fed off baxeter slowed now traveling the entire length until he reached kapotas where he said damn and jerked the car around to retrace their route there pointed janet head close to her map again it was a narrow rutted spur of an alley without any proper lighting baxeter had to stop the car and get out to calculate the consecutive numbering back inside the car he edged slowly forward counting off the houses as he did so seven nine his voice trailed off and he stopped the car not saying anything its a mistake its got to be a mistake janet said gazing at the completely empty lot where number eleven would have had to be weve miscounted lets do it again baxeter got out of the car to check the numbering on both sides and then knocked at the entrance to nine in the light behind the occupant a fat sagbusted woman janet was able to see a lot of gesturing although she could not hear what was said there was a slowness about baxeters return to the car im sorry he said really sorry tell me there isnt a number eleven there never has been he switched on the interior light looking closely at the photograph he said i dont even think this is beirut the background looks far more like cyprus than beirut janet broke down the weeping this time was different from the way she had cried in beirut this time there was a mix of emotions of regret and of disappointment and of frustration she felt baxeters arm around her and she allowed herself to be pulled into his shoulder and she sobbed against him letting it happen there was some relief in weeping why she said her voice unsteady why does it always have to be like this easy he said we always had our doubts didnt we i wanted so much for it to be right this time something could still come up janet pulled away from him but only slightly she said your moneys gone you know thats protected i still feel responsible dont be silly b axeter insisted upon going alone to the police to report the incident and freeze the money and janet was grateful baxeter dropped her off at the hotel on his way reminding her of the postponed interview the following day and janet assured him she would not forget another stupid episode janet thought lying unsleeping in her darkened room which shed suspected before shed started but shed had no choice but to go through with the charade so it was even more stupid to spend time on recriminations oddly one of her biggest regrets was breaking down and crying like that in front of baxeter showing herself up hed been very understanding kind and gentle and understanding she did not think it was any professional cynicism she was sure it was genuine she was glad hed been with her thered been some apprehension particularly when she stood by the paphos gate but the knowledge of his being so close at handof protection being only yards awayhad made everything much easier he really was janet stopped the drift determinedly and then demanded the reason from herself there was nothing wrong nothing at which to feel ashamed in reflecting on a man who was kind and considerate and had actually gone to a great deal of inconveniencethe sort of inconvenience he would be undergoing now at the police stationon her behalf she was not indulging in any schoolgirl romantic fantasy that would have been absurd unthinkable she was merely looking back over the events of the day that shed shared with someone the word shared stayed with her thats what shed done shared something not been alone after all that had happened the neardisasters and the humiliations it had been nice for a few brief hours not to be alone any more just as she hadnt been alone after john sheridan came into her life janet frowned at the comparison not the same she thought not the same at all it would be quite wrong for her to combineto confusethe two the following morning janet telephoned the british embassy but without any of the anger she was now sorry at having directed at her father in contrast she was chillingly cool she told partington at once that she was aware of his role in what had happened to her talking down his weaklybegun protest by telling him that her father as well as hart had confirmed it as she mentioned the american she remembered the stillunreturned clothes deciding now against any more contact with the cia man janet demandedrather than requestedthat the embassy help return them to the woman in beirut partington flustered promised that he would of course take care of it i couldnt have known how it would turn out said the diplomat not what they intended to happen to you in beirut robbery but not rape eh your father said the money didnt matter that without it you wouldnt be able to do anything i dont want to talk about it any more said janet it was difficult for her to accept but she really did feel bored by it now i really am very sorry thats what people seem perpetually to be very sorry apart from returning the clothes is there anything else i can do no janet said careless of the rudeness you will call me again if i can help wont you no janet said again if i thought i needed any sort of help i dont think i would come to you mr partington janet was ready waiting for baxeters arrival and picked up the telephone on the first ring when he called from the downstairs house phone they met in the lounge overlooking the swimming pool again although he did not at once turn on the tape recorder janet asked about his meeting with zarpas and baxeter said he had not seen him a subordinate officer had promised to put a stop on the money and circulate all banks credit exchanges and hotels as an additional precaution baxeter had told his own bank to duplicate the warning through all its branches he agreed with her that he supposed there would be a prosecution if whoever had the money attempted to pass it but he assured janet the policeman who had taken his statement had not talked of needing one from her what about your magazine they cleared it before i started so they knew the risks baxeter said casually theres no problem i still wish it had been my money its over finished said baxeter even more dismissively janet found the resumed interview difficult and could not at first understand why it was because she did not think of him as a stranger any more she decided finally at the first encounter their roles had been clearly defined interviewer to interviewee but now it didnt seem like that any more baxeter appeared to find a similar problem posing his questions oversolicitously frequently apologizing in advance for what he was going to ask and several times abandoning a query in midsentence saying that it didnt matter and twice that it was too personal it was late afternoon before baxeter turned the recorder off you must know more about me now than i do about myself said janet trying to lighten the mood you dont mind not if it helps john no he agreed looking directly at her not if it helps john janet looked away sure youve got all you want not quite he said there are still the photographs of course janet agreed at once wholl take them i will you do both questioned janet not expecting that he did they get good value out of me smiled the man when baxeter looked beyond her to the grounds outside the lights gone now he said are you free tomorrow sometime it would fill in part of another empty day janet thought which is all it would be just occupying part of a day she said sure what time your convenience he said we really are being most polite to each other arent we he was looking directly at her again but did not immediately reply yes he said very polite what time is the light best midday usually why not make it midday then could we make it a little earlier he asked i thought we might drive somewhere for better backgrounds the troodos mountains perhaps of course when janet emerged from the hotel the following day she saw hed had the volkswagen cleaned which made the rusting dent in the wing look worse than it had when the car had been dirty it was clean inside too and between the two front seats there was a large carton of sweets and chocolate bars help yourself he offered you really eat these all the time im getting better down to a pound a day as they drove towards the mountains baxeter maintained a constant chatter about the island pointing out monasteries and medieval and roman historical sites he talked about the crusaders and told the story of aphrodite whose temple he said was on the far side of the island janet listened politely conscious of the effort he was making hed dug deeply into the sweet bag by the time they reached troodos the mountains were larger than janet had expected them to be mistclouded at the summits and heavily cloaked in firs and pine they stopped at a roadside tavern with an outside area ceilinged with vines and janet shivered involuntarily when he asked why she confessed that it had briefly reminded her of the souroiled cafe on the road to dhekelia where shed been taken to meet the fettal family baxeter rose at once saying they should go but janet insisted on staying determined to exorcise the ghosts from her mind she let him order the fish kebabs and he photographed her at the table and took more pictures after their lunch janet standing against the trellised vines and then against the verandah rail gazing out over a deep and thickly wooded valley they climbed higher in the early afternoon and janet suddenly saw the huge white globe like a giant tennis ball which baxeter identified as one of the listening stations maintained by the british on the island janet actually opened her mouth to speak of the eavesdropping cooperation that willsher had told her about but quickly shut it again throughout every interview she had given and certainly during the twoday session with baxeter janet had held back from disclosing anything of that conversation determined to keep her side of the bargain with the cia man did it matter any more she wondered that meeting in washington seemed a very long time ago baxeter took more photographs at another verandahed vantage spot then came close beside her to point in the direction of aphrodites temple janet was once more aware of his cologne the continual sweeteating seemed to have scented his breath too i think ive got all the photographs i need he said time to go then i guess so as they made their way unhurriedly towards the volkswagen janet said ive enjoyed the day he held open the door for her to get into the vehicle and as he entered from his side baxeter said ive enjoyed it too very much he twisted in his seat so that he could look directly at her he didnt try to start the car wed better be going said janet i he started then stopped what nothing baxeter started the car and ground the gears when he engaged them the road snaked downwards in a neverending loop of hairpin bends and janet began to feel vaguely nauseated from constantly turning back upon themselves the silence lasted for a long time to break it she said what happened to the car what car this one the dent in the wing dont know it happened in a car park have to get it fixed one day it was not something she had ever discussed with him but janet was sure that john sheridan would have repaired a damaged wingor for that matter damage to anything else he ownedwithin an hour or two after he discovered it she became instantly irritated with herself linking them together in her mind again she thought she said could you slow down a little im beginning to feel slightly carsick do you want to stop he asked solicitous again no just go slower baxeter did markedly and said have you been to limassol no there are some good restaurants along the coast from there really there was another silence and then he said would you like to eat dinner he hesitated not immediately i dont mean later when weve got off the mountain youll only feel discomfort while were going around these bends i dont feel sick any more janet said but no thank you for asking but no of course not he accepted at once i dont want to sound rude i understand janet wished she did what would be wrong with having dinner on the way back to nicosia she said maybe another and came to a halt herself wishing she had not begun the sentence im feeling rather tired she finished fatuously im concerned he announced what about your getting mixed up in any more nonsense like that business at the paphos gate and before im learning with experience said janet bitterly what exactly was she learning she wondered can i make a suggestion without waiting for an answer he continued on please let me give you my phone number theres an answering machine so i get messages even if im not there if you get any more approachesanything at alldont try to handle it by yourself let me be involved he risked a glance at her across the car i dont mean for a story not primarily anyway let me help you first and well work out the rest later i just dont want you to be hurt janet could not find the words to describe how she felt but certainly her eyes were clouded and when she started to speak her voice was jagged she said thats very kind of you generous but what about your other commitments i can be as flexible as i like working with the magazine i was not thinking particularly about the magazine corrected janet what about girlfriends wives and children he looked across the car again grinning there are no girlfriends wives or children in that or any other order she smiled back grateful he was making a joke of the question as i said its a very generous offer thank you so will you he pressed yes promise i promise outside the hotel he made a groping haphazard search through the pockets of his jacket and then the glove compartment and withdrew triumphantly from there with a crumpled and bent piece of pasteboard in his hand knew i had one somewhere he said offering her the visiting card with his number printed upon it and this he added snatching into the carton and proffering the wrapped pastille its strawberry flavored the best i always save it until last she laughed openly unoffended by the flirtation she was enjoying herself and it hadnt happened for a long time not since before john had been snatched all i seem to do is thank you will you will i what come out to dinner with me some other time janet felt herself coloring and hoped he wouldnt notice in the fading light she said i dont know maybe when i said maybe said janet as unoffended by his persistence as she had been by the earlier flirtation can i call of course you can and youll get in touch with me if there are any more approaches i promised i would so i will baxeter did not call the following day janet sat around the pool in the morning and went into the city in the afternoon and checked her messages when she got back acknowledging the disappointment and becoming unhappy at feeling it that night eating a solitary dinner she kept remonstrating with herself and was convinced by the time she went to bed that her attitude was in no way unfaithful to john after so much hostility and rejection and drama what could be more normal than respondingproperly respondingto a gesture of friendship and that was all it amounted to janet was equally convinced a gesture of friendship nothing more certainly nothing more on her part the next day zarpas gave her the date of the first hearing against the fettal family cautioning her it was only a remand appearance but warning her that the magistrates would expect her to attend and within an hour partington telephoned to say the borrowed clothes had been returned to beirut and ask if she had changed her mind about his offer to help which she hadnt she caught a reflection of herself leaving the bynowfamiliar pool abruptly aware just how deeply tanned she had become and at this rate she guessed she would become more so janet tried to suppress the sound of any pleasure in her voice when baxeter called on the friday and was sure she had succeeded but a brief and unsettling feeling a kind of numbness briefly swept her body when he invited her to dinner she managed too to seem unsure in advance of accepting it and felt after replacing the receiver that the conversation had been maintained on precisely the necessary level of friendship he assured her the orangery at the hilton was good for nouvelle cuisine and it was and afterwards they went to a bar on the famagusta road where there was good bouzouki music he said the article and photographs had worked out very well and that his vancouver office was pleased she told him about the initial court appearance of the fettals and he at once offered to accompany her if she would like him to janet surprised accepted baxeter asked what she was doing on the weekend and janet blurted nothing before thinking what she was saying so he invited her to paphos and she accepted baxeter made no attempt to kiss herno attempt at any physical contact at allwhen he took her back to the hotel and neither did he the following day which she enjoyed as much as she had their first trip to the troodos mountains there were three outings in the succeeding week one lunch and two dinners and that weekend he suggested going through the turkishheld area in one of the united nationsescorted convoys to kyrenia which he assured her was possible janet made the journey curiously saddened by the occasional protest sign and the indications of squalor compared to the greekheld sections which were all she had previously encountered janet thought kyrenia was one of the most attractive cities she had visited on the island and baxeter as usual was an enthusiastic guide he made her climb all over the ochre and yellow castle and in one comparatively small room pointed to a small circle in the middle of the floor this was the officers mess hall he explained in medieval times prisoners were sentenced to be pushed down that hole it opens into something like the shape of an upside down light bulb theres one in the ordinary soldiers mess as well theyre called oubliette holes because once put in there the prisoners never got out they were forgotten all they had to eat apart from themselves were the scraps that the officers and men used to throw them for amusement baxeters voice trailed off at the look on janets face oh christ he said oh christ im sorry what the oh shit its all right she said stiffly its not he contradicted i dont know what to say jesus christ just dont say anything m ustafa fettal died without recovering consciousness early on the day of the remand hearing three hours before the court convened and it was not until she arrived at the magistrates building that janet learned of the death chief inspector zarpas was waiting anxiously on the court steps when she arrived with baxeter looking with passing curiosity at the journalist when janet got from the car the steps were jammed with reporters and cameramen and there was an abrupt flare of lights there were a lot of shouted questions too which at the time janet did not understand zarpas said dont say anything theres something youve got to know and started to hurry her away janet looked around for baxeter but couldnt see him zarpas took her into a side office off the main courtroom corridor and told her there dead she said disbelieving i warned you it might happen somehow i just never imagined it would well it has the policeman said harshly he had probably the most important court hearing of his career about to begin and he wanted to break the mood into which he believed she was retreating what must i do now asked janet numbly ive killed a man she thought taken a life do frowned zarpas and then understood the question ive already told you that i dont intend to recommend any proceedings because of the circumstances of the stabbing but youve made a confession so i must officially inform the lebanese authorities because of their jurisdiction but as you already told them and they released you once i dont imagine theyll want to proceed either that wasnt right thought janet it wasnt right to be able to kill somebody and escape any penalty whatsoever irrespective of how extenuating the circumstances might be she said how will it affect todays hearing i dont know admitted zarpas the other two have been in conference with their lawyers for over an hour now ever since i told them i didnt mean him to die i just wanted stop it zarpas said harsher still stop it right now it happened and we know how it happened and no action is going to be taken what you did was justified dont collapse into a lot of unnecessary recrimination lets try to make sure the other two dont walk away janet nodded but didnt speak sure youre all right demanded the man i think so janet managed although it wasnt true she didnt think she was all right at that moment she didnt know what she was you wont be required to give evidence today zarpas assured her formally i just wanted you here for any eventuality when asked janet that depends on whatever the defense say today and then what the court decides i want to get it over with said janet too loudly the concern filled zarpass face at janets unsteady reactions and he thought how fortunate it was that she was not being called today shed be all right when the shock wore off that was all it was understandable shock he said lets get on inside the courtroom was comparatively small and it was already crowded expectant zarpas led her to a reserved area deep in the well of the court and sat her down at once janet looked around for baxeter worried when at first she couldnt see him and then she did inconspicuous at the side away from the main press bench he smiled faintly and gave a head movement she could not fully understand but which she inferred to mean that he had heard about the death quite near to baxeter she located partington when he realized shed seen him the diplomat nodded too without any facial expression janet looked away not responding the clerk demanded that the court stand for the entry of the magistrates and janet dully took her lead from what people did around her there was a shuffle of interest when the fettal brothers were called into the dock janet forced herself to look aware that the attention of almost everyone in the court was upon her as she did so and she made a determined effort to show no emotion the one who had acted as captain wore the same suit and tie as he had in the dkehelia road cafe but his hair had been slicked back in an attempt at neatness the other wore no jacket and hobbled with difficulty into the dock neither man looked at her the charge that they had jointly attempted fraudulently to covert a money draft in the sum of by purporting that they had the right to such monies was formally delivered and at once the prosecuting solicitor asked for a remand in custody to enable the prosecution to prepare its case then the defense was formally invited to respond the fettals solicitor was a fat confident man who appeared to enjoy the theatrics of a court of law he smiled indulgently around the room and made much of arranging before him his already perfectly arranged papers your worships he began still bent over his files my clients utterly refute this accusation and i intend to prove absolutely their innocence although unfortunately someone associated with them who would have been called to prove that innocence has regrettably died this very day the man paused as if a moments respectful silence were necessary and then continued my clients have no knowledge whatsoever of the original acquisition of the bearer letter of credit in the name of mrs janet stone the man turned and looked fully at janet there was no selfsatisfied smile now they have never met mrs stone nor traveled with mrs stone on any vessel plying out of this island to the coast of lebanon there was a bustle of surprised reaction around the room zarpas was sitting just two rows away and in front of her and janet saw him lean towards the prosecuting solicitor and then pull back nodding in apparent anticipation my clients shared with a cousin of theirs mustafa fettal the use of a sailing boat a generalpurpose craft in which they pursued various activities sometimes fishing sometimes coastal trading resumed the lawyer he was now looking intently at the magistrates wanting them fully to take the point he was about to make but the three of them did not constitute a permanent crew sometimes all three of them sailed it sometimes only two a further pause identified the moment and sometimes your worships it sailed with one man i repeat with just one man the day before that stipulated in the charge before you mustafa fettal informed his relations the two accused now in the dock that upon that evening he wished to use the boat alone one of my clients could not have sailed that night anyway he had suffered a grievous wound to the foot an injury involving a broken bottle and was quite incapacitated neither saw anything unusual in their cousins request it was an arrangement each had known and used many times in the past they of course agreed it was then that mustafa fettal produced the document which is the subject of the charge before you today he asked these two to go to a bank to negotiate the order for him and arranged that they should meet the following day for him to receive the money janet was conscious of more attention upon herself and knew her face was blazing with indignation at what was being said the court couldnt accept it she thought they just couldnt it is surely an indication of their innocence their unawareness of what they were being asked to do that they quite openly entered a branch of a local bank in larnaca and offered the document not realizing it had to be endorsed by the person in whose name it was issued before any monies could be handed over said the man surely sirs this is the innocent action of ordinary men not the conniving behavior of villains intent to defraud ahead of janet there was another muffled consultation going on between zarpas and the prosecutor and more head nodding the lawyer concluded this sirs is the basis of the defense i shall be callinga defense i am confident will result in their immediate acquittal without any reference to a higher courtand in the circumstances i confidently apply to you today for them to be permitted bail to enable them to continue about their lawful duties the prosecutor was on his feet before the other lawyer was fully seated the bail objection was very forcefully put it was pointed out that the two had access to a boat and zarpas was formally sworn to give evidence that the police had serious doubts of either appearing at another hearing if they were allowed out of custody the magistrates did not need to retire to reject the bail application when the fettals were taken down from the dock and the magistrates retired janet remained where she had been seated unsure what to do in the brief moments of hesitation zarpas reached her and said lets go back to that office and talk again the policeman shielded her against the crush of questionshouting reporters in the outside corridor once inside the office janet wheeled upon the man and said that was preposterous absolutely preposterous of course it was preposterous zarpas agreed mildly with the man dead theyre able to change their story say they knew nothing about your being taken to the lebanon as a whore it makes nonsense of everything that really took place said janet still outraged thats what the defense tries to do in the majority of cases zarpas said deciding she was sufficiently recovered he said but it tells us one thing youre going to be in for some pretty tough crossexamination youll have to be ready for it but theres proof insisted janet trying for some reality against the exasperation that burned through her the arab engineer haseeb at larnaca marina and the cafe owners on the dhekelia road she groped for the recollection and said excitedly we were served by a young boy obviously the son of the owner zarpas moved his head sadly from side to side you told us all that in your statement we havent been able to find anyone named haseeb working around larnaca marina or anyone who knows him by that name no one at the dhekelia road cafe remembers anything i dont believe it said janet aghast theres no one reason shrugged zarpas resigned theres family loyalties race loyalties theres people with things themselves to hide who dont want to get involved just not wanting to get involved is enough more often than not i really am going to be made to look the complete fool arent i janet said crushed by the recollection of why she had been entrapped into the situation in the first place no zarpas said you did silly things unthinking illconsidered silly things but everyone can understand and feel sympathy with why you did them what you hoped to achieve complete fools behave without any logic or reason so youre not a complete fool just a determined lady who made mistakes janet smiled at the policeman against whom she had felt antagonistic but didnt any more she said i appreciate that very much that makes it seem right she stopped and at once blurted no i didnt mean that not that killing that could never be right not completely whatever the circumstance but everything else the legal process has begun now zarpas said i know janet said curious at the reminder theres a mob of pressmen outside warned zarpas you mustnt give interviews or say anything that is likely to affect the outcome of any hearing i dont want to give the fettals any more loopholes through which to crawl back into the sewer i wont janet promised would you like me to lay on a car i came with someone ill be all right there was a mob two uniformed constables had to run interference to get her to the exit throughout janet shook her head against the cacophony of demands and repeated nothing to say and guessed that the photographs and the television footage would be as awful as they had been in beirut except that here shed look as if she were trying to get away from the attention instead of cooperating with it every step of the way she searched against the glare for baxeters face in the crowd but couldnt see it by the time she reached the steps the panic was beginning to well up the fear that for some inexplicable reason he wasnt there to help her and that eventually she would be abandoned to be tugged and gnawed at by the pack around her and then she saw the car with its rusty dent and felt a surge of relief he was waiting directly at the bottom of the steps carelessly in a prohibited parking zone and with the engine running and when he saw her emerge he leaned across to open the door for her to enter there was a grabbing struggle as she tried to enter the car and baxeter pushed the throng back with the door edge someone yelled bastard and another voice said son of a bitch and as he took the car away from the curb scattering them baxeter shouted back fuck you he made two very tight turns an obvious attempt to lose any pursuit and said im sorry what for swearing like that i didnt notice janet said wanting at once to get it out of the way between them she said hes dead i heard i cant accept i killed somebody she said edging back to the disbelief of the first few moments with zarpas i cant conceive the crap that the defense lawyer served up either baxeter kept twisting and turning the tiny car around the central part of the city using the ancient difficulttonegotiate streets he said some tried to follow i think ive lost them what the hell did they hope to achieve she demanded wanting to be angry at something positive that youd break down say something that could be expanded into a bigger story said baxeter and ive never encountered a photographer yet whos satisfied with the last picture he took theyll be at the hotel janet realized im afraid so thats the obvious place to wait for you i dont think i could face it janet said she actually did feel physicallyor was it mentallystrange her awareness of everything around one moment definite the next receding almost foggily then becoming definite again do you want to go to a restaurant or a bar good god no janet said at once baxeter turned away from the walled part of the town but janet was unaware and uncaring slumped in the volkswagen with her head forward against her chest playing zarpass reassurances over and over in her mind like a child with a favored pop tune but still unable to avoid the burden of guilt against every reassuring phrase or argument the policeman had provided janet put the contradicting litany of her own ive killed ive killed ive killed were here he said still unconcerned at her surroundings janet let herself be helped from the car and followed him up the outside steps of a twostory flatroofed house not aware until she was inside the room that she was in somebodys home where is this she demanded my flat said baxeter simply im sorry its not very tidy it wasnt it appeared to be a workplace on to which living accommodation had been added as an afterthought by the window was a cluttered desk dominated by a word processor with an umbilical cord between two screens not just one above the desk doityourself shelves held uneven walls of reference books and on a small side table there were three separate telephones between the shelves and the window was a drying line from which strips of undeveloped negatives hung from pegs and immediately below a photographs magnifying stand stood ready to examine the tiny exposures two filing cabinets with gaptoothed drawers delineated the work space from where baxeter lived the living area was surprisingly expansive easily able to accommodate two couches covered with garishlycolored arab blankets as well as easy chairs newspapers and magazines overflowed from a center table onto another brightly patterned arab rug and a television set stood in a corner near a floortoceiling wall cabinet which housed crockery and glasses the bottles were on a central flat shelf seeing her look baxeter said would you like a drink i actually think i need one brandy would be good he poured for both of them heavily and when she took the glass janet saw just how badly her hand was shaking he said there really is space to sit on the couches janet did so and said it seems to be becoming a habit for me to break down in front of you it doesnt cause me any difficulty janet clamped her lips between her teeth determined against any more nonsense waiting until the sensation passed she still didnt risk talking immediately covering the moment by bringing the glass to her mouth so much she said at last theres been so much i know he said softly i thought i could cope was sure i could cope thats one of the upsets i suppose not believing any more that i can janet felt his arm around her pulling her against him and let herself go it was much more comfortable than it had been in the volkswagen the smell of his cologne wasnt really too strong at all in fact it was rather nice an indication of how personally clean he was there was bound to be a reaction he said of course you can cope his hand was soothingly against her face gently rubbing her cheek and up into her hair and janet was aware of herself sighing of letting herself go she said when my husband died i curled up into a ball and never wanted to go out again thats what i feel like now that i want to hide away forever thats what were doing he said hiding away where no one can find us janet felt something else against the side of her head near her hair and could not at once decide what it was then she realized his lips were there kissing her she shifted but not away bringing her legs up beneath her better to lean against him she said thats where i want to be hidden from everyone and everything she brought her head around as she spoke his kiss like everything else about him was gentle and janet responded just as softly so that their mouths remained close together exploring between quietly snatched breaths janet felt his hand upon her and momentarily stiffened but then eased again not wanting to stop him and the buttons parted and the clasps unsnapped he explored with his fingers now and janet didnt object letting her mind stay in that fogged part of reality where she refused to think or to rationalize or to equate just to feel she felt him move again and raise her up with him and walk with his arm around supporting her to the bedroom where she was practically unaware of her clothes coming off it was his mouth as well as his fingers that moved over her now and janet reached out for him sighing with the greatest relaxation of all when he entered her they moved perfectly together unhurriedly and it was ecstasy and she cried out at the moment of bursting excitement clinging to him and knowing his explosion too the pain of physical release brought her shudderingly back to the reality she had briefly refused to confront and janet did stiffen this time hands gripped at her sides making herself think of what shed done betrayed she thought shed betrayedhumiliateda man she loved and whom shed postured and posed and pretended to be trying to rescue it didnt matter that john would never know of the betrayal or the humiliation shed know always carry it with her like a stigma a constant weight a thought began but janet refused it there couldnt be any excuse any escape shed been betrayed and humiliated and battered and frightened but the need for a few moments to hide and forget wasnt an excuse there wasnt even an equation she paraded all the words in her mind mentally shouting the accusation whore and tart and prostitute and slut and they werent bad enough cruel enough to describe what shed done she felt baxeters hand upon hers on the fist she had created and kept it tightly shut refusing too to look sideways at him i am not sorry he said i am it happened it shouldnt have done why not dont be so bloody stupid she said you know why it shouldnt have happened it neednt complicate anything it will wont it you think ill be able to forget it will only become a complication if you let it you think im a whore now youre being bloody stupid he said i knew the situation do you think of me as a whoremonger or a lecher the rejection quietened her no she said i dont think of you like that it hasnt hurt john neednt hurt john how do you think of me she said needing an answer baxeter raised himself on one arm and moved over her so that she was forced to look at him he said i think youre very beautiful and i wanted almost from the first moment to take you to bed and i think you realized what was growing up between us just as much as i did didnt you yes janet agreed in a whisper and didnt want it to stop he pressed determined upon the complete catharsis no she said in further admission but i still love john i didnt ask you to stop expect you to stop it is a complication she insisted angrily its a bloody mess its an adult situation and were adults i dont feel like an adult i feel like an idiot child stop it he warned what are we going to do she asked what do you want to do i dont she began and then stopped yes i do she said i want us to forget about it not forget but put it in the back of our minds like the mistake it was and she trailed off and what i dont know i dont think it was a mistake i knew what i was doing like you did lets not start using words like love not if you dont want me to my father wants me to go back to england in between the court hearings i think thats what ill do the difficulty wont exist if i do that baxeter lowered himself off his arm and lay like janet on his back looking up at the ceiling he said if you dont want to go it wont be necessary for you to make the separation not for a week or so at least i dont understand she said turning to him at last ive got to go away said baxeter i was going to tell you earlier despite the guilt and the resolutions janet felt her stomach dip at the thought of his not being near she said just for a week or so it shouldnt be any longer its just a quick inandout assignment where he was silent for several moments then he said beirut what a situation piece said baxeter itll probably accompany the article ive written about you dont go she blurted dont be silly he said ive got to go be careful darling please be said janet and then stopped realizing the word shed used baxeter smiled back but didnt pick up upon it further to embarrass her im the sort of guy who does his reporting from the bar of the best hotel im serious janet insisted unashamedly she said i dont want to lose anyone else serious himself baxeter said do you want me to find out what i can about john janet held his eyes yes she said please find out what you can about john j anet slept at baxeters flat that night and in the morning they made love again and it was as good as the first time she insisted upon returning alone to the hotel which was still besieged by reporters on baxeters advice janet did not try to avoid them which he argued would merely prolong the pressure but agreed to meet them all at once in a small conference room the hotel made available to them when everyone was seated and the lights were on a cacophony of questions erupted janet held her hands up to stop the babble not bothering to speak until the sound lessened then she said simply that she was unable to answer any questions because she had been legally advised that having come before a court everything was now sub judice until a verdict she was ignored whats your reaction to the defense assertion which would appear to make your story complete fabrication called an american voice from the rear the truth will come out during the court hearing refused janet doggedly i hope she thought mrs stone has this whole episode been an exercise to achieve personal publicity an english voice this time a man in the front balding and bespectacled the demand unsettled and to an extent bewildered janet until nowparticularly in beirutshe had been treated sympathetically by the media but she recognized that the attitude had shifted now it was suspicion actual hostile suspicion from the time of my fiances abduction i have cooperated with the press for only one reason to maintain public interest in his plight she retorted angrily that anger was primarily at the assembled journalists but there was a subsidiary reason for her flushed face when she got to the word fiance her mind had filled with what had happened during the previous twentyfour hours between herself and baxeter and shed almost stumbled to an awkward halt do you intend staying in cyprus throughout all the hearings right up to a higher court if the case is committed there asked a woman dear god i wish i knew what i was going to do about anything janet thought she said i have not yet decided upon that it depends how long it takes you didnt come back to the hotel last night mrs stone it was the balding englishman in front again no said janet and stopped she could physically feel the flush firing through her cheeks where were you mrs stone a woman somewhere in the middle of the pack i groped janet but another voice talked over her and she saw partington walking down the side of the group to where she was sitting partington british embassy said the diplomat as mrs stone has already made clear there was the need for extensive legal discussion after the initial hearing those discussions lasted late into the evening and it was decided by the embassy that she needed some uninterrupted time to rest he bent cupping janets arm but went on talking its also been made clear that there is no further comment mrs stone can make until the conclusion of the legal processes here on the island so you will have to excuse her there was a surge of protest partington ignored it janet relieved let herself be guided from her chair and out of the room baxeter was standing right at the back near the door he gave no facial reaction and neither did she id better escort you to your room suggested the diplomat please accepted janet they remained unspeaking in the elevator in her room janet said why did you do that down there say what you did from where i was sitting you looked like someone who needed rescuing what about from where everyone else was sitting maybe said partington unhelpfully why were you there at all same reason why i was in court yesterday said partington london still considers you a british national irrespective of your american marriage and particularly because of the high profile youve achieved i was holding a watching brief if you like and to decide for myself whether you need help despite what you told me janet experienced a jolt of embarrassment at the reminder after what the man had just done she said thank you and decided it was inadequate so do you pressed the man yes but not the sort you could give janet thought she said im all right partington remained looking at her waiting and janet guessed he was expecting her to tell him where shed been the previous evening she stared back saying nothing the man said please no more escapades janet realized that the man believed she had been attempting something else involving john sheridan she said dont worry i wont do anything silly and thought at once it was a ridiculous statement i spoke to zarpas partington said what about your going back to england during the hearings he said that after youd given your evidence you wouldnt be required until any higher court hearing the gap could be several months that was thoughful of you said janet think about it urged the embassy official she had to janet acknowledged after partington had gone but not yet not until she didnt know until or when or how but she certainly didnt want to make any decisions yet she looked at her watch and then the telephone impatient for baxeter to make contact they hadnt talked about when they would see each other again janet was shocked at her sudden doubt trying to rationalize it he didnt need anything more for whatever he was writing no further reason then professionally and he hadnt acknowledged her downstairs when shed left the press conference shed thought at the time that he was being discreet disguising any association between them but recognized there could be other reasons what if he hadnt meant what he said that it had all been a comeon to achieve a one night stand wasnt that what harriet and her washington group did all the time mouth the expected words and pleasantries to get each other into bed and have to strain the following morning to remember each others names it would actually be better that way easier to lock it away in her mindlock it away and never ever turn the opening keyif they didnt see each other again it wasnt so difficult alone in her hotel room and fully dressed and out of bed to make the resolve that was definitely what she had to do she had the telephone shrilled and janet snatched it up on the second ring how are you he asked i hoped it would be you said janet all right i guess im downstairs what took you so long to call reasons he said enigmatically theres a lot of guys still hanging around photographers too what the hell for in the trade its known as doorstepping he said it literally means what it says youre a running international story so theyve got to stay on your doorstep to be ready if anything develops i want to see you ill come up be ready to let me in the moment i knock she was and immediately he thrust through the door janet put her arms out to be held and he brought her close to him soothing his hand through her hair curious at her obvious need i thought you said you were all right they attacked me at the conference protested janet why did they do that it hasnt happened before only one or two baxeter said the majority are still on your side why the change at all stories like yours stories that keep going over a long period of time develop a kind of cycle baxeter tried to explain a person is built up into a heroor in your case heroineand for a long time everything goes their way then at the slightest whiff of doubt some change having created their pedestal they start trying to knock it down and their hero with it thats stupid thats the way it is baxeter smiled but its nothing for you to worry about like i said its only one or two itll all be ok after the full hearing zarpas virtually told me its my word against theirs he cant find haseeb and the people at the cafe say they dont know anything about it pointed out janet the evidence will be found promised baxeter you were a long time calling janet said again i had something else to do after your conference janet had become to feel warm protected once more in his presence but it was washed chillingly away by the tone of his voice what she said my visas come through when are you going asked janet heavily tomorrow i dont want you to go weve been through that he reminded her weve been through it all if theyre watching downstairs i cant stay away from here again tonight and i cant stay all night here either they abandoned themselves to an afternoon of absolute love unthinking uncaring unaware of anyone or anything but themselves and the cocoon of janets room four times the telephone rang without her answering and once they held each other laughing silently as they tried to pick out a muffled conversation outside the repeatedly knockedupon door minutes after the knocking ceased a note was pushed beneath the door but neither was sufficiently interested to get out of bed to see what it said the encroaching blackness of evening the time he had to leave her darkened their mood and they were exhausted anyway by the lovemaking which had left them damp and physically aching can i say something asked baxeter what sort of question is that to ask me its been wonderful said the man but for one thing what she said guessing that she knew it was the same with both of us the frenzy it was like we were desperate that it would never happen again dont theres no point it will i said dont last night you asked me not to say something else he remembered that i couldnt tell you i loved you which i do come back said janet please come back i will he said i know i will how can you know i just know two hours earlier there would have been hilarity in the cautious way they checked the corridor before baxeter left but now there wasnt he did it mechanically ducking back once because of a passing guest and was then gone without any farewell janet stood directly inside the door head pressed against the wood and it was several moments before she moved away the room was completely dark but she didnt bother to switch on a light didnt bother to do anything she just climbed back inside the wrecked bed and begged for sleep to come to blot out everything which surprisingly it did very quickly she was conscious of stirring twice during the night but it was not abrupt wakefulness and she drifted off again it was brightly light by the time she fully awoke beside the bed the message light on her telephone was blinking redly and she remembered the pushedunderthedoor message she retrieved that first smiling down at the request from germanys der spiegel for an exclusive indepth interview there were four telephone messages being held for her by the switchboard all were from newspapers all seeking the same she decided to reply to none of them she escaped by going down the fire stairs to her hire car which had not been identified and drove into nicosia for a breakfast which she needed not having eaten at all the previous day afterwards she lingered over coffee not knowing what to do next alone again she acknowledged without any positive intention janet drove towards troodos retracing the route along which she had gone with baxeter it had been she admitted to herself that day when shed realizedalthough refusing to realize it at the timethat she loved him no not love it hadnt been that quick that positive that she was attracted to him and that there was a possible danger she corrected sensible people who recognized danger avoided it so why hadnt she janet didnt have logical easy answers to the logical easy questions everything was mixed up not confused but differing factors interlocking to make some sort of although not entirely satisfactory explanation she had been alone and fed up with being alone frightened and in need of someone vulnerable and baxeter had been kind and understanding janet stopped the mental examination curious why did she think of john as john and baxeter as baxeter subconsciously she supposed she was trying to separate them accord one greater intimacy and greater love than the other was it possible to love two men at the same time it was an uncertainty janet had never before had to consider there had been a passing affair at university before shed met hank but once theyd established their relationship it had been enough for her thered been approaches of course in england and later in washington approaches almost every time they had attended one of harriets parties she and hank had laughed about it absolutely sure of each other neither feeling threatened was john threatened by what had occurred between herself and baxeter the automatic mental division she recognized again and there was a division groping for a way to rationalize it to herself janet thought that it was practically as if she were thinking of herself as two women one in love with john sheridan the other in love with david baxeter hardly rational positively irrational nevertheless it was how it settled in her mind she accepted it was still not a resolve not even a proper explanation little more than a weak attempt at easing her conscience sufficient though for the moment thats all she really wanted to do go from moment to moment hour to hour unwilling to make plans for the next day or the day after that because there was nothing sure enough to make plans about wasnt that just another attempt to avoid the most difficult question of all the one she had adamantly refused even to bring to mind she did so now making herself consider it whom would she choose if it came to the choice janet was sitting on the tavern verandah from which baxeter had photographed her looking out over the thickly wooded valley she shook her head refusing to answer moment to moment hour to hour she thought she drove aimlessly and slowly back to nicosia regretting the trip because it had not been the same without baxeter and shed become further depressed by her failed attempts at personal honesty she was surprised by the amount of mail awaiting her back at the hotel there were three more written requests for interviews from journalists and in addition two airmailed letters both postmarked from the united states the first she opened was from the talk show agency in atlanta increasing from to their offer for a countrywide tour for afterdinner or lunch talks the second was from a new york publishing house proposing a advance for a book which they had tentatively entitled the love of janet stone if she cabled her acceptance they would fly an executive to cyprus to finalize the details and discuss whether she felt able to complete a manuscript herself or would like to work with a ghost writer janets vision blurred at the suggested title she threw everything angrily into the wastebasket and stood at the window gazing out over the city and its sunbleached duncolored outskirts arms rigid by her side both hands clenched into fists fuck it she thought not even sure at what or at whom she was swearing fuck it fuck it fuck it the following day zarpas called there was no necessity for her to attend the next remand hearing unless she wanted to because it would be even more of a formality than the initial appearance there was a followup call from the new york publisher which she refused to accept she let another twentyfour hours pass before calling england her mother as always answered the telephone and announced at once that she had very bad news what demanded janet george is dead i am so sorry my darling george janet could not think what her mother was talking about your cat harriet telephoned last night it struck janet as bizarre and she snickered oh was all she could manage i knew youd be upset said her mother janet realized her instant reaction would have sounded like a sob she said quite a lot has actually happened since i was last with george mother and ive kind of been expecting it still a shock could people think of animals dying as a shock janet guessed she would have known thatfelt more than she was feeling at the moment at leastif shed never met john sheridan and never done what she was doing now but remained in the rosslyn apartment with george she said thank harriet for me will you say ill settle the vets bills when i get back she wanted to know that the older woman said when youre getting back that is janet sighed not responding should i speak to daddy he wants to speak to you he must have been standing next to her because he came on the telephone at once there was a lot of publicity about that remand hearing i didnt bother to read any of it said janet who hadnt no definite date for a full hearing not yet you could come home in between times couldnt you so partington and her father were still in close contact wearily janet said i havent decided yet and dont want to decide she thought there was desultory talk about the cat which janet found utterly inconsequential and an attempt to bring the conversation back to her return which janet ignored he told her as always to call again soon and janet as always promised that she would gratefully replacing the telephone and deciding upon at least a weeks interval poor george she thought trying but still failing to feel more had she changed so completely about everything and everybody she didnt want that to happen not to become so hardened that nothing mattered or moved her any more shed known women like thatshe supposed harriet was close to being oneand thought it was ugly she started going back to the pool again and on the second morning realized from a faraway bustle that she was being photographed by cameramen using long focus lenses her immediate reaction was to feel indecent and she moved to cover herself in a wrap but then she stopped lying back on the lounger so what she thought what the hell did a picture of her in a swimsuit matter if it made them think they were doing their jobmade them think it was importantit was all right by her it was ten days after baxeters departure in the late afternoon when she was returning sunthrobbing and still oiled from the pool the room key slippery in her hands that she heard the room telephone ringing the key slipped further and she almost dropped it running anxiously into the room when the door finally opened im back he announced janet closed her eyes swaying thank god she said oh thank god you ok yes she said feeling strangely breathless where are you my apartment the pack still there some could you get here of course an hour make it thirty minutes janet showered and changed and didnt bother to dry her hair so eager was she to get to him she used the fire escape stairs again and was sure she reached the hire car unobserved she was still cautious driving not straight to baxeters home but into nicosia parking the car near the paphos gate where she had been cheated of baxeters money she entered the walls through the paphos gate twisting at once through the narrow alleys of the oldest part of the city constantly looking behind in an effort to detect anyone following she couldnt see anyone certain not an obvious camerahung photographer she emerged from the citadel at eleftheria square where there was a taxi rank and rode away staring through the rear window again there was no indication of pursuit baxeter snatched at her without speaking and janet didnt need any words either they made love hurriedly hungrily and it was much too quick but the second time was slower and better ive missed you so much said baxeter ive missed you too youre going to hate me he announced abruptly she pulled away staring curiously at him hate you for cheating you making love like this without telling you first telling me what her stomach dipped instead of replying baxeter reached sideways for an envelope taking out a photograph john sheridan looked older and grayer than in any previous prints sagged against a wall he was being made to hold up a copy of the new york times to show the date just a week earlier do you hate me said baxeter beside her no said janet i dont hate you j anet became aware that she was upright naked with her legs splayed for support and sitting directly in front of him despite their having made love every way that love could be made and the fact that there was no secret about either of their bodies that the other had not explored and discovered and delighted in exploring and discovering she snatchedimmediately regretting the hasteat the crumpled top sheet to pull it up over herself i thought that was how it might be he said and janet regretted the haste even more hes alive she said it was not until now this precise moment that janet had opened another locked and sealed compartment that most secret part of her mind in which shed believed john to be dead now abruptly unexpectedly incredibly she had proofthat he wasnt dead that he definitely hadnt been dead as of just one week ago and janet knewjust knewthat if he werent killed by now he wouldnt be that somehow somewhere she would be reunited with him the awarenesses rushed in upon her a tidal wave and janet was swamped by it tumbled headoverheels upon a bruising scratching mental shore for a long time she just sat the creased sheet like a toga held with increasing tightness before her gazing at the stained bed upon which she had just made passionate and uninhibited love to one man while she thought about another alive she said again emptyvoiced there isnt any doubt confirmed baxeter i want to say i want to say stumbled janet looking down at herself and then across at his nakedness i want to say thank you but thats bloody ridiculous isnt it yes baxeter agreed bloody ridiculous you know whats even more ridiculous she said it makes me love you even more baxeter shook his head becoming aware of his own nakedness and pulling part of janets sheet over himself i dont know what to say to that no janet made a sound halfway between a sad choke and an excited laugh i dont either im glad said the man however it affects you and me im glad there was a gulped pause no i dont mean that at all im glad hes alive certainly i mind very much how it affects you and me very much i dont know how it affects you and me admitted janet with matching honesty i want to tell you something said baxeter even if it resolves the uncertainty about what happens between you and me i want to tell you something there was another hesitation i thought he was dead i did too said janet quietly he stared at her twistedfaced but then why i thought it but i wouldnt accept it said janet and i was right wasnt i so whats the answer asked baxeter answer about you and me darling implored janet how can i tell you that i secretly thought that a man i was engaged to marry was dead you give me confirmation that hes not and within minutes want me to make decisions like that would it be an easier decision weeks or months or years from now she asked herself im sorry he said at once it was something i shouldnt have asked how did you get the photograph demanded janet luck really baxeter shrugged the simplest luck in beirut we have a stringersomeone who works for us on a freelance basisnaturally ive been plaguing him with demands about hostages ever since the kidnappings began in the lebanon years ago hes a shia when i told him about the piece i had just done here on you he said he knew where sheridan was and i challenged him to prove it baxeter jerked his head towards the photograph still clutched in janets hand and he did the man finished simply what are you going to do with it asked janet nothing said baxeter more simply still not yet at least i made you a promise about printing nothing that would endanger johns life i meant it janet swallowed and looked away hoping he had not seen her reaction i think youre wonderful she said absolutely wonderful no im not he said almost too loudly so what are we going to do with it you baxeter said i brought the proof back for you youve got to decide what to do with it janet shook her head i need you she said you know i need you how much i need you you tell me what to do i dont want to try anything else by myself do anything else by myself im too tired too beaten tell the americans advised baxeter simply again janet blinked at him after everything thats happened they wont even let me through the embassy door they will disputed baxeter he indicated the photograph look at it he instructed thats only a week old eight days no one has seen any proof whether or not john sheridan is alive or dead for months this is proof they wont dismiss you this time they cant im not sure said janet still doubtful its got to be the americans argued baxeter with irrefutable logic john sheridan is an american citizen an operative of the central intelligence agency who else has the resourcesthe abilityto do anything but the american government janet gazed at her lover not speaking for several moments then she said i want to say something but i dont want to hurt you ok ok he agreed the americansthe ciahave had this sort of stuff before janet picked up and then dropped the photograph hes still somewhere there in captivity i want a guarantee that this time theyll do something blackmail them then said baxeter it seemed to be a day of simplistic answers thought janet she said blackmail them youre the media manipulator right tell whoever you see at the embassy here whats his name hart supplied janet al hart tell al hart that unless youre sureunless you know that theyre going to do something youre going to have copies of this photographcopies that youll make before you hand this original overmade available to all the press hanging around the hotel and that youll give a press conference complaining that washington are doing nothing yet again all right acknowledged janet still doubtful but what can they do just from a photograph she picked it up it doesnt show where he is give any sort of clue how he could be got out does it itll prove youre someone to be believed taken proper notice of said baxeter so so they will have to do something when you provide an actual address an address in her excitement janet came forward and the sheet fell away but she didnt bother to pick it up again you have an address no baxeter said just the promise of one but the promise is from the same source and i think its reliable theyre going to ask me about a source arent they yes said baxeter so what do i say nothing advised the man refuse to say where anything comes from as a further guarantee of their cooperation arent you taking a risk pressed janet what risk baxeter smiled back if i were asked about it i would deny everything do you really think your man can find an address he found the photograph you really are started janet but baxeter talked her down no dont say it theres no need this hasnt made anything easier more difficult in fact i know i want to stay with you tonight said janet but i dont i know that too he stopped her again i love you she said i love you too j anet hesitated outside the american embassy at the corner of therissos street caught by the irony that it was one of the feed roads on the way to larnaca where so much had happened and where theyd all laughed at her the bastards whod tricked her and the bastards who were supposed to help her they couldnt laugh any more she had what shed come to cyprus to get and like baxeter said they had to take her seriously from now on and by christ she was determined they were going to take her seriously the embassy was quite heavily fortified and janet had to prove her identity at a guard house before being allowed to approach the main building by the time she reached it her arrival had been telephoned through she asked for al hart the receptionist asked if she had an appointment and janet replied that shed telephoned to say she was coming which she had hart had refused to take her call there was a muffled conversation and the woman smiled embarrassed im sorry she said mr hart isnt available janet took the beirut photograph from her handbag holding it out and displaying it to the woman tell hart that im showing you a photograph of john sheridan taken a week ago and tell him to get his ass out here hart was in the vestibule in three minutes face blazing eyes bulged with anger what the hells going on he demanded at once i want to talk said janet politely and sensibly i want to talk the mans effort at control was discernible wheres the photograph he demanded wheres your office said janet it hadnt occurred to her to gloat and she was not really gloating now but there was a satisfaction in being in controlin being the teller not the toldafter all the bullshit that had been dumped upon her hart hesitated and then turned on his heel leading her deeper into the embassy the cia section was at the rear and to reach it they had to pass through a ceilingtofloor barred door like the sort janet remembered from movies about prisons there was a marine on guard outside and hart had to authorize janets entry in an official signed log his office was a bare box of a place very similar to that of george knox the cia man in beirut a standard design thought janet the picture hart demanded i think we should set out some ground rules first said janet so ok you dont like me you think im a pain i dont like you i think youre a jerk but ive got proof that john is still alive proof you none of you could get theres a possibility of my being able to get more so weve got to work together be together whether you like it or not so lets at least be civil ok hart sat looking at her across his clean desk a vein in his forehead throbbing in time to his annoyance with difficulty he said im sorry i didnt mean to be rude on the apology scale of ten janet scored that at about two but decided that it was a concession without speaking she dug into her handbag again and offered the photograph across the desk hart snatched it for a long time he stared down and when he looked back to her all the dismissive aggression had gone jesus he said jesus h christ so im sorry said hart sincerely this time i really am sorry that wasnt what i meant said janet hes alive isnt he johns alive and so she thought was david baxeter hart was back over the photograph moving it flatly against the light he said it looks ok what do you mean its possible to fake photographs superimpose things like a newspaper with a date on it over a picture taken earlier said hart janet felt a plunge of despair but the picture itself she argued that picture hasnt been released has it no agreed hart like i said it looks ok it can be checked by experts will be checked its genuine janet insisted needing the assurance im prepared to go with it right away said hart smiling for the first time the expression was sincere like the second apology janet decided youll tell washington of course ill tell washington beirut too said hart he rubbed his hands together as if he were warming them and went on briskly ok so where did you get it where do we go from here no janet shook her head harts smile faltered what do you mean no its my source it stays that way hart leaned across the desk hands together now as if he were praying ms stone he said controlled dont you think youve been involved in enough screwups already yes concurred janet at once far too many screwups and im not going to get involved in any more neither am i going to be shunted aside as ive been shunted aside almost always since this thing began i want guarantees and i want to remain the conduit to ensure that theyre being kept the vein in harts forehead began to dance again what sort of guarantees ms stone named courtesy every time now janet noticed instead of directly replying janet said what if i could get a location to go with the photograph maybe even an address hart stared at her for a long time then he said you think you could get something like that maybe hedged janet what if i could if i could tell you a street where john sheridan is being held will yousome american group or force or whatevergo in to get him out hart nodded understanding the demand he said i cant answer that not right now i dont expect you to answer it right now said janet what about after youve been in contact with washington maybe not then either i need to know janet said i told you i wont be shunted aside any more hart looked down again at the photograph and said this isnt the only copy is it ms stone no said janet ive quite a lot more so its an ultimatum a request corrected janet you know its johns life youre risking if you release this ive had this conversation so many times i can recite it backwards said janet im not risking johns life im trying to save his life by getting some fucking action quite a lot about this conversation is familiar isnt it said hart unmoved by the outburst you sure of your source ms stone janet indicated the picture it produced that didnt it and promises an address mused hart i know what willsher told you in washington about all the professional efforts that weve made the cooperation weve had from other countries other agencies to come up with nil and now youve got a picture taken a week ago and expect more yes said janet thats impressive said hart the lone amateur showing all the professionals how to do it does it matter if it gets john out i dont know ms stone i really dont know i cant see any direction in this conversation said janet uneasily at the risk of further repetition said the american you will be careful wont you ive learned the hard way how to be assured janet thats why im trying to establish more ground rules so ill play to your game plan accepted hart no he wouldnt janet recognized at once he was just stringing her along until he thought he had everything and then hed dump her she said how long before youll get a playback from washington your rules reminded hart how long before you get something more i dont know admitted janet why dont i wait for you to make contact when youve got something already being pushed aside judged janet patronized too no she said why dont you make contact when you hear from washington the american capitulated youre calling the shots driving away from the embassy janet tried to analyze the encounter good enough she supposed certainly the official door had been opened to her but for their advantage not hers but then objectively what else could she expect their jobthe cias job anywaywas collecting information not imparting it it was unrealistic for her to expect anything like complete admission complete access to whatever they might do at very best all she could expect was to be allowed on the sidelines where she wouldnt get in the way janet and baxeter had arranged to meet at the tembelodendron and as she entered the restaurant janet wished they had chosen somewhere else because it was where she and baxeter had lunched the first day they met and she was unhappy at it becoming a romantic shrine the way the virginia inn had become the place for her and john why she demanded of herself didnt baxeter when would she think of him in given name terms deserve some sort of special romantic place as well janet became impatient with the constant internal argument it was arrogantconceited eventhis perpetual effort to maintain a balancing act and what a balancing act she could think rationally and behave rationally and make all sorts of sensible rational decisionsfor christs sake she was an aloof academic wasnt shebut the bottom line came down to choice and she knew she couldnt choose wasnt able to choose baxeter rose to meet her he held out his hand and she took it he said guess how much i missed you and she said i dont need to be told because i missed you that much too if i read this in a book or saw it in a movie i wouldnt believe it he said you know what i feel when i dont know where you are what youre doing i feel lost lost like one of those poor bastards will be in space one day when the survival cord linking them to their spacecraft snaps and they float away into the blackness janet sat down and said have you been drinking yes baxeter admitted but it doesnt affectdoesnt minimizewhat ive just said thats how i feel thats funny said janet no not funny wrong word whats the right word yours janet said lost you wouldnt believe how long ive felt lost been lost a waiter intruded into their impenetrably private world and they ordered without thought or consideration wanting only to get rid of the man as the waiter left baxeter said it wasnt meant to be like this i dont understand said janet no agreed baxeter obtusely you have been drinking i told you that already but why lost he said lost and lonely like you i dont want any wine janet announced positively nothing to drink is that how it would be i dont understand that either if we were married would you nag me like this decide when and when not i should drink stop it said janet irritated just asking youre ratfaced she accused pissed out of your mind the transformation was startling baxeter seemed to expand and grow in front of her very eyes like a balloon being filled for flight he straightened in his chair adding to the impression and jaggedly but no longer with any slur in his voice said relaxing just for a moment thinking sorry so what happened the question coincided with the arrival of their lamb and the waiter asked about drinks and looking directly at janet baxeter said nothing thank you was that refusal difficult demanded janet yes said baxeter very why i asked what happened reminded baxeter ignoring her question answer me first tell me what happened it was belligerencepersistencebut not drinkinspired janet decided she remained offbalanced inexplicably and uncomfortably feeling herself to be with a man whom she no longer knew which was disorienting and nonsensical she sloughed away the impression and tried to clear her mind by recounting in as much detail as possible the encounter with the cyprus cia officerincharge throughout baxeter listened utterly intent hardly bothering with the delivered meal when she finished he said hostile just short of so theyll take everything for nothing said janet getting john out wont be for nothing halted baxeter janet dipped her head accepting the correction any promised cooperation will be minimal she qualified theyll use me baxeter did not react stabbing at his food without eating it yes he said detached hart said something odd janet announced what he asked me if i trusted my source janet said reminded me of the cooperation that the americans had had from friendly countries friendly agencies and remarked how surprising it was that an amateur could do better told me to be careful she spoke looking fully at him and baxeter looked directly back he said i told you how it happened i know word for word what you told me said janet she stopped and then said youre not using me are you not using me like all the rest did any of the rest produce the evidence of john being alive came back baxeter thats not an answer to my question you know the answer to your own question said baxeter loudly i am using you i am using you ultimately to get an exclusive story that no one else has a chance of getting baxeter paused raising his hands between them which is quite differentquite separate and apartfrom what else has happened between us im not using you that way certainly my loveour loveis boxed compartmented from anything else uninvolved janet felt a glow at the assurance somewhat convoluted though it was i wasnt really doubting you she said then why did you question me persisted the man what else could i be than what i am janet wished the insistence were not quite so fervent she said were arguing were arguing about nothing baxeter appeared to deflate the balloon going down much more quietly he said do you think hart will stay with his promise to keep you in touch definitely at this stage janet said at once they want an address dont they she allowed the time for him to speak and when he didnt she demanded so what are the chances of getting that address there was an uncertain shoulder movement maybe there isnt any possibility janet realized abruptly that so completely had she begun to rely upon baxeter that shed never doubted he would come up with a location the idea that he might not be able to shocked her in further disorientation but you said just a promise stopped baxeter would it mean your going back to beirut yes oh shit how else could i get it i dont know i hadnt thought everything was becoming frayed again fragmented it was like a smoke cloud a mass with an apparent shape and form that was impossible to reach out and touch pushing herself on janet said so how do you know when to go back you want me to go back yes no that doesnt make sense it makes every sense he saidthe shiathat he knew the man who took the picture that from him he could learn the location of the house said baxeter all he had to do was to find him and ask that sounds simple a conversation of minutes yes agreed the man thats how it sounds i dont think its quite as easy as that will you go back there was a long silence between them yes he said ill go back there was another shorter silence then baxeter said does that mean ive lost out its too soon for a question like that why because it is replied janet in childlike repartee i want to know he persisted no janet said desperately how could you have lost out after whats happened so where does that leave john janet had not eaten her meal either she pushed it aside reaching across the table for his hand kneading his fingers stop it she demanded stop trying to get inside my head cant you understand ive been thinking abouttorn apart aboutnothing else and im not helping no janet said youre not helping at all how was it left at the embassy asked baxeter changing direction to defuse the tension that hart would call me as soon as he heard something back from washington youll never know of course whether hes telling he truth whatever he says and however he says it i accept that janet said where does it say ive got to believe him youre becoming cynical dont become cynical youre becoming protective thats what i want to be dont press not at this time dont press ok he accepted your speed your decision i dont need reminding the returning waiter asked if there were anything wrong with the meal and baxeter apologized that they were not hungry and without any discussion between them they went back to his apartment where for the first time their lovemaking wasnt good they coupled and came but there was a tension between them a block janet waited for baxeter to refer to it but he didnt so neither did she telling herself she was imagining it its a multientry visa announced baxeter beside her so you could go back any time yes this shia is he a member of one of the groups connections obviously what if its a trap that theyre setting you up to be snatched there are journalists in captivity baxeter considered the question they could have snatched me receiving the photograph there wasnt any need to wait until i came back a second time dont go insisted janet youve got a photograph and weve given it to the americans and thats enough let them take over from here but that means john he started i know what it means broke in janet sharply she sensed rather than saw him shake his head baxeter said the americans wont moveif theyll move at alljust on a picture theyve had pictures before janet turned away from him pushing her face into the pillow not wanting him to see her cry trapped she thought desperately she always felt trapped his hand was on her shoulders gently massaging his fingers soothing up into her hairline its all right he said ill be all right no she said muffled yes he said with determination baxeter asked her to stay the night but janet suggested there might be a call from the embassy which was only part of the reason for her refusal she still felt the barrier between them that shed known when they made love and decided she needed to get away for it to disappear as it had to disappear she regretted leaving as soon as she reached the hotel sure she was imagining the barrier but willed herself against telephoning to say she was coming back she rang the following morning intending to apologize but there was no reply she waited until midafternoon for him to call her and when he didnt she dialed his number again there was still no reply she started calling every half hour and then reduced it to the quarter hour and at six drove back to his flat it was locked and the window shutters were closed and bolted janet returned angrily to the hotel hed told her he was going of course but there should have been some talk between them before he left some time together just taking off without any contact was janets thoughts filtered seeking the word the only one she could think of was inconsiderate which was ridiculous he was going to beirut for her to help her locate a fiance so what could be more considerate more selfless than that whatever he should still have said goodbye it made it appear as if he didnt care and she knew that wasnt true hart did not telephone but came personally to the hotel the following day and janet felt embarrassed at his finding her predictably by the pool the american seemed more subdued than usual although there was no hostility when she asked eagerly if there had been any developments he said they couldnt talk where they were and she agreed at once to accompany him to the embassy it was a chauffeur driven car with darkened rear windows and a division between the driver and the rearseat passengers but the cia officer still refused to divulge anything until they reached the us compound they went again to the rear of the building through the barred gate but into a larger pinepaneled and pinefurnished office janet came to an abrupt stop in the doorway so that hart almost collided into her robert willsher rose first to greet her immediately followed by george knox the other cia man shed met in beirut both men were smiling knox more broadly than the washington official good to see you again ms stone said willsher is it said janet cautiously why not come on in so we can talk invited the man janet continued on going to the chair that knox was holding out courteously for her as she went to sit he winked at her from the way the men arranged themselves at the table all facing her it was obvious that willsher was the senior officer looks like weve got a chink of light here began willsher i hope so said janet willsher nodded sideways to the cyprusbased agent and said al submitted a full report of your meeting ive got to tell you it caused quite a flap at langley im glad theres some reaction at last willsher appeared not to notice the sarcasm if he had he was unoffended by it he said you must understand that what i am going to tell you is in the strictest confidence if you had not kept so positively to the agreement we made in washington i wouldnt be telling you at all theres been a policy decision taken at the highest level that photograph is absolutely genuine if we can get a location for john itll be the first time in all the kidnappings that weve something positive to act upon and were going to do just that if we can get a location for john were authorized to go in and get him for a moment the three men blurred before her and the room spun hoping they would not notice janet actually gripped the edge of her chair physically holding on thank you she managed thank you so much which is why we must have access to your source completed the man it was like being doused in cold reviving water no said janet as adamantly as willsher had spoken ms stone said willsher levelvoiced this is foolish were planning an incursion into another country ok so its a pretty screwedup country but by international law its still sovereign territory if we do it theres going to be hell to pay thats been allowed for to stop being shoved around by any bunch of bums who think they can take a pop at us washingtonthe presidentis prepared to take whatever flak is thrown afterwards at any international forum but weve got to get it right if we lose too many men the man stopped awkwardly and ive got to say it if we lose john in the attempt then its all going to blow right up in our faces you understand what im saying yes said janet i understand what youre saying weve got to plan to get as much detail as we can rehearse if possible in some sort of mockup outside of washington weve a training facility at fort pearce we can have a street recreation ready there in twentyfour hours and weve got men standing by to build it this has got to go as clean as the israeli rescue did in entebbe so we must have access to your source no said janet again willsher was right of course by telling her of the rescue operation being considered theyd met her demand for actionthe reason shed put forward before for refusingso to go on refusing was foolish but her possible access to the knowledgethrough baxeterof where john might be was her only bargaining strength so she wouldnt surrender it wouldnt be cut out and discarded yet again janet pleaded knox familiarly youve got to it wont work improvised janet i asked after bringing the photograph here after talking to hart they said no that they wont cooperate directly with you theyll only pass the information through me the three men stared at her the skepticism obvious they isolated hart more than one person then yes floundered janet why wont they trade direct pressed hart i wasnt told not openly there was some talk about not trusting you you think its a group with which weve worked before said willsher janet thought she was sweating and that it would be noticeable to them i dont know what to think she avoided like i said i wasnt told directly its an inference what nationality said knox they speak arabic janet tried to sidestep syrian arabic lebanese arabic what arabic insisted the beirut officer she was out of her depth janet decided out of her depth and sinking without any means of support syrian arabic she said whats the deal demanded willsher what are they getting out of it thinking desperately janet realized the americans would probably have access to her account through zarpas money she said ive agreed to pay but since being conned like i was before ive said i wont pay anything until after johns got out she thought it had sounded all right she wished she were able to tell more from the expression on their faces and theyve gone for that asked hart doubtfully they gave me the photograph didnt they how can you contact them i cant said janet vaguely aware of firmer ground underfoot theyve got to contact me no planned dates then no planned dates i dont like this said willsher i dont like this at all i dont like it either said janet aware they were the first honest words she had uttered for a long time this is the way they insist it has to be you think youll get a location said knox ive no way of knowing honest again she thought gratefully so we just sit and wait said willsher and hope janet said you think some sort of personal protection might be a good idea hart suggested no janet said too quickly frightened of what surveillance might disclosebaxeter im sure they wont come near me if they see any sort of official escort lets not take the risk of blowing it willsher said you will tell us knox said you wont try anything like before try to do something yourself i brought the photograph here reminded janet if i had intended doing anything myself i would not have done that would i i recognize well enough that youre the only people with a chance of getting john out just dont forget it willsher cautioned this is big league stuff now the biggest lets keep in daily contact hart suggested just to keep the lines open of course janet agreed and dont forget what i said before will you ms stone hart said be very careful despite the apparent assurance janet expected them to attempt some sort of surveillance and over the following days she tried to detect it she actually set her idea of traps staying entire days in the hotel and around the pool alert for obvious attention and at other times going for long drives through the greek parts of the island where there were tourist spots and lingering at them intent for a familiar face following her not once did she detect anything she maintained the daily contact and once accepted willshers invitation to dinner which was an appalling mistake the washington officer resumed the embassy interrogation and janet sweated and lied again sure by the end of the evening that willsher knew she was lying it was a fortnight before baxeter returned so resigned had janet become to his absence that she did not expect the call to be from him when she lifted the receiver as soon as she recognized his voice she erupted in a babble of questions and he had to shout her down to be able to speak himself ive got something he announced simply janet swallowed unable to respond or think clearlyproperlyhow she should have thought her immediate impression was that the moment of decision was drawing inexorably nearer like a noose tightening she said ill come to the flat she used the same avoidance technique as shed tried before driving openly to the communication complex and even more openly parking the car then hurrying into the walled section of nicosia to come out again by the rank on eleftheria square like before she drove away straining through the rear window there was no indication of pursuit they thrust into each others arms neither speaking for a long time then janet said i dont ever want you to go away again and baxeter said i wont they separated at last and janet said youve got an address baxeter nodded and said its in the kantari district genuine he shrugged who knows until someone goes there someone is going there disclosed janet she told him everything about the encounter at the american embassy and the assurances from willsher and howand whyshed refused to disclose baxeters identity to the americans throughout baxeter sat nodding not looking directly at her but slightly to one side deep in concentration and they agreed to it he demanded as soon as she finished youre still the conduit yes baxeter nodded in further contemplation and said and they must continue to do so janet thought the tone of his voice was strange why baxeter blinked out of his reverie the address could change he said you must tell them that let them rehearse the kantari rescue but make them understand they cant exclude you because john might be shifted at the last moment janet stared curiously at him aware of that sensation of a barrier arising between them again she said and you would know if there were a last minute change i have a promise he said abruptly janet recalled harts remark that day at the us embassy when she produced the photograph of john in captivity the lone amateur showing all the professionals how to do it she remembered the words echoing in her head very quietly she said david what do you do really do you know what i do tell me she insisted im genuinely employed by a vancouver magazine he insisted but thats not all is it baxeter stared back at her for several moments then he said no thats not all j anet felt nakedlike she had been literally spreadeagled naked at that earlier revelationalthough now she was wearing clothes and this time the exposure was worse far worse not just clothes stripped off skin too a moment of flagellation she sat scooped up in a leatherbacked bucket chair her arms encompassing her legs her head virtually against her knees like a mollusk ready at a moments notice to retreat into its shell never to come out again she did not catch every word he said every sentence even it wasnt necessary the mentally chafing partsthe lumpinthestomach uncertaintieswere finally fitting into the jigsaw an incomplete outline was becoming a more tangible image the mossad yes said baxeter an unfettered admission why does israeli intelligence want to become involved policy from on high said baxeter almost a paraphrase of willsher janet supposed there were a restricted number of ways an idea could be expessed without repetition or cliche she said i want to know everything what your approach that first day journalism or intelligence both no janet said i dont believe you all right baxeter said it was to see see what if there were an advantage jesus this isnt easy for me how the fuck do you think it is for me do you have to swear yes i fucking well have to swear dont shit she snarled what about your getting involved in that demand for that was a setup wasnt it your people yes he admitted why to get closer to you to make me feel dependent you mean to come to rely upon you yes he said admitting more you bastard all of you bastards have you any idea what im doing what im disclosing the rules im breaking i dont give a fuck about your rules i love you stop it janet cupped her hands over her ears to close out what he was saying im trying to get through to you he said make you understand i was told to get close to you ok to see if you could be used i wasnt told to fall in love with you which is why i am being honest now telling you truthfully i came near to doing it before thought youd guessed that day at the tembelodendron janet still had her hands up to her head she moved it jerkily from side to side in refusal i dont want to hear dont want your lies that isnt a lie baxeter insisted listen to me for christs sake hes not your god dont be facile what do you expect me to be sensible go fuck yourself go ahead baxeter said why dont you go ahead and mouth off every swear word there is and get it out of your system janet took her hands from her head im not sure thats what i need to get out of my system are you going to listen to me janet sat with her arms around her legs again staring at him wanting to feel hatredsomething like it at leastbut nothing would come baxeter waited but when he saw she was not going to speak he said journalism is the cover like the passport it enables me to travel all over the middle east my first meeting with you was exactly what i told you exploratory how did i know how it was going to work out what about john janet demanded the photograph and the address did you really go to beirut to get them collect them corrected baxeter weve got a lot of sources there a lot of operatives weve got to have but why she pressed why get involved is there an advantage there too it would be a humiliation to the terrorists if america were able to get in and get out one of their people said baxeter and i hope there could be a personal advantage too i dont understand that last part youre never going to be able to choose with john still in captivity are you he said simply why couldnt she hate this man janet asked herself why couldnt she despise and detest him for using her like everyone else had used her no she said almost to herself forgive me i dont know i havent hurt you janet supposed he hadnt but it was difficult for her to work out i dont know that either she said i obviously couldnt tell you in the beginning he said trying to convince her and afterwards it was too late now it means theres a chance of rescuing john it was convoluted but true she recognized i suppose youre right she conceded so you forgive me he asked again i said i dont know i need to think understand everything would she ever understand everything i want you to stay tonight janet realized despising herself that she wanted very much to stay no she said as strongly as she could she acceptedjusthis explanation but shed still been used and couldnt dismiss it as lightly as this as if it hardly mattered i guess it was too much to ask too much to expect that too he agreed was it true what you said about the possibility of john being moved thats the way they operate precisely to prevent rescue why me demanded janet abruptly as the query occurred to her why bother to use me as a conduit israel and america are allies you rely enormously on washington why not deal direct agency to agency baxeter nodded acknowledging the question ready for the cynicism yes damage limitation said baxeter this way it remains entirely an american operation they get the credit if it goes right the criticism if it goes wrong were prepared to sacrifice one to avoid getting caught up in the other how do you learn to think like that years of practice baxeter said janet shuddered involuntarily its creepy sure about not staying no she thought positive she said you know everything you have to tell the americans janet wished he had tried harder to persuade her yes she said hart was at the hotel to collect her in the chauffeurdriven limousine within thirty minutes of janets call they assembled again in the pinepaneled conference room and the three men huddled excitedly around the paper that janet offered with the kantari address know it willsher asked the beirut agent nodded weve more than enough photographs and plans of the street for the mockup at fort pearce he promised what about checking it out ourselves on the ground trying to establish if it really is where johns being held came in hart knox made an uncertain movement with his hand we could try i suppose but what if were spotted they seemed to have forgotten her presence thought janet she said dont forget the possibility of his being moved willsher looked back to her janet repeated the warning that baxeter had given together with the assurance of her being able to learn any new location sure youll be able to find out willsher asked yes janet said she was now she thought now that she knew what baxeter really did she supposed she should feel reassured and wondered why she didnt well have to build that contingency in of course through every stage of the planning willsher said to the other two men and blanket kantari with every sort of listening device thats been invented as a backup the man turned back to janet looks as if youre going to remain an important part of the team he smiled its good to be involved said janet should she feel a hypocrite only about her romantic involvement with baxeter she decided everything else was being moved along the labyrinthine paths that baxeter and these three men trod all the time if it had not all been literally in such deadly earnestso importantjanet could imagine laughing at the absurdity of it still keep in daily contact willsher told her thereve been more thoughts from washington too what she asked weve decided to maximize the impact of getting john out said willsher confidently im to ask you if youd agree to reunion publicity janet swallowed not able immediately to respond what would that moment be the ultimate hypocrisy or the ultimate inevitable choice arent you planning ahead a little she said thats exactly what were doing willsher chose not to acknowledge her caution everything that can be planned for is being planned for of course i agree she said hypocrite she thought what right did she of all people have to criticize baxeter or anyone else for lying and cheating and being labyrinthine were not going to fail willsher said confidently this isnt going to be another iran hostage screwup were going to get john out and leave an awful lot of bloody noses behind believe me id like to said janet id like to believe you very much indeed perfect said baxeter enthusiastically an hour later is it said janet the israeli became serious matching her mood there always had to be a decision time sooner or later i know so this is it not quite she said i t would have been fatuous for janet not to think about the choice she had to make it was constantly at the forefront of her mind at best she could refuse to consider it with any finality which was how she went through the succeeding days aware but uncommitted if she could remain uncommitted that is spending every available moment with baxeter and making love every nightand sometimes during the dayand feeling content only in his presence or when he was near they drove to the mountains again and this time there was none of the aching nostalgia shed experienced when shed made the journey alone and he took her to a production of shakespeares much ado about nothing at a restored roman amphitheater in the low seacliffs near limassol the backdrop was breathtaking the performance magnificent and the irony of the title not lost on them after the play they went to a restaurant near ladys mile baxeter said it was the one hed had in mind after the photographic session in the mountains when hed asked her to dinner that was the first time i knew he said thought i knew anyway me too said janet janet maintained daily contact with the cia group at the american embassy and on the fifth day at willshers invitation went to the legation intrigued by what she found the room in which they had always met had been transformed into what she could only think of as a war room there were three separate blackboards on their easelstwo draped with maps with blownup inserts of kantari the third covered with ground and aerial photographsand an additional cork pinboard upon which photographs had been given map references neither hart nor knox were present but during their meeting a hardboned crewcut man in unmarked jungle camouflage fatigues came into the room consulted an index on the pinboard and withdrew he paid no attention whatsoever to either of them and willsher made no effort to introduce him it looks positive willsher said weve had lots of imageintensified picturesmovie as well as stillblown up to their maximum enlargement of the area and particularly the street under analysis there seems to be a lot of activity weve identified amal militia groupings weaponry stuff like that also there is some indication of a radio installation the british are giving us a tremendous amount of cooperation we think weve isolated their wave band and were backing up with our own satellite intercepts as well what about fort pearce asked janet before replying willsher looked towards the door through which the soldier had just left the room why i asked you to come today he revealed theyve finished the mockup exercises theyre here here echoed janet surprised nearer and nearer she thought were on countdown ms stone which is where you come in we want to hear from you that johns still there that we havent got to redirect yes janet accepted emptily how long i dont know answered janet honestly it seemed absurd but it was something she had not discussed with baxeter could you give me some idea tomorrow i hope so said janet whats the plan thats classified refused willsher i didnt mean the details of the incursion elaborated janet what about afterwards if you find john where are you going to take him here said willsher the british are making their air base at akrotiri available already on its way towards the lebanese coast is a major part of the sixth fleet including the aircraft carrier they wont enter territorial waters but therell be blanket air support john will be helicoptered here to undergo medical checks while we set up the press briefing the planning appeared to be absolute where you want me to be present she said right alongside the man you love smiled willsher it felt like a physical blow a punch low in the stomach she managed a smile and said it should be quite a media event would baxeter attend as the journalist he was supposed to be and show these fanatic bastards up to be the useless idiots they are said willsher with sudden vehemence what else would it show up it could all be over in days she said distantly thats the scale were working to willsher confirmed over and finished in days he smiled all were waiting for is the word from you once again baxeter heard her out with the distracted attitude she found disconcerting concentrating upon what she was saying but not upon janet herself days he queried thats what willsher said all theyre waiting for is my confirmation ill need their definite date said baxeter why asked janet its important why she repeated trust me will you have to go back to beirut maybe not this time how long baxeter pulled down the corners of his mouth maybe fortyeight hours over and finished in days she remembered what exactly would be finished baxeter left early the following morning but this time there was none of the earlier emptiness because her mind was in a turmoil of indecision how could she dispassionately pick one against the other the very word was a mockery passion had every thing to do with it uncomfortably her mind held by it janet decided that if she were making a comparison which was what she had to do then baxeter was a better lover than john but that was only a part of it she knew she loved baxeter because shed been with him practically lived with him it seemed so long ago with john almost difficult to remember so she had to have time with him again not for herself she thought quickly to be fair to john thats all was she capable of that sort of hypocrisy going through the charade of the media reunion and all the time conducting some sort of mental trial she didnt think she was couldnt think properly of anything baxeter wasnt away the fortyeight hours hed estimated he called on the evening of the second night and met her in a restaurant in ayios dhometios they had not used before he was there before her and as janet sat down the man said john is still there janet tried to think of something appropriate to say but couldnt good she mumbled baxeter leaned intensely across the table towards her he said its vital you understand the importance of learning the precise day the americans are going to go in why ive been to tel aviv disclosed baxeter janet frowned over the table trying to understand the significance so from what willsher told you is it obvious the americans are planning a frontal assault backed up by air support and whatever else from their fleet said the israeli i guess so agreed janet i hadnt thought about it to that extent willsher said they were prepared it wont work declared baxeter flatly it cant work cant work the anxiety flared through her even if they achieve complete surprise therell still be some resistance predicted baxeter our military people in tel aviv estimate that moving at the maximum possible speednight is the logical attack time which is going to cause further hindranceit will take an hour from the moment they hit the beach to get to where john is in kantari baxeter stopped hesitating at what he had to say by which time john will have been moved he said bluntly he added or killed no moaned janet softly it cant go on like this it just cant its got to stop thats why my knowing the actual day is important why weve decided to use the american landing as a diversionary tactic said baxeter were going to send a commando team in ahead of them well get john out j anet sensed the atmosphere the moment she entered the mapstrewn room the sort of solemnity that remains after a disagreement or a dispute except no one looked as if they had been arguing willsher was in his preferred chair at the center of the table and the soldier who had interrupted them on the previous occasion was by the furthest blackboard where the maps had been coordinated with photographs he still wore his unmarked fatigues knox was at the window he gave janet the briefest welcoming smile and then looked back at the fourth man in the room who was sitting alongside willsher he was elderly with a hedge of straggling white hair around a bald dome he wore halfrim spectacles low on his nose and a crumpled neglected sports jacket over an equally crumpled and neglected checked sports shirt without a tie the man stopped talking when janet entered the room looking expectantly towards her willsher stood holding out his hand in invitation towards a chair opposite them and said im glad youre here ms stone seems there is something we havent allowed for the cia official halfturned to the man beside him professor robards he said in introduction what hasnt been allowed for asked janet not sitting johns mental condition announced willsher his what my specialty is the psychological affect of long incarceration explained robards ive worked with some of the men imprisoned by the north vietnamese during the war and latterly tried to expand it to include the traumas likely to be suffered by kidnap victims such as john people whove spent time possibly in solitary confinement possibly experiencing some degree of torture and certainly with captors they identify as enemies not knowing if at any moment they are going to be killed robards had an unemotional scholarly delivery talking as if to a class of students janet considered it altogether too sterile and distant she said you think john will be traumatized its inevitable said the psychologist flatly the only uncertainty is to what degree he could have the mental strength to recover in a day alternately it could take months and maybe even require psychiatric treatment janet looked at willsher remembering you told me he could stand it she said i thought he would be able to said the man apologetically i didnt know no one knows reiterated robards ive encountered men built like trees whom i would have bet could withstand any sort of stress but who have collapsed almost at once and taken years to recover and wimpy little guys weighing ninety pounds whove taken everything and walked away without a mental mark is that why youre here to treat him janet asked langley thought it might be a precaution said willsher answering for the man and im glad youre here too robards said to her why like i told you johns spent quite a lot of time not knowing what to expect from one minute to the next hes going to be rescued by a commando group making a sudden assault therell be a great deal of noise explosions shooting stuff like that a great deal endorsed the unnamed officer a primary tactic is to disorient with as much noise as possible what was she doing janet demanded of herself what was she doing sitting here listening to these people talk about rescuing john when she already knew they werent going to rescue john at all tell them she thought at once tell them and and what how could she tell them without exposing herself and baxeter and john john too john wouldnt survive the frontal assault baxeter had told her and baxeter was an israeli hadnt the israelis done in entebbe exactly what was being planned here hadnt the ugandan assault been used by willsher himself as a role model werent they experts the people who knew best the american attempt to rescue the iran hostages had been a disaster she had to leave it to the experts janet felt constrained straitjacketed by the conflicting demands and she felt something else a rumbling churn of nausea deep in her stomach john wont know whats happening the psychologist was saying it wont initially occur to him that its a rescue hell think its what hes been threatened with ever since he was seized it will be the moment of maximum pressure maximum terror and then therell be the pendulum swing from terror to relief when he realizes its the americans coming in thats the likeliest snapping point that swing from one extreme to the other stop thought janet stop stop stop she said why is my being here important because yours is the face hell recognize said robards people held like john seize upon images that mean the most to them thats how they cling to reality how john will have clung thinking of the person closest to him in the world janet closed her eyes swallowing against the sickness bubbling up through her why of anything she could have asked had she posed a question to get an answer like that she was only vaguely aware of robardss voice talking on im sorry to have been so blunt apologized the man misconstruing her emotion its important you know how difficult it might be janet opened her eyes forcing the smile thank you for setting it out as you have im sure its not going to be like that tried knox from near the window im sure its all going to work out great it wont fail from lack of preparation came in the commando officer joining in the encouragement were as ready as were ever likely to be which brings us back to you ms stone said willsher janet stirred gratefully she had to get out she thought the constricted feeling had gone beyond a mental impression she felt the room closing in upon her walls and ceiling pressing around her squeezing her breathless she said its the same location john hasnt been moved son of a bitch said the soldier driving a fist into the palm of his other hand in satisfied excitement just what i wanted to hear we can go then said willsher it was not really a question but the soldier responded two ackemma tomorrow he said she had it janet accepted she had the precise information required by one man she loved to free the other man she loved jesus she thought despairingly knox offered to accompany her back to the hotel but janet said she wanted to be alone and the cia officer withdrew at once imagining her need for solitude to be caused by the nearness of the operation with no way of knowing the proper reason or the seed of an idea germinating in her mind she had the limousine drop her by the old city and wended her way completely across the greekheld section to emerge by the famagusta gate baxeter was waiting as hed promised he would be parked in themis street the volkswagen was dirty as it had been the first time shed ridden in it why did such inconsequential things register he drove off as soon as she got in you were much longer than i expected he said janet didnt bother with an explanation the determination that had started to grow on her way from the embassy was hardening within her she said are you to be part of the commando assault baxeter glanced quickly across at her and then back at the road yes he said im trained i want to come announced janet what baxeter had taken kennedy avenue driving without any particular intention towards famagusta he jerked the car hurriedly into the side of the road cranking on the handbrake i want to come repeated janet thats absurd utterly absurd laughable not to me she said nothing seems laughable to me absurd a lot of the time but never laughable why ive just had a long lecture about johns needs said janet it was very convincing i think its about time i started doing the right thing and considered johns needs dont you johns needs rather than my needs or your needs i promise you he will be gotten out said baxeter i know the time said janet the precise hour and the precise day unless you agree to my coming i dont intend to tell you darling this is ridiculous how can you expect us to take you youre an amateur finished janet for him i wont get in the way ill do exactly what i am told when i am told i must be there when john is freed hes got to see my face no i mean what i say its not my decision then ill rely on the americans said janet she stopped breathing in courage for the final determined ultimatum and ill tell them what you intended to do how you intended to use their assault as a diversion i know what that will mean for me personally what theyll learn i dont care if itll help what theyre trying to do they might need to alter their planning its got to work thats all that matters that john is freed i t was a fishing boat again in the darkness it seemed to have the same midsection construction and be about the same size janet waited expectantly for the revulsion but nothing came this boat was cleaner although there was still the stink of fish the muttered challenge came as soon as baxeter hauled her inboard from the rowboat which had ferried them from the bay near cape pyla janet guessed the mutter to be hebrew a language she did not understand baxeters retort was brief but sharp in the tone of a superior to subordinates and the challenge stopped abruptly theres shelter in the wheelhouse suggested baxeter no janet said at once remembering the last time baxeter had retreated from her in attitude and mind he had agreed that she should come as soon as she threatened going to the americans but he clearly begrudged the concession it wont be long a mile or two he said what then transfer to a proper patrol boat until now janet had not considered how they were going to reach the lebanese mainland it was going to be a great deal different than before trying to rebuild bridges between them she said now that ive explained what robards told me dont you understand no rejected baxeter he was actually standing away from her his gaze towards the open sea where he expected the israeli patrol boats to be laying off was it his reluctance to accept her presence wondered janet or was this a side of baxeter she had not experienced before the mans ability to compartment himself concentrating upon something or someone absolutely essential at that particular and absolute moment and able to relegate everything or everyone else of subsidiary importance its necessary that i come she insisted you made that clear there was a call a single word in hebrew from the wheelhouse and baxeter slightly changed the direction in which he was looking janet followed his gaze hearing the patrol boat before she actually detected it a throaty heavy bubbled sound of very powerful engines throttled back to minimal tickover practically a protest at the waste of such power the seamanship was superb without any obvious signals the captain of the fishing boat brought his vessel softly against the side of the matchingly maneuvered patrol boat and the two sides kissed the hanging fenders with the merest jolt step across follow me ordered baxeter janet did as she was told without any stumble or uncertainty and was glad anxious not to indicate this early that she might become an encumbrance despite the darkness she was immediately noticed there was an eruption of babbled hebrew against which baxeter argued and then started to shout unseen blackgarbed figures whose faces and heads also seemed blackened shouted back milling in front of them and gesticulating wildly some of the shouts were to the fishing boat that was easing away and it at once reversed its engines janet guessed the instruction had been to return to take her off the argument became a violent yelling row with baxeter standing in front of her in the manner of a protector gradually janet recognized a sameness in the gestures and as she did baxeter said to her over his shoulder they are insisting i talk to tel aviv he reached protectively behind him and seized her arm to guide her towards the darker superstructure once she entered the radio shack janet understood where she wason a very special custombuilt vessel created for a very special function everyone wore black onepiece boiler suitseven the zips were blackwithout any insignia of rank fitted with pushback hoods that could be pulled up entirely to cover the head there was no white light just red but despite the dullness janet could make out that all the internal fittings were black not a single item risking the reflection of any sort of light and that beyond on the open deck all the metal was blackened too covered by some plastic or bitumen coating a fairhaired man insisted upon using the radio first yelling into the mouthpiece as loudly as he had upon the deck and then baxeter snatched it away from him but spoke in more controlled tones than the other man forceful reason against inconsiderate anger from the transmitter came a flurry of questions and although she could not understand the language janet was able to discern three different voices and guessed the concern would be as great in israel as it appeared aboard this bizarre boat first baxeter responded then the fairhaired man then baxeter again the transmission ended with the fairhaired commando throwing down a pencil in disgust and stumping past her janet was near the doorway and he actually attempted to collide with her but at the last minute she went further sideways into the shack and he missed janet who was pleased hoped baxeter had seen you won guessed janet you can come agreed baxeter i have to face an internal inquiry when its all over i m sorry i hope im not the engines heavy bubble became within moments the roar of throttles being opened as the patrol boat unexpectedly lifted on its stern and hurtled forwards smashing through the water there was no warning of the acceleration and both she and baxeter stumbled backwards he managed to grab a support rail and then snatched out for her stopping her falling an expression of displeasure said baxeter youre very much resented im an expert at resentment said janet she had to shout to make herself heard over the engine scream baxeter did not try to talk he pulled her from the radio room out on to the deck and then through a small housing covering some steps he went down ahead of her calling out in advance what she guessed to be some sort of warning of their approach there were about eight men below in the mess area it smelled of stale cigarette smoke and bodies too close together for too long the men regarded them sullenly without any greeting the vehement radio protestor was not one of them baxeter went through the mess to a bunk area further back groped in a locker and handed her a pair of the black coveralls that were clearly the regulation dress he said i think theyre the smallest janet stood looking uncertainly down at the suit it felt like a rubberized material tight at the wrists and ankles and lined with a silklike material closer she saw that the hood was wired with earpieces inside so that the wearer could be linked up to a communications system how do i wear it she asked baxeter over my own clothes she had on her muchworn jeans shirt and sneakers you can try but youll be damned hot said the israeli if you take them off dont expect the courtesy of their turning their backs itll be part of making you feel unwelcome janet stripped to her pants and bra not brazenly but not embarrassed either her back defiantly to them the overalls were big but wearable baxeter changed too facing her with seeming indifference to her taking off her clothes baxeter indicated a seat at the far end of the table around which the other men sat and said itll be better if you get off your feet you can very easily become exhausted constantly bracing yourself against the pitch and roll of this thing she said how long not more than an hour assured baxeter this is the fastest incursion boat weve got what about the american fleet asked janet wont they be between us theyre further north nearer the turkish coast what about their radar the israeli smiled at her naivete there are more baffling and confusing devices aboard than most other countries including those in the west know we have invented janet looked along the table isnt this division a bit unnecessary not to men like these said baxeter they work in groups teams that take months to train together they think like each other react like each other know each other that way they stay alive an intrusion like you throws the synchronization out because youre here they think they might get killed i didnt understand said janet deflated thats why theyre not accepting you wont accept you what about when we get ashore youre my responsibility said baxeter your burden suggested janet trying for a more accurate word you speak hebrew no she said he smiled briefly that was the word tel aviv used to describe you there was the soft noise of muffled descent on the rubberized companionway and the fairhaired man came into view carrying a snakes nest of radio links he handed them out individually to the waiting men and then stayed by them staring down at baxeter and janet there was a curt question to which baxeter replied with equal curtness two of the seated men sniggered and janet guessed baxeter had scored with his retort because the man flushed slightly and tossed one of the connectors towards him baxeter caught it easily theres no purpose in your having a headset said baxeter its minimal communication anyway its in hebrew and its coded just understand one thing dont ever lose me dont get separated and dont fall back into one of the other groups theyll either intentionally abandon youor kill you youre joking thats their training to kill or be killed insisted baxeter youre as near to being an enemy as makes no difference janet tried to subdue her shudder but couldnt baxeter was connecting his radio links intent on the hood of his uniform and janet did not think hed seen her reaction in case he had she said it frightens me this matteroffactness its meant to there was a perceptible reduction in engine power baxeter called out to the other end of the table and one of the men replied in agreement baxeter said were getting close theyll be putting out a lot of deceptive electronics now and transferring to a much quieter engine well do the last mile by rubber dinghy there was a curt tinvoiced order over the tannoy and the men began to assemble picking up weapons and multipocketed rucksacks there were eight of them and janet watched fascinated as they formed up in two lines of four one man facing another each reaching out and touching the one opposite checking off equipment and packs each ensuring that the other had overlooked nothing synchronized teams she remembered baxeter had to prepare himself alone and janet wished she could have helped him closer she saw all the buckles and fastenings were rubber that would make no noise under movement by the time they reached the deck the dinghies had been dropped overboard six of them trailed by short lines along the sides of the now barely moving patrol vessel janet made out eight men additional to those in the mess from which theyd just come again the entry was perfectly coordinated groups of four dropped without any apparent instruction in perfect order into their boatseight commandoes to each boatand towed off the one behind them empty to make room for the next entry janet and baxeter were allocated the last boat everyone else was inboard and she felt them watching for her to stumble and make a fool of herself she hit the slatted bottom unsteadily but retained her balance and managed to sit without any need for help she would have liked to see their disappointment but it was too dark the dinghy churned away from its mother ship and janet looked curiously to its stern where a single coxswain hunched at the tiller there was the foam of a wake but hardly any noise at all she decided the engine had to be electric so quiet was it a line of propellers dropped straight into the water from a straightbar assembly and janet was reminded of the food blender in the kitchen of her rosslyn apartment she felt a demanding tug and leaned towards baxeter his mouth directly against her ear he said when were ashore dont try to talk whatever the circumstances dont say anything to make a sound that will carry if you want to communicate with me do what ive just done so that we can get as close together as this understand janet nodded without trying to reply even here from the wind on her face she could tell it was cold but she was perfectly warm otherwise inside her special suit her mouth was unnaturally dry and she would have liked a drink she hadnt used a toilethadnt thought of itbefore shed left the patrol boat and hoped there would not be the need ahead she could make out the lighter glow of land and habitation although they did not seem to be coming as close to the city itself as she had on the fishing boat she turned to baxeter to ask before remembering the injunction against unnecessary noise she turned back to look ahead saying nothing directly in front of her in the dinghy the commandoes were putting on night goggles they made their faces look froglike beside her baxeter did the same baxeter handed her a set which she fitted on awkwardly they were close enough now to hear the surf against the shore over the hardly audible pop of their engine beirut was definitely away to their left but so dark was it even with the benefit of the night vision equipment janet found it impossible to judge how far baxeter tugged at her again indicating that she would soon have to go over the side to wade the last few yards through the water the men began to leave the dinghy once more in perfect unison first port then starboard then port again with scarcely a disturbance of the craft to show their departure baxeter prodded her and janet edged doubtfully over the side apprehensive of dropping into water she couldnt see not knowing what she would encounter underfoot there was another shove harder this time which actually propelled her over the edge she tensed for the shock of coldness but there wasnt any because the suit was completely waterproof nothing brushed against her in the waisthigh water and hardpacked sand was even underfoot she stood there knowing a surge of uncertainty and then felt baxeters hand upon her arm guiding her towards the shore she tried to wade like him with slow long strides so that there was no sound from the water when they reached it the beach was deserted baxeter urged her forward more quickly janet stumbled once because the beach had patches of shingle and rock outcrops impatiently baxeter got directly ahead and felt backwards with his hands showing her where it was safe to walk janet was conscious of ascending a rising slope and as it became lighter she realized they had climbed an incline to a shoreroad ahead was the uneven outline of vehicles three or four quite low jeeplike then a highersided lorry and more jeeps it was a considerable convoy and janet wondered how they had managed to get a fleet that size undetected across the border and up through southern lebanon baxeter led her to the last jeep and they sat in it alone apart from the driver baxeter was leaning forward but not too close to the driver his head automatically bent as he whispered into the throat mike that formed part of his communications set they moved off at staged intervals and janet very quickly lost sight of the leading vehicles they traveled only briefly not more than fifteen minutes before pulling into a walled yard in what had to be the southernmost suburb of the city as their jeep the last went through the gate shadowy figures closed it immediately behind them janet squinted around the parking area sure there were not as many vehicles now as there had been when they set out groups of men were assembled in absolute silence and in marked separate units she could make out heavier equipment she guessed had been hauled ashore in the supply dinghies there were two longbarreled guns she thought must be rocket launchers and quite near a man was harnessed into a cumbersome tank from which a nozzle led a flamethrower she supposed they exited on foot at timed intervals with her and baxeter bringing up the rear there were city sounds now music strained through walls and windows the occasional headlight glare of a car people huddled in cafes they were careful to skirt always getting past by going around and keeping the block of the building between them at first janet had been able to make out quite a few of the commandoes but it became increasingly difficult and then baxeter pulled her away from the direction they had been following up a very narrow darkened alley little more than a footpath between two buildings janet followed dutifully conscious once more of a slope underfoot and bending forward to climb it once again the devastation was all around as it had been when shed fled her attackers janet supposed they would have not have been able to move around the city with such comparative ease unless the lighting had been practically nonexistent the chief danger of attention came from foraging dogs which barked and snarled and sniffed after them twice windows above opened and there were arabic shouts for the animals to be quiet each time baxeter was ahead of any movement moving her quickly into the shadows of a doorway she and baxeter had been moving apparently alone for longer than janet had expected and she wished she knew beirut well enough to know when they actually got into the kantari district she should have asked to look at the maps or the photographs in willshers room in cyprus the americans had relaxed sufficiently in her presence and she was sure they would have allowed it she longed to stop baxeter to ask him but recognized that the question did not constitute the sort of emergency hed stipulated they came to an intersection with a wider betterlit thoroughfare and once more baxeter pulled her into the concealment of a doorway while he edged forward to reconnoiter their crossing it gave janet the opportunity to look around particularly behind her she did so frowning she made out the glint of the sea and the brighter harbor area was that the area through which shed fled in guttightening fear of being caught and even the faraway bright normality of east beirut was kantari on a hill she had imagined it to be further down in the flatter part of the city baxeter was back beside her signlanguaging an occupied cafe to the left on the main road where it sloped back down towards the waterfront and gesturing for her to move at once and hurriedly when he gave the signal janet nodded her understanding pushing away from her concealment and going head bent looking neither left nor right across the road the illumination was still comparatively low and the highway deserted but janet walked with the feeling of scurrying beneath an inquiring spotlight tensed for a shout of challenge nothing came she was panting more through apprehension than effort when she reached the other side finding her own concealing doorway she looked back trying to locate baxeter but couldnt she checked her watch onethirty thirty minutes to go before the american assault why had they split from the rest of the group janet did not see baxeter start out he was suddenly in the street moving low and very fast janet actually held her breath waiting for the challenge that had not come when she crossed but once again there was nothing she gestured as he pushed into the alley and he halted close against her in the doorway seizing the opportunity janet gestured him even nearer he eased the hood away from the side of his face and she heard a staccato spurt of hebrew from the headset she hissed why have we separated from the others safer he whispered back closing off the exchange by pulling the hood back into place baxeter led off again going to the end of the alley and then breaking to their right running parallel with the road they had just crossed from the camber janet knew they were still climbing they made a detour around another coffeehouse from which there was thin music and the mumble of conversation and once had to pull unmoving into a rubblestrewn courtyard to evade a sudden gaggle of men who appeared ahead of them walking in their direction the group passed unaware janet expected she and baxeter to move out at once but baxeter held her back she thought it was to let the men get further away but then realized baxeter was reholstering into his backpack a short handweapon that bulged with a fatnosed silencer just innocent men merely walking home from some latenight outing janet thought it would have been murder he urged her on until they reached the junction at which theyd first seen the approaching men baxeter hesitated for a moment orienting himself led her about ten yards to the left and then stopped hunkering down against a large deserted building beside which there was a completely open space pulling her down to his level across the open space there was a perfect view of the entire city much better than when shed first looked down laid out for inspection in the sharp moonlight she indicated she wanted to speak again and he pulled aside his cowl janet said i dont understand whats happening wait he said brusquely the explosions split the night open appearing to be all around her so near and so loud that the pain seared through her ears she was partially deafened but still able to hear the sudden roar of aircraft and then everything became fiercely whitelighter than the brightest dayas dozens of phosphorus illuminating shells burst from what seemed every point in the sky janet blinked against the glare able to see everything there was a fresh eruption of noise of machinegun fire and the slowerpaced crack of rifles and handguns and the crump of shells there were spurts of flame where the shells landed all along the waterfront landing craft were spewing men ashore they emerged firing from behind the dropfronted ramps and several fell almost immediately janet recognized that the overhead roar was not that of aircraft but of helicopter gunships they hovered all along the waterfront continuous streams of flame coming from their catling cannons protruding from either side and then janet recognized something else she stared wildly around convinced she knew the imposing government building about two hundred yards away as one she had driven past on her way to the american embassy that morning after shed toured the harbor looking for the fishing boat that had first brought her to beirut then she saw the embassy itself and knew she was right furious eyes bulging in her anger janet snatched and tugged and baxeter staggered sideways surprised he jerked the head cover off because noise didnt matter any morehad to be yelled over in facthe shouted what the hells going on this isnt kantari janet shouted back i know this place its yarzy and thats the american embassy why arent we in kantari because it was absurd and laughable like i told you he said that is the american embassy and if anything goes wrong get the hell to it youll be safe there but john shut up and stop being a fool said baxeter he tugged binoculars from his backpack thrust them towards her and gestured far away to their right there he said focus there janet hesitated then did as she was told it took her a moment to adjust the binoculars a moment in which there was a fresh spray of phosphorus it was like a firework display she thought an obscene killing firework display and she had the ringside seat the enlargement was perfect she could see the american commandoes spreading through the street and other men civilians desperately firing at them as they retreated the gunships moved with the advance pouring down cannon shells she saw one arab practically cut in half by the concentration of fire and an already shattered building actually collapsed and then she saw blacksuited and blackhelmeted men janet tried to count but stopped at seven they were all in one street with two in a side alley and all facing the direction from which the americans were approaching so that the arabs were pincered in between twice groups of arabs tried to get into the street and only then did the israelis fire blasting the entry and preventing them janet turned beseechingly to baxeter what just watch when she looked back the arabs had stopped trying to get into the israelisealed street and were being forced further along another road to escape camouflaged americans were everywhere now entering the street itself and moving housetohouse along bordering and parallel alleys but she could no longer see any israelis there was an abrupt concentration of troops around one house halfway along she watched one mans arm move and the door was blown in and she realized hed thrown a grenade the house was rushed and into the streetquiet and secured nowanother coordinated group moved a stretcher between them and then she saw john he was at the doorway supported by two american commandoes his arms were along their shoulders and theirs were around him and he sagged between them janet whimpered hearing herself make the sound and a huge feeling of pity welled up inside her there was an obvious indication towards the stretcher and john shook his head trying to walk but almost at once he stumbled and allowed himself to be shakily lowered on to it they moved off at once the stretcher completely encircled by men with their backs to it most literally walking backwards forming a tight circle of protection ok baxeter said you had to be here to see him freed and you were now lets get out janet did not move still watching the progress of the rescue squad and baxeter jerked her upright pulling the binoculars from her i said weve got to get out dully bewildered she stumbled after him conscious that the night was becoming black again because no more phosphorus was exploding there was still firing from below but it was sporadic now and the gunships had stopped blasting they appeared to be going back along exactly the same route they had climbed but at the brighter thoroughfare baxeter halted longer than before head lowered as he mumbled into his throat microphone janet had an abrupt spurt of fear as a shadow became the figure of a man and then there were others and she realized they had linked up with some of the other israelis at once they moved off in their own tight circle of protection they were practically across the street before the shout came at once two of the israelis stopped turning towards the cafe one fired a short burst and the other hurled a grenade baxeter was dragging her along her hand in his and they were in an alley before the blast of the explosion rippled up the street janet stumbled along panting the air burning her throat aware that as well as being pulled by baxeter she was being pushed by another of the men his hand in the small of her back a dog barked suddenly snarling in front of them and at once there was a wailing howl as it was kicked out of the way a challenge came from a window above but the head jerked back from view at a spray of automatic fire that whined off the brickwork bringing dust raining down upon them cant keep up got to stop janet groaned baxeter continued pulling and the other commando went on pushing no one slackening their pace please they ran on the gates of whatever yard it was in which they had hidden the vehicles were open men guarding the entrance and as they reached it the first emerged the lorry closely followed by two jeeps baxeter had to physically lift janet into the back of another she rolled sideways as she went in laid against the hard seat and could not raise herself she felt baxeter behind her his hand protectively against her shoulder the convoy hurtled back along the coast road and she was jolted and thrown about scarcely aware in her exhaustion of what was happening twice she heard what she thought was gunfire but her ears were so dulled by the earlier attack she wasnt sure she was just able to straighten by the time they got back to where they beached surrendering herself completely to baxeters guidance she was led back down the incline over the shingle and briefly out into the water he folded backwards easily into the rubber boat leaning out and lifting her bodily in beside him behind there was the crump of yet another explosion and janet squinted back in time to see the lorry and the jeeps burst one after the other into a solid wall of flame it was not casual destruction she realized they had been arranged so that they formed a solid blazing barrier against any pursuit as the awareness came to her janet saw in the light of the flames the dark outlines of pursuing army vehicles moving along the coast road after them the dinghy started off at once there were far more people aboard than when they had come in from the patrol boat and when they reached it men milled around on deck laughing and hugging and patting each other on the back she could see four men on stretchers but there were no obvious bloodstains to show that they had been wounded in the assault baxeter moved into the apparent celebration janet stayed by the wheelhouse ignored no attempt was made to bring the dinghies inboard a number of men threw things into them as the patrol boat surged off and almost at once there were grenade bursts and the rubber boats started to settle and sink janet clung on to the wheelhouse grateful for the wind that whipped into her face drying the perspiration that soaked her as close as she was she could hear a continuous radio commentary in hebrew and see the blips against the radar screen the heavy concentration to one side would be the american fleet she supposed there were other isolated markings one directly ahead she was aware of someone next to her and turned to see baxeter all right he said janet shrugged not replying her mind at that moment blank of any thought it worked said baxeter again janet did not reply she was conscious of the obvious drop in power knowing they had not traveled as long this time as they had ingoing from the fishing boat and then she realized the rendezvous was not with the fishing boat but with two other patrol vessels exactly like the one on which they were already traveling again they came expertly together and there was a scrambled transfer the stretcher cases going across first janet watched counting it was achieved very quickly hardly more than minutes there were shouted farewells and the two new vessels creamed away in convoy only she and baxeter remained aside from the crew thirteen she said to baxeter as the patrol vessel climbed back on top the water again what said baxeter making allowances for those ashore in your vehicles when we got there id guess we came back with thirteen more people than when we went in actually said baxeter it was twelve and they werent our vehicles they were hijacked from the lebanese army b axeter had tried to speak to explain but janet had refused him choked by this the final betrayal tricked by a man she thought had loved her she spat out that she hated him he said he didnt believe her and she screamed back that she didnt give a fuck what he believed that all she wanted to do was get back to cyprus hed reached out to touch her but shed shrugged him away not wanting even the slightest physical contact youre being juvenile he said have been juvenile she qualified welcome to the graduation youre not very good at sarcasm it comes out wrong what the fuck are you good at what i do whats that johns free you saw it happen thats what im good at im impressed you should be and the sarcasm still isnt working go fuck yourself the barnyard language doesnt work either never has like everything else in the operation which janet now accepted baxeter had personally organized the reunion with the fishing boat went perfectly and there was no difficulty landing at the shoreline break near cape pyla from which theyd embarked he did not immediately try to start the car looking across at her i said i wanted to explain shut up just shut up and get me back to the hotel your choice i just made it sure sure they drove in silence through the stilldark night towards nicosia theyd crossed from the lebanon in an incredibly brief time and there wasnt yet the peach and pink tinge of dawn on the horizon but a helicopter would have been quicker and the american plan was for john to be helicoptered in at once to the british base at akrotiri she remembered what if theyd tried to reach her at the hotel what reason could she convincingly give for not being there nothing right janet thought dismally from the very outset she had done nothing right shed fumbled and thrashed out and made ripplesmaybe even wavesbut not once had she got anything right not once fucked up all the way along baxeters distaste of her swearing forced itself upon her fucked up she thought again defiantly and then again fucked up baxeter started to drive into the hotel gate but janet stopped him there we have to talk he said as she got out janet slammed the door saying nothing the skeletal night staff were still on the clerk hastily buttoning his shirt collar as she approached the desk when she asked he assured her there were no outstanding messages relief lifted janet she felt the physical need to cleanse herself of everything and everybody with whom she had been in contact during the previous hours she showered for a long time twisting the water control from cold to hot first to chill and then to burn herself but soon became irritated at the obvious scourging snapping off the pretense she didnt sleep when she finally got into bed lying wideeyed but able to see nothing clearly as the day lightened through the window fucked up she decided once more and then confronted another truism her cursing was thoughtout and artificial words without the necessary gutfelt emotion the telephone shrilled at six oclock it was willsher janet had to force the excitement befitting the announcement that john sheridan was a free man using words like wonderful and fantastic and agreed to be ready when the limousine arrived in an hours time al hart was the escort once again he was unshaven and haggard and wore denim fatigues and janet knew he had somehow been involved as soon as she got into the car hart said it was a cakewalk we annihilated them janet thought how easily baxeter had been prepared to shoot the group of innocent men whod almost come unexpectedly upon them she said what were the casualties we lost ten men maybe twentyfive wounded disclosed the cia man none captured though that would have been the disaster ten menprobably with wives and kidswho this time yesterday had been alive janet reflected she said so its being regarded as a success the stubbled man grinned at her across the car theres already been a congratulatory telephone calland a followup cablefrom the president what do you think janet wishedas shed wished all too oftenthat she knew what to think she said so hows john i only saw him briefly a few minutes said hart guardedly he looked ok to me bewildered not quite able to grasp what was happening but basically ok i hope to christ youre right said janet how many more disappointments could there possibly be at akrotiri hart actually had to get from the car to complete the necessary formalities an armed escort entered the limousine next to the driver to take them through the military complex the soldier pointed out the infirmary buildings when they were still some way off and hart came forward eagerly in his seat his leg began pumping up and down a nervous mannerism there must have been the sort of warning of their approach that there had been when janet had made her entry into the american embassy a week a month an eon ago because professor robards emerged immediately from the hospital entrance when the car stopped janet had expected the psychologist to be wearing a white coat and maybe carrying some tool of his trade whatever a tool of his trade was instead he had on the same crumpled jacket and check shirt of their previous encounter janet wondered if the man bathed how is he janet demanded robards smiled better than i expected i want a day or two to be surethe damned press conference can waitbut hes better than i expected him to be janet was conscious of a stir within her which she put down as relief was it enough she asked herself she said thats good im very glad disappointed in herself as she spoke from the emptiness of her voice she could have been speaking about a casual acquaintance robards didnt notice he said its more than good its astonishing your fiance is one hell of a tough guy mentally as well as physically my fiance thought janet why didnt she feel any longer that john sheridan was her fiance she said i can see him right away hes insisting on it said robards smiling again is there anything i should say shouldnt say robards made a sharp dismissive gesture with his head dont hold back on anything if you feel like saying something say it hes quite tense coiledup hed recognize in a moment any sort of hesitation be unsettled by it janet walked with the psychologist through gleaming polished corridors conscious of the mans crepesoled shoes squeaking over the tiles she expected the hospital smell of disinfectant and formaldehyde but it wasnt present and then she remembered it was not physical injury that was treated in this wing having posed the question she was unsure what she was going to say john sheridan was in a singlebedded side ward an allglass cubicle where he was always visible to the nurses from their central control desk area there were three nurses at the desk and another was leaving sheridans room as they approached through the glass janet could see sheridan staring directly ahead eyes unfocused his hair remained as thick as it had always been but it was almost completely white now his cheeks were sunken and emaciated and his eyes were blinking both thin hands were outstretched without movement on top of the sheet and the veins were corded black across their backs are you coming in with me asked janet suddenly needing support do you want me to i dont no perhaps not she stumbled awkwardly it would probably be better just the two of you yes but if you want no ill be at the desk all you need to do is call yes janet accepted so what the hell was she going to say good luck encouraged robards janet wished he hadnt said it she stopped in the frame of the doorway looking in for a few brief moments he did not appear to see her and then recognition came into his eyes and his face filled with happiness hello he said hello my darling his voice was thin and uneven hello said janet it sounded vacuous and inadequate which it was go on in she urged herself go in go in she did at last hesitantly her feet sliding one after the other over the polished floor janet got to the bedside and smiled down and when he smiled back she was shocked to see that some of his teeth were missing she didnt know if shed kept her reaction from showing she reached tentatively out and he stretched his hand up to hers his skin felt strange like paper an old persons hand she thought kiss him she had to kiss him janet started to lean forward but sheridan twitched back turning his head away no he said why not not clean he mumbled not clean yet what do you mean not clean havent washed not properly for a long time said sheridan they bathed me this morning but theres some skin infection from the dirt i hate dirt he always had thought janet remembering the fastidious apartment concentrating she saw there was filth ingrained in the creases on his hands and beneath his fingernails his chalkwhite face was patched with pink and there were occasional grazes where the shaver had snagged she said i want to kiss you no the voice was tremulous tears close sheridan said its nothing serious the infection they say itll clear up in days still with her hand in his janet managed to pull a chair closer to the bed to sit down as close as this she could smell at last the disinfectant or whatever they were treating him with she said its good to see you my darling vacuous and inadequate she thought again the doctor robards he told me what youve done if only you knew what id done my darling janet thought she said i had to get you out i never thought it would happen said sheridan not really i refused to give in wouldnt give in because if i had the bastards would have won but deep down i never thought i was going to get out alive did they hurt you badly asked janet at once she regretted the question dont hold back on anything she recalled sheridan nodded in the beginning they wanted to break me make me beg he pulled his lips back an ugly expression lost some teeth i think they bruised my kidneys too peed a lot of blood but its stopped now robards said theyd check for permanent damage they didnt maim me threatened to cut fingers off but they didnt poor darling my poor darling janet covered the bony fragile hand with both of hers frightened against hurting him if she squeezed too hard it was you said sheridan confusingly thats how i resisted them thinking of you although as time went on i began to believe id never get out i still kept thinking of you knowing that youd be waiting thats why i begged in the end didnt mean anything and it stopped me being beaten reduced the risk of my not getting back to you dont my love please dont said janet begging herself sheridan was a blurred outline through her tears it was exactly how robards had predicted he would hang on she remembered its all right assured sheridan their roles reversed it doesnt upset me to talk about it they didnt really win just thought they did so im not ashamed or anything silly like that i dont think youve got anything at all to be ashamed of my darling said janet with feeling we should have been married by now i thought about that too janet swallowed so did i have we got the house she nodded all waiting i planned things disclosed sheridan thats how i kept my sanity thinking about all the pictures and plans you sent and imagining how wed fix it up the man smiled almost embarrassed every room carpets drapes stuff in the kitchen things like that but it was only a game for me a way of staying sane we neednt do any of it of course well fix it up however you want said janet how could she make a promise like that i want so much to get back he said his lips began to tremble and momentarily he had to stop talking clamping them shut against a collapse to get back where things are familiar where im sure dont want to be unsure again he picked up sheridan moved one of his hands to cover hers remember what i said a long time ago about never going away again janet nodded once more unspeaking this time i really mean it promised the man never again ever good she said was that the best she could manage ive got to stay here a couple of days for tests robards told me but after that we can go home cant we he asked with sudden urgency back home to washington yes agreed janet feeling the pressure of his dependence we can go back home come and see me every day sheridan pressed further i want to know youre around im around said janet and of course ill come every day robards was waiting where hed promised to be in the desk area he smiled as janet emerged and said well janet was unsure how to answer she said hes very thin a couple of weeks from now with the proper care and diet hell be a different man guaranteed the psychologist buoyantly how did he seem apart from that nervous said janet but not unstable no she agreed he certainly didnt seem unstable he said it didnt hurt to talk about it thats the most important thing seized robards weve got to get it all out i dont want anything left unsaid which is going to stay inside his head and fester will two or three days be sufficient for you to achieve that what was she trying to delay janet asked herself here certainly assured robards well carry on of course when we get back to washington of course accepted janet i wasnt thinking willshers here announced the psychologist he wants to see you the cia official rose politely as janet entered the visitors room and waited until she sat down the man didnt smile he seems ok said janet yes said willsher were very relieved so am i said janet it had been automatic to say it the words came without thought hart said thered been congratulations from the president the outcry is what we predicted it would be but washington is regarding it as an unqualified success said willsher which is what i want to talk to you about me robards wont let us make john available to the media for a couple of days but theres a clamor for access said willsher we want you to hold the first press conference by yourself by myself inconceivably her mind blocked by other things janet had forgotten the media interest she had been largely instrumental in cultivating youve done pretty well in the past reminded willsher pointedly what more is there to say she asked wearily which is what i want to talk to you about most of all said willsher the discovery of johns whereabouts planning of the incursion everything like that has got to remain entirely a cia operation you werent involved understood janet blinked at the demand if you like she said badly we do like said willsher forcefully who you humped to get what you wanted remains unsaid as far as were concerned who i what lady said willsher weary himself now you surely dont think that we havent known whats been going on do you weve had you and baxeter under wraps from the first time you jumped into the sack together weve had a wire in your hotel bedroom for weeks heard every sigh and groan like i said thats your business it worked oh my god exclaimed janet coming forward with her head in her hands it remains unsaid repeated willsher john will never know but why didnt you groped janet through her hands didnt we what confront baxeter and demand cooperation because we wouldnt have got it would we said willsher as if he were explaining a simple lesson to a dull child baxeter was conning you and had to imagine he was conning us too hed have backed off if wed confronted him and wed have lost the opportunity to get john we just didnt see the curve until it was almost too late but we managed to minimize it everyone got their share janet didnt understand the last remark what share had she got out of any of it she straightened with difficulty and said i dont know if i can do it oh yes you can said willsher coming forward himself so that their heads were quite close weve got a success like i told you and its going to end up a success all the way down the line or else anticipated janet im not in the business of threats said willsher for the moment im in the business of writing happyeverafter love stories you go before the press by yourself and you go before the press with john before you fly back to america and its going to be violin music and roses and everyone back home is going to get a lump in their throats and know an international violation was justified and think what a great and free country ours is whatever you personally decide is going to happen between the two of you once you get there and the press isnt looking is entirely a matter for you for the moment what happens is entirely a matter for us just like that said janet trying successfully to match the cynicism no not just like that offered willsher the court case is still outstanding and you stand a chance of being trashed if the prosecution cant come up with that arab engineer or get the cafe people to remember what happened yes agreed janet doubtfully we know where haseeb is disclosed willsher were going to make sure that zarpas does too and the cafe owner is going to recover his memory by being threatened whatever it takes nothing is going to tarnish this not a detail overlooked said janet not a one said willsher confidently satisfied demanded janet her control wavering are you satisfied with what youve done willsher was quite unmoved by janets outrage of course im satisfied he said it all worked out didnt it you wouldnt believe how unusual it is for everything to turn out as completely as it has this time but what about me your problem ms stone your problem said the man you made it one after all l ater when janet watched a recording of the solitary press conference it was difficult for her to believe that she was the person smiling the smiles and saying the words a selfeffacing modest woman refusing to accord herself any special attributes what special attributes did she have for cods sake or make any particular claims she took hardly any recollection at all from the conference room itself a smoky jostled yelling chamber where she confronted more journalists and television cameras than ever before and subjected herself to an inquisition that went on for more than two hours at the end her voice croaked with overuse and her eyes watered from the tobacco sting she talked of her ecstatic delight at john being freed his apparent fortitude was staggering he was suffering some deprivation but there were no indications of permanent physical or mental harm yes he had been tortured but not seriously yes she had always known that one day he would be freed no shed never despaired yes she looked eagerly forward to their time together now no they had not yet fixed a date for the delayed wedding yes of course it was something they would have to arrange but ensuring john was fully recovered was the first priority no she did not know the details which had enabled the incursion force to go into lebanon and get him out yes she knew of the international furor yes she thought the invasion was justified because the country itself appeared willing to allow gangsterism and terrorism to continue unchecked yes she worried desperately about other hostages still detained whose predicament might be worsened by what had happened but hoped it would act as a warning to the gangs and groups holding these remaining hostages that they were vulnerable and lead to other early releases yes she welcomed the decision and strength of america which she sincerely thanked in taking the decision to mount the rescue no she did not regret what she had attempted nor the difficulties she had personally experienced in coming here and doing what shed done yes a pause here because she could not help it she had occasionally behaved stupidly and had been lucky to escape unscathed but yes she would do it all again if the outcome were the same as it was today after the conference janet agreed to separate individual television interviews with the four major american networks and then the english and the french and the german until at the end she was parroting her replies dulleyed and dulleared scarcely waiting for the predictable questions to be posed before going into her prepared and rehearsed and by now practically cliched answer she slumped in the back of the us embassy car taking her back to the hotel limp and wrung out her mind hardly capable of sustaining a single thought and certainly not a continuous contemplation incredibly there were still more cameramen and journalists at the churchill janet pushed through them refusing another questioning session careless of the photographs being taken as she shuffled into the elevator to go up to her room there were callback messages from her parents and partington and zarpas janet let herself drop backwards on to the bed literally prostrated by the ordeal she had undergone relegating everything to the following day the exhaustion from not sleeping at all the previous night overtook her but janet did not lapse completely into sleep it was a suspension halfway between sleep and wakeful ness a pleasantly lightheaded sensation she wondered if this were what it was like to be a drug addict after a fix suspended beyond the need to reason or worry or think wrapped in the softest thickest most protective cotton wool everything had happened to her so nothing else could not any more no more hurt to feel no more pain not more bruising safe like shed always wanted to be the telephone rang distantly but she ignored it it stopped and rang again at once stopped and rang again stopped and rang again and then again worming its way into her semiconsciousness she lifted it at last without identifying herself waiting for the caller to speak i want to come up no we have to talk no you know we have to talk i said no please janet couldnt remember his pleading before she remembered something else though we just didnt see the curve until it was almost too late everyone got their share what about you know what about she had to know completely where let me come up weve had a wire in your hotel bedroom for weeks heard every sigh and groan no somewhere else you choose yes thought janet she had to choose at last is your car here yes ill use the emergency exit did willsher and his men know about her use of the fire escape stairs wondered janet as she pushed against the heavy locking bar and began to descend the stone steps what willsher knewwhat anyone knewdidnt matter any more baxeter must have moved the volkswagen because it was directly opposite the door through which she emerged as she approached he leaned across as she always thought of him as doing and thrust the door open for her janet sat with her back partially against the door determined to look directly at him do you want to drive around he said i dont mind it might be best i said i didnt mind baxeter started the car and ground the gears like he normally did and janet thought why cant i feel like i should feel why cant i hate the bastard instead of feeling like i do about him he took the road towards the mountains the mountains where theyd first realized what was happening between them and janet recognized it at once unthinking or intentional wanting to unsettle him janet said the americans know what about us everything willsher told me today baxeter drove for several moments without responding then he said shit that fits well enough a lot of what happened everything worked out as it was planned baxeter insisted almost defiantly you got john back the psychologist thinks hes going to be ok thats good im waiting said janet they were on the central plain now in heavy darkness away from any street or village lights baxeter coasted the car into the side of the road but didnt look at her when he stopped he said simply it was an exchange the twelve extra men despite the darkness she was aware of his nodding baxeter said you know what its like in beirut faction fighting faction gang fighting gang the shia group holding john were warring with a group holding twelve of our people people we had to get safely back israel always gets its people back you know that entebbe remembered janet she said what was the deal we got our soldiers the shias got americans delivered up to them on a plate i cant believe you did that said janet incredulous why not werent these peopleall of themcapable of anything your arrival all the publicity was the way to do it the idea was to leak information sufficiently accurate to persuade the americans to go at a time and on a day when they would be expected in return we got our hostages you knowingly set the americans up appeared to qualified baxeter half an hour before the americans landed we broadcast as supposed shias exchanging last minute information on the wavelength we knew the americans were monitoring so they were warned well in advance it was really the shias who got ambushed janet was staggered by the matteroffact cynicism everyone got their share she thought once more john said janet in abrupt awareness there was no need under that arrangement with the shias for john to be actually gotten out baxeter looked at her at last it was difficult for her properly to discern his features the americans had to be successful to mitigate any bad feeling between us if they discovered what was really happening which you tell me they have if the americans hadnt reached kantari youd have got john out baxeter nodded again but it wasnt necessary the american assault was brilliant they did it if youd had to rescue john he would have been handed over at the embassy where we were in beirut on the hill at yarzy persisted janet in growing comprehension yes baxeter confirmed but not by a group of israelis no thats why i was allowed along janet said you didnt agree to my coming you needed me if the american assault didnt work it was an insurance the israeli conceded oh you are janet said you are a bastard everything had to be covered baxeter said at last janet thought the complete ugly nasty opportunistic truth at last willsher said you conned me reflected janet distantly i never guessed how completely her voice becoming harder she demanded how much did you laugh at me how much did everyone laugh at me no one laughed at you baxeter insisted it wasnt like that i deserve to be laughed at janet said reflective again i must have been the best comedy act in years i havent liedi havent connedabout one thing baxeter said there wouldnt be any advantage left for you now would there she accepted bitterly stay baxeter said no janet said at once baxeter held his hands out another pleading gesture ok he said go to america be with john for a while but youll come back we both know youll come back no she said again where did the determinationa determination she didnt feelcome from baxeter did not speak for a long time then he said dont you love me that isnt it thats all it can be all it needs to be thats making it too simple john more then i wont answer that you love me he shouted yes how could she say that admit the truth and feel nothing then why i dont need that not a feeling of love i need to feel safe with john i feel safe i always have i could never feel safe with you that doesnt make sense it doesnt have to not to you all it has to do is make sense to me youll come back he said again i know youll come back j anet visited sheridan every day as shed promised and was amazed at his visible improvement by the time of their joint press conference the gauntness had gone from his face and hed overcome the tendency to lose concentration turning inwardly upon himself the media gathering was still strictly controlled however sheridan gave only a brief description of the brutality during his imprisonment refusing to elaborate too much because of the distress it might cause relatives and friends of hostages still held in lebanon the focus anyway was upon them both all the questions about their hopes and their marriage that had been put to janet were repeated and for over an hour they strolled in the embassy grounds hand in hand and arm in arm and embracing for the benefit of the camermen they were driven directly from the embassy to the airport on the plane a curtained alcove had been arranged in the first class section to give them some privacy the steward offered champagne even before takeoff and they accepted heres to us toasted sheridan and janet replied heres to us no more upsets promised sheridan as the plane climbed banked over the island then set its course from now on its just us never apart were going to be so happy darling i know we are said janet so happy it had been naive of her to have expected baxeter to attend the press conference but shed hoped he would shed wanted very much to see him just once more thats all though just once more she wouldnt come back although she might want to she definitely wouldnt come back
