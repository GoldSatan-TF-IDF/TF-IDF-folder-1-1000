grave peril by jim butcher chapter one there are reasons i hate to drive fast for one the blue beetle the mismatched volkswagen bug that i putter around in rattles and groans dangerously at anything above sixty miles an hour for another i dont get along so well with technology anything manufactured after about world war ii seems to be susceptible to abrupt malfunction when i get close to it as a rule when i drive i drive very carefully and sensibly tonight was an exception to the rule the beetles tires screeched in protest as we rounded a corner clearly against the no left turn sign posted there the old car growled gamely as though it sensed what was at stake and continued its valiant puttering moaning and rattling as we zoomed down the street can we go any faster michael drawled it wasnt a complaint it was just a question calmly voiced only if the wind gets behind us or we start going down a hill i said how far to the hospital the big man shrugged his shoulders and shook his head he had that kind of saltandpepper hair dark against silver that some men seem lucky enough to inherit though his beard was still a solid color of dark brown almost black there were worry and laugh lines at the corners of his leathery face his broad lined hands rested on his knees which were scrunched up due to the dashboard i dont know for certain he answered me two miles i squinted out the beetles window at the fading light the sun is almost down i hope were not too late were doing all we can michael assured me if god wills it well be there in time are you sure of your his mouth twisted with distaste source bob is annoying but rarely wrong i answered jamming on the brakes and dodging around a garbage truck if he said the ghost would be there it will be there lord be with us michael said and crossed himself i felt a stirring of something powerful placid energy around himthe power of faith harry theres something ive been meaning to talk to you about dont ask me to mass again i told him uncomfortable you know im just going to say no someone in a red taurus cut me off and i had to swerve around him into the turn lane and then ahead of him again a couple of the beetles wheels lifted off the ground jerk i howled out the drivers window that doesnt preclude asking michael asked but no i wanted to know when you were going to marry miss rodriguez hells bells michael i scowled you and i have been chasing all over town for the past two weeks going up against every ghost and spirit that has all of a sudden reared its ugly head we still dont know whats causing the spirit world to go postal i know that harry but at the moment i interrupted were going after a nasty old biddy at cook county who could kill us if we arent focused and youre asking me about my love life michael frowned at me youre sleeping with her arent you he said not often enough i growled and shifted lanes swerving around a passenger bus the knight sighed do you love her he asked michael i said give me a break where do you get off asking questions like that do you love her he pressed im trying to drive here harry he asked smiling do you love the girl or dont you it isnt a difficult question speaks the expert i grumbled i went past a blueandwhite at about twenty miles an hour over the speed limit and saw the police officer behind the wheel blink and spill his coffee as he saw me go past i checked my rearview mirror and saw the blue bulbs on the police car whirl to life dammit that tears it the cops are going to be coming in right after us dont worry about them michael assured me just answer the question i flashed michael a glance he watched me his face broad and honest his jaw strong and his grey eyes flashing his hair was cropped close marinelength on top but he sported a short warriors beard which he kept clipped close to his face i suppose so i said after a second yeah then you dont mind saying it saying what i stalled harry michael scolded holding on as we bounced through a dip in the street dont be a child about this if you love the woman say so why i demanded you havent told her have you youve never said it i glared at him so what if i havent she knows whats the big deal harry dresden he said you of all people should know the power of words look she knows i said tapping the brakes and then flattening the accelerator again i got her a card a card michael asked a hallmark he sighed let me hear you say the words what say the words he demanded if you love the woman why cant you say so i dont just go around saying that to people michael stars and sky thats i just couldnt all right you dont love her michael said i see you know thats not say it harry if it will get you off my back i said and gave the beetle every ounce of gas that i could i could see the police in traffic somewhere behind me all right i flashed michael a ferocious wizardly scowl and snarled i love her there hows that michael beamed you see thats the only thing that stands between you two youre not the kind of person who says what they feel or who is very introspective harry sometimes you just need to look into the mirror and see whats there i dont like mirrors i grumbled regardless you needed to realize that you do love the woman after elaine i thought you might isolate yourself too much and never i felt a sudden flash of anger and vehemence i dont talk about elaine michael ever if you cant live with that get the hell out of my car and let me work on my own michael frowned at me probably more for my choice of words than anything else im talking about susan harry if you love her you should marry her im a wizard i dont have time to be married im a knight michael responded and i have the time its worth it youre alone too much its starting to show i scowled at him again what does that mean youre tense grumpy and youre isolating yourself more all the time you need to keep up human contact harry it would be so easy for you to start down a darker path michael i snapped i dont need a lecture i dont need the conversion speech again i dont need the cast aside your evil powers before they consume you speech again what i need is for you to back me up while i go take care of this thing cook county hospital loomed into sight and i made an illegal uturn to get the blue beetle up into the emergency entrance lane michael unbuckled his seat belt even before the car had come to a stop and reached into the back seat to draw an enormous sword fully five feet long in its black scabbard from the backseat he exited the car and buckled on the sword then he reached back in for a white cloak with a red cross upon the left breast which he tossed over his shoulders in a practiced motion he clasped it with another cross this one of silver at his throat it clashed with his flannel workmans shirt blue jeans and steeltoed work boots cant you leave the cloak off at least i complained i opened the door and unfolded myself from the beetles drivers seat stretching my long legs and reached into the backseat to recover my own equipmentmy new wizards staff and blasting rod each of them freshly carved and still a little green around the edges michael looked up at me wounded the cloak is as much a part of what i do as the sword harry besides its no more ridiculous than that coat you wear i looked down at my black leather duster the one with the large mantle that fell around my shoulders and spread out as it billowed in a most heavy and satisfactory fashion around my legs my own black jeans and dark western shirt were a ton and a half more stylish than michaels costume whats wrong with it it belongs on the set of el dorado michael said are you ready i shot him a withering glance to which he turned the other cheek with a smile and we headed toward the door i could hear police sirens closing in behind us maybe a block or two away this is going to be close then we best hurry he cast the white cloak back from his right arm and put his hand on the hilt of the great broadsword then he bowed his head crossed himself and murmured merciful father guide us and protect us as we go to do battle with the darkness once more there was that thrum of energy around him like the vibrations of music heard through a thick wall i shook my head and fetched a leather sack about the size of my palm from the pocket of my duster i had to juggle staff blasting rod and sack for a moment and wound up with the staff in my left hand as was proper the rod in my right and the sack dangling from my teeth the sun is down i grated out lets move it and we broke into a run knight and wizard through the emergency entrance of cook county hospital we drew no small amount of stares as we entered my duster billowing out in a black cloud behind me michaels white cloak spreading like the wings of the avenging angel whose namesake he was we pelted inside and slid to a halt at the first intersection of cool sterile bustling hallways i grabbed the arm of the first orderly i saw he blinked and then gawked at me from the tips of my western boots to the dark hair atop my head he glanced at my staff and rod rather nervously and at the silver pentacle amulet dangling at my breast and gulped then he looked at michael tall and broad his expression utterly serene at odds with the white cloak and the broadsword at his hip he took a nervous step back mmmay i help you i speared him into place with my most ferocious darkeyed smile and said between teeth clenched on the leather sack hi could you tell us where the nursery is chapter two we took the fire stairs michael knows how technology reacts to me and the last thing either of us wanted was to be trapped in a broken elevator while innocent lives were snuffed out michael led the way one hand on the rail one on the hilt of his sword his legs churning steadily i followed him huffing and puffing michael paused by the door and looked back at me white cloak swirling around his calves it took me a couple of seconds to come gasping up behind him ready he asked me hrkghngh i answered and nodded still clenching my leather sack in my teeth and fumbled a white candle from my duster pocket along with a box of matches i had to set my rod and staff aside to light the candle michael wrinkled his nose at the smell of smoke and pushed open the door candle in one hand rod and staff in the other i followed my eyes flicking from my surroundings to the candles flame and back all i could see was more hospital clean walls clean halls lots of tile and fluorescent lights the long luminescent tubes flickered feebly as though they had all gone stale at once and the hall was only dimly lit long shadows stretched out from a wheelchair parked to the side of one door and gathered beneath a row of uncomfortablelooking plastic chairs at an intersection of hallways the fourth floor was a graveyard bottomofthewell silent there wasnt a flicker of sound from a television or radio no intercoms buzzed no air conditioning whirred nothing we walked down a long hall our steps sounding out clearly despite an effort to remain quiet a sign on the wall decorated with a brightly colored plastic clown read nurserymaternity and pointed down another hall i stepped past michael and looked down that hallway it ended at a pair of swinging doors this hallway too was quiet the nurses station stood empty the lights werent just flickering herethey were altogether gone it was entirely dark shadows and uncertain shapes loomed everywhere i took a step forward past michael and as i did the flame of my candle burned down to a cold clear pinpoint of blue light i spat the sack out of my mouth and fumbled it into my pocket michael i said my voice strangled to hushed urgency its here i turned my body so that he could see the light his eyes flicked down to the candle and then back up to the darkness beyond faith harry then he reached to his side with his broad right hand and slowly silently drew amoracchius from its sheath i found it a tad more encouraging than his words the great blades polished steel gave off a lambent glow as michael stepped forward to stand beside me in the darkness and the air fairly thrummed with its powermichaels own faith amplified a thousandfold where are the nurses he asked me in a hoarse whisper spooked off maybe i answered as quietly or maybe some sort of glamour at least theyre out of the way i glanced at the sword and at the long slender spike of metal set into its cross guard perhaps it was only my imagination but i thought i could see flecks of red still upon it probably rust i reasoned sure rust i set the candle down upon the floor where it continued to burn pinpointclear indicating a spiritual presence a big one bob hadnt been lying when hed said that the ghost of agatha hagglethorn was no twobit shade stay back i told michael give me a minute if what the spirit told you is correct this creature is dangerous michael replied let me go first it will be safer i nodded toward the glowing blade trust me a ghost would feel the sword coming before you even got to the door let me see what i can do first if i can dust the spook this whole contest is over before it begins i didnt wait for michael to answer me instead i took my blasting rod and staff in my left hand and in my right i grasped the pouch i untied the simple knot that held the sack closed and slipped forward into the dark when i reached the swinging doors i pressed one of them slowly opened i remained still for a long moment listening i heard singing a womans voice gentle lovely hush little baby dont say a word mamas gonna buy you a mockingbird i glanced back at michael and then slipped inside the door into total darkness i couldnt seebut im not a wizard for nothing i thought of the pentacle upon my breast over my heart the silver amulet that i had inherited from my mother it was a battered piece of jewelry scarred and dented from uses for which it was never intended but i wore it still the fivesided star within the circle was the symbol of my magic of what i believed in embodying the five forces of the universe working in harmony contained inside of human control i focused on it and slid a little of my will into it and the amulet began to glow with a gentle bluesilver light which spread out before me in a subtle wave showing me the shapes of a fallen chair and a pair of nurses at a desk behind a counter slumped forward over their stations breathing deeply the soothing quiet lullaby continued as i studied the nurses enchanted sleep it was nothing new they were out they werent going anywhere and there was little sense in wasting time or energy in trying to break the spells hold on them the gentle singing droned on and i found myself reaching for the fallen chair with the intention of setting it upright so that i would have a comfortable place to sit down for a little rest i froze and had to remind myself that i would be an idiot to sit down beneath the influence of the unearthly song even for a few moments subtle magic and strong even knowing what to expect i had barely sensed its touch in time i skirted the chair and moved forward into a room filled with dressing hooks and little pastel hospital gowns hung upon them in rows the singing was louder here though it still drifted around the room with a ghostly lack of origin one wall was little more than a sheet of plexiglas and behind it was a room that attempted to look sterile and warm at the same time row upon row of little glass cribs on wheeled stands stood in the room tiny occupants with toysized hospital mittens over their brandnew fingernails and tiny hospital stocking caps over their bald heads were sleeping and dreaming infant dreams walking among them visible in the glow of my wizards light was the source of the singing agatha hagglethorn had not been old when she died she wore a proper highnecked shirt as was appropriate to a lady of her station in nineteenthcentury chicago and a long dark nononsense skirt i could see through her to the little crib behind her but other than that she seemed solid real her face was pretty in a strained bony sort of way and she had her right hand folded over the stump at the end of her left wrist if that mockingbird dont sing mamas going to buy you she had a captivating singing voice literally she lilted out her song spun energy into the air that lulled listeners into deeper and deeper sleep if she was allowed to continue she could draw both infants and nurses into a sleep from which they would never awaken and the authorities would blame it on carbon monoxide or something a little more comfortably normal than a hostile ghost i crept closer i had enough ghost dust to pin down agatha and a dozen spooks like her and allow michael to dispatch her swiftly with a minimum of mess and fussjust as long as i didnt miss i hunkered down kept the little sack of dust gripped loosely in my right hand and slipped over to the door that led into the roomful of sleeping babies the ghost did not appear to have noticed meghosts arent terribly observant i guess being dead gives you a whole different perspective on life i entered the room and agatha hagglethorns voice rolled over me like a drug making me blink and shudder i had to keep focused my thoughts on the cool power of my magic flowing through my pentacle and coming out in its spectral light if that diamond ring dont shine i licked my lips and watched the ghost as it stooped over one of the rolling cradles she smiled lovingkindness in her eyes and breathed out her song over the baby the infant shuddered out a tiny breath eyes closed in sleep and did not inhale hush little baby time had run out in a perfect world i would have simply dumped the dust onto the ghost but its not a perfect world ghosts dont have to play by the rules of reality and until they acknowledge that youre there its tough very very tough to affect them at all confrontation is the only way and even then knowing the shades identity and speaking its name aloud is the only sure way to make it face you and better and better most spirits cant hear just anyoneit takes magic to make a direct call to the hereafter i rose fully to my feet bag gripped in my hand and shouted forcing my will into my voice agatha hagglethorn the spirit started as though a distant voice had come to her and turned toward me her eyes widened the song abruptly fell silent who are you she said what are you doing in my nursery i struggled to keep the details bob had told me about the ghost straight this isnt your nursery agatha hagglethorn its more than a hundred years since you died you arent real you are a ghost and you are dead the spirit drew itself up with a sort of cold highsociety haughtiness i might have known benson sent you didnt he benson is always doing something cruel and petty like this then calling me a madwoman a madwoman he wants to take my child away benson hagglethorn is long dead agatha hagglethorn i responded and gathered back my right hand to throw as is your child as are you these little ones are not yours to sing to or bear away i steeled myself to throw began to bring my arm forward the spirit looked at me with an expression of lost lonely confusion this was the hard part about dealing with really substantial dangerous ghosts they were almost human they appeared to be able to feel emotion to have some degree of selfawareness ghosts arent alive not reallytheyre a footprint in stone a fossilized skeleton they are shaped like the original but they arent it but im a sucker for a lady in distress i always have been its a weak point in my character a streak of chivalry a mile wide and twice as deep i saw the hurt and the loneliness on the ghostagathas face and felt it strike a sympathetic chord in me i let my arm go still again perhaps if i was lucky i could talk her away ghosts are like that confront them with the reality of their situation and they dissolve im sorry agatha i said but you arent who you think you are youre a ghost a reflection the true agatha hagglethorn died more than a century ago nno she said her voice shaking thats not true it is true i said she died on the same night as her husband and child no the spirit moaned her eyes closing no no no no i dont want to hear this she started singing to herself again low and desperateno enchantment to it this time no unconscious act of destruction but the infant girl still hadnt inhaled and her lips were turning blue listen to me agatha i said forcing more of my will into my voice lacing it with magic so that the ghost could hear me i know about you you died you remember your husband beat you you were terrified that he would beat your daughter and when she started crying you covered her mouth with your hand i felt like such a bastard to be going over the womans past so coldly ghost or not the pain on her face was real i didnt agatha wailed i didnt hurt her you didnt mean to hurt her i said drawing on the information bob had provided but he was drunk and you were terrified and when you looked down she was gone isnt that right i licked my lips and looked at the infant girl again if i didnt get this done quickly shed die it was eerie how still she was like a little rubber doll something some spark of memory caught a flame in the ghosts eyes i remember she hissed the axe the axe the axe the axe the proportions of the ghosts face changed stretched became more bony more slender i took my axe my axe my axe and gave my benson twenty whacks the spirit grew expanding and a ghostly wind rustled through the room emanating from the ghost and rife with the smell of iron and blood oh crap i muttered and gathered myself to make a dash for the girl my angel gone screamed the ghost benson gone and then the hand the hand that killed them both she lifted the stump of her arm into the air gone gone gone she threw back her head and screamed and it came out as a deafening bestial roar that rattled the nursery walls i threw myself forward toward the breathless child and as i did the rest of the infants burst into terrified wails i reached the child and smacked her little upturned baby butt she blinked her eyes open in sudden shock drew in a breath and joined the rest of her nursery mates in crying no agatha screamed no no no hell hear you hell hear you the stump of her left arm flashed out toward me and i felt the impact both against my body and against my soul as though she had driven a chip of ice deep into my chest the power of the blow flung me back against a wall like a toy hard enough to send my staff and rod clattering to the floor by some miracle or other i kept hold of my sack of ghost dust but my head vibrated like a hammerstruck bell and cold shivers wracked my body in rapid succession michael i wheezed as loudly as i could but already i could hear doors being thrown open heavy work boots pounding toward me i struggled to my feet and shook my head to clear it the wind rose to gale force sending cribs skittering around the room on their little wheels tearing at my eyes so that i had to shield them with one hand dammit the dust would be useless in such a gale hush little baby hush little baby hush little baby agathas ghost bowed over the infant girls cradle again and thrust the stump of her left arm down and into the mouth of the child her translucent flesh passing seamlessly into the infants skin the child jerked and stopped breathing though she still attempted to cry i shouted a wordless challenge and charged the spirit if i could not cast the dust upon her from across the room i could thrust the leather bag into her ghostly flesh and pin her into place from withinagonizing but undoubtedly effective agathas head whipped toward me as i came and she jerked away from the child with a snarl her hair had come free in the gale and spread about her face in a ferocious mane well suited to the feral features that had replaced her gentle expression she drew back her left hand and there suddenly appeared floating just above the stump a short heavyheaded hatchet she shrieked and brought the hatched down at me ghostly steel chimed on true iron and amoracchiuss light flared brightwhite michael slid his feet into position on the floor gritting his teeth with effort and kept the spiritweapon from touching my flesh dresden he called the dust i fought my way forward through the wind shoved my fist into agathas weaponarm and shook loose some of the ghost dust from the leather sack upon contact with her immaterial flesh the ghost dust flared into blazing motes of scarlet light agatha screamed and jerked back but her arm remained in place as firmly as if it had been set in concrete benson agatha shrieked benson hush little baby and then she simply tore herself away from her arm at the shoulder leaving her spirit flesh behind and vanished the arm and hatchet collapsed to the floor in a sudden spatter of clear semifluid gelatin the remnants of spiritflesh when the spirit was gone ectoplasm that would swiftly evaporate the gale died though the lights continued to flicker my bluewhite wizard light and the lambent glow of michaels sword were the only reliable sources of illumination in the room my ears shrieked with the sudden lack of sound though the dozen or so babies in their cribs continued a chorus of steady terrified little wails are the children all right michael asked where did it go i think so the ghost must have crossed over i guessed she knew shed had it michael turned in a slow circle sword still held at the ready its gone then i shook my head scanning the room i dont think so i responded and bent over the crib of the infant girl who had nearly been smothered the name on her wrist bracelet read alison ann summers i stroked her little cheek and she turned her mouth toward my finger baby lips fastening on my fingertip cries dying take your finger out of her mouth michael chided its dirty what happens now ill ward the room i said and then well get out of here before the police show up and arres alison ann jerked and stopped breathing her tiny arms and legs stiffened i felt something cold pass over her heard the distant drone of mad lullaby hush little baby michael i cried shes still here the ghost shes reaching here from the nevernever christ preserve michael swore harry we have to step over my heart skipped a beat at the very thought no i said no way this is a big spook michael im not going to go onto her home ground naked and offer to go two out of three we dont have a choice michael snapped look i looked the infants were falling silent one by one little cries abruptly smothered in midbreath hush little baby michael shell tear us apart and even if she doesnt my godmother will michael shook his head scowling no by god i wont let that happen he turned his gaze on me piercing and neither will you harry dresden there is too much good in your heart to let these children die i returned his stare uncertain michael had insisted that i look him in the eyes on our first meeting when a wizard looks you in the eyes its serious he can see inside of you all of your dark secrets and hidden fears of your souland you see his in return michaels soul had made me weep i wished that my soul would look like his had to me but i was pretty damned sure that it didnt silence fell all the little babies hushed i closed the sack of ghost dust and put it away in my pocket it wouldnt do me any good in the nevernever i turned toward my fallen rod and staff thrust out my hand and spat ventas servitas the air stirred and then flung staff and rod into my open hands before dying away again all right i said im tearing open a window that will give us five minutes hopefully my godmother wont have time to find me anything beyond that and were going to be dead already or back here in any case you have a good heart harry dresden michael said a fierce grin stretching his mouth he stepped closer to my side god will smile on this choice yeah ask him not to sodom and gomorrah my apartment and well be even michael gave me a disappointed glance i shot him a testy glare he clamped a hand onto my shoulder and held on then i reached out caught hold of reality in my fingertips and with an effort of will and a whispered aparturum tore a hole between this world and the next chapter three even days that culminate in a grand battle against an insane ghost and a trip across the border between this world and the spirit realm usually start out pretty normally this one for example started off with breakfast and then work at the office my office is in a building in midtown chicago its an older building and not in the best of shape especially since there was that problem with the elevator last year i dont care what anyone says that wasnt my fault when a giant scorpion the size of an irish wolfhound is tearing its way through the roof of your elevator car you get real willing to take desperate measures anyway my office is smallone room but on the corner with a couple of windows the sign on the door reads simply harry dresden wizard just inside the door is a table covered with pamphlets with titles like magic and you and why witches dont sink any faster than anyone elsea wizards perspective i wrote most of them i think its important for we practitioners of the art to keep up a good public image anything to avoid another inquisition behind the table is a sink counter and an old coffee machine my desk faces the door and a couple of comfortable chairs sit across from it the air conditioning rattles the ceiling fan squeaks on every revolution and the scent of coffee is soaked into the carpet and the walls i shambled in put coffee on and sorted through the mail while the coffee percolated a thank you letter from the campbells for chasing a spook out of their house junk mail and thank goodness a check from the city for my last batch of work for the chicago pd that had been a nasty case all in all demon summoning human sacrifice black magicthe works i got my coffee and resolved to call michael to offer to split my earnings with himeven though the legwork had been all mine he and amoracchius had come in on the finale id handled the sorcerer hed dealt with the demon and the good guys won the day id turned in my logs and at fifty bucks an hour had netted myself a neat two grand michael would refuse the money he always did but it seemed polite to make the offer especially given how much time wed been spending together recently in an attempt to track down the source of all the ghostly happenings in the city the phone rang before i could pick it up to call michael harry dresden i answered hello there mr dresden said a warm feminine voice i was wondering if i could have a moment of your time i kicked back in my chair and felt a smile spreading over my face why miss rodriguez isnt it arent you that nosy reporter from the arcane that useless rag that publishes stories about witches and ghosts and bigfoot plus elvis she assured me dont forget the king and im syndicated now publications of questionable reputation all over the world carry my column i laughed how are you today susans voice turned wry well my boyfriend stood me up last night but other than that i winced a little yeah i know sorry about that look bob found a tip for me that just couldnt wait ahem she said in her polite professional voice im not calling you to talk about my personal life mr dresden this is a business call i felt my smile returning susan was absolutely one in a million to put up with me oh beg pardon miss rodriguez pray continue well i was thinking that there were rumors of some more ghostly activity in the old town last night i thought you might be willing to share a few details with the arcane mmmm that might not be wholly professional of me i keep my business confidential mr dresden she said i would as soon not resort to desperate measures why miss rodriguez i grinned are you a desperate woman i could almost see the way she arched one eyebrow mr dresden i dont want to threaten you but you must understand that i am well acquainted with a certain young lady of your companyand that i could see to it that things became very awkward between you i see but if i shared the story with you gave me an exclusive mr dresden an exclusive i amended then you might see your way clear to avoiding causing problems for me id even put in a good word with her susan said her voice cheerful then dropping into a lower smokier register who knows you might get lucky i thought about it for a minute the ghost michael and i had nailed last night had been a big bestial thing lurking in the basement of the university of chicago library i didnt have to mention the names of any people involved and while the university wouldnt like it i doubted it would be seriously hurt by appearing in a magazine that most people bought along with every other tabloid in the supermarket checkout lines besides which just the thought of susans caramel skin and soft dark hair under my hands yum thats an offer i can hardly refuse i told her do you have a pen she did and i spent the next ten minutes telling her the details she took them down with a number of sharp concise questions and had the whole story out of me in less time than i would have believed she really was a good reporter i thought it was almost a shame that she was spending her time reporting the supernatural which people had been refusing to believe in for centuries thank you very much mr dresden she said after she squeezed the last drips of information out of me i hope things go well between you and the young lady tonight at your place at nine maybe the young lady would like to discuss the possibilities with me i drawled she let out a throaty laugh maybe she would susan agreed but this is a business call i laughed youre terrible susan you never give up do you never ever she said would you really have been mad at me if i hadnt told you harry she said you stood me up last night without a word i dont usually stand for that kind of treatment from any man if you hadnt had a good story for me i was going to think that you were out horsing around with your friends yeah that michael i chuckled hes a real party animal youre going to have to give me the story on him sometime have you come any closer to working out whats going on with the ghosts did you look into the seasonal angle i sighed closing my eyes no and yes i still cant figure why the ghosts seem to be freaking out all at onceand we havent been able to get any of them to hold still long enough for me to get a good look at them ive got a new recipe to try out tonightmaybe that will do it but bob is sure it isnt a halloweeny kind of problem i mean we didnt have any ghosts last year no we had werewolves different situation entirely i said ive got bob working overtime to keep an eye on the spirit world for any more activity if anything else is about to jump well know it all right she said she hesitated for a moment and then said harry i i waited but when she stalled i asked what i uh i just want to be sure that youre all right i had the distinct impression that she had been going to say something else but i didnt push tired i said a couple of bruises from slipping on some ectoplasm and falling into a card catalog but im fine she laughed that creates a certain image tonight then im looking forward to it she made a pleased little sound with more than a hint of sexuality in it and let that be her goodbye the day went fairly quickly with a bunch of the usual business i whipped up a spell to find a lost wedding ring and turned down a customer who wanted me to put a love spell on his mistress my ad in the yellow pages specifically reads no love potions but for some reason people always think that their case is special i went to the bank referred a caller to a private detective i knew and met with a fledgling pyromancer in an attempt to teach him to stop igniting his cat accidentally i was just closing down the office when i heard someone come out of the elevator and start walking down the hallway toward me the steps were heavy as though from boots and rushed mr dresden asked a young womans voice are you harry dresden yes i said locking the office door but im just leaving maybe we can set up an appointment for tomorrow the footsteps stopped a few feet away from me please mr dresden ive got to talk to you only you can help me i sighed without looking at her shed said the exact words she needed to in order to kick off my protective streak but i could still walk away lots of people got to thinking that magic could dig them out of their troubles once they realized they couldnt escape ill be glad to maam first thing in the morning i locked the door and started to turn away wait she said i felt her step closer to me and she grabbed by hand a tingling writhing sensation shot up my wrist and over my elbow my reaction was immediate and instinctive i threw up a mental shield against the sensation jerked my hand clear of her fingers and took several steps back and away from the young woman my hand and arm still tingled from brushing against the energy of her aura she was a slight girl in a black knit dress black combat boots and hair dyed to a flat black matte the lines of her face were soft and sweet and her skin was pale as chalk around eyes that were sunken shadowed and glittering with alleycat wariness i flexed my fingers and avoiding meeting the girls eyes for more than a fraction of a second youre a practitioner i said quietly she bit her lip and looked away nodding and i need your help they said that you would help me i give lessons to people who want to avoid hurting themselves with uncontrolled talent i said is that what youre after no mr dresden the girl said not exactly why me then what do you want i want your protection she lifted a shaking hand fidgeting with her dark hair and if i dont have it im not sure ill live through the night chapter four i let us both back into the office and flicked on the lights the bulb blew out it does that a lot i sighed and shut the door behind us leaving stripes of golden autumn light pouring through the blinds interweaving with shadows on the floor and walls i drew out a seat in front of my desk for the young woman she blinked at me in confusion for a second before she said oh and sat i walked around the desk leaving my duster on and sat down all right i said if you want my protection i want a few things from you first she pushed back her asphaltcolored hair with one hand and gave me a look of pure calculation then she simply crossed her legs so that the cut of her dress left one pale leg bare to midthigh a subtle motion of her back thrust out her young firm breasts so that their tips pressed visibly against the fabric of course mr dresden im sure we can do business the look she gave me was direct sensual and willing nipple erection on commandnow thats method acting oh she was pretty enough i suppose any adolescent male would have been drooling and hurling himself at her but id seen acts a lot better i rolled my eyes thats not what i meant her sexkitten look faltered it it isnt she frowned at me eyes scanning me again reassessing me is it are you no i said im not gay but im not buying what youre selling you havent even told me your name but youre willing to spread your legs for me no thanks hells bells havent you ever heard of aids herpes her face went white and she pressed her lips together until they were white too all right then she said what do you want from me answers i told her jabbing a finger at her and dont try lying to me it wont do you any good which was only a marginal lie in itself being a wizard doesnt make you a walking lie detector and i wasnt going to try a soulgaze on her to find out if she was sincereit wasnt worth it but another great thing about being a wizard is that people attribute just about anything you do to your vast and unknowable powers granted it only works with those who know enough to believe in wizards but not enough to understand our limitsthe rest of the world the regular people who think magic is just a joke just look at you like someone is going to stuff you into a little white coat any second now she licked her lips a nervous gesture not a sexy one all right she said what do you want to know your name for starters she let out a harsh laugh you think im going to give you that wizard point serious spellslingers like me could do an awful lot with a persons name given by their own lips all right then what do i call you she didnt bother to cover her leg again a rather pretty leg actually with a tattoo of some kind encircling her ankle i tried not to notice lydia she said call me lydia okay lydia youre a practitioner of the art tell me about that it doesnt have anything to do with what i want from you mr dresden she said she swallowed her anger fading please i need your help all right all right i said what kind of help do you need if youre into some kind of gangrelated trouble im going to recommend that you head for the police im not a bodyguard she shivered and hugged herself with her arms no nothing like that its not my body im worried about that made me frown she closed her eyes and drew in a breath i need a talisman she said something to protect me from a hostile spirit that made me sit up and take notice metaphorically speaking with the city flying into spiritual chaos as it was i had no trouble believing that a girl gifted with magical talent might be experiencing some bad phenomena ghosts and spooks are drawn to the magically gifted what kind of spirit her eyes shifted left and right never looking at me i cant really say mr dresden its powerful and it wants to hurt me they they told me you could make something that would keep me safe true in point of fact around my left wrist at that very moment was a talisman made from a dead mans shroud blessed silver and a number of other more difficult to come by ingredients maybe i told her that depends on why youre in danger and why you feel you need protection i ccant tell you that she said her pale face pinched into an expression of worryreal worry the kind that makes you look older uglier the way she hugged herself made her look smaller more frail please i just need your help i sighed and rubbed at one eyebrow with my thumb my first rampant instincts were to give her a cup of hot chocolate put a blanket around her shoulders tell her everything would be all right and strap my talisman onto her wrist i tried to rein those in though down quixote i still knew nothing about her situation or what she needed protection fromfor all i knew she was trying to stave off an avenging angel coming after her in retribution for some act so vile that it stirred the powers that be to take immediate action even vanilla ghosts sometimes come back to haunt someone for a darned good reason look lydia i dont like to get involved in anything without knowing something about whats going on which hadnt slowed me down before i noted unless you can tell me a little bit about your situation convince me that you are in legitimate need of protection i wont be able to help you she bowed her head her asphalt hair falling across her face for a long minute then she drew in a breath and asked do you know what cassandras tears is mr dresden prophetic condition i said the person in question has random seizuresvisions of the future but theyre always couched in terms of conditions that make explanation of the dreams seem unbelievable doctors mistake it for epilepsy in children sometimes and prescribe a bunch of different drugs for it pretty accurate prophecy as it goes but no one ever buys into it some people call it a gift im not one of them she whispered you dont know how horrible it is to see something about to happen and to try to change it only to have no one believe you i studied her for a minute in silence listening to the clock on my wall count down the seconds all right i said you say that you have this gift i guess you want me to believe that one of your visions warned you about an evil spirit coming after you not one she said three three mr dresden i only got one vision when they tried to kill the president i got two for that disaster at nasa and for the earthquake in laos ive never had three before never had something appear so clearly i closed my eyes to think about this again my instincts told me to help the girl smash the bad ghost or whatever and walk off into the sunset if she was indeed afflicted with cassandras tears my actions could do more than save her life my faith could change it for the better on the other hand id been played for a sucker before the girl was obviously a competent actress she had shifted smoothly to the role of willing seductress when she thought i had been asking for sex in payment that she would immediately make that conclusion based on my own fairly neutral statement said something about her all by itself this wasnt a girl who was used to playing things fair and square unless i was grossly misreading her she had bartered sex for goods and services beforeand she was awfully young to be so jaded about the entire matter the entire cassandras tears angle was a perfect scam and people had used it before among the circles of the magically endowed the story required no proof no performance on the part of the person running the scam all she would need would be a smidgen of talent to give her the right aura maybe enough kinetomancy to tilt the dice a little on their way down then she could make up whatever story she wanted about her supposed prophetic gifts put on a littlegirllost act and head straight for the local dummy harry blackstone copperfield dresden i opened my eyes to find her watching me of course she said i could be lying cassandras tears cant be analyzed or observed i could be using it as an excuse to provide a reasonable explanation why you should help a lady in distress thats pretty much whats going through my mind lydia yeah you could just be a smalltime witch who stirred up the wrong demon and is looking for a way out she spread her hands all i can tell you is that im not i know that somethings coming i dont know what and i dont know why or how i just know what i see which is fire she whispered wind i see dark things and a dark war i see my death coming for me out of the spirit world and i see you at the middle of it all youre the beginning the end of it youre the one who can make the path go different ways thats your vision iowa has less corn she turned her face away i see what i see standard carny procedure flatter the ego of the mark draw him in get him good and hooked and fleece him for everything hes got sheesh i thought someone else trying to get something out of me my reputation must be growing still there was no sense in being rude look lydia i think maybe youre just overreacting here why dont we meet again in a couple of days and well see if you still think you need my help she didnt answer me her shoulders just slumped forward and her face went slack with defeat she closed her eyes and i felt a nagging sensation of doubt tug at me i had the uncomfortable impression that she wasnt acting all right she said softly im sorry to have kept you late she got up and started walking toward the door of my office my better judgement propelled me up out of my chair and across the room we reached the door at the same time wait a minute i said i unbound the talisman from my arm feeling the silent pop of energy as the knot came undone then i took her left wrist and turned her hand over to tie the talisman onto her there were pale scars on her armthe vertical kind that run along the big veins the ones you get when youre really serious about killing yourself they were old and faded she must have gotten them when she was what ten years old younger i shuddered and secured the little braid of musty cloth and silver chain about her wrist willing enough energy into it to close the circle once the knot was tied when i finished i touched her forearm lightly i could just feel the talismans power a tingling sensation that hovered a halfinch off of her skin faith magic works best against spirits i said quietly if youre worried get to a church spirits are strongest just after the sun goes down around the witching hour and again just before the sun comes up go to saint mary of the angels its a church at the corner of bloomingdale and wood down by wicker park its huge you cant miss it go around to the delivery door and ring the bell talk to father forthill tell him that michaels friend said that you need a safe place to stay for a while she only stared at me her mouth open tears formed in her eyes you believe me she said you believe me i shrugged uncomfortable maybe maybe not but things have been bad the past few weeks and i would rather not have you on my conscience youd better hurry its going to be sundown soon i pressed some bills into her hand and said take a cab saint mary of the angels father forthill michaels friend sent you thank you she said oh god thank you mr dresden she seized my hand in both of hers and pressed a tearstained kiss to my knuckles her fingers were cold and her lips too hot then she vanished out the door i shut it behind her and shook my head harry you idiot your one decent talisman that would protect you against ghosts and you just gave it away shes probably a plant they probably sent her to you just to get the talisman off you so that they can eat you up the next time you go spoil their fun i glared down at my hand where the warmth of lydias kiss and the dampness of her tears still lingered then i sighed and walked to the cabinet where i kept fifty or sixty spare lightbulbs on hand and replaced the one that had burned out the phone rang i got down off my chair and answered it sourly dresden there was silence and scratchy static on the other end of the line dresden i repeated the silence stretched on and something about it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up there was a quality to it that is difficult to describe like something waiting gloating the static crackled louder and i thought i could hear voices underneath it voices speaking in low cruel tones i glanced at the door after the departed lydia who is this soon whispered a voice soon dresden we will see one another again who is this i repeated feeling a little silly the line went dead i stared at the phone before hanging it up then ran my hand back through my hair a chill crawled neatly down my spine and took up residence somewhere a little lower than my stomach all right then i said my own voice a little too loud in the office thank god that wasnt too creepy or anything the antique radio on the shelf beside the coffee machine hissed and squalled to life and i almost jumped out of my shoes i whirled to face it in a fury hands clenched harry said a voice on the radio hey harry is this thing working i tried to calm my pounding heart and focused enough will on the radio to let my voice carry through yeah bob its me thank the stars bob said you said you wanted to know if i found out anything else ghostly going on yeah yeah go ahead the radio hissed and crackled with staticspiritual interference not physical the radio wasnt set up to receive amfm any more bobs voice was garbled but i could understand it my contact came through cook county hospital tonight someones stirred up agatha hagglethorn this is a bad one harry she is one mean old biddy bob gave me the rundown on agatha hagglethorns grisly and tragic death and her most likely target at the hospital i glanced down at my bare left wrist and abruptly felt naked all right i said im on it thanks bob the radio squalled and went silent and i dashed out the door sundown would come in less than twenty minutes rush hour had been going for a while now and if i wasnt at cook county by the time it got dark all kinds of bad things could happen i flew out the front door the sack of ghost dust heavy in my pocket and all but slammed into michael tall and broad toting a huge athletic bag over his shoulder which i knew would contain nothing but amoracchius and his white cloak michael i burst out how did you get here his honest face split into a wide smile when there is a need he sees to it that i am there wow i said youre kidding no he said his voice earnest then he paused of course youve gotten in touch with me every night for the past two weeks tonight i just thought id save him the trouble of arranging coincidence so i came on over as soon as i got off work he fell into step beside me and we both got into the blue beetlehe got in the red door i got in the white one and we peered out over the grey hood as i pulled the old vw into traffic and that was how we ended up doing battle in the nursery at cook county anyway you see what i mean about a day being fairly normal before it falls all to pieces oh well maybe it hadnt been all that normal as we took off into traffic and i gave the beetle all the gas it could take i got that sinking feeling that my life was about to get hectic again chapter five michael and i plunged through the hole id torn in reality and into the nevernever it felt like moving from a sauna into an airconditioned office except that i didnt feel the change on my skin i felt it in my thoughts and my feelings and in the primitive skincrawling part of me at the base of my brain i stood in a different world than our own the little leather sack of ghost dust in my duster pocket abruptly increased its weight dragging me off balance and to the ground i let out a curse the whole point of the ghost dust was that it was something extrareal that it was heavy and inert and locked spiritual matter into place when it touched it even inside its bag it had become a sudden stress on the nevernever if i opened the bag here in the world of spirit it might tear a hole in the floor id have to be careful i grunted with effort and pulled the little pouch out of my pocket it felt like it weighed thirty or forty pounds michael frowned down at my hands you know i never really thought to ask beforebut what is that dust made of depleted uranium i told him at least thats the base ingredient i had to add in a lot of other things cold iron basil dung from a never mind he said i dont want to know he turned away from me his arms steadily holding the massive sword before him i recovered staff and rod and stood beside him studying the lay of the asitwere land this part of the nevernever looked like chicago at the end of the nineteenth centuryno strike that this was the ghosts demesne it looked like a mishmash of agatha hagglethorns memories of chicago at the end of her life edisons bulbs were mounted in some of the streetlights while others burned with flickering gas flames all of them cast hazy spheres of light doing little to actually illuminate their surroundings the buildings stood at slightly odd angles to one another with parts of them seamlessly missing everythingstreets sidewalks buildingswas made of wood hells bell i muttered no wonder the real chicago kept burning down this place is a tinderbox rats moved in the shadows but the street was otherwise empty and still the rift that led back to our world wavered and shifted fluorescent light and sterile hospital air pouring onto the old chicago streets around us pulsed maybe a dozen shimmering disturbances in the airthe rich life forces of the infants back in the infirmary showing through into the nevernever where is she michael asked his voice quiet wheres the ghost i turned in a slow circle peering at the shadows and shook my head i dont know but wed better find her fast and we need to get a look at this one if we can to try to find out whats gotten it stirred up michael said exactly i dont know about you but im getting a little tired of chasing all over town every night didnt you already get a look at her not the right kind of look i said with a grimace there could be spells laid on her some kind of magic around her to clue me in on whats going on i need to be not in mortal peril for a couple of minutes to examine her provided she doesnt kill us first all right michael assented but time is short and i dont see her anywhere what should we do i hate to say it i said but i think we should i was going to say split up but i didnt get the chance the heavy wooden timbers of the roadway beneath us exploded up and out in a deadly cloud of splinters i threw one leatherclad arm across my eyes and went tumbling one way michael went the other my little angels mine mine mine screamed a voice that roared against my face and chest and made my duster flap around as though made of gauze i looked up to see the ghost quite real and solid now clawing its onearmed way up from the substreet agathas face was lean and bony twisted in rage and her hair hung about her in a shaggy mane sharply at odds with her crisp white shirt her arm was missing from its shoulder and dark fluid stained the cloth beneath it michael rose to his feet with a shout one of his cheeks cut and bleeding and went after her with amoracchius the spirit backhanded him away with her remaining arm as though he weighed no more than a doll michael grunted and went flying rolling along the wooden street and then snarling and drooling her eyes wide with frenzied madness the ghost turned toward me i scrambled to my feet and held out my staff across my body a slender barrier between me and the ghost on its home turf i guess its too late to have a reasonable discussion agatha my babies the spirit screamed mine mine mine yeah thats what i thought i breathed i gathered my forces and started channeling them through the staff the pale wood began glowing with a goldandorange light spreading out before me in a quarterdome shape the ghost screamed again and hurtled toward me i stood fast and shouted reflettum at the top of my lungs the spirit impacted against my shield with all the momentum of a bull rhinoceros on steroids ive stopped bullets and worse with that shield before but that was on my home turf in the real world here the nevernever agathas ghost overloaded my shield which detonated with a thunderous roar and sent me sprawling to the ground again i jammed my scorched staff into the ground and groaned to my feet blood stained my tingling fingers the skin swelling with dark bruises and burst blood vessels agatha stood several paces away shaking with rage or if i was lucky with confusion bits of my shieldfire played over her shape and slowly winked out i fumbled for my blasting rod but my fingers had gone numb and i dropped it i bent over to pick it up swayed and stood up again red mist and sparkling dots swimming through my vision michael circled the stunned spirit and arrived at my side his expression was concerned rather than frightened easy harry easy good lord man are you all right ill make it i croaked theres good news and bad news the knight brought his sword to guard again ive always been partial to the good news i dont think shes interested in those babies anymore michael flashed me a swift smile that is good news i wiped some sweat from my eyes my hand came away scarlet i must have gotten a cut somewhere along the way the bad news is that shes going to come over here and tear us apart in a couple more seconds not to be negative but im afraid the news gets worse michael said listen i glanced at him and cocked my head to one side distantly but quickly growing nearer i could hear haunting musical baying ghostly in the midnight air holy shit i breathed hellhounds harry michael said sternly you know i hate it when you swear youre right sorry holy shit i breathed heckhounds godmothers out hunting how the hell did she find us so damned fast michael grimaced at me she must have been close already how long before she gets here not long my shield made a lot of noise when it buckled shell home in on it if you want to go harry michael said go on and leave ill hold the ghost until you can get back through the rift i was tempted there arent a lot of things that scare me more than the nevernever and my godmother in tandem but i was also angry i hate it when i get shown up besides michael was a friend and im not in the habit of leaving friends to clean up my messes for me no i said lets just hurry michael grinned at me and started forward just as agathas ghost extinguished the last residual bits of my magic that had been plaguing it michael sent amoracchius whistling at the ghost but she was unthinkably swift and dodged each blow with a circling swooping sort of grace i lifted my blasting rod and narrowed my focus i tuned out the baying of the hellhounds now a lot nearer and the sound of galloping hoofbeats that sent my pulse racing i methodically blanked out everything but the ghost michael and the power funneling into the blasting rod the ghost must have sensed the strike gathering because she turned and flew at me like a bullet her mouth opened in a scream and i could see jagged pointed teeth lining her jaws the empty white fire of her eyes fuego i shouted and then the spirit hit me full force a beam of white fire spewed out from my blasting rod and across the wooden storefronts they burst into flame as though soaked in gasoline i went down rolling the spirit going after my throat with her teeth i jammed the end of the blasting rod into her mouth and prepared to fire again but she tore it from my hands with a ferocious doglike worrying motion and it tumbled away i swiped the staff at her awkwardly to no avail she went for my throat again i shoved a leatherclad forearm into her mouth and shouted michael the ghost ripped at me with her nails and clamped down on my forearm i dropped the ghost dust and scrabbled furiously at her with my free hand trying to lever her off of me but didnt do much more than muss up her clothing she got her hand on my throat and i felt my breath cut off i writhed and struggled to escape but the snarling ghost was a lot stronger and faster than me stars swam in front of my eyes michael shouted and swept amoracchius at the spirit the great blade bit into her back with a woodensounding thunk and made her arch up screaming in pain it was a deathblow the white light of the blade touched her spiritflesh and set it alight sizzling away from the edges of the wound she twisted screaming in fury and the motion jerked the blade from michaels hands agatha hagglethorns blazing ghost prepared to fly at his throat i sat up seized the sack of ghost dust and with a grunt of effort swept it at the back of her head there was a sharp sound when the improvised cosh struck her the superheavy matter id enchanted hitting like a sledgehammer on china the ghost froze in place for a moment her feral mouth wideand then toppled slowly to one side i looked up at michael who stood gasping for breath staring at me harry he said do you see i lifted a hand to my aching throat and looked around me the sounds of baying hounds and thundering hooves had gone see what i asked look he pointed at the smoldering ghostcorpse i looked in my struggles with agathas ghost i had torn aside the prim white shirt and she must have ripped up the dress when shed been crashing through sidewalks and strangling wizards and so on i crawled a bit closer to the corpse it was burningnot blazing but steadily being eaten away by amoracchiuss white fire like newsprint slowly curling into flame the fire didnt hide what michael was talking about though wire strands of barbed wire ran about the ghosts flesh beneath her torn clothing the barbs had dug cruelly into her flesh every two inches or so and her body was covered with small agonizing wounds i grimaced picking away at the burning cloth in tentative jerks the wire was a single strand that began at her throat and wrapped about her torso beneath the arms winding all the way down one leg to her ankle at either end the wire simply vanished into her flesh sun and stars i breathed no wonder she went mad the wire michael asked crouching down next to me it was hurting the ghost i nodded looks like torturing it why didnt we see this in the hospital i shook my head whatever this is im not sure it would be visible in the real world i dont think we would have seen it if we hadnt come here god smiled on us michael said i eyed my own injuries then glowered at the bruises already spreading over michaels arm and throat yeah whatever look michaelthis kind of thing doesnt just happen someone had to do it to this ghost which implies michael said that they had a reason to want this ghost to hurt those children his face darkened into a scowl whether or not that was their goal what it implies is that someone is behind all the recent activitynot some thing or condition someone is purposefully doing this to the ghosts in the area i stood up and brushed myself off as the corpse continued to burn like the buildings around us fire raged up the sides of anything vertical and began to chew its way across the streets and sidewalks as well a haze of smoke filled the air as the spirits demesne in the nevernever crumbled along with its remains ow i complained i keep my complaints succinct michael took the handle of his sword and drew it out of the flames shaking his head the city is burning thank you sir obvious he smiled can the flames hurt us yes i said emphatic time to go together we headed back to the rift at a quick trot at one point michael shouldered me out of the way of a tumbling chimney and we had to skirt around the pile of shattered bricks and blazing timbers wait i said suddenly wait do you hear that michael kept me hustling over the ground toward the rift hear what i dont hear anything yeah i coughed no more hounds howling a very tall slender inhumanly beautiful woman stepped out of the smoke reddish hair curled down past her hips in a riotous cascade complementing her flawless skin high cheekbones and lush full bloodred lips her face was ageless and her golden eyes had vertical slits instead of pupils like a cat her gown was a flowing affair of deep green hello my son lea purred evidently unaffected by the smoke and unconcerned about the fire three great shapes like mastiffs built from shadows and soot crouched about her feet watching us with flat black eyes they stood between us and the rift that led back home i swallowed and forced down a sudden feeling of childlike panic that started gibbering down in my belly and threatened to come dancing up out of my throat i stepped forward between the faerie and michael and said in a rough voice hello godmother chapter six my godmother looked around at the inferno and smiled it reminds me of times gone by doesnt it remind you my sweet she idly reached down and stroked the head of one of the hounds at her side however did you find me so quickly godmother i asked she gave the hellhound a benign smile mmmm i have my little secrets sweet i only wanted to greet my longestranged godson all right hi good to see you have to do it again sometime i said smoke curled up into my mouth and i started coughing were kind of in a hurry here so lea laughed a sound like bells just a shade out of tune always in such a rush you mortals but we havent seen each other in ages harry she walked closer her body moving with a lithe sensuous grace that might have been mesmerizing in other circumstances the hounds spread out silently behind her we should spend some time together michael lifted his sword again and said calmly madame step from our path if you please it does not please me she spat sudden and vicious those rich lips peeled back from dainty sharp canines and at the same time the three shadowy hounds let out bubbling growls her golden eyes swept past michael and back to me he is mine sir knight by blood right by law and by his own broken word he has made a compact with me you have no power over that harry michael shot me a quick look is what she says true i licked my lips and gripped my staff i was a lot younger then and a lot more stupid harry if you have made a covenant with her of your own free will then she is rightthere is little i can do to stop her another building fell with a roar the fires gathered around us and it got hot really really hot the rift wavered growing smaller we didnt have much time left come harry lea purred her voice gone pardon the pun smoky again let the good knight of the white god pass on his way and let me take you to waters that will soothe your hurts and balm your ills it sounded like a good idea it sounded really good her own magic saw to that i felt my feet moving toward her in a slow leaden shuffling dresden michael said sharply good lord man what are you doing go home michael i said my voice came out thick dull as though id been drinking i saw leas mouth her soft lovely mouth curl upward in a triumphant smirk i didnt try to fight the pull of the magic i wouldnt have been able to stop my legs in any case lead had my number for years and as far as i could tell she always would i hadnt a prayer of taking control back for more than a few seconds the air grew cooler as i got closer to her and i could smell herher body her hair like wildflowers and musky earth intoxicating there isnt much time before the rift closes go home harry michael shouted lea placed one longfingered slender hand upon my cheek a wash of tingling pleasure went through me my body reacted to her helpless and demanding at the same time and i had to fight to keep thoughts of her beauty from preoccupying me altogether yes my sweet man lea whispered golden eyes bright with glee sweet sweet sweet now lay aside your rod and staff i watched dully as my fingers released both they clattered to the ground the flames grew closer but i didnt feel them the rift glowed and shrank almost closed i narrowed my eyes gathering my will will you complete your bargain now sweet mortal child lea murmured sliding her hands over my chest and then over my shoulders i will go with you i answered letting my voice come out thick slow her eyes lit with malicious glee and she threw her head back and laughed revealing creamy delicious expanses of throat and bosom when hell freezes over i added and drew out the little sack of ghost dust for the last time i dumped it all over and down the previously mentioned bosom there isnt much lore about faeries and depleted uranium yet but theres a ton about faeries and cold iron they dont like it and the iron content of the dusts formula was pretty high leas flawless complexion immediately split into fiery scarlet welts the skin drying and cracking before my eyes leas triumphant laugh turned into an agonized scream and she released me tearing her silken gown away from her chest in a panic revealing more gorgeous flesh being riven by the cold iron michael i shouted now i gave my godmother a stiff shove scooped up my staff and rod and dove for the rift i heard a snarl and something fastened around one of my boots dragging me to the ground i thrust my staff down at one of the hellhounds and the wood struck it in one of its eyes it roared in rage and its two pack mates came rushing toward me michael stepped in the way and swept his sword at one of them the true iron struck the faerie beast and blood and white fire erupted from the wound the second one leapt upon michael and fastened its fangs onto his thigh ripping and jerking i brought my staff down hard on the beasts skull driving it off michaels leg and started dragging my friend back toward the swiftly vanishing line of the rift more hellhounds appeared rushing from the burning ruins around us come on i shouted theres no time treacher spat my godmother she rose up from the ground blackened and burned her fine dress in tatters about her waist her body and limbs stretched knobby and inhuman she clenched her hands into fists at her sides and the fire from the building around us seemed to rush down gathering in her grasp in a pair of blazing points of violet and emerald light treasonous poisonous child you are mine as your mother swore unto me as you swore you shouldnt make contracts with a minor i shouted back and shoved michael forward into the rift he wavered for a moment on the narrow opening and then fell through and vanished back into the real world if you will not give me your life serpent child then i will have your blood lea took two huge strides toward me and hurled both hands forward a thunderbolt of braided emerald and violet power rushed at my face i hurled myself backwards at the rift and prayed that it was still open enough to let me fall through i extended my staff toward my godmother and threw up whatever weak shield i could the faerie fire hammered into the shield hurling me back into the rift like a straw before a tornado i felt my staff smolder and burst into flames in my hand as i went sailing through i landed on the floor of the nursery back in cook county hospital my leather duster trailing with it a shroud of smoke that swiftly converted itself to a thin disgusting coating of residual ectoplasm while my staff burned with weird green and purple fire babies in their little glass cribs screamed lustily all around me confused voices babbled from the next room then the rift closed and we were left back in the real world surrounded by crying babies the fluorescent lights all came back up and we could hear more worried words from the nurses back at the duty station i beat out the fires on my staff and then sat there panting and hurting none of the matter of the nevernever may have come back to the real worldbut the injuries gained there were very real michael got up and looked around at the babies making sure that they were all in satisfactory condition then he sat down next to me wiped the patina of ectoplasm from his brow and started pressing the material of his cloak against the oozing gashes in his leg where the hellhounds fangs had sunk through his jeans he gave me a pensive frowning stare what i asked him your godmother you got away from her he said i laughed weakly this time yeah so whats bothering you you lied to her to do it i tricked her i countered classic tactics with faeries he blinked and then used another section of his cloak to clean the ectogook off of amoracchius i just thought you were an honest man harry he said his expression injured i cant believe you lied to her i started to laugh weakly too exhausted to move you cant believe i lied to her well no he said his voice defensive thats not the way were supposed to win were the good guys harry i laughed some more and wiped a trickle of blood off of my face well we are some kind of alarm started going off one of the nurses stepped into the observation room took one look at the pair of us and ran out screaming you know what bothers me i asked whats that i set my scorched staff and rod aside im wondering how in the world my godmother happened to be right at hand when i stepped through into nevernever it isnt like the place is a small neighborhood i wasnt there five minutes before she showed up michael sheathed his sword and set it carefully aside out of easy arms reach then unfastened his cloak wincing yes it seems an unlikely coincidence we both put our hands up on top of our heads as a chicago pd patrolman his jacket and pants stained with spilled coffee burst into the nursery gun drawn we both sat there with our hands on our head and did our best to look friendly and nonthreatening dont worry michael said quietly just let me do the talking chapter seven michael rested his chin in his hands and sighed i cant believe were in jail disturbing the peace i snorted pacing the confines of the holding cell trespass hah theyd have seen disturbed peace if we hadnt shown up i jerked a fistful of citations out of my pants pocket look at this speeding failure to obey traffic signs dangerous and reckless operation of a motor vehicle and heres the best one illegal parking im going to lose my license you cant blame them harry it isnt as though we could explain what happened in terms that they would understand i kicked at the bars in frustration pain lanced up my leg and i immediately regretted ittheyd taken away my boots when id been put through processing added to my aching ribs the wounds on my head and my stiffening fingers it was too much i sat down on the bench next to michael with a whuff of expelled breath i get so sick of that i said people like you and me stand up to things that these jokers i made an allencompassing gesturewould never even dream existed we dont get paid for it we hardly even get thanked for it michaels tone was unruffled philosophical its the nature of the beast harry i dont mind it so much i just hate it when something like this happens i stood up frustrated again and started pacing the interior of the cell what really galls me is that we still dont know why the spirit worlds been so jumpy this is big michael if we dont pin down whats causing it whos causing it right whos causing itwho knows what could happen michael halfsmiled the lord will never give you a burden bigger than your shoulders can bear harry all we can do is face what comes and have faith i gave him a sour glance i need to get myself some bigger shoulders then someone in accounting must have made a mistake michael let out a rough warm laugh and shook his head then lay back on the bench crossing his arms beneath his head we did what was right isnt that enough i thought of all those babies snuffling and making cute piteous little sounds as the nurses had rushed about gathering them up and making sure that they were all right carrying them off to their mommies one a fat little gerber candidate had simply let out an enormous burp and promptly fallen asleep on the nurses shoulder about a dozen little lives all told with an open future laid out before thema future that would have abruptly ended if i hadnt acted i felt a stupid little smile playing at the corners of my mouth and a very small very concrete sense of satisfaction that my indignation hadnt managed to erase i turned away from michael so that he wouldnt see the smile and forced myself to sound resigned is it enough i guess its going to have to be michael laughed again i flashed him a scowl and it only drew more merry laughter so i gave up trying and just leaned against the bars how long before we get out of here do you think ive never been bailed out of jail before michael said youd be a better judge hey i protested whats that supposed to mean michaels smile faded charity he predicted is not going to be very happy i winced michaels wife yeah well all we can do is face what comes and have faith right michael grunted somehow making it wry ill say a prayer to saint jude i leaned my head against the bars and closed my eyes i ached in places i didnt know could ache i could have dozed off right there all i want i said is to get home get clean and go to sleep an hour or so later a uniformed officer appeared and opened the door informing us that wed made bail i got a sickly little feeling in my stomach michael and i shuffled out of the holding area into the adjacent waiting room a woman in a roomy dress and a heavy cardigan stood waiting for us her arms folded over her seventh or eighth month of pregnancy she was tall with gorgeous silken blonde hair that fell to her waist in a shining curtain timelessly lovely features and dark eyes smoldering with contained anger michael joseph patrick carpenter she snapped and stalked toward us well actually she waddled but the set of her shoulders and her determined expression made it seem like a stalk youre a mess this is what comes of taking up with bad company hello angel michael rumbled and leaned over to give the woman a kiss on the cheek she accepted it with all the loving tolerance of a komodo dragon dont you hello angel me do you know what i had to go through to find a babysitter get all the way out here get the money together and then get the sword back for you hi charity i said brightly gee its good to see you too its been what three or four years since weve talked five years mr dresden the woman said shooting me a glare and the good lord willing it will be five more before i have to put up with your idiocy again but i she thrust her swollen stomach at me like the ram on a greek warship every time you come nosing around you get michael into some sort of trouble and now into jail what will the children think look charity it was really imp missus carpenter she snarled its always really important mr dresden well my husband has engaged in many important activities without what i dubiously term your help but its only when youre around that he seems to come back to me covered in blood hey i protested i got hurt too good she said maybe it will make you more cautious in the future i scowled down at the woman ill have you know she grabbed the front of my shirt and dragged my face down to hers she was surprisingly strong and she could glare right at me without looking me square in the eyes ill have you know she said voice steely that if you ever get my michael into trouble so deep that he cant come home to his family i will make you sorry for it tears that had nothing to do with weakness made her eyes bright for a moment and she shook with emotion i have to admit at that particular moment her threat scared me waddling pregnancy and all she finally released me and turned back to her husband gently touching a dark scab on his face michael put his arms around her and with a little cry she hugged him back burying her face against his chest and weeping without making any sound michael held her very carefully as if he were afraid of breaking her and stroked her hair i stood there for a second like a floundering goob michael looked up at me and met my gaze for a moment he then turned keeping his wife under one arm and started walking away i watched the two of them for a moment walking in step beside one another while i stood there alone then i stuck my hands into my pockets and turned away i hadnt ever noticed before how well the two of them matched one anothermichael with his quiet strength and unfailing reliability and charity with her blazing passion and unshakable loyalty to her husband the married thing sometimes i look at it and feel like someone from a dickens novel standing outside in the cold and staring in at christmas dinner relationships hadnt ever really worked for me i think its had something to do with all the demons ghosts and human sacrifice as i stood there brooding i sensed her presence before i smelled her perfume a warmth and energy about her that id grown to know over the time wed been together susan paused at the door of the waiting room looking back over her shoulder i studied her i never got tired of that susan had dark skin tanned even darker from our previous weekend at the beach and ravenblack hair cut off neatly at her shoulders she was slender but curved enough to draw an admiring look from the officer behind the counter as she stood there in a flirty little skirt and halftop which left her midriff bare my phone call caught her just as shed been leaving for our rendezvous she turned to me and smiled her chocolatecolored eyes worried but warm she tilted her head back toward the hallway behind her where michael and charity had gone theyre a beautiful couple arent they i tried to smile back but didnt do so well they got off to a good start susans eyes studied my face the cuts there and the worry in her eyes deepened oh hows that he rescued her from a firebreathing dragon i walked toward her sounds nice she said and met me halfway giving me a long and gentle hug that made my bruised ribs ache you okay ill be okay more ghostbusting with michael whats his story off the record publicity could hurt him hes got kids susan frowned but nodded all right she said and added a flair of melodrama to her words so what is he some kind of eternal soldier maybe a sleeping arthurian knight woken in this desperate age to battle the forces of evil as far as i know hes a carpenter susan arched a brow at me who fights ghosts what has he got a magic nailgun or something i tried not to smile the muscles at the corners of my mouth ached not quite hes a righteous man he seemed nice enough to me no not selfrighteous righteous the real deal hes honest loyal faithful he lives his ideals it gives him power susan frowned he looked average enough id have expected im not sure something a different attitude thats because hes humble too i said if you asked him if he was righteous hed laugh at the idea i guess thats part of it ive never met anyone like him hes a good man she pursed her lips and the sword amoracchius i supplied he named his sword how very freudian of him but his wife just about reached down that clerks throat to get it back its important to him i said he believes that it is one of three weapons given by god to mankind three swords each of them has a nail that is supposed to be from the cross worked into its design only one of the righteous can wield them the ones who do call themselves the knights of the cross others call them the knights of the sword susan frowned the cross she said as in the crucifixion capital c i shrugged uncomfortably how should i know michael believes it that kind of belief is a power of its own maybe thats enough i took a breath and changed the subject anyway my car got impounded i had to drive fast and cpd didnt like it her dark eyes sparkled anything worth a story i laughed tiredly dont you ever give up a girls got to earn a living she said and fell into step beside me on the way out slipping her arm through mine maybe tomorrow i just want to get back home and get some sleep no date i guess she smiled up at me but i could see the expression was strained around the edges sorry i i know she sighed i shortened my steps a little and she lengthened hers though neither of us moved quickly i know what youre doing is important harry i just wish sometimes that she broke off frowning that what nothing really its selfish that what i repeated i found her hand with my bruised fingers and squeezed gently she sighed and stopped in the hall turning to face me she took both of my hands and didnt look up when she said i just wish that i could be that important to you too an uncomfortable pang hit me in the middle of my sternum ow it hurt to hear that literally susan i stammered hey dont ever think that youre not important to me oh she said still not looking up its not that like i said just selfish ill get over it i just dont want you to feel like i frowned and took a breath i dont want you to think that i dont what i mean to say is that i love you that should have been simple enough to say but the words stuck hard in my throat id never said them to anyone i didnt lose and every time i told my mouth to make the sounds something shut down somewhere along the way susan looked up at me her eyes flickering over my face she reached up a hand and touched the bandage on my forehead her fingers light gentle warm silence fell heavy on the hallway i stood there staring stupidly at her finally i leaned down and kissed her hard like i was trying to push the words out of my useless mouth and into her i dont know if she understood but she melted to me all warm soft tension smelling of cinnamon the sweetness of her lips soft and pliant beneath mine one of my hands drifted to the small of her back to the smooth rounded ridges of muscle on either side of her spine and drew her against me a little harder footsteps coming from the other direction made us both smile and break away from the kiss a female officer walked by her lips twisted into a knowing little smirk and i felt my cheeks flush susan took my hand from her back bending her mouth to put a gentle kiss on my bruised fingers dont think youre getting off that easy harry dresden she said im going to get you to start talking if it kills you but she didnt press the issue and together we reclaimed my stuff and left i fell asleep on the drive back to my apartment but i woke up when the car crunched into the gravel parking lot beside the stone stairs leading down to my lair in the basement of an old boardinghouse we got out of the car and i stretched looking around the summer night with a scowl whats wrong susan asked mister i said hes usually running right up to me when i come home i let him out early this morning hes a cat harry susan said flashing me a smile maybe hes got a date what if he got hit by a car what if a dog got him susan let out a laugh and walked over to me my libido noted the sway of her hips in the little skirt with an interest that made my aching muscles cringe hes as big as a horse harry i pity the dog that tries something i reached back into the car for my staff and rod then slipped an arm around her susans warmth beside me the scent of cinnamon drifting up to me from her hair felt incredibly nice at the end of a long day but it just didnt feel right to not have mister run up to me and bowl into my shins in greeting that should have been enough to tip me off ill plead weariness achiness and sexual distraction it came as a total shock to me to feel a wave of cold energy writhe into my face in tandem with a shadowy form rising up from the steps leading down to my apartment i froze and took a step back only to see another silent shape step around the edge of the boardinghouse and start walking toward us gooseflesh erupted up and down my arms susan caught on a second or two after my wizards senses had given me warning harry she breathed what is it who are they take it easy and get out your car keys i said as the two shapes approached us the waves of cool energy increasing as they did light from the distant street lamp reflected in the nearest figures eyes gleaming huge and black were getting out of here theyre vampires chapter eight one of the vampires let out a velvet laugh and stepped out into the dim light he wasnt particularly tall and he moved with a casual and dangerous grace that belied his crystalblue eyes styled blond hair and the tennis whites he wore bianca told us youd be nervous he purred the second of the pair kept coming toward us from the corner of the boardinghouse she too was of innocuous height and build and possessed the same blue eyes and flawless golden hair as the man she too was dressed in tennis whites but she breathed and licked her lips with a catquick tongue she didnt tell us you would smell so delicious susan fumbled with her keys and pressed up against me tight with tension and fear harry dont look them in the eyes i said and dont let them lick you susan shot me a sharp look from beneath raven brows lick yeah their salivas some kind of addictive narcotic we reached her car get in the male vampire opened his mouth showing his fangs and laughed peace wizard were not here for your blood speak for yourself the girl said she licked her lips again and this time i could see the black spots on her long pink tongue ewg the male smiled and put a hand on her shoulder a gesture that was half affection half physical restraint my sister hasnt eaten tonight he explained shes on a diet vampires on a diet susan murmured beneath her breath yeah i said back sotto voce make hers a blood lite susan made a choking sound i eyed the male and raised my voice who are you then and why are you at my house he inclined his head politely my name is kyle hamilton this is my sister kelly we are associates of madame biancas and we are here to give you a message an invitation actually it only takes one of you to deliver a message kyle glanced at his sister we were just on the way to our game of doubles i snorted yeah right i told him whatever it is youre selling i dont want any you can go now kyle frowned i urge you to reconsider mr dresden you of all people should know madame bianca is the most influential vampire in the city of chicago denying her invitation could have grave consequences i dont like threats i shot back i hefted my blasting rod and leveled it at kyles baby blues keep it up and theres going to be a greasy spot right about where youre standing the pair of them smiled at meinnocent angels with pointed teeth please mr dresden kyle said understand that i am only pointing out the potential hazards of a diplomatic incident between the vampire court and the white council whoops that changed things i hesitated and then lowered the blasting rod this is court business official business the vampire court kyle said a measured cadence to his words extends a formal invitation to harry dresden wizard as the local representative of the white council of wizards to attend the reception celebrating the elevation of bianca st claire to the rank of margravine of the vampire court three nights hence reception to begin at midnight kyle paused to produce an expensivelooking white envelope and to refresh his smile the safety of all invited guests is assured by word of the assembled court of course harry susan breathed whats going on tell you in a minute i said i stepped away from susan you are acting as an ordained herald of the court then i am kyle said i nodded bring me the invitation the pair of them started toward me i lifted my blasting rod and muttered a word power flooded through the rod and the far tip began to glow with an incandescent light not her i said nodding to the heralds sister just you kyle kept his smile but his eyes had changed from blue to a shade of angry black that was rapidly expanding to cover the whites well he said his voice tense arent we the little lawyer mr dresden i smiled back at him look sparky youre the herald you should know the accords as well as i do youve license to deliver and receive messages and to have safe passage granted you so long as you dont start any trouble i waved the tip of the rod toward the girl beside him she doesnt and shes not obliged to keep the peace either lets just say id rather we all walked away from this they both made a hissing sound that no human could quite have duplicated kyle pushed kelly roughly back behind him where she remained her softlooking hands pressed to her stomach her eyes flooded entirely black and empty of humanity kyle stalked toward me and thrust the envelope at me i swallowed my fear lowered my blasting rod and took it your business here is complete i told him blow youd better be there dresden kyle snarled pacing back to his sisters side my lady will be most upset if you are not i told you to blow kyle i lifted my hand gathered my anger and my fear as handy sources of fuel and said quietly ventas servitas energy flowed out of me wind roared up in response to my command and whipped out toward the pair of vampires carrying a cloud of dust and dirt and debris with it they both staggered lifting a hand to shield their eyes against flying particles as the wind faded i sagged wearied by the effort of moving that much air and watched the vampires gather their wits and blink their eyes clear their perfect tennis whites were stained their beautiful complexions were mussed and best of all their flawless hair was standing up every which way they hissed at me and crouched bodies oddly balanced and held with an inhuman lightness then there was a blur of tennis whites and they were gone i didnt assume that they had left until i let my senses drift out from me tasting the air for the cold energy that had surrounded them it had faded as well only then when i was absolutely sure they were gone did i relax well it felt like simple relaxingbut generally when i relax i dont stagger and need to plant my staff firmly on the ground to keep from falling over i stood there like that for a second my head swimming wow susan came toward me her face concerned harry you sure know how to make friends i wobbled a little hardly able to stand i dont need friends like that she got close enough for me to lean on and spared my ego by slipping underneath my arm as though for my protection are you all right tired ive been working too hard tonight must have gotten out of shape can you walk i gave her a smile that probably looked strained and started walking toward the stairs leading down to my apartment mister my grey cat came flying over the ground from the darkness somewhere and threw himself fondly against my legs thirty pounds of cat is a lot of fondness and i had to have susans help to keep from falling over eating small children again mister my cat meowed then padded down the stairs and pawed at the door so susan said the vampires are throwing a party i fished my keys out of my dusters pocket i unlocked the door to the old place and mister bolted inside i shut the door behind us and stared wearily at my living room the fire had died down to glowing embers but still shed redgolden light over everything i decorated my apartment in textures not colors in any case i like the smooth grain of old woods the heavy tapestries on the bare stone walls the chairs are all thickly padded and comfortable looking and rugs are strewn over the bare stone floor in a variety of materials patterns and weaves from arabian to navajo susan helped me hobble in until i could collapse on my plushly cushioned couch she took my staff and blasting rod from me wrinkling her nose at the charred smell and set them in the corner next to my cane sword then she came back over to me and knelt down flashing a lot of bare pretty leg she took my boots off and i groaned as my feet came free thanks i said she plucked the envelope from my hand could you get the candles i groaned for an answer and she sniffed big baby you just want to see me walk around in this skirt guilty i said she quirked a smile at me and went to the fireplace she added a few logs to it from the old tin hod and then stirred the embers with a poker until licks of flame came up i dont have any electric lights in my apartment gadgets go out so often that theres no point in constantly replacing them my refrigerator is an oldstyle icebox the kind with ice i shuddered to think of what i could do to gas lines so i lived without heat except for my fireplace and without hot water without electricity the curse of a wizard it saves on the utilities bills i have to admit but it can be damned inconvenient susan had to bend down far over the fire to thrust a long candlesticks tip down into the small flames the orange light curved around the lean muscles of her legs in a fashion i found positively fascinating even as wearied as i was susan rose with the lighted candle in her hand and cast a smirk at me youre staring harry guilty i said again she lit several candles on the mantel from the first and then opened the white envelope frowning wow she said and held the invitation inside up to the light i couldnt make out the words but they had that whiteyellow glint that you only get from true gold the bearer wizard harry dresden and an escort of his choosing are hereby courteously invited to a reception i didnt think they used invitations like this anymore vampires they can be a couple hundred years out of style and not notice harry susan said she flicked the invitation against the heel of her hand a couple of times you know something occurs to me my brain tried to stir from its congealment some instinct twitched warning me that susan was up to something um i said blinking my eyes in an effort to clear my thoughts i hope youre not thinking what a great opportunity it would be for you to go to the ball her eyes glinted with something very much like lust think of it harry there could be beings there hundreds of years old i could get enough stories from a half hour of chat to last me hang on cinderella i said in the first place im not going to the ball in the second even if i was i wouldnt take you with me her back straightened and she put one fist on her hip and just what is that supposed to mean i winced look susan theyre vampires they eat people youve got no idea how dangerous it would be for me thereor for you for that matter what about what kyle said the guarantee of your safety talk is cheap i said look everyone in the old circles is big on the old laws of courtesy and hospitality but you can only trust them to adhere to the letter of the law if i happened to get served a bad batch of mushrooms or someone drove by and filled the whole place with bullets and i was the only mortal there theyd just say oh my what a terrible shame so sorry really it wont happen again so youre saying theyd kill you susan said bianca has a grudge against me i said she couldnt just sneak up on me and tear my throat out but she could arrange for something to happen to me more indirectly its probably what she has in mind susan frowned ive seen you handle things a lot worse than those two out there i let out a breath in exasperation maybe sure but whats the point in taking chances cant you see what this might mean to me she said harry that footage i shot of the werewolf loupgarou i interrupted whatever it was ten seconds of footage that was only aired for three days before it vanishedand it put me further ahead than five years of legwork if i could publish actual interviews with vampires sheesh susan youre reading too much off the bestseller list in the real world the vampire eats you before you get to hit the record button ive taken chances beforeso have you i dont go looking for trouble i said her eyes flashed dammit harry how long have i been putting aside the things that happen to you like tonight when i was supposed to be spending the evening with my boyfriend and instead im bailing him out of jail ouch i glanced down susan believe me if i could have done anything else this could be a fantastic opportunity for me she was right and she had bailed me out of trouble often enough before that maybe i owed her that opportunity dangerous as it might be she was a big girl and could make her own choices but dammit i couldnt just nod my head and smile and let her walk into that kind of danger better to try to sidetrack her no i said ive got enough problems without pissing off the white council again her eyes narrowed whats this white council kyle talked to you as though it were some kind of ruling body is it like the vampire court only for wizards exactly like that i thought susan hadnt gotten as far as she had by being stupid not really i told her youre a horrible liar harry the white council is a group of the most powerful men and women in the world susan wizards their big currency is in secrets and they dont like people knowing about them her eyes gleamed like a hound on a fresh scent and youre some kind of ambassador for them i had to laugh at the notion oh god no but im a member its sort of like having a black belt its a mark of status of respect with the council it means that i get to vote when issues come up and that i have to abide by their rules are you entitled to represent them at a function like this i didnt like the direction this conversation was headed um obligated to really in this case so if you dont show up youll be in trouble i scowled not as much trouble as ill be in if i go the worst the councild be able to accuse me of is being impolite i can live with that and if you do show up come on harry whats the worse that could happen i threw up my hands i could get myself killed or worse susan you really dont understand what youre asking of me i pushed myself up off the couch to go to her bad idea my head swam and my vision blurred i would have fallen but susan dropped the invitation and caught me she eased me back down to the couch and i kept my arm around her drawing her down with me she felt soft and warm we lay there for a minute and she rubbed her cheek against the duster leather creaked i heard her sigh im sorry harry i shouldnt hit you with this right now its all right i said i just think that its something big if we i turned a little tangled my fingers in the dark softness of her hair and kissed her her eyelids opened wide for a second and then lowered her words broke off into a low growling sound and her mouth softened beneath mine warm and getting warmer in spite of my aches and bruises the kiss felt good it felt really good her mouth tasted nice the softness of her lips mobile and eager beneath mine i felt her slide a few fingers in between the buttons of my shirt caressing the skin there and electric sensation thrilled through me our tongues met and i dragged her closer she moaned again then abruptly pushed me back enough to straddle my hips with those long and lovely legs and begin to kiss me as though she meant to inhale me i ran my hands over her hips lingering on the small of her back and she moved them grinding against me i moved my hands to the taut tension of her thighs and slid them up over the bare smooth skin lifting the skirt up baring her legs her hips i faltered in surprise for a halfsecond when i realized she wasnt wearing anything underneathbut then wed been planning on an evening in a spasm of need and hunger pounded through all the exhaustion and i clutched her felt her gasp again willing and as hungry as me her body tensing against me beneath my hands she started jerking at my belt gasping her breath hot in my face harry you jerk dont you think this is going to distract me forever shortly after that we made sure that neither of us could think of anything at all and fell asleep a goodly while after that tangled together in a sprawl of exhausted limbs dark hair and soft blankets in front of the fire all right so the entire day wasnt a living hell but as it turned out hell got up awfully early in the morning chapter nine i dreamed the nightmare felt familiar almost comfortable though it had been years since id gone through it it began in a cave its walls made of translucent crystal all but glowing in the dim light of the fire beneath the cauldron the silver manacles were tight on my wrists and i was too dizzy to keep my own balance i looked to the left and right and watched my blood glide down over the manacles from where they pierced my wrists like thorns then fall into a pair of earthen bowls set out beneath them my godmother came to me pale and breathtaking in the firelight her hair spilling down around her like a cloud of silk the sidhe lady was beautiful beyond the pale of mortals her eyes bewitching her mouth more tempting than the most luscious fruit she kissed my bare chest shudders of cold pleasure ran through me soon she whispered between kisses only a few more nights of the dark moon my sweetling and you will be strong enough she kept kissing me and i began to lose my vision cold pleasure faerie magic coursed through her lips like a drug so sweet that it was almost an agony of its own and made the torment of the bonds the blood loss almost worthwhile almost i felt myself gasping for breath and stared at the fire focusing on it trying to keep from falling into the darkness the dream changed i dreamt of fire someone i had once loved like a father stood in the middle of it screaming in agony they were black screams horrible screams highpitched and utterly without pride or dignity or humanity in the dream as in life i forced myself to watch flesh blacken and flake away from sizzling muscle and baking bone watched muscles contract in tortured spasms while i stood over the fire and metaphorically speaking blew on the coals justin i whispered in the end i couldnt watch any longer i closed my eyes and bowed my head listening to the thunder of my own heart pounding in my ears pounding my heart pounding i came out of the dream blinked opened my eyes my door rattled on its frame under a series of hammering blows susan woke up at the same time sitting up the blanket wed been curled under gliding down over the curves of her breasts it was still dark outside the longest candle hadnt yet burned away but the fire was down to embers again my body ached all over the dayafter ache of tired joints and muscles demanding time to recuperate i rose as the pounding went on and went to the kitchen drawer my had been lost in the battle with the gang of halfmad lycanthropes the year before and id replaced it with a mediumbarreled i must have been feeling insecure that day or something the gun weighed about two thousand pounds in my hand i made sure that it was loaded and turned to face the door susan pushed her hair out of her eyes blinked at my gun and backed away making damn sure she was out of my line of fire smart girl susan youre not going to have much luck breaking down that door i called out i didnt point the gun at the door yet never point a gun at anything you arent sure you want dead i replaced the original one with a steel door and a steel frame demons you know the pounding ceased dresden michael called from the other side of the door i tried to reach you on the phone but it must be off the hook weve got to talk i frowned and put the gun back in the drawer okay okay sheesh michael do you know what time it is time to work he answered the sun will be up shortly lunatic i mumbled susan looked around at the remains of our clothing scattered pretty much everywhere the sprawl of blankets and pillows and cushions all over the floor i think maybe ill just wait in your room she said right okay i opened the kitchen closet and got my heavy robe out the one i usually save for working in the lab and slipped into it stay covered up all right i dont want you to get sick she gave me a sleepy halfsmile and rose all long limbs and grace and interesting tan lines then vanished into my little bedroom and shut the door i walked across the room and opened the door for michael he stood there in blue jeans a flannel shirt and a fleecelined denim jacket he had his big gym bag slung over his shoulder and amoracchius was a silent tension i could just barely feel within it i looked from the bag to his face and asked trouble could be did you send someone to father forthill last night i rubbed at my eyes trying to get the sleep out of them coffee i needed coffee or a coke just as long as there was caffeine somewhere yes a girl named lydia she was worried that a ghost was after her he called me this morning something spent the night trying to get into the church i blinked at him what did it get inside he shook his head he didnt have time to tell me much can you come down there with me and take a look around i nodded and stepped back from the door give me a couple of minutes i headed for the icebox and got out a can of coke my fingers worked enough to open it at least though they still felt stiff my stomach reminded me that id been ignoring it and i got out the plate of cold cuts while i was there i swigged coke and made myself a big sandwich i looked up a minute later to see michael eyeing the destruction that had been the living room he nudged one of susans shoes with his foot and glanced up at me apologetically im sorry i didnt know anyone was here its okay michael smiled briefly then nodded well do i need to lecture you on sexual involvement before marriage i growled something about early morning and inconvenient visitors and toads michael only shook his head smiling while i wolfed down food did you tell her tell her what he lifted an eyebrow at me i rolled my eyes almost you almost told her sure got distracted michael nudged susans other shoe with his foot and let out a delicate cough so i see i finished the sandwich and part of the coke then walked across the room and slipped into the bedroom the room was freezing and i could see susan curled into a ball beneath the heavy blankets on my bed mister had lain down with his back against hers and watched me with sleepy selfsatisfied eyes as i came in rub it in fuzzball i growled at him and dressed quickly socks jeans tshirt heavy flannel work shirt over that moms amulet around my neck and a little silver charm bracelet with a halfdozen shields dangling off it fixed to my left wrist in place of the charm id given to lydia a plain silver ring its interior surface inscribed with a number of runes went onto my right hand both pieces of jewelry tingled with the enchantments id laid on them still fairly fresh i leaned over the bed and kissed susans cheek she made a sleepy murmuring sound and snuggled a little deeper beneath the covers i thought about getting under there with her and making sure she was nice and warm before leavingbut instead went out shutting the door carefully behind me michael and i left piling into his truck a white of course ford pickup with extra wheels and enough hauling power to move mountains and headed for saint mary of the angels saint mary of the angels is a big church i mean a big church its been looming over the wicker park area for more than eighty years and has seen the neighborhood grow up from a collection of cheap homes for immigrants mixed in with rich folks mansions to little bohemia today packed with yuppies and artsies success stories and wannabes the church im told is modeled after st peters basilica in romewhich is to say enormous and elegant and maybe a bit overdone it takes up an entire city block i mean sheesh the sun came up as we entered the parking lot i felt the golden rays slice across the morning skies the sudden subtle shift of forces playing about the world dawn is significant magically speaking it is a time of new beginnings magic isnt as simple as good and evil light and dark but theres a lot of correlations between the powers particular to night and the use of black magic we drove around to the rear parking lot of the church and got out of the truck michael walked in front of me carrying his bag i stuffed my hands down in the pockets of my duster as i followed him i felt uncomfortable approaching the churchnot for any weirdo quasimystical reason just because id never felt comfortable with churches in general the church had killed a lot of wizards in its day believing them in league with satan it felt strange to just be strolling up on business hi god its me harry please dont turn me into a pillar of salt harry michael said bringing me out of my reverie look he had stopped beside a pair of worn old cars parked in the back lot someone had done one hell of a job on them the windows had all been smashed their safety glass fractured and dented the hoods were dented as well the headlights lay mostly on the ground in front of the cars and all the tires were flat i walked around to the back of the cars frowning the taillights lay shattered on the ground the antenna had been torn off each car and were not in sight long scratches in three parallel rows ran down the sides of both cars well michael asked me i looked up at him and shrugged probably something got frustrated when it couldnt get inside the church he snorted do you think he adjusted the gym bag until amoracchiuss handle lay jutting outside the zipper any chances that its still around i shook my head i doubt it come daylight ghosts usually head back to the nevernever usually usually almost without exception michael eyed me and kept one hand on the hilt of the sword we walked on up to the delivery door compared to the grandeur of the churchs front it looked stunningly modest on either side of the double doors someone had gone to a lot of trouble to plant and care for a halfdozen rosebushes someone else had gone to a lot of trouble to tear them to shreds each plant had been uprooted thorny branches lay strewn across several dozen square yards around the door i crouched down beside several fallen branches picking them up one at a time squinting at them in the dawn dimness what are you looking for michael asked me blood on the thorns i said rose thorns can poke little holes in just about anythingand something that tore them up this hard would have been scratching itself on them any blood no no footprints in the earth either michael nodded a ghost then i squinted up at michael i hope not he tilted his head and frowned at me i dropped a branch and spread my hands a ghost can usually only manage to move things physically in bursts throwing pots and pans maybe really stretch things and stack up a bunch of books or something i gestured at the torn plants and then back toward the wrecked cars not only that but its limited to a certain place time or event the ghost if it is one followed lydia here and rampaged around on blessed ground tearing things apart i mean wow this thing is way stronger than any ghost ive ever heard about michaels frown deepened what are you saying harry im saying we might be getting out of our depth here look michael i know a lot about spooks and nasties but they arent my specialty or anything he frowned at me we might need to know more i stood up brushing myself off that i said is my specialty lets talk to father forthill michael knocked on the door it opened at once father forthill a greying man of slight build and only medium stature blinked anxiously up at us through a pair of wirerimmed spectacles his eyes were normally a shade of blue so bright as to rival robins eggs but today they were heavily underlined shadowed oh he said oh michael thank the lord he opened the door wider and michael stepped over the threshold the two embraced forthill kissed michael on either cheek and stepped back to peer at me and harry dresden professional wizard ive never had anyone ask me to bless a fivegallon drum into holy water before mr dresden michael peered at me evidently surprised that the priest and i knew each other i shrugged a little embarrassed and said you told me i could count on him in a pinch and so you can forthill said his blue eyes sparkling for a moment behind the spectacles i trust you have no complaints about the blessed water none at all i said talk about your surprised ghouls harry michael chided youve been keeping secrets again contrary to what charity thinks michael i dont go running to the phone to call you every time i have a little problem i clapped michael on the shoulder in passing and offered my hand to father forthill who shook it gravely no hug and kiss on each cheek for me forthill smiled up at me i look forward to the day when you give your life to god mr dresden he can use men with your courage i tried to smile but it probably looked a little sickly look father id love to talk about it with you sometime but were here for a reason indeed forthill said the sparkle in his eyes faded and his manner became absolutely serious he began to walk down a clean hallway with dark heavy beams of old wood overhanging it and paintings of the saints on the walls we kept pace with him the young woman arrived yesterday just before sunset was she all right i asked he lifted both eyebrows all right i should say not all the signs of an abused personality borderline malnutrition she had a lowgrade fever as well and hadnt bathed recently she looked as though she might be going through withdrawal from something i frowned yeah she looked like she was in pretty bad shape i briefly recounted my conversation with lydia and my decision to help her father forthill shook his head i provided fresh clothes and a meal for her and was getting set to put her to bed on a spare cot at the back of the rectory thats when it happened what happened she began to shake forthill said her eyes rolled back into her head she was still sitting at the dinner table and spilled her soup onto the floor i thought she was having a seizure of some sort and tried to hold her down and to get something into her mouth to keep her from biting her tongue he sighed clasping his hands behind his back as he walked im afraid that i was of little help to the poor child the fit seemed to pass in a few moments but she still trembled and had gone absolutely pale cassandras tears i said or narcotic withdrawal forthill said either way she needed help i moved her to the cot she begged me not to leave her so i sat down and began to read part of st matthews gospel to her she seemed to calm somewhat but she had such a look in her eyes the old priest sighed that resolved look that they get when theyre sure that theyre lost despair and in one so young when did the attack begin i asked about ten minutes later the priest said it started with the most terrible howling of wind lord preserve me but i was sure the windows would rattle out of their frames then we started to hear sounds outside he swallowed terrible sounds something walking back and forth heavy footsteps and then it started calling her name the priest folded his arms and rubbed his palms against either arm i rose and addressed the being and asked its name but it only laughed at me i began to compel it by the holy word and it went quite mad we could hear it crushing things outside i dont mind telling you that it was quite the most terrifying experience i have ever had in my life the girl tried to leave to go out to it she said that she didnt want me harming myself that it would only find her in any case well i forbade her of course and refused to let her past me it kept on outside and i kept on reading the word aloud to the girl it waited outside i could feel it but could see nothing outside the windows such a darkness and every so often it would destroy something else and wed hear the sound of it after several hours it seemed to grow quiet the girl went to sleep i walked the halls to make sure all the doors and windows were still closed and when i came back she was gone gone i asked gone as in left or as in just gone forthill gave me a smile that looked a bit shaky the back door was unlocked though shed shut it after herself the older man shook his head i called michael at once of course weve got to find that girl i said forthill shook his head his expression grave mr dresden i am certain that only the power of the almighty kept us safe within these walls last night i wont argue with you father but if you could have sensed this creatures anger its rage mr dresden i would not wish to encounter this being outside of a church without seeking gods help in the matter i jerked a thumb at michael i did seek gods help heck is one knight of the cross not enough i could always put out the batsignal for the other two forthill smiled thats not what i meant and you know it but as you wish you must come to your own decision he turned to michael and me both and said i hope gentlemen that i can trust your discretion on this matter the police report will doubtless reflect that persons unknown perpetuated the vandalism i snorted a little white lie father i felt bad the minute id said it but heck i get tired of the conversion efforts every time i show up evil gains power from fear mr dresden forthill replied within the church we have agencies for dealing with these matters he put a hand on michaels shoulder briefly but spreading word of it to everyone even to all of the brethren would accomplish nothing but to frighten many people and to make the enemy that much more able to do harm i nodded at the priest i like that attitude father you almost sound like a wizard his eyebrows shot up but then he broke into a quiet weary laugh be careful both of you and may god go with you he made the sign of the cross over both of us and i felt the quiet stirring of power just as i sometimes did around michael faith michael and forthill exchanged a few quiet words about michaels family while i lurked in the background forthill arranged to christen the new baby whenever charity delivered they exchanged hugs again forthill shook my hand businesslike and friendly and we left outside michael watched me as we walked back to his truck well he asked whats next i frowned and stuffed my hands into my pockets the sun was higher now painting the sky blue the clouds white i know someone whos pretty close to the spooks around here that psychic in oldtown michael scowled and spat the necromancer i snorted hes no necromancer he can barely call up a ghost and talk to it hes got to fake it most of the time besides had he been a real necromancer the white council would already have hounded him down and beheaded him doubtless the man i was thinking of had already been visited by at least one warden and warned of the consequences of dabbling too much into the dark arts if hes so inept why speak to him at all hes probably closer to the spirit world than anyone else in town other than me i mean ill send out bob too and see what kind of information he can run down were bound to have different contacts michael frowned at me i dont trust this business of communing with spirits harry if father forthill and the others knew about this familiar of yours bob isnt a familiar i shot back he performs the same function doesnt he i snorted familiars work for free ive got to pay bob pay him he asked his tone suspicious pay what mostly romance novels sometimes i splurge on a michael looked pained harry i really dont want to know isnt there some way that you could work some kind of spell here instead of relying upon these unholy beings i sighed and shook my head sorry michael if it was a demon it would have left footprints and maybe some kind of psychic trail i could follow but im pretty sure this was pure spirit and a goddamned strong one harry michael said voice stern sorry i forgot ghosts dont usually inhabit a constructa magical body theyre just energy they dont leave any physical traces behindat least none that last for hours at a time if it was here i could tell you all kinds of things about it probably and work magic on it directly but its not here so michael sighed very well i will put out the word to those i know to be on the lookout for the girl lydia you said her name was yeah i described her to michael and she had a charm on her wrist the one id been wearing the past few nights would it protect her michael asked i shrugged from something as mean as this thing sounded i dont know weve got to find out who this ghost was when it was alive and shut it down which still will not tell us who or what is stirring up the spirits of the city michael unlocked his truck and we got inside thats what i like about you michael youre always thinking so positively he grinned at me faith harry god has a way of seeing to it that things fall into place he started driving and i leaned back in my seat and closed my eyes first off to see the psychic then to send bob out to find out more about what looked to be the most dangerous ghost id seen in a long time and then to keep on looking for whoever it was behind all the spooky goingson and to rap them politely on the head until they stopped easy as one two three sure i whimpered sunk down in my seat a little more and wished that i had kept my aching sore self in bed chapter ten mortimer lindquist had tried to give his house that gothic feel greyish gargoyles stood at the corners of his roof black iron gates glowered at the front of his house and statuary lined the walk to his front door long grass had overgrown his yard if his house hadnt been a redroofed whitewalled stucco transplant from somewhere in southern california it might have worked the results looked more like the haunted mansion at disneyland than an ominous abode of a speaker to the dead the black iron gates stood surrounded by plain chainlink fence the gargoyles on closer inspection proved to be plastic reproductions the statuary too had the rough outlines of plaster rather than the clean sweeping profile of marble you could have plopped a pink flamingo down right in the middle of the unmowed weeds and it would have somehow matched the decor but i supposed at night with the right lighting and the right attitude some people might have believed it i shook my head and lifted my hand to rap on the door it opened before my knuckles touched it and a wellrounded set of shoulders below a shining balding head backed through the doorway grunting i stepped to one side the little man tugged an enormous suitcase out onto the porch never taking notice of me his florid face streaked with perspiration i sidled into the doorway as he turned to lug the bag out to the gate muttering to himself under his breath i shook my head and went on into the house the door was a business entrancethere was no tingling sensation of crossing the threshold of a dwelling uninvited the front room reminded me of the houses exterior lots of black curtains draped down over the walls and doorways red and black candles squatted all over the place a grinning human skull leered from a bookshelf straining to contain copies of the encyclopedia britannica with the lettering scraped off their spines the skull was plastic too morty had a table set up in the room several chairs around it with a highbacked chair at the rear wood that had actually been carved with a number of monstrous beings i took a seat in the chair folded my hands on the table in front of me and waited the little man came back in wiping at his face with a bandana handkerchief sweating and panting shut the door i said we need to talk morty he squealed and whirled around yyou he stammered dresden what are you doing here i stared at him come in morty he came closer but left the door open in spite of his pudginess he moved with the nervous energy of a spooked cat his white business shirt showed stains beneath his arms reaching halfway to his belt look dresden i told you guys beforei get the rules right i haven been doing anything you guys talked about aha the white council had sent someone to see him morty was a professional con i hadnt planned on getting any honest answers out of him without a lot of effort maybe i could play this angle and save myself a lot of work let me tell you something morty when i come into a place and dont say a thing except lets talk and the first thing i hear is i didnt do it it makes me think that the person im talking to must have done something you know what im saying his florid face lost several shades of red no way man look ive got nothing to do with whats been going on not my fault none of my business man with whats been going on i said i looked down at my folded hands for a moment and then back up at him whats the suitcase for morty you do something that means you need to leave town for a while he swallowed thick neck working look dresden mister dresden my sister got sick see im just going to help her out sure you are i said thats what youre doing going out of town to help your sick sister i swear to god morty said lifting a hand his face earnest i pointed at the chair across from me sit down morty id like to but i got a cab coming he turned toward the door ventas servitas i hissed nice and dramatic and threw some will at the door sudden wind slammed it shut right in front of his eyes he squeaked and backed up several paces staring at the door then whirling to face me i used the remnants of the same spell to push out a chair opposite me sit down morty ive got a few questions now if you cut the crap youll make your cab and if not i left the words hanging one thing about intimidation is that people can always think up something worse that you could do to them than you can if you leave their imagination some room to play he stared at me and swallowed again his jowls jiggling then he moved to the chair as though he expected chains to fly out of it and tie him down the moment he sat he balanced his weight on the very edge of the chair licked his lips and watched me probably trying to figure out the best lies for the questions he expected you know i said ive read your books morty ghosts of chicago the spook factor two or three others you did good work there his expression changed eyes narrowing in suspicion thank you i mean twenty years ago you were a pretty damn good investigator sensitivity to spiritual energies and apparitionsghosts what we call an ectomancer in the business yeah he said his eyes softened a little if not his voice he avoided looking directly in my face most people do that was a long time ago i kept my voice in the same tone the same expression and now what you run seances for people how many times do you actually get to contact a spirit one time in ten one in twenty must be a real letdown from the actual stuff playacting i mean he was good at covering his expressions ill give him that but im used to watching people i saw anger in the way he held his neck and shoulders i provide a legitimate service to people in need no you play on their grief to take them for all you can you dont believe that youre doing right morty deep down you can justify it any way you want but you dont like what youre doing if you did your powers wouldnt have faded like they have his jaw set in a hard line and he didnt try to hide the anger anymorethe first honest reaction id seen out of him since hed cried out in surprise if youve got a point dresden get to it ive got a plane to catch i spread my fingers over the tabletop in the past two weeks i said the spooks have been going mad you should see the trouble theyve caused that poltergeist in the campbell house the basement beast at u of c agatha hagglethorn down at cook county morty grimaced and wiped at his face again yeah i hear things you and the knight of the sword have been covering the worst of it what else has been happening morty im getting a little cranky losing sleep so keep it short and simple i dont know he said sullen ive lost my powers remember i narrowed my eyes but you hear things morty youve still got some sources in the nevernever why are you leaving town he laughed and it had a shaky edge to it you said you read all of my books did you read they shall rise i glanced over it endoftheworldtype stuff i figured you had been talking to the wrong kind of spirits too much they love trying to sell people on armageddon a lot of them are cons like you he ignored me then you read my theory on the barrier between our world and the nevernever that its slowly being torn away and you think its falling to pieces now morty that wall has been there since the dawn of time i dont think its going to collapse right now wall he said the word with a sneer more like saran wrap wizard like jello it bends and wiggles and stirs he rubbed his palms on his thighs shivering and its falling now look around you he shouted good god wizard the past two weeks the borders been waggling back and forth like a hooker at a dockworkers convention why the hell do you think all of these ghosts have been rising i didnt let the sudden volume of his tone make me blink youre saying that this instability has been making it easier for ghosts to cross over from the nevernever and easier to form bigger stronger ghosts when people die he said you think youve got some pissedoff ghosts now wait until some honor student on her way out of the south side with a college scholarship gets popped by accident in a gang shootout wait until some poor sap who got aids from a blood transfusion breathes his last bigger badder ghosts i said superghosts thats what youre talking about he laughed a nasty little laugh new generation of viruses is coming too things are going to hell all over eventually that borders going to get thin enough to spit through and youll have more problems with demon attacks than gang violence i shook my head all right i said lets say that i buy that the barrier is fluid rather than concrete theres turbulence in it and its making crossing over easier both ways could something be causing the turbulence how the hell should i know he snarled you dont know what its like dresden to speak to things that exist in the past and in the future as well as in the now to have them walk up to you at the salad bar and start telling you how they murdered their wife in her sleep i mean you think youve got a hold on things that you understand but in the end it all falls to pieces a con is simpler dresden you make order people dont give a flying fuck if uncle jeffrey really forgives them for missing his last birthday party they want to know that the world is a place where uncle jeffrey can and should forgive them he swallowed and looked around the room at the fake tomes and the fake skull thats what i sell them closure like on television they want to know that its all going to work out in the end and theyre happy to pay for it a car honked outside morty glared at me were through i nodded he jerked to his feet splotches of color in his cheeks god i need a drink get out of town dresden something came across last night like nothing ive ever felt i thought of ruined cars and rosebushes planted in consecrated ground do you know what it is its big morty said and its pissed off its going to start killing dresden and i dont think you or anyone else is going to be able to stop it but its a ghost he gave me a smile that showed me his canines it was creepy on that florid eyestoowide face its a nightmare he started to turn away i wanted to let him go but i couldnt the man had become a liar a sniveling con but he hadnt always been i rose and beat him to the door taking his arm in one hand he spun to face me jerking his arm away glaring defiantly at my eyes i avoided locking gazes i didnt want to take a look at mortimer lindquists soul morty i said quietly get away from your seances for a while go somewhere quiet read relax youre older now stronger if you give yourself a chance the power will come back he laughed again tired and jaded sure dresden just like that morty he turned away from me and stalked out the door he didnt bother to lock the place up behind him i watched him head out to the cab which waited by the curb he lugged his bag into the backseat and then followed it before the cab pulled out he rolled down the window dresden he called under my chair theres a drawer my notes if you want to kill yourself trying to stand up to this thing you might as well know what youre getting into he rolled the window back up as the cab pulled away i watched it go then went back inside i found the drawer hidden in the base of the carved wooden chair and inside i found a trio of old leatherbound journals vellum pages covered in script that started out neat in the oldest one and became a jerky scrawl in the most recent entries i held the books up to my mouth and inhaled the smell of leather ink paper musty and genuine and real morty hadnt had to give me the notes maybe there was some root of the person he had been deep down somewhere that wasnt dead yet maybe id done him a little good with that advice id like to think that i blew out a breath found a phone and called a cab of my own i needed to get the beetle out of impound if i could maybe murphy could fix it for me i gathered the journals and went to the porch to wait for the cab shutting the door behind me something big was coming through town morty had said a nightmare i said out loud could mort be right could the barrier between the spirit world and our own be falling apart the thought made me shudder something had been formed something big and mean and my gut instinct told me that it had a purpose all power no matter how terrible or benign whether its wielder is aware of it or not has a purpose so this nightmare was here for something i wondered what it wanted wondered what it would do and worried that all too soon i would find out chapter eleven an unmarked car sat in my driveway with two nondescript men inside i got out of the taxi paid off the cabby and nodded at the driver of the car detective rudolph rudys cleancut good looks hadnt faded in the year since hed started with special investigations chicagos unspoken answer to the officially unacknowledged world of the supernatural but the time had hardened him a bit made him a little less white around the eyes rudolph nodded back not even trying to hide his glower he didnt like me maybe it had something to do with the bust several months back rudy had cut and run rather than stick it out next to me before that id escaped police custody while he was supposed to be watching me id had a darn good reason to escape and it wasnt really fair of him to hold that against me but hey whatever got him through the day heya detective i said whats up get in the car rudolph said i planted my feet and shoved my hands in my pockets with a certain nonchalance am i under arrest rudolph narrowed his eyes and started to speak again but the man in the passenger seat cut him off heya harry detective sergeant john stallings said nodding at me how you doing john what brings you out today murph wanted us to ask you down to a scene he reached up and scratched at several days worth of unshaven beard beneath a bad haircut and intelligent dark eyes hope you got the time we tried at your office but you havent been in so she sent us down here to wait for you i shifted mort lindquists books in my arms im busy today can it wait rudolph spat the lieutenant says she wants you down there now you get your ass down there now stallings gave rudolph a look and then rolled his eyes for my benefit look harry murphy told me to tell you that this one was personal i frowned personal eh he spread his hands its what she said he frowned and then added its micky malone i got a sickly little feeling in my stomach dead stallingss jaw twitched youd better come see for yourself i closed my eyes and tried not to get frustrated i didnt have time for detours it would take me hours to grind through morts notes and sundown when the spirits would be able to cross over from the nevernever would come swiftly but murphy did plenty for me i owed her shed saved my life a couple of times and vice versa she was my main source of income too karrin murphy headed up special investigations a post that had traditionally resulted in a couple of months of bumbling and then a speedy exit from the police force murphy hadnt bumbledinstead shed hired the services of chicagos only professional wizard as a consultant she was getting to where she had a pretty good grasp on the local preternatural predators at least the most common of them but when things got hairy she still called me in technically i show up on the paperwork as an investigative consultant i guess the computer records system doesnt have numerical codes for demon banishment divination spells or exorcisms si had gone toe to toe with one of the worst things anyone but a wizard like me was ever likely to see only the year beforea halfton of indestructible loupgarou theyd taken some serious casualties six dead including murphys partner micky malone had gotten hamstrung hed gone through therapy and had come along for one last job when michael and i took down that demonsummoning sorcerer after that though hed decided that his limp was going to keep him from being a good cop and retired on disability i felt guilty for thatmaybe irrational true but if id been a little smarter or a little faster maybe i could have saved those peoples lives and maybe i could have saved mickys health no one else saw it that way but i did all right i said give me a second to put these away the ride was quiet except for a little meaningless chatter from stallings rudolph ignored me i closed my eyes and ached along the way rudolphs radio squawked and then fell abruptly silent i could smell burnt rubber or something and knew that it was likely my fault i opened one eye and saw rudolph scowling back at me in the mirror i halfsmiled and closed my eyes again jerk the car stopped in a residential neighborhood near west armitage down in bucktown the district had gotten its name from the number of immigrant homes once there and the goats kept in peoples front yards the homes had been tiny affairs stuffed with toolarge families and children bucktown had been lived in for a century and it was all grown up literally the houses on their tiny lots hadnt had much room to expand out so theyd grown up instead giving the neighborhood a stretched elongated look the trees were ancient oaks and sycamores and decorated the tiny yards in stately majesty except where theyd been roughly hacked back from power lines and rooftops shadows fell in sharp slants from all the tall trees and tall houses turning the streets and sidewalks into candy canes of light and darkness one of the houses a twostory whiteonwhite number had its small driveway full and another halfdozen cars parked out on the street plus murphys motorcycle leaning on its kickstand in the front yard rudolph pulled the car up alongside the curb across the street from that house and killed the engine it went on rattling and coughing for a moment before it died i got out of the car and felt something wrong an uneasy feeling ran over me prickles of sensation along the nape of my neck and against my spine i stood there for a minute frowning while rudolph and stallings got out of the car i looked around the neighborhood trying to pin down the source of the odd sensations the leaves in the trees all in their autumn motley rustled and sighed in the wind occasionally falling dried leaves rattled and scraped over the streets cars drove by in the distance a jet rumbled overhead a deep and distant sound dresden rudolph snapped lets go i lifted a hand extending my senses out pushing my perception out along with my will hang on a second i said i need to i quit trying to speak and searched for the source of the sensation what the hell was it fucking showboat rudolph growled i heard him start toward me hang on kid stallings said let the man work weve both seen what he can do i havent seen shit that cant be explained rudolph growled but he stayed put i drifted across the street to the yard of the house in question and found the first body in the fallen leaves five feet to my left a small yellowandwhite furred cat lay there twisted so that its forelegs faced one way its hindquarters the opposite something had broken its neck i felt a pang of nausea death isnt ever pretty really its worst with people but with the animals that are close to mankind it seems to be a little nastier than it might be elsewhere in the wild kingdom the cat couldnt have reached its full growth yetmaybe a kitten from early in the spring roaming the neighborhood there was no collar on its neck i could feel a little cloud of disturbance around it a kind of psychic energy left by traumatic agonizing and torturous events but this one little thing one animals death shouldnt have been enough to make me aware of it all the way over from my seat in the police car five feet farther on i found a dead bird i found its wings in two more places then two more birds without heads then something that had been small and furry and was now small and furry and squishymaybe a vole or a ground squirrel and there were more a lot moreall in all maybe a dozen dead animals in the front yard a dozen little patches of violent energies still lingering no single one of them would have been enough to disturb my wizards sense but all of them together had so what the hell had been killing these animals i rubbed my palms over my arms a sickly little feeling of dread rolling through me i looked up to see rudolph and stallings following me around their faces looked kind of greenish jesus stallings said he prodded the body of the cat with one toe what did this i shook my head and rolled my shoulders in a shrug it might take me a while to find out wheres micky inside well then i said and stood up brushing off my hands lets go chapter twelve i stopped outside the doorway micky malone owned a nice house his wife taught elementary school they wouldnt have been able to afford the place on his salary alone but together they managed the hardwood floors gleamed with polish i saw an original painting a seascape hanging on one of the walls of the living room adjacent to the entryway there were a lot of plants a lot of greenery that along with the wood grain of the floors gave the place a rich organic glow it was one of those places that wasnt just a house it was a home come on dresden rudolph snapped the lieutenant is waiting is mrs malone here i asked yes go get her i need her to invite me in what rudolph said give me a break who are you count dracula drakul is still in eastern europe last time we checked i replied but i need her or micky to ask me in if you want me to do anything for you what the hell are you talking about i sighed look homes places that people live in and love and have built a life in have a kind of power of their own if a bunch of strangers had been trouping in and out all day i wouldnt have any trouble with the threshold but youre not you guys are friends like murphy had saidthis one was personal stallings frowned so you cant come in oh i could come in i said but id be leaving most of what i can do at the door the threshold would mess with me being able to work any forces in the house what shit rudolph snorted count dracula harry stallings said cant we invite you in no has to be someone who lives there besides its polite i said i dont like to go places where im not welcome id feel a lot better if i knew it was all right with mrs malone for me to be here rudolph opened his mouth to spit venom on me again but stallings cut him off just do it rudy go get sonia and bring her back here rudolph glowered but did what he was told going into the house stallings tapped out a cigarette and lit up he puffed for a second thoughtfully so you cant do magic inside a house unless someone asks you in not a house i said a home theres a difference so what about victor sellss place i hear you took him on right i shook my head hed screwed up his threshold he was running his business out of it using the place for dark ceremonies it wasnt a home anymore so you cant mess with anything on its own turf cant mess with mortals no monsters dont get a threshold why not how the hell should i know i said they just dont i cant know everything right guess so stallings said and after a minute he nodded sure i see what you mean so it shuts you down not completely but it makes it a lot harder to do anything like wearing a lead suit thats why vampires have to keep out other nasties like that if you give them that much of a handicap they have trouble just staying alive much less using any freaky powers stallings shook his head this magic crap i never would have believed it before i came here i still have trouble with it yeah thats good means you arent running into it too much he blew out twin columns of smoke from his nostrils could be changing last couple of days weve had some people go missing bums street people folks some of the cops and detectives know i frowned yeah yeah its all rumors so far and people like that they can just be gone the next day but since i started working si stuff like that makes me nervous i frowned and debated telling stallings what i knew about biancas party doubtless there would be a whole flock of vampires in from out of town for the event maybe she and her flunkies were rounding up hors doeuvres but i had no proof of thatfor all i knew the disappearances if they were disappearances could be related to the turbulence in the nevernever if so the cops couldnt do anything about it and if it was something else i could be starting a very nasty exchange with bianca i didnt want to sic the cops on her for no reason im pretty sure bianca had the resources to send them back at meand she could probably make it look like id done something to deserve it too besides that in the circles of the supernatural community an old world code of conduct still ruled when you have a problem you settle it face to face within the circle you dont bring in the cops and the other mortals as weapons theyre the nuclear missiles of the supernatural world if you show people a supernatural brawl going on its going to scare the snot out of them and the next thing you know theyre burning everything and everyone in sight most people wouldnt care that one scary guy might have been right and the other was wrong both guys are scary so you ace both of them and sleep better at night it had been that way since the dawn of the age of reason and the rising power of mortal kind and more power to the people i say i hated all these bullies vampires demons and bloodthirsty old deities rampaging around like they ruled the world never mind that until a few centuries ago they really had in any case i decided to keep my mouth shut about biancas gathering until i knew enough to be certain either way stallings and i made small talk until sonia malone appeared at the door she was a woman of medium height comfortably overweight and solidlooking her face would have been gorgeous when she was a young woman and it still carried that beauty refined by years of selfconfidence and steady reliability her eyes were reddened and she wore no makeup but her features seemed composed she wore a simple dress in a floral print her only jewelry the wedding band on her finger mr dresden she said politely micky told me that you saved his life last year i coughed and looked down though i guess that was true technically i still didnt see it that way we all did everything we could maam your husband was very brave detective rudolph said that i needed to invite you in i dont want to go where im not welcome maam i replied sonia wrinkled up her nose and eyed stallings put that out sergeant stallings dropped the cigarette and mushed it out with his foot all right mr dresden she said for a moment her composure faltered and her lips began to tremble she closed her eyes and took a deep breath smoothing over her features then opened her eyes again if you can help my micky please come in i invite you thank you i said i stepped forward through the door and felt the silent tension of the threshold parting around me like a beaded curtain rimed with frost we went through a living room where several cops people i knew from si sat around talking quietly it reminded me of a funeral they looked up at me as i went by and talk ceased i nodded to them and we went on past to a staircase leading up to the second floor he was up late last night she told me her voice quiet sometimes he cant sleep and he didnt come to bed until late i got up early but i didnt want to wake him so i let him sleep in mrs malone stopped at the top of the stairs and pointed down the hall at a closed door ththere she said im sorry i ccant she took another deep breath i need to see about lunch are you hungry oh yes sure all right she said and retreated back down the stairs i swallowed and looked at the door at the end of the hall then headed toward it my steps sounded loud in my own ears i knocked gently on the door karrin murphy opened it she wasnt anyones idea of a leader of a group of cops charged with solving every bizarre crime that fell between the lines of the law enforcement system she didnt look like someone who would stand with her feet planted putting tiny silver bullets into an oncoming freight train of a loupgarou eitherbut she was karrin looked up at me from her fivefootnothing in height her blue eyes normally clear and bright looked sunken shed shoved her golden hair under a baseball cap and wore jeans and a white tshirt her shoulder harness wrinkled the cotton around the shoulder where her side arm hung lines stood out like cracks in a sunbaked field around her mouth her eyes hi harry she said her voice too was quiet gruff hiya murph you dont look so good she tried to smile it looked ghastly i i didnt know who else to call i frowned troubled on any other day murphy would have returned my mildly insulting comment with compounded interest she opened the door farther and let me in i remembered micky malone as an energetic man of medium height balding with a broad smile and a nose that peeled in the sun if he walked outside to get his morning paper the cane and limp were additions too recent for me to have firmly stuck in my memory micky wore old quality suits and was careful never to get the jackets messy or his wife would never let him hear the end of it i didnt remember micky with a fixed toothbaring grin and eyes spread out in that helterskelter gleam of madness i didnt remember him covered in small scratches or his fingernails crusted with his own blood or his wrists and ankles cuffed to the ironframed bed he panted grinning around the neatly decorated little room i could smell sweat and urine there were no lights on in the room and the curtains had been drawn over the windows leaving it in a brownish haze he turned his head toward me and his eyes widened he sucked in a breath and threw back his head in a long falsettopitched scream like a coyotes then he started laughing and rocking back and forth jerking on the steel restraints making the bed shake in a steady squeaking rhythm sonia called us this morning murphy said toneless shed locked herself into her closet and had a cellular we got here right before micky finished breaking down the closet door she called the cops no she called me said she didnt want them to see micky like this that it would ruin him i shook my head damn brave lady and hes been like this ever since yeah he was just crazy mean screaming and spitting and biting has he said anything i asked not a word murphy said animal noises she crossed her arms and looked up at me at my eyes for a second before looking away what happened to him harry micky giggled and started bouncing his hips up and down on the bed as he rocked making it sound as though a couple of hyperkinetic teenagers were coupling there my stomach turned no wonder mrs malone hadnt been willing to come back into this room you better give me a minute to find out i said could he be you know possessed like in the movies i dont know yet murph could it be some kind of spell murphy i dont know dammit harry she snapped youd damned well better find out she clenched her fists and shook with suppressed fury i put my hand on her shoulder i will give me some time with him harry i swear if you cant help him her voice caught in her throat and tears sparkled in her eyes hes one of mine dammit easy murph i told her making my voice as gentle as i knew how i opened the door for her go get some coffee all right ill see what i can do she glanced up at me and then back at malone its okay micky she said were all here for you you wont be alone micky malone gave her that fixed grin and then licked his lips before bursting out into another chorus of giggles murphy shivered and then walked out of the room her head bowed and left me alone with the madman chapter thirteen i drew up a chair beside the bed and sat down micky stared at me with whiterimmed eyes i rummaged around in the inside pocket of my duster i had some chalk there in case i needed to draw a circle a candle and some matches a couple of old receipts not much magically speaking to work with hi there micky i said can you hear me in there micky broke out in another fit of giggles i made sure to keep my eyes away from his hells bells i did not want to get drawn into a soulgaze with micky malone at the moment all right micky i said keeping my voice calm low like you do with animals im going to touch youokay i think ill be able to tell if theres anything inside of you if i do im not going to hurt you so dont freak out as i spoke i reached out a hand toward his bare arm and laid it lightly upon mickys skin he was feverhot to the touch i could sense some kind of force at work on himnot the tingling energy of a practitioners aura or the oceandeep power of michaels faith but it was there nonetheless some kind of cold crawling energy oozed over him what the hell it didnt feel like any kind of spell id ever experienced and it wasnt a possession i was sure of that i would have been able to sense any kind of spiritbeing in him through a physical touch micky stared at me for a second and then thrust his head at my hand his teeth making snapping motions i jerked back even though he couldnt have reached me someone trying to bite you makes you react more than if they take a punch at you biting is just more primal spooky micky started giggling again rocking the bed back and forth all right i breathed im going to have to get a little desperate here if you werent a friend micky i closed my eyes for a moment steeling myself then focused my will into a spot right between my eyebrows only a little higher i felt the tension gather there the pressure and when i opened my eyes again id opened my wizards sight too the sight is a blessing and a curse it lets you see things things you couldnt normally see with my sight i can see even the most ethereal of spirits i can see the energies of life stirring and moving running like blood through the world between the earth and the sky between water and fire enchantments stand out like cords braided from fiberoptic cables or maybe las vegasquality neon depending on how complicated or powerful they are you can sometimes see the demons that walk among mankind in human form this way or the angels you see things the way they really are in spirit and in soul as well as in body the problem is that anything you see stays with you no matter how horrible no matter how revolting no matter how madnessinducing or terrifyingit stays with you forever always right there in your mind in full technicolor never fading or becoming easier to bear sometimes you see things that are so beautiful you want to keep them with you always but more often in my line of work you see things like micky malone he was dressed in boxers and a white undershirt stained with bits of blood and sweat and worse but when i turned my sight on him i saw something different he had been ravaged torn apart he was missing flesh everywhere something had attacked him and taken out sections of him in huge bites id seen pictures of people whod been attacked by sharks had hunks of meat just taken gone thats what micky looked like it wasnt visible to the flesh but something had torn his mind and maybe his soul to bloody shreds he bled and bled endlessly never staining the sheets and wound around him starting at his throat and running down to one ankle was a strand of black wire oversized barbs gouging into his flesh the ends disappearing seamlessly into his skin just like agatha hagglethorn i stared at him horrified my stomach writhing and heaving i had to fight to keep from throwing up micky looked up at me and seemed to sense something was different because he went abruptly still his smile didnt look mad to me anymore it looked agonized like a grimace of pain twisted and cranked until the muscles of his face were at the snapping point his lips moved shook his whole face writhing with the expression uh uh uh he moaned its all right micky i said i clasped my hands together to keep them from shaking im here hurts he breathed at last barely a whisper it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts he went on and on repeating it until he ran out of breath then he squeezed his eyes shut tears welled out and he broke into another helpless maddened giggle what the hell could i do for that the barbed wire had to be a spell of some kind but it didnt look like anything i had ever seen before most magic throbbed and pulsed with light life even if it was being used for malevolent purposes magic comes from life from the energy of our world and from people from their emotions and their will thats what i had always been taught but that barbed wire was dull flat matteblack i reached out to touch it and it almost seared my fingers with how cold it was micky god i couldnt imagine what he must have been going through the smart thing to do would have been to fall back i could get bob and work on this research it figure out how to get the wire from around micky without hurting him but he had already been suffering through this for hours he might not make it through many morehis sanity was going to be hardpressed to survive the spiritual mauling he had taken adding another day of this torture onto it all might send him someplace from where hed never come back i closed my eyes and took a breath i hope im right micky i told him im going to try to make it stop hurting he let out a whimpering little giggle staring up at me i decided to start at his ankle i swallowed steeling myself again and reached down getting my fingers between the burning cold barbed wire and his skin i clenched my teeth forcing will power into the touch enough to be able to touch the material of the spell around him then i started pulling slowly at first and then harder the metal strands burned into me my fingers never went numbthey just began to ache more and more violently the barbed wire resisted barbs clinging at mickys flesh the poor man screamed aloud agonized though there was that horrible tortured laughter added to it as well i felt tears burn into my eyes from the pain from mickys scream but i kept pulling the end of the wire tore free of his flesh i kept pulling barb by barb inch by inch i tore the wirespell free drawing it up through his flesh at times pulling that dead cold energy away from micky he screamed until he ran out of breath and i heard whimpers coming from somewhere else in the room i guess it was me i started using both hands struggling against the cold magic finally the other end slithered free from mickys neck his eyes flew open wide and then he sagged down letting out a low exhausted moan i gasped and stumbled back from the bed keeping the wire in my hands it suddenly twisted and spun like a serpent and one end plunged into my throat ice cold endless bitter aching cold coursed through me and i screamed i heard footsteps running down the hall outside a voice calling out the wire whipped and thrashed around the other end darting toward the floor and i seized it in both hands twisted it up and away from attaching itself at the other end the loose strands near my neck started rippling cold barbs digging into me through my clothes my skin as the dark energy tried to attach itself to me the door burst open murphy came through it her eyes living flames of azure blue her hair a golden coronet around her she held a blazing sword in her hand and she shone so bright and beautiful and terrifying in her anger that it was hard to see the sight i realized dimly i was seeing her for who she was harry what the hell i struggled against the wire knowing that she couldnt see it or feel it gasping the window murph open the window she didnt hesitate for a second but crossed the floor and threw open the window i staggered after her winding the frozen wire around one hand my mind screaming with the agony of it i fought it down dragged it into a coil my face twisted into a snarl as i did it anger surged up hot and bright and i reached for that power as i jerked the wire from my throat and threw it out the window as hard as i could sending it sailing into the air i snarled jabbed a finger at it took all that anger and fear and sent it coursing out of me toward that dark spell fuego fire came to my call roared forth from my fingertips and engulfed the wire it writhed and then vanished in a detonation that rattled the house around me and sent me tumbling back to the floor i lay there for a minute stunned trying to get a handle on what was happening damn the sight it starts blurring the lines between whats real and what isnt a guy would go crazy that way fast just keep it open all the time and let everything pour in and really know what everything is like that sounded like a good idea really just bask in all the beauty and horror for a while just drink it all in and let it erase everything else all that bother and worry about people being hurt or not being hurt i found myself sitting on the floor aching from cold that had no basis in physical reality giggling to myself in a highpitched stream rocking back and forth i had to struggle to close my sight again and the second i did everything seemed to settle to become clearer i looked up blinking tears out of my eyes panting outside dogs were barking all over the place and i could hear several car alarms whooping touched off by the force of the blast murphy stood over me her eyes wide her gun held in one hand and pointed at the door jesus she said softly harry what happened my lips felt numb and i was freezing all over shaking spell ssomething attacked him llaid a spell on him after hhad to burn it fire even burns in thesspirit world ssorry she put the gun away staring at me are you all right i shook some more hhows micky murphy crossed the room to lay a hand on mickys brow his fevers gone she breathed mick she called gently hey malone its murph can you hear me micky stirred and blinked open his eyes murph he asked quietly whats going on his eyes fell closed again exhausted wheres sonia i need her ill get her murphy breathed you wait here rest my wrists hurt micky mumbled murphy looked back at me and i nodded to her he should be all right now she unfastened the cuffs from him but it looked as though he had already fallen into a deep exhausted sleep murphy drew the covers up over him and smoothed his hair back from his forehead then she knelt down on the floor beside me harry she said you look like hell i said yeah i know hes going to need rest murph peace something tore him up inside real bad what do you mean i frowned its like when someone close to you dies or when you break off a relationship with someone it tears you up inside emotional pain thats kind of what happened to micky something tore him up what did it murphy asked her voice was quiet steelhard i dont know yet i said i closed my eyes shaking and leaned my head back against a wall ive been calling it the nightmare how do we kill it i shook my head im working on it its staying a couple steps ahead of me so far damn murphy said i get sick of playing catchup sometimes yeah so do i more footsteps came pounding down the hall and sonia malone burst into the room she saw micky laying quietly and went to him as if she feared to stir the air too much each movement fragile she touched his face his thinning hair and he awoke enough to reach for her hand she held onto it tightly kissed his fingers and bowed her head to rest her cheek against his i heard her crying letting it out murphy and i traded a look and rose by mutual consent to leave sonia in peace murphy had to help me up i ached everywhere felt as though my bones had been frozen solid walking was hard but murphy helped me i took a last look at sonia and micky and then quietly closed the door thank you harry murphy said any time youre my friend murph and im always up to helping a lady in distress she glanced up at me a sparkle in her eyes underneath the brim of the baseball cap you are such a chauvinist pig dresden a hungry chauvinist pig i said im starving you should eat more often beanpole murphy sat me down on the top step and said stay here ill get you something dont take too long murph ive got work to do the thing that did this comes out to play at sundown i leaned against the wall and closed my eyes i thought of dead animals and smashed cars and frozen agonies wrapped around micky malones tortured soul i dont know what the hell this nightmare is but im going to find it and im going to kill it that sounds about right murphy said if i can help youve got it thanks murph dont mention it um harry i opened my eyes she was watching me her expression uncertain for a minute there when i came in you stared at me you stared at me with the strangest damned expression on your face what did you see she asked youd laugh in my face if i told you i said go get me something to eat she snorted and turned to go down the stairs and sort things out with the excited si officers roaming around on the first floor i smiled remembering the vision sharp and brilliant in my minds eye murphy the guardian angel coming through the door in a blaze of wrath it was a picture i wouldnt mind keeping with me sometimes you get lucky and then i thought of that barbed wire the hideous torment id seen and briefly felt the ghosts rising of late had been suffering from the same thing but who could be doing it to them and how the forces used in that torturespell werent like anything i had seen or felt before i had never heard of any kind of magic that could be slapped on a spirit or a mortal with the same results i wouldnt have thought it possible how was it being done more to the point who was doing it or what i sat there shivering and alone and aching i was starting to take this business personally malone was an ally someone who had stood up to the bad guys beside me the more i thought about it the more angry and the more certain i became i would find this nightmare this thing that had crossed over and destroy it and then i would find whoever or whatever had created it unless harry i thought to myself they find you first chapter fourteen no i said into the phone i tossed my coat onto a chair and then sprawled out on the couch my apartment lay covered in shadows sunlight filtering in through the sunken windows high up on the walls i havent gotten the chance yet i lost a couple of hours detouring to pull a spell off of micky malone from si someone had wrapped barbed wire around his spirit mother of god michael said is he all right will be but its four hours of daylight lost i filled him in on mort lindquist and his diaries as well as the events at detective malones house there isnt much more time to find this lydia harry michael agreed sundowns in another six hours im working on it and after i get bob out the door looking ill see if i can hit the streets myself i got the beetle back he sounded surprised its not impounded murphy fixed it for me harry he said disappointed she broke the law to get you your car back darn tootin she did i said she owed me a favor hey man the almighty doesnt arrange for me to be anywhere on time i need wheels michael sighed there isnt time to debate this right now ill call you if i find herbut it doesnt look good i just cant figure it what would this thing have to do with that girl we need to find her and work out the connection could lydia be responsible for the recent disturbances i dont think so that spell i ran into todayive never seen anything like it it was i shivered remembering it was wrong michael cold it was evil he suggested maybe yeah there is such a thing as evil harry in spite of what many people say just remember that theres good too i cleared my throat uncomfortable murphy put out the word to the folks in blueso if one of her friends on patrol sees a girl matching lydias description well hear about it outstanding michael said you see harry this detour of yours to help detective malone is going to help us a great deal isnt that a very positive coincidence yeah michael divine fortune yadda yadda call me dont yadda yadda the lord harry its disrespectful god go with you and he hung up i put my coat away got out my nice heavy flannel robe and slipped into it then went over to the rug against the south wall i dragged it away from the floor and the hinged door there then swung the door open i fetched a kerosene lamp lit it up and dialed the wick up to a bright flame then got ready to descend the folding wooden ladder into the subbasement the telephone rang again i debated ignoring it it rang again insistent i sighed closed the door put the rug back in place and got to the phone on the fifth ring what i said uncharitably i have to hand it to you dresden susan said you certainly know how to charm a girl the morning after i let out a long breath sorry susan ive been working and its not going so well lots of questions and no answers ouch she said back someone said something to her in the background and she murmured a response i dont want to add to your day but do you remember the name of that guy you and special investigations took down a couple months ago the ritual killer oh right him i closed my eyes and grubbed about in my memory leo something cravat camner conner kraven the hunter i didnt really get his name i tracked him down by the demon he was calling up and nailed him that way michael and i didnt hang around for the paperwork afterwards either kravos susan asked leonid kravos yeah that might have been it i think great she said super thank you harry her voice sounded a little tense excited uh do you mind telling me whats going on i asked her its an angle im working on she said look all ive got right now are rumors ill try to tell you more as soon as ive got something concrete fair enough im sort of focused on something else right now anyway anything you need help with god i hope not i said i shifted the phone a little closer to my ear did you sleep all right last night maybe she teased its hard to get really relaxed when im that unsatisfied but your apartments so cold its kind of like going into hibernation yeah well next time ill make sure its a hell of a lot colder im shivering already she purred call you tonight if i can might not be here she sighed i understand potluck then thanks again harry any time we said goodbye hung up and i went back to the stairs leading down into the subbasement i uncovered the trap door opened it got my lantern and clumped on down the steep folding staircase my lab never got any less cluttered no matter how much more organization i imposed on it the contents only grew denser counters and shelves ran along three walls a long table ran down the center of the room with enough space for me to slip sideways down its length on either side next to the ladder a kerosene heater blunted the worst of the subterranean chill on the far side of the table a brass ring had been set into the floora summoning circle id had to learn the hard way to keep it clear of the other debris in the lab debris technically everything in the lab was useful and served some kind of purpose the ancient books with their faded moldering leather covers and their allpervasive musty smell the plastic containers with resealable lids the bottles the jars the boxesthey all had something in them i either needed or had needed at one time notebooks dozens of pens and pencils paper clips and staples reams of paper covered in my restless scrawling handwriting the dried corpses of small animals a human skull surrounded by paperback novels candles an ancient battle axe they all had some significance i just couldnt remember what it was for most of them i took the cover off the lamp and used it to light up about a dozen candles around the room and then the kerosene heater bob i said bob wake up come on weve got work to do golden light and the smell of candle flames and hot wax filled the room i mean it man theres not much time up on its shelf the skull quivered twin points of orangish flame flickered up in the empty eye sockets the white jaws parted in a pantomime yawn an appropriate sound coming out with it stars and stones harry the skull muttered youre inhuman it isnt even sundown yet stop whining bob im not in the mood mood im exhausted i dont think i can help you out anymore unacceptable i said even spirits get tired harry i need rest time enough for rest when im dead all right then bob said you want work we make a deal i want to do a ridealong the next time susan comes over i snorted at him hells bells bob dont you ever think about anything besides sex no im not letting you into my head while im with susan the skull spat out an oath there should be a union we could renegotiate my contract i snorted any time you want to head back to the homeland bob feel free no no no the skull muttered thats all right i mean theres still that misunderstanding with the winter queen but all right i said you probably dont need my protection anymore im sure shed be willing to sit down and work things out rather than putting you in torment for the next few hundred all right i said bobs eyelights flamed you can be such an asshole dresden i swear yep i agreed you awake yet the skull tilted to one side in a thoughtful gesture you know it said i am the eye sockets focused on me again anger really gets the old juices flowing that was pretty sneaky i got out a relatively fresh notepad and a pencil it took me a moment to clear off a space on the central table ive run into some new stuff maybe you can help me out and weve got a missing person i need to look for okay hit me i took a seat on the worn wooden stool and drew my warm robe a little closer about me trust me wizards dont wear robes for the dramatic effect they just cant get warm enough in their labs i knew some guys in europe who still operated out of stone towers i shudder to think right i said just give me whatever you can and i outlined the events starting with agatha hagglethorn through lydia and her disappearance through my conversation with mort lindquist and his mention of the nightmare to the attack on poor micky malone bob whistled no mean trick for a guy with no lips let me get this straight this creature this thing has been torturing powerful spirits for a couple of weeks with this barbedwire spell it tore up a bunch of stuff on consecrated ground then it blew through somebodys threshold and tore his spirit apart and slapped a torturespell on him you got it i said so what kind of ghost are we dealing with and who could have called it up and what is this girls connection to it harry bob said his tone serious leave this one alone i blinked at him what maybe we could go on a vacationfort lauderdale theyre having this international swimsuit competition there and we could i sighed bob i dont have time for i know a guy whos possessed a travel agent for a few days and he could get us tickets cut rate what do you say i peered at the skull if i didnt know any better i would think that bob sounded nervous was that even possible bob wasnt a human being he was a spirit a being of the nevernever the skull was his habitat his home away from home i let him stay in it protected him and bought him trashy romance novels on occasion in exchange for his help his prodigious memory and his affinity for the laws of magic bob was a records computer and personal assistant all rolled into one provided you could keep his mind on the issue at hand he knew thousands of beings in the nevernever hundreds of spell recipes scores of formulae for potions and enchantments and magical constructions no spirit could have that kind of knowledge without it translating into considerable power so why was he acting so scared bob i dont know why youre so upset but we need to stop wasting time sundowns coming in a few hours and this thing is going to be able to cross over from the nevernever and hurt someone else i need to know what it is and where it might be going and how to kick its ass you humans bob said youre never satisfied you always want to find out whats behind the next hill open the next box harry youve got to learn when you know too much i stared up at him for a moment then shook my head well start with basics and work our way through this step by step dammit harry ghosts i said ghosts are beings that live in the spirit world theyre impressions left by a personality at the moment of death they arent like people or sentient spirits like you they dont change they dont growtheyre just there experiencing whatever it is they were feeling when they died like poor agatha hagglethorn she was loopy the skull turned its eye sockets away from me and said nothing so theyre spiritbeings usually they arent visible but they can make a body out of ectoplasm and manifest in the real world when they want to if theyre strong enough and sometimes they can just barely have any physical existence at alljust kind of exist as a cold spot or a breath of wind or maybe a sound right give it up harry bob said im not talking they can do all kinds of things they can throw things around and stack furniture there have been documented incidents of ghosts blotting out the sun for a while causing minor earthquakes all sorts of stuffbut it isnt ever random theres always some purpose to it something related to their deaths bob quivered about to add something but clacked his bony teeth shut again i ginned at him it was a puzzle no spirit of intellect could resist a puzzle so if someone leaves a strong enough imprint when they go you got yourself a strong ghost i mean badass maybe like this nightmare maybe bob admitted grudgingly then spun his skull to face wholly away from me im still not talking to you harry i drummed my pencil on the blank piece of paper okay we know that this thing is stirring up the boundary between here and the nevernever its making it easier for spirits to come across and thats why things have been so busy lately not necessarily bob chirped up maybe youre looking at it from the wrong angle eh i asked he spun to face me again eyelights glowing voice enthusiastic someone else has been stirring these spirits harry maybe they started torturing them in order to make them jump around in the pool and start causing waves there was a thought you mean prodding the big spirits into moving so that they create the turbulence exactly bob said nodding then he caught himself mouth still open he turned the skull toward the wall and started banging the bony forehead against it i am such an idiot stirring up the nevernever i said thoughtfully but who would do that and why you got me big mystery well never know time for a beer stirring up the nevernever makes it easier for something to cross over i said so whoever laid out those torture spells must have wanted to pave the way for something i thought of dead animals and smashed cars something big i thought of micky malone quivering and mad and its getting stronger bob looked at me again and then sighed all right he said gods do you ever give up harry never then i might as well help you you dont know what youre dealing with here and if you walk into this with your eyes closed youre going to be dead before the sun rises chapter fifteen dead before the sun rises i said stars bob why dont you just go all the way over the melodramatic edge and tell me that im going to be sleeping with the fishes im not sure that much of you would be left bob said seriously harry look at this thing look at what its done it crossed a threshold so what i asked lots of things can remember that toad demon it came over my threshold and trashed my whole place in the first place harry bob said youre a bachelor you dont have all that much of a threshold to begin with this malone thoughhe was a family man so so it means his home has a lot more significance besides whichthe toad demon came in and everything after that was pure physical interaction it smashed things it spat out acid saliva that kind of thing it didnt try to wrench your soul apart or enchant you into a magical sleep this is getting to be a pretty fine distinction bob it is did you ask for an invitation before you went into the malones house yeah i said i guess i did its polite and and its harder for you to work magic in a home you havent been invited into you cross the threshold without an invitation and you leave a big chunk of your power at the door it doesnt affect you as much because youre a mortal harry but it still gets you in smaller ways and if i was an allspirit creature i said bob nodded it hits you harder if this nightmare is a ghost like you say then the threshold should have stopped it coldand even if it had gone past it then it shouldnt have had the kind of power it takes to hurt a mortal that badly i frowned drumming my pencil some more and made some notes on the paper trying to keep everything straight and certainly not enough to lay out a spell that powerful on malone definitely so what could do that bob what are we dealing with here bobs eyes shifted restlessly around the room it could be a couple of things from the spirit world are you sure you want to know i glared at him all right all right it could be something big enough something so big that even a fraction of it was enough to attack malone and lay that spell on him maybe a god someones dug up hecate kali or one of the old ones no i said flatly bob if this thing was so tough it wouldnt be tearing up peoples cars and ripping kitty cats apart thats not my idea of a godlike evil thats just pissed off harry it went through the threshold bob said ghosts dont do that they cant i stood up and started pacing back and forth on the little open space of floor of my summoning circle it isnt one of the old ones guardian spells all over the world would be freaking out alerting the gatekeeper and the council of something like that no this is local harry if youre wrong i jabbed a finger at bob if im right then theres a monster out there messing with my town and im obliged to do something about it before someone else gets hurt bob sighed it blew through a threshold so i said pacing and whirling maybe it had some other way to get around the threshold what if it had an invitation how could it have gotten that bob said dingdong soul eater home delivery may i come in bite me i said what if it took lydia once she was out of the church she could have been vulnerable to it possession bob said possible i guessbut she was wearing your talisman if it could get around a threshold maybe it could get around that too she goes to malones looks helpless and gets an invite in maybe bob did a passable imitation of scrunching up his eyes but then why were all those little animals torn up outside we are going way out on a branch here there are a lot of maybes i shook my head no no ive got a feeling about this youve said that before you remember the time you wanted to make smart dynamite for that mining company i scowled i hadnt had much sleep that week and anyway the sprinklers kicked in bob chortled or the time you tried to enchant that broomstick so that you could fly remember that i thought it would take a year to get the mud out of your eyebrows would you focus please i complained i pushed my hands against either side of my head to keep it from exploding with theories and whittled them down to the ones that fit the facts there are only a couple of possibilities a were dealing with some kind of godlike being in which case were screwed and the absurd understatement award goes to harry dresden i glared at him or i said lifting a finger b this thing is a spirit something weve seen before and its using smoke and mirrors within the rules we already know either way i think lydia knows more than shes admitting gee a woman taking advantage of captain chivalry what are the odds bah i said if i can find her and find out what she knows i could nail it today youre forgetting the third possibility bob said amiably c its something new that neither of us understand and youre sailing off in ignorance to plunge into the mouth of charybdis youre so encouraging i said fastening on the bracelet and slipping on the ring feeling the quiet humming power in them both bob somehow waggled his eyebrow ridges hey you never went out with charybdis whats the plan i loaned lydia my dead mans talisman i said i still cant believe after all the work we did you gave it to the first girl to wiggle by i scowled at bob if shes still got it i should be able to work up a spell to home in on it like when i find peoples wedding rings great bob said give em hell harry have fun storming the castle not so fast i said she might not have it with her if shes in on this with the nightmare then she could have dumped it once she had it away from me thats where you come in me bob squeaked yes youre going to head out hit the streets and talk to all of your contacts see if we can get to her before sundown weve only got a couple of hours harry bob pointed out the suns up im exhausted i cant just flit around like some kinda dewdrop fairy take mister i said he doesnt mind you riding around and he could use the exercise just dont get him killed hooboy bob said once more into the breech dear friends eh harry dont quit your job to become a motivational speaker i have your permission to come out yep i said for the purposes of this mission only and dont waste time prowling around in womens locker rooms again i put out the candles and the heater and started up the stepladder bob followed drifting out of the eye sockets of the skull as a glowing candleflamecolored cloud and flowed up the steps past me the cloud glided over to where mister dozed in the warm spot near the mostly dead fire and seeped in through the cats grey fur mister sat up and blinked his yellowgreen eyes at me stretched his back and flicked his stump of a tail back and forth before letting out a reproachful meow i scowled at mister and bob shrugging into my duster gathering up my blasting rod and my exorcism bag an old black doctors case full of stuff come on guys i said were on the trail we have the advantage what could possibly go wrong chapter sixteen finding people is hard especially when they dont want to be found its so difficult in fact that estimates run up near sevendigit figures on how many people disappear without a trace every year in the united states most of these people arent ever found i didnt want lydia to become one of these statistics either she was one of the bad guys and had been playing me for a sucker or she was a victim who was in need of my help if the former then i wanted to confront heri have this thing about people who lie to me and try to get me into trouble if the latter then i was probably the only one in chicago who could help her she could be possessed by one very big and very brawny spirit who needed to get some pardon the pun exorcise lydia had been on foot when she left father forthill and i dont think shed had much cash assuming she hadnt come into any more resources shed likely still be in the bucktownwicker park area so i headed the blue beetle that way the beetle isnt really blue any more both doors had to be replaced when theyd gotten clawed to shreds and the hood had been slagged with a big old hole melted in it my mechanic mike who can keep the beetle running most days hadnt asked any questions hed just replaced the parts with pieces of other volkswagens so that the blue beetle was technically blue red white and green but my appellation stuck i tried to keep my cool as i drove at least as best as i could my wizards propensity for blowing out any kind of advanced technology seems to get worse when im upset angry or afraid dont ask me why so i did my best to zen out until i got to my destinationparking strips alongside wicker park a brisk breeze made my duster flap as i got out on one side of the street tall town houses and a pair of apartment buildings gleamed as the sun began to go down over the western plains the shadows of the trees in wicker park meanwhile stretched out like black fingers creeping toward my throat thank god my subconscious isnt too symbolically aware or anything the park had a bunch of people in it young people mothers with kids while on the streets business types began arriving in their business clothes heading for one of the posh restaurants pubs or cafes that littered the area i got a lump of chalk and a tuning fork out of my exorcism bag i glanced around then squatted down on the sidewalk and drew a circle around myself willing it closed as the chalk marks met themselves on the concrete i felt a sensation a crackling tension as the circle closed encasing the local magical energies compressing them stirring them most magic isnt quick and dirty the kind of stunts you can pull off when some nasty thing is about to jump up in your face are called evocations theyre fairly limited in what they can do and difficult to master i only had a couple of evocations that i could do very well and most of the time i needed the help of artificial foci such as my blasting rod or one of my other enchanted doodads to make sure that i dont lose control of the spell and blow up myself along with the slobbering monster most magic is a lot of concentration and hard work thats where i was really goodthaumaturgy thaumaturgy is traditional magic all about drawing symbolic links between items or people and then investing energy to get the effect that you want you can do a lot with thaumaturgy provided you have enough time to plan things out and more time to prepare a ritual the symbolic objects and the magical circle ive yet to meet a slobbering monster polite enough to wait for me to finish i slipped my shield bracelet off of my wrist and laid it in the center of the circlethat was my channel the talisman id passed off to lydia had been constructed in a very similar manner and the two bracelets would resonate on the same pitches i took the tuning fork and laid it down beside the bracelet with the two ends of the shield bracelet touching either tine making a complete circle then i closed my eyes and drew upon the energy gathered in the circle i brought it into me molded it shaped it into the effect i was looking for with my thoughts fiercely picturing the talisman id given lydia while i did the energy built and built a buzzing in my ears a prickling along the back of my neck when i was ready i spread my hands over the two objects opened my eyes and said firmly duo et unum at the words the energy poured out of me in a rush that left me a little lightheaded there were no sparks no glowing luminescence or anything else that would cost a special effects budget some moneyjust a sense of completion and a tiny almost inaudible hum i picked up the bracelet and put it back on then took up the tuning fork and smudged the circle with my foot willing it broken i felt the little pop of the residual energies being released and i rose up and fetched my exorcism bag from the beetle then i walked away down the sidewalk holding my tuning fork out in front of me after id taken several paces away i turned in a slow circle the fork remained silent until id turned almost all the way aroundthen it abruptly shivered in my hand and emitted a crystalline tone when i had it facing vaguely northwest i looked up and sighted along the tines of the fork then walked a dozen paces farther and triangulated as best i could the direction change on the way the fork faced when it toned the second time was appreciable even without any kind of instrumentslydia must have been fairly close yes i said and started off at a brisk walk sweeping the tuning fork back and forth setting my feet in the direction that it chimed i kept on like that to the far side of the park where the tuning fork pointed directly at a building that had once been some kind of manufacturing facility perhaps but now stood abandoned the lower floor was dominated by a pair of garage doors and a boardedup front door on the lower two floors most of the windows had been boarded up on the third floor truly bored or determined vandals had pitched stones through those windows and their shattered edges stood sharp and dusty against the blackness behind them like dirty ice i took two more readings from fifty feet on either side of the first all pointed directly to the building it glowered down at me silent and spooky i shivered i would be smart to call michael maybe even murphy i could get to a phone try to get in touch with them it wouldnt take them long to get here of course it would be after sundown the nightmare if it was inside lydia would be free to leave her then to roam abroad if i could get to her exorcise this thing now i could end the spree of destruction it was on if if if i had a lot of ifs but i didnt have much time the sun was swiftly vanishing i reached inside my duster and got out my blasting rod transferring my exorcism bag to the same hand as the tuning fork then i headed across the street to the garage doors of the building i tested one and to my surprise it rolled upwards i glanced left and right then slipped inside into the darkness shutting the door behind me it took a moment for my eyes to adjust the room was lit only by the fading light that slipped its fingers beneath the plyboard over the windows the edges of the garage doors it was a loading dock that encompassed almost the entire first floor i judged stone pillars held the place up water dripped somewhere from a broken pipe and there were pools of it everywhere on the floor a brandnew sidepanel van its engine still ticking cooling off stood parked at the far side of the loading dock next to a fivefoothigh stone abutment where trucks would once have backed up to load and unload goods a sign hanging by one hinge over the van read summers textiles mfg i approached the van slowly my blasting rod held loosely at my side i swept the tuning fork and my eyes around the shadowed chamber the fork hummed every time it swept past the van the white van all but glowed in the halflight its windows had been tinted and i couldnt see inside of them even when i came within ten feet or so something some sound or other cue that i hadnt quite caught on the conscious level made the hair on the back of my neck prickle up i spun to face the darkness behind me the tip of my blasting rod rising up my bruised fingers wrapped tight around its haft i focused my senses on the darkness and listened honing my attention to the area around me darkness drip of water creak of building above me nothing i put the tuning fork in my duster pocket then i turned back to the van closed the distance quickly and hauled open the side door leveling my rod on the inside a blanketwrapped bundle approximately lydiasized lay inside the van one pale hand lay limp outside of it my talisman scorchedlooking and bloodstained wrapped around the slender wrist my heart leapt into my throat lydia i asked i reached out and touched her wrist felt the dull slow throb of pulse i let out a breath of relief pulled the blankets from her pale face her eyes were open staring the pupils dilated until there was barely any color left in them at all i waved my hand in front of her eyes and said again lydia she didnt respond drugged i thought what the hell was she doing here laying in a van covered up in blankets drugged and placed as neatly as could be it didnt make sense unless she was unless she was a distraction the bait for a trap i turned but before i got halfway around that cold energy id felt the night before flooded over the side of my face my throat something blonde and incredibly swift slammed into me with the force of a rushing bull throwing me off my feet and into the van i spun around onto my elbows to see the vampire kyle hamilton coming for me his eyes black and empty his face screwed up into a grimace of hunger he still wore his tennis whites i kicked at his chest and superhuman strength or no it lifted him up off the ground for a second brought me a halfbreath of life i lifted my right hand the silver ring there gleaming and cried assantius the energy stored in the ring all kinetic stuff that it saved back a little every time i moved my arm unloaded in a flood right in the vampires face an unseen fury of motion the raw force split his lipsbut no blood flowed out it dug into the corners of his eyes and tore the skin away but there was still no blood it ripped the skin from his cheekbones all rubbery black beneath the anglosaxon pink strips of flesh flapping back in the wave of force like flags in a high wind the vampires body flew back and up it thudded hard against the ceiling and then fell to the floor with a thump i struggled out of the van my chest aching with a dull sort of pain i left the doctors bag behind shook out the shield bracelet and extended my left arm in front of me kyle stirred for a moment and then flung himself to all fours his body weirdly contorted shoulders standing up too much his back bent at a crooked angle shreds of flesh dangled from his face slicklooking rubbery black beneath them his eyes also had the skin torn away from them like pieces of a rubber mask and bulged out black and huge and inhuman his jaws parted showing dripping fangs saliva pattering to the damp floor you the vampire hissed his voice calm normal disconcerting whoah that was original i muttered drawing in my will yeah me what the hell are you doing here where do you think youre going with lydia his inhuman expression flickered who my chest panged hard sharp hot as if something was broken broken badly i remained standing though not letting him see weakness lydia bad dye job sunken eyes in your van wearing my talisman on her wrist he hissed out a dripping runnel of laughter is that what she told you her name was youve been used dresden i got a shivery feeling again and narrowed my eyes i didnt have any warning but instinct to make me throw myself to one side in an abrupt leap the vampires sister kelly as blonde and pretty as he had been a moment before landed in the space i had occupied she too dropped to her knees with a drooling hiss fangs showing eyes bulging she wore a white cat suit clinging tight to her curves along with white boots and gloves and a short white cape with a deep hood her clothing was smudged imperfect spotted with flecks of scarlet and her blonde hair in disarray blood stained her mouth like smeared lipstick or a child with a big cup of juice a blood mustache hells bells i kept my blasting rod trained on kelly my left hand thrust out before me so you two are putting the snatch on lydia eh why let me kill him moaned the female her eyes all black empty and hungry kyle im hungry so sue me i weird out when someone starts talking about eating me i swung the blasting rod right at kellys face and started sending power into it setting the tip to glowing yeah kyle i said let her try kyle rippled beneath his skin and it was enough to make my stomach turn something like that just aint right even when you know whats underneath this affair is none of yours wizard the girl is under my protection i said you two clear out now and i wont have to get rough with you that will not happen kyle said his voice deadly quiet kyle the female moaned again more drool slithered out of her mouth dripping to the floor she started shaking quivering as if she were about to fly apart or at me my mouth went dry and i got ready to blast her i saw kyle move out of the corner of my eye i lifted the shield bracelet toward him transferred my will to it but in time only to partially deflect the broken chip of concrete that he threw at my head it slammed against my temple and sent me spinning i saw kelly blur toward me white cape flying and i lifted the blasting rod toward her shouting fuego fire slammed out the end of the rod missing kelly by at least a foot but still hot enough to set the hem of her cloak ablaze the flame slewed in an arch across the ceiling and down the wall as i started falling cutting through wood and brick and stone like an enormous arcwelder she flung herself atop me straddling my hips with her thighs moaning in excitement i thrust the blasting rod toward her but she batted it aside laughing in a wild hysterical tone throwing her smoldering cloak off with the other hand she plunged toward my throat but i lifted my hands to catch at her mane of hair i knew it was a futile gestureshe was just too damned strong i wouldnt be able to hold her off of me for long a few seconds at most my heart pounded in my burning chest and i struggled gasping in air and then droplets of her spittle fell onto my throat my cheek into my mouth and none of it mattered any more it was a glorious sensation that spread over mewarmth security peace ecstasy began at my skin and spread through me easing all the horrid tension from my muscles my fingers slackened in kellys lovely hair and she purred her hips writhing against mine she lowered her mouth toward me and i felt her breath on my skin her breasts press against me through the thin material of her bodysuit something some nagging thought bothered me for a moment perhaps it was something about the perfect lightless depths of her eyes or the way her fangs rubbed against my throatno matter how good it felt but then i felt her lips on my skin felt her draw in her breath in shivering anticipation and it stopped mattering i just wanted more then there was a roaring sound and i dimly perceived the west wall of the building collapsing falling away in great flaming sections of wood and brick the blast i had sent spewing at kelly had sliced through the ceiling walls and support beams it must have weakened the structure of the entire building as it had oops sunlight flooded in through the falling bricks and clouds of dust the last rays of daylight warm and golden on my face painfully bright in my eyes kelly screamed and wherever her skin wasnt covered by cloth from her chin up mostlyshe burst into flame the light hit her like a physical blow hurling her away from me i became aware of a dull pain uncomfortable heat on my cheek my throat where her saliva had coated my skin everything was light and heat and pain for a few moments and someone was screaming i struggled up a moment later peering around the inside of the building fire spread a dull chewing sound on the floors above me and through the missing section of wall i could hear sirens in the distance there were smears of something black and greasy on the concrete floor leading to the white van the sunlight barely touched the back window of the vehicle the side door stood wide open and kyle his face still hanging in ragged strips hauled something grotesquehis sister her true form no longer shrouded by its mask of flesh the vampire girl made keening sounds of agony while her brother pitched her into the back of the van he slammed the door shut a snarl rippling his split lips he took a step toward me then clenched his jaws in frustration stopping just short of the sunlight wizard he hissed youll pay ill make you pay for this then he spun back to the van with its darktinted windows and leapt in a moment later the engine roared to life and the van sped toward the garage doors plowed through one of them sending shards of wood flying jounced into the street and vanished from sight engine racing i remained in place stunned burnt hurting my brain clouded then i stumbled to my feet and staggered toward the hole in the wall and out into the fading daylight sirens got closer damn i mumbled looking back at the spreading fires im kinda hard on buildings i shook my head trying to clear my thoughts dark it was getting dark had to get home vampires could come out after dark home i thought home i started stumbling back toward the beetle behind me as i did the sun sank beneath the horizonfreeing all the things that go bump in the night to come out and play chapter seventeen i dont remember how i managed to get home again i have a vague image of all the cars around me going way too fast and then of misters rumbling purr greeting me as i got into my apartment and locked the door behind me the vampires narcotic saliva had soaked in through my skin in a matter of a second or three spreading into my system in short order after that i felt numb light all over the room wasnt quite whirling but when i moved my eyes things almost seemed to blur a little then to settle when i focused on something i throbbed every time my heart beat my entire body pulsed with a slow gentle pang of pleasant sensation something inside me couldnt help but love every second of it even counting the times id been juiced up in a hospital it was the best drug id ever had i stumbled to my narrow bed and dropped onto it mister came and prowled around my face waiting for me to get up and feed him go away i heard myself mumble stupid furball go on he put one paw on my throat and touched the area of burned skin where the sunlight had struck the smear of kelly hamiltons saliva pain flared through me and i groaned forcing myself into the kitchen i got some cold cuts out of the icebox and dropped them onto misters plate then i stumbled into the bathroom and flicked on the light it hurt i shielded my eyes and studied myself in the mirror my pupils had dilated out nice and big the skin on my throat my cheek was red and glowing as though from falling asleep outside on a summer afternoonpainful but not dangerous i couldnt find any marks on my throat so the vampire hadnt bitten me i was pretty sure that was a good thing something about a bite being a link to a victim if shed bitten me she could have gotten into my head usual mindcontrol enchantment breaking one of the laws of magic i stumbled back to my bed and sank down onto it trying to sort out my thoughts my lovely throbbing body made this fairly difficult mister came nosing around again but i shoved him away with one hand and forced myself to ignore him focus harry i mumbled to myself got to have focus id learned to block out pain when necessary studying under justin it had been a practical necessity my teacher hadnt believed in sparing the rod and spoiling the potential wizard you learn very quickly not to make mistakes given the correct incentive to avoid them blocking out pleasure was a more difficult exercise but i somehow managed the first thing i had to do was separate my sense of enjoyment it took me a while but i slowly marked out the boundaries of the parts of me that liked all the wonderful warm sensations and walled them away then the actual pounding happiness itself i found my heart rate and slowed it a bit though it was already going too slowly then started shutting down perception of my limbs pushing them behind the walls with the rest of me that wasnt doing any good giddy delight went next leaving only a dull fuzz across my thinking chemically unavoidable i closed my eyes and breathed and tried to sort through things lydia had fled the shelter of the church and father forthills protection why i thought back over the details of everything i knew about her her sunken eyes the tingle of touching her aura had her hands been shaking just a little i think they had in retrospect i thought of what i had seen of her in the van of the bracelet on her wrist her beating pulse had it been slow id thought so at the timebut then my own had been racing i focused on the moment id been touching her sixty i thought shed been around sixty beats per minute my own heart rate was about a sixth of that at the moment had been half that before id slowed it down to quiet the song of the drug in my blood song pretty song why the hell did i have it shut away when i could just lower the walls listen to the music lay here all happy and quiet and just feel just be i took a moment to prop the walls up again lydias heart rate had been at human normal nominally but shed been laying limp and still much as i was now kyle and kelly had poisoned her as they had me i was sure of it then why had her heart been beating so quickly in comparison she left the church and had been taken perhaps by the nightmare then gone to malones house under its guidance and gotten an invitation in but why go to malones house what did he have to do with anything malone and lydia theyd both been attacked by the nightmare what was the connection what linked them together more questions what did the vampires want with her if kyle and his sister had been after lydia that meant that bianca wanted her why was bianca in league with the nightmare if she was why the hell would she need to use her most powerful goons to kidnap the girl if she was possessed by biancas ally and how the hell had the nightmare gone through the threshold an even better question how had it gotten through the protection offered to lydia by my dead mans talisman no ghost should have been able to offer her any direct harm or contact through that thing it didnt make any sense why should it why should anything need to mean anything at all just sit back harry lay back and feel good and relax and let your blood sing let your heart beat just ease down into the wonderful warm spinning dark and stop worrying stop caring drift and float and the walls started to crumble i struggled but sudden fear made my heartbeat quicken i fought against the pull of the poison in my blood but that struggle only made me more vulnerable more susceptible i couldnt fail now i couldnt people were depending upon me i had to fight the walls fell and my blood surged up with a roar i drifted and it was nice drifting turned into sleep gentle dark sleep and sleep in time turned into dreams in my dream i found myself back at the warehouse down by burnham harbor it was night beneath a full moon i was wearing my duster my black shirt and jeans my black sneakers which were better for well sneaking michael stood beside me his breath steaming in the winter air dressed in his cloak his full mail his bloodred surcoat amoracchius rode his hip a source of quiet constant power murphy and the other members of special investigations all wore dark loose clothing and their flack vests and everyone had a gun in one hand and something elselike vials of holy water or silver crucifixesin the other micky malone glanced up at the moon and shifted the shotgun in both handshe was the only person relying upon raw shredding firepower hey the guy had a point all right he said we go in and then what heres the plan murphy said harry thinks that the killers followers will be drugged out and dozing we round them up cuff them up and move on murphy grimaced her blue eyes sparkling in the silver light tell them whats next harry i kept my voice quiet the guy were after is a sorcerer its sort of like being a wizard only he spends all his energy doing things that are mostly destructive he isnt good at doing anything that doesnt fuck someone up which makes him a badass as far as were concerned malone growled pretty much i confirmed the guys got power but no class im going to go in and lock down his magic we think he might have a demon on a stringthats what the murders have been for theyre part of his payment to get the demon to work for him demon breathed rudolph jesus can you believe this shit jesus did believe in demons michael said his voice quiet if the creature is there do not get close to it dont shoot at it leave it to me if it gets past me throw your holy water at the thing and run while it screams thats pretty much the plan i confirmed keep any human flunkies with knives from giving them to me or michael ill take kravoss powers out and you guys grab him as soon as were sure the demon wont eat us i deal with any other supernatural stuff questions murphy shook her head lets go she leaned out and pumped her arm in the air signaling the rest of the si team and we headed into the warehouse everything went according to plan in the front of the warehouse a dozen young people all with that lost lonely look to them lay dozing amidst fumes that made me dizzy the remnants of a serious party lay all over the placebeer cans clothes roaches empty needles you name it the cops fell on the kids in a darkclad swarm and had them cuffed and hauled out into a waiting wagon in under ninety seconds michael and i moved forward toward the back of the warehouse through stacks of boxes and shipping crates murphy rudy and malone followed hard on our heels i cracked the door at the back wall and peered through it i saw a circle of black smoking candles a redlit figure dressed in feathers and blood kneeling beside it and something dark and horrible crouching within bingo i whispered i turned to michael hes got the demon in there with him the knight simply nodded and loosened his sword in its sheath i drew the doll out of my dusters pocket it was a ken doll naked and not anatomically correct but it would work the single hair that forensics had recovered from the last victims crime scene had been carefully scotchtaped to the dolls head and i had attired ken in the general garb of someone delving into black magicreversed pentagrams some feathers and some blood from a hapless mouse mister had nabbed murphy i hissed are you absolutely sure about this hair that it belongs to kravos if it didnt the doll wouldnt do diddly to the sorcerer unless i managed to throw it into his eye were reasonably sure she whispered yes reasonably sure great but i knelt down and marked out the circle around me then another around the ken doll and wrought my spell the hair was kravoss he became aware of the spell taking effect a few seconds before it could close off his power altogetherand with those few seconds he had he reached out and broke the circle around the demon with his will and his hand then in a screaming rage compelled it to attack the demon leapt toward us all writhing darkness and shadows and glowing red eyes michael stepped into the doorway and drew amoracchius the sudden blaze of light and magical fury like a gale in that darkness in real life i had completed the spell and shut kravos away from his powers michael had carved the demon into chutney kravos had made a run for it but malone at fairly long range had fired his shotgun at the ground and at kravoss feet and done it perfectly sweeping the mans legs out from beneath him and leaving him writhing bleeding but alive murphy had wrestled the knife out of the sorcerers hands and the good guys had won the day in my dream it didnt happen that way i felt the fabric of the spell closing around kravos start to slip one minute he was there in the weaving i was spinning around himthe next he was simply gone the spell collapsing of its own unsupported weight michael screamed i looked up to see him lifted high in the air his sword sweeping through the shadows and darkness before him in impotent futility dark hands fingers nightmarishly long grabbed michaels head covering his face there was a twist a wet crackling sound and the knights neck broke cleanly his body jerked then went limp amoracchiuss light died out the demon screamed a tinny highpitched sound and let the body fall to the ground murphy shouted and hurled her jar of holy water at the demon the liquid flared into silver light as it struck something in that writhing darkness that was the demon the shape turned toward us claws flashed out and murphy stumbled back her eyes wide with shock where the talons had carved through her kevlar jacket her shirt her skin leaving her belly torn open blood and worse rushed out and she let out a weak gasp pressing both hands against her own ruined side malone started pumping rounds out of the shotgun the demondarkness turned toward him a redfanged leer spreading over it and waited until the gun clicked empty then it simply laughed grabbed the end of the shotgun and slammed malone against a wall shoving the hardwood stock against the mans belly until he screamed until the flesh began to rip until ribs started crackling and then shoved harder until i could clearly hear even above the sound of malones retching the bones in his spine start to splinter and break malone too fell to the ground dying rudolph screamed pastyfaced and white and ran away leaving me alone with the demon my heart rushed with terror and i shook like a leaf before the creature i was still inside of the circle i still had the circle protecting me i struggled to reach out for my power to summon a strike that would annihilate this thing and found something in my way a wall the same spell id meant to lay on kravos the demon stalked over to me and as though my circle wasnt even there reached out and backhanded me into the air i landed with a thud upon the ground no i stammered and tried to struggle back from the thing no this isnt happening this isnt the way it happened the demons red eyes glowed i lifted my blasting rod toward it pointed and shouted fuego there was no stirring of heat no fitful crackling of energy nothing the demon laughed again reaching down toward me and i felt myself lifted into the air this is a dream i shouted with that awareness i started struggling to reach out to the fabric of the dream to alter itbut id made no preparations before id slept and was already too panicked too distracted to focus this is a dream this isnt the way it happened that was then the demon purred its voice silken this is now then its maw opened up and closed over my belly horrible fangs sinking in worrying me stretching my guts it shook its head and i exploded shreds of meat flying out of me into it my blood rushing out while i strained and struggled helplessly screaming and then a grey tabby with a bobtail bounded out of nowhere and whipped one paw at me lashing it across my nose claws slashing like fire i screamed again and found myself in the far corner of my bedroom back in my apartment curled into a fetal ball i had been puking my guts out mister hovered over me and then almost judiciously delivered another scratch to my cheek i heard myself cry out and flinch from the blow something rippled along my skin something cold and dark and nauseating i sat up blinking sleep from my eyes struggling through the remnants of the vampires poison and sleep to focus on the presencebut it was gone i shook violently i was terrified not frightened not apprehensiveviciously and unremittingly terrified mindless brainstem terror the kind that quite simply bypasses rational thought and heads straight for your soul i felt horribly violated somehow used helpless weak i crawled down to my lab fumbling in the dark dimly i was aware of mister coming along behind me it was dark down here dark and cold i stumbled across the room knocking things down left and right to the summoning circle built into the floor i threw myself into it sobbing fumbled with tingling fingers at the floor until i located the ring then i willed the circle closed it struggled resisted and i pushed harder forced myself on it harder until finally i felt it snap shut around me in an invisible wall i curled on my side keeping every part of myself within that circle and wept mister prowled around the circle a rumbling reassuring purr in his throat then i heard the big grey cat hop up onto the work table and over to one of the shelves his dim shadow curled up by the pale bone of the skull orange light began to glide out of his mouth into the skulls eye sockets until bobs candleflame eyes blinked and the skull turned to focus on me harry bob said his voice quiet solemn harry can you hear me shaking i looked up desperately grateful to hear a familiar voice harry bob said gently i saw it harry i think i know what went after malone and the others i think i know how it did it i tried to help you but you wouldnt wake up my mind whirled confused what i asked my voice came out a whimper what are you talking about im sorry harry the skull paused and though its expression couldnt really change it somehow looked troubled i think i know what just tried to eat you chapter eighteen eat me i whispered i dont i dont understand this thing youve been chasing i think the nightmare i think it was here nightmare i said i lowered my head and closed my eyes bob i cant i cant think straight whats going on well you came in about five hours ago drugged to the gills on vampire spit and muttering like a madman i think you didnt realize that i was inside mister do you remember that part yeah sort of what happened i relayed my experience with kyle and kelly hamilton to bob speaking seemed to help things stop spinning my guts to settle my heartbeat slowly eased down to something less than that of a terrified rabbit sounds weird bob said got to be something important to make them risk going out in daylight like that even in a specially equipped van i realize that bob i said and mopped at my face with one hand you any steadier i i guess i think you got torn up pretty good spiritwise its lucky you started screaming i came as quick as i could but you didnt want to wake up the poison i think i sat up crosslegged staying inside the circle i remember that i had a dream god it was a terrible dream i felt my guts turn to water and i started shaking again i tried to change it but i wasnt ready i couldnt a dream bob said yeah that figures figures i asked sure bob said i shook my head rested my elbows on my knees and put my face in my hands i did not want to be doing this someone else could do it i should go leave town it was a spirit that jumped me yeah i shook my head that doesnt make any sense how did it get past the threshold your threshold isnt so hot to begin with bachelor man i worked up enough courage to scowl at bob the wards then ive got all the doors and windows warded and i dont have any mirrors it could have used if bob had any hands he would have been rubbing them together exactly he said yes exactly my stomach quailed again and a fresh burst of shuddering made me put my hands in my lap i felt like sprawling somewhere crying my eyes out puking up whatever shreds of dignity remained in my stomach and then crawling into a hole and pulling it in after me i swallowed it it never came in to me then is what youre saying it never had to cross those boundaries bob nodded eyes burning brightly exactly you went out to it when i was dreaming yes yes yes bob bubbled it makes sense nowdont you see not really dreams the skull said when a mortal dreams all kinds of strange things can happen when a wizard dreams it can be even weirder sometimes dreams can be intense enough to create a little temporary world of their own kind of a bubble in the nevernever remember how you told me agatha hagglethorn was a strong enough ghost to have had her own demesne in the nevernever yeah it looked kind of like old chicago well people can do the same at times but im not a ghost bob no he said youre not but youve got everything it takes to make a ghost inside you except for the right set of circumstances ghosts are only frozen images of people harry last impressions made by a personality bob paused reflectively people are almost always more trouble than anything you run into on the other side i hadnt noticed i said all right so youre saying that any time i dream it creates my own little rentbythehour demesne in the nevernever not every time bob said in fact not even most times only really intense dreams i suspect bring the necessary energy out of people but with the border being so turbulent and easy to get through more peoples dreams are making bubbles on the other side that must have been how it got to poor micky malone then while he was sleeping his wife said hed had insomnia that night so the thing hangs around outside his house waiting for him to fall asleep and starts killing fuzzy animals to fill up the time could be bob said do you remember your dream i shuddered yeah i i remember it the nightmare must have got inside with you while my spirit was in the nevernever i asked it should have ripped me to shreds not so bob beamed your spirits demesne remember even if only a temporary one means you have the home field advantage it didnt help since it got the drop on you but you had it oh do you remember anything in particular any figure or character in the dream that wouldnt have been acting the way you thought it should have yeah i said my shaking hands went to my belly feeling for tooth marks hells bells yeah i was dreaming of that bust a couple of months back when we nailed kravos that sorcerer bob mused okay this could be important what happened i swallowed trying not to throw up um everything went wrong that demon hed called it was stronger than it had been in life the demon was i blinked bob is it possible for something like a demon to leave a ghost oh uh bob said i dont think sounless it had actually died there eternally perished i mean not just had its vessel dispersed michael killed it with amoracchius i said bobs skull shuddered ow he said amoracchius im not sure then i dont know that sword might be able to kill a demon even through a physical shell that whole faithmagic thing is awfully strong okay so we could be dealing with the ghost of a demon here i said a demon that died while it was all fired up for a fight maybe thats what makes it so so vicious could be bob agreed cheerily i shook my head but that doesnt explain the barbedwire spells weve been finding on those ghosts and people i grabbed onto the problem the tangled facts with a silent kind of desperation like a man about to drown who has no breath to waste on screaming it helped to keep me moving maybe the spells are someone elses work bob offered bianca i said suddenly she and her lackeys are all messed up in this somehowremember that they put the snatch on lydia and they were waiting for me that first night when i came back from being arrested i didnt think she was that big time a practitioner bob said i shrugged shes not horribly but she just got promoted too maybe shes been studying up shes always had a little more than her share of freaky vampire tricksand if she was over in the nevernever when she did it it would have made her stronger bob whistled through his teeth yeah that could work bianca stirs things up by torturing a bunch of spirits gets all the turbulence going so that she can prod this nightmare toward you then she lets it loose sits back and enjoys the fun she got a motive regret i said remembering a note id read more than a year ago she blames me for the death of one of her people rachel she wants to make me regret it neat bob said and she could have been everywhere in question yeah i said yeah she could have been means opportunity motive damn shaky logic though nothing i could justify to the council in order to get their backup either i dont have any proof so bob said hat up go kill her problem solved bob i said you cant just go around killing people i know thats why you should do it no no i cant go around killing people either why not youve done it before and youve got a new gun and everything i cant arbitrarily end someones life because of something they may have done biancas a vampire bob pointed out cheerfully shes not alive in the classic sense ill get mister and go fetch the bullets and you i sighed no bob shes got lots of people around her too id probably have to kill some of them to get to her oh damn this is one of those right and wrong issues again isnt it yeah one of those im still confused about this whole morality thing harry join the club i muttered i took a shaking breath and leaned forward to put my hand over the circle and will it broken i almost cringed when its protective field faded from around me but forced myself not to i was as recovered as i was going to get i needed to focus on work i stood up and walked to my work table my eyes by now adjusted to the dimness i reached for the nearest candle but there werent any matches handy so i pointed my finger at it frowned and muttered the words flickum bicus my spell a tiny one i had used thousands of times stuttered and coughed the energy twitching instead of flowing the candles wick smoked but did not flicker to life i frowned then closed my eyes made a little bit of an effort and repeated the spell this time i felt a little surge of dizziness and the candle flickered to life i braced one hand on the edge of the table bob i asked were you watching that yeah bob said a frown in his voice what happened um you didnt put enough magic into the spell the first time around i put as much as i always do i protested come on ive done that spell a million times seventeen hundred and fiftysix that ive seen i gave him a pale version of my usual glower you know what i mean not enough power bob said i call em like i see em i stared at the candle for a second then muttered to myself why did i have to work to make that thing light up probably because the nightmare took a big bite out of your powers harry i turned around very slowly to blink at bob it it did what when it attacked you in your dream did it go after a specific place on your body i put my hand to the base of my stomach pressing there and felt my eyes go wide bob winced oooooo chakra point that isnt good got you right in the chi bob i whispered good thing he didnt go after your mojo though right i mean you have to look on the bright side of these bob i said louder are you saying it it ate my magic bob got a defensive look on his face not all of it i woke you up as quick as i could harry dont worry about it youll heal sure you might be down for a couple of months or um years well decades possibly but thats only a very outside chance i cut him off with a slash of my hand he ate part of my power i said does that mean that the nightmare is stronger well naturally harry you are what you eat dammit i snarled pressing one hand against my forehead okay okay weve really got to find this thing now i started pacing back and forth if its using my power it makes me responsible for what it does with it bob scoffed harry thats irrational i shot him a look that doesnt make it any less true i snapped okay bob said meekly we have now left reason and sanity junction next stop looneyville grrrr i said still pacing we have to figure out where this thing is going to hit next its got all night to move six hours thirteen minutes bob corrected me shouldnt be hard ive been reading those journals you got from the ectomancer while you were sleeping the thing can show up in nightmares but theres going to be commonality between all of it ghosts can only have the kind of power this nightmare has while they are acting within the parameters of their specific bailiwick bailiwhat look at it this way harry a ghost can only affect something that relates directly to its death somehow agatha hagglethorn couldnt have terrorized a cubs game that wasnt where her power was she could mess with infants with abusive husbands maybe with abused wives and meddling wizards i mumbled you put yourself in the line of fire sure bob said but agatha couldnt just run somewhere willynilly and wreak havoc the nightmares got to have a personal beef in this i said thats what youre saying well it has to be related to its demise somehow so yeah i guess that is what im saying more specifically its what mort lindquist was saying in his journals me i said and lydia and mickey malone how the hell do all of those relate i never saw lydia before in my life i frowned at least i dont think i have shes kind of an oddball bob agreed leave her out of the equation for a minute i did and it came to me as clearly as a beam of sunlight dammit i said i turned and ran toward the stairs on my unsteady legs started hauling myself up them and toward the phone what bob called after me harry what if that thing is the demons ghost i know what it wants payback its after the people that took it down i yelled back down the stairs ive got to find murphy chapter nineteen theres a kind of mathematics that goes along with saving peoples lives you find yourself running the figures without even realizing it like a medic on a battlefield this patient has no chance of surviving that one does but only if you let a third die for me the equation broke down into fairly simple elements the demon hungry for its revenge would come after those who had struck it down the ghost would only remember those who had been there whom it had focused on in those last moments that meant that murphy and michael would be its remaining targets michael had a chance of protecting himself against the thinghell maybe a better chance than me murphy didnt i got on the phone to murphys place no answer i called the office and she answered with a fatigueblurred murphy murph i said look i need you to trust me on this one im coming down there and ill be there in about twenty minutes you could be in danger stay where you are and stay awake until i get to you harry murphy asked i could hear her starting to scowl you telling me youre going to be late late no dammit look just do what i said all right i do not appreciate this crap dresden murphy growled i havent slept in two days you told me youd be here in ten minutes and i told you id wait twenty i said twenty minutes murph i could feel her glare over the phone dont be an asshole harry thats not what you said five minutes ago if this is some kind of joke i am not amused i blinked and a cold feeling settled into my gut into the hollow place the nightmare had torn out of me the phone line snapped crackled and popped and i struggled to calm down before the connection went out wait murphy are you saying you talked to me five minutes ago i am about two seconds short of killing the next thing that pisses me off harry and everything keeping me out of bed is pissing me off dont get added to the list she hung up on me dammit i yelled i hung up the phone and dialed murphys number again but only got a busy signal something had talked to murphy and convinced her she was talking to me the list of things that could put on someone elses face was awfully long but the probabilities were limited either another supernatural beastie had wandered onto the stage or i gulped the nightmare had taken a big enough bite of me that it could put on a convincing charade ghosts could take material form after allif they had the power to form a new shape out of material from the nevernever and if they were familiar enough with the shape the nightmare had eaten a bunch of my magic it had the power it needed and it had the familiarity it needed hells bells it was pretending to be me i hung up the phone and tore around the house frantically collecting car keys and putting together an improvised exorcism kit from stuff in my kitchen salt a wooden spoon a table knife a couple of storm candles and matches and a coffee cup i stuffed them all into an old scoobydoo lunch box then as an afterthought reached into a bag of sand that i keep in the kitchen closet for misters litter box and tossed a handful into a plastic bag i added the scorched staff and blasting rod to the accumulating pile of junk in my arms then i ran for the door i hesitated though then went to the phone and dialed michaels number fingers dancing over the rotary it was also busy i let out a shriek of purest frustration slammed down the phone and ran out the door to the blue beetle it was late traffic could have been worse i got there in less than the twenty minutes id promised murphy and parked the car in one of the visitors parking spaces the district station murphy worked in crouched down amongst taller buildings that surrounded it solid and square and a bit battered like a tough old sergeant amongst a forest of tall young recruits i ran up the stairs taking my blasting rod with me with my scoobydoo lunch box in my right hand the grizzled old sergeant behind the desk blinked at me as i came panting through the doorway dresden hi i panted which way did i go he blinked what did i come through here a minute ago his thick grey moustache twitched in nervous little motions he took a look at his clipboard yeah you went up to see lieutenant murphy just a minute ago great i said i need to see her again buzz me through he peered at me a little closer then reached forward to buzz me through whats going on here mr dresden believe me i said as soon as i work that out ill be sure to tell you i opened the door and headed through up the stairs and toward the si offices on the fourth floor i pounded through the doors and sprinted down the rows of desks toward murphys office stallings and rudolph both started up from their chairs blinking as i went past what the hell rudy blurted his eyes widening wheres murphy i shouted in her office stallings stammered with you murphys office stood at the back of the room with cheap walls and a cheap door that finally bore a genuine metallic nameplate with her name and title on it i leaned back and drove my heel at the doorknob the cheap door splintered but i had to kick it again to send it swinging open murphy sat at her desk still wearing the clothes id last seen her in shed taken her hat off and her short blonde hair was mussed the circles beneath her eyes were almost as dark as bruises she sat perfectly still staring forward with her blue eyes set in an expression of horror i stood behind her all in blackthe same outfit id worn the night wed stopped kravos and his demon the nightmare looked like me its hands rested on either side of her face fingertips on her templesexcept that they had somehow pressed into her head reaching down through skin and bone as though gently massaging her brain the nightmare was smiling leaning down a bit toward her head canted as though listening to music i didnt know my face was capable of making an expression like thatserene and malicious and frightening i stared for a second in sheer horror at the weirdness of the sight then blurted get the hell off of her the nightmares dark eyes snapped up sparkling with a cold calm intelligence it lifted its lips away from its teeth in an abrupt snarl be thou silent wizard it murmured steel and razor blades in its words else i will tear thee apart as i already have this night a little gibbering shriek of terror started somewhere down in my quivering belly but i refused to give it a voice i heard rudy and stallings coming behind me i lifted the blasting rod and leveled it at the nightmares head i said to get off of her the nightmares mouth twisted into a smile it lifted its hands away from murphy fingers just sliding out of her skin as though from water and showed me its palms there is something thou hast forgotten wizard yeah i asked whats that i have partaken of thee i am what thou art the nightmare whispered he flicked his wrists toward me ventas servitas wind roared up in a sudden fury and hurled me from my feet back into the air i collided with rudolph and stallings as they ran forward we all went down in a heap upon the ground i lay there stunned for a moment i heard the nightmare walk out it just walked past us footsteps calm and quiet and left the room we gathered ourselves together slowly sitting up what the hell rudolph said my head hurt in back i must have slammed it into something i pressed a hand against my skull and groaned oh stars i muttered i should have known better than to give him a straight line like that stallings had blood running out his nose and into his greying moustache flecks of red spotted his white dress shirt that good lord dresden what was that thing i pushed myself to my feet everything wobbled for a moment my whole body shook and i felt like i might just fall over and start crying like a baby it had used my magic it had stolen my face and my magic and used them both to hurt people it made me want to start screaming to tear something apart with my bare hands instead i staggered toward murphys office its what got malone i told stallings its kind of complicated murphy still sat in her chair her eyes wide and staring and horrified her hands folded into her lap murph i asked karrin can you hear me she didnt move but her breath came out with a little edge to it as though she had tried to speak she breathed thank god i knelt down and took her hands in mine they felt ice cold murph i whispered i waved my hand in front of her eyes and snapped my fingers sharply she didnt so much as blink rudolphs handsome face was pale ill call downstairs tell them not to let him out i heard him go to the nearest phone and start calling down to the desk i didnt bother to tell him that it wouldnt do any good the nightmare could walk out through the walls if it needed to stallings joined me in the room looking shaken and a little grey he stared at murphy for a long moment and then asked what is it whats wrong with her i peered at her eyes they were dilated wide i braced myself and looked deeper into her eyes when a wizard looks into your eyes you cannot hide from him he can see deep down into you see the truest parts of your character the dark places and the lightand you see him in return eyes are the windows to the soul i searched for murphy behind all of that terror and waited for the soulgaze to begin nothing happened murphy just sat there staring ahead another low breath rattled out not quite making a soundbut i recognized the effort she was making for what it was murphy was screaming i had no idea what she was seeing what horrors the nightmare had set before her eyes what it had taken from her i touched her throat with gentle fingertips but i couldnt feel the bonechilling cold of the tormentspell like the one upon malone at least there was that much but if i couldnt see inside of her then murphy was in another place the lights were on but no one was home shes this thing has messed with her head i think its making her see things things that arent here i dont think she knows where she is and she cant seem to move christ preserve stallings whispered what can we do john i said quietly i need you to pull the evidence files from the kravos case i need that big leather book that we found at his apartment stallings started and then stared at me you need what i repeated my request he closed his eyes jesus dresden i dont know i dont know if i could get it theres been some stuff come up lately i need that book i said the thing thats doing this is a kind of demon kravos will have that demons name written down in his spell book if i can get that name i can catch this thing and stop it i can make it tell me how to help murph you dont understand it isnt going to be that easy for me this has gotten complicated and im not going to be able to just walk into storage and get the damn thing for you dresden he studied murphy with worried eyes it could cost me my job i set my scoobydoo lunch box on the floor and opened it up listen to me i said im going to try to help murphy i need someone to stay with her until dawn and then to take her back to her houseor better yet to malones house why stallings asked what are you doing i think this thing is making her live through some messed up stufflike in a nightmare im pretty sure i can stop it but shell still be vulnerable so im going to set up a protection around her so that shell be safe until dawn once morning rolled around the nightmare would be trapped in whatever mortal body it possessed or else would have to flee to the nevernever someone will need to watch her in case she wakes up rudolph can do it stallings said and rose to his feet ill talk to him i looked up at him i need that book john he frowned studying the ground in front of me are we going to be able to catch this thing dresden we meaning the police i could hear that much in his voice i shook my head if i get the book for you he said can you help the lieutenant i nodded at him he closed his eyes and let out a breath all right he whispered then he walked out i heard him talking to rudolph a moment later i turned back to murphy taking the plastic sack of sand out of the lunch box i got out a piece of chalk and pushed murphys chair back from the desk so that i could draw a circle around us both and will it closed it took more effort than it usually did leaving me dizzy for a second i swallowed and began to gather up energy to focus it as carefully and precisely as i could it built slowly while murphy continued to inhale and to exhale whispered screams i put my hand on her cold fingers and thought about all the stuff wed been through the bond of friendship that had grown between us good times and bad murphs heart had always been in the right place she didnt deserve this kind of torment a great fury began to stir in menot some vaporous swiftly dissipated flash of anger but something deeper darker more calm and more dangerous rage rage that this sort of thing should happen to someone as selfless and caring as murphy rage that the creature had used my power my face to trick its way close to her and to hurt her from that rage came the power i needed i gathered it up carefully and shaped it with my thoughts into the softestedged spell i could conceive gently i sent the power coursing down my arm into the grains of sand i pinched between a single fingertip then i slowly lifted my arm the spell holding in a precarious balance as i sprinkled a bit of sand over each of her eyes dormius dorme i whispered murphy dormius power coursed out of me flowed down my arm like water i felt it fall with the grains of sand murphy let out a long shivering breath and her staring eyes began to flutter closed her expression slackened from horror to deep silent sleep and she slumped into her chair i let out my breath as the spell took hold and bowed my head trembling i reached out and stroked my hand over murphys hair then i composed her into something that looked a little more comfortable down where theres no dreams i whispered to her just rest murph ill nail this thing for you with an effort of will i smudged the circle and broke it then i stepped outside it used the chalk to close it again and willed it closed around murphy i had to strain this time more than id ever needed to since i was barely more than a child but the circle closed around her sealing her in a small haze only an inch or two high danced around the chalk lines like heat waves rising from summer roads the circle would keep out anything from the neverneverand the enchanted sleep would hold until the dawn came keep her from dreaming and giving the nightmare a way to further harm her i shambled out of her office to the nearest phone rudolph watched me stallings wasnt in evidence i dialed michaels number it was still busy i wanted to crawl home and drop a sleep spell on myself i wanted to hide somewhere warm and quiet and get some rest but the nightmare was still out there it was still after its vengeance after michael i had to get to it find it stop it or at least warn him i put the phone down and started gathering my stuff together someone touched my shoulder i looked up at rudolph he looked uncertain pale youd better not be a fake dresden he said quietly im not really sure whats going on here but so help me god if something happens to the lieutenant because of you i studied his face numbly and then nodded ill call back for stallings i need that book rudolphs expression was serious earnest hed never much liked me anyway i mean it dresden if you let murphy get hurt ill kill you kid if anything happens to murphy because of me i sighed i think ill let you chapter twenty i wouldnt have thought you could find a peaceful suburbanish neighborhood in the city of chicago michael had managed not too far west of wrigley field ancient old trees lined either side of the street in stately splendor the homes were mostly old victorian affairs restored after a fluctuating economy and a century of wear and tear had reduced them to trembling firetraps michaels house looked like it was made of gingerbread fancy trim elegant paint in ivory and burgundyand perhaps inevitably a white picket fence around the house and its front yard the porch light cast a circle of white radiance out onto the front lawn almost to the edge of the property i slewed the beetle up onto the curb in front of the house and pushed my way through the swinging gate clomping up the stairs to rattle the knocker against the front door i figured that it would take michael a minute to stagger out of bed and come down the stairs but instead i heard a thump a pair of long steps and then the curtains of the window beside the door stirred a second later the door opened and michael stood there blinking sleep out of his eyes he wore a pair of jeans and a tshirt with john across his chest he held one of his kids in his brawny arms one i hadnt seen yetmaybe a year old with a patch of curly golden hair her face pressed against her daddys chest as she slept harry michael said his eyes widened merciful father whats happened to you its been a long night i said have i been here yet michael peered at me im not sure what you mean harry good then i havent michael youve got to wake your family up now they could be in danger he blinked at me again harry its late what on earth just listen in terse terms i outlined what id learned about the nightmare and how it was getting to its victims michael stared at me for a minute then he said let me get this straight the ghost of a demon i killed two months ago is rampaging around chicago getting into peoples dreams and eating their minds from the inside yeah i said and now its taken a part of you manifested a body that looks like you and you think its coming here yes i said exactly michael pursed his lips for a moment then how do i know that you arent this nightmare trying to get me to invite you in i opened my mouth closed it again then said either way its better if i stay out here charity would probably gouge out my eyes for showing up at this hour michael nodded come on in harry let me put the baby to bed i stepped inside into a small entry hall with a polished hardwood floor michael nodded toward his living room to the right and said sit down ill be back in a second michael i said you should wake your family up you said this thing is in a solid body right it was a few minutes ago then its not in the nevernever its here in chicago it cant get into peoples dreams from here i dont think so but and its going to be after the people who were near it when it died its going to come after me i chewed on my lip for a second then i said its got a part of me in it too michael frowned at me if i was going to come after you michael i said i wouldnt start with you he looked down at the child he carried his face hardened and he said in a very soft voice harry sit ill be down in a moment but it might ill see to it he said in that same soft gentle voice it scared me i sat down he took the child walking softly and vanished up a stairway i sat for a moment in a big comfortable easy chair the kind that rocks back and forth there was a towel and a halfemptied bottle off to my left on the lamp table michael must have been rocking the little girl to sleep beside the bottle was a note i leaned forward and picked it up reading michael didnt want to wake you and the baby the little one is demanding pizza and ice cream ill be back in a few minutesprobably before you wake up and read this love charity i stood up and started toward the stairs michael appeared at the top of them his face pale charity he said shes gone i held up the note she went to the store for pizza and ice cream pregnant cravings i guess michael came down the stairs and brushed past me then he reached into the entry hall closet and pulled out a blue levis jacket and amoracchius in its black scabbard what are you waiting for harry lets go find her but your kids michael rolled his eyes took a step to the door and jerked it open without looking away from me father forthill stood on the other side his thinning hair windblown his bright blue eyes surprised behind his wirerimmed spectacles oh michael i didnt mean to stop by so late but my car stalled only a block from here on the way back from taking mrs hamish home and i thought i might borrow he paused looking from me to michael and then back to me again you need a babysitter again dont you michael shrugged into his jacket and slung the sword belt over his shoulder theyre already asleep do you mind father forthill stepped in never he made the cross over each of us again and murmured god go with you we started out of the house and to michaels truck you see harry i scowled handy fringe benefit michael drove the big white truck rumbling down the local streets toward a corner grocery on byron street within a long sprint of the famous graceland cemetery the lowering clouds rumbled and started dumping a steady heavy rain down onto the city giving all the lights golden halos and casting ghostly reflections on the wet streets this time of night michael said walshams is the only place open shell be there thunder rumbled again in growling punctuation to the statement i drummed my fingers on my scorched staff and made sure that my blasting rod was hanging loosely by its thong around my wrist theres her van michael said he pulled the truck up into the row of parking spots in front of the grocery next to the white suburban troop transport he barely took the time to take his keys with himinstead just snatching out amoracchius and loosening the great blade in its sheath as he strode toward the stores front doors his eyes narrowed his jaw set the rain pasted his hair down to his head after a few steps soaking his levis jacket dark blue i followed him wincing at the damage to my leather duster and reflecting that the old canvas job would have fared better in this weather michael slammed the heel of his hand into the door and it swept open with a jangling of tinny bells he strode into the store swept his eyes around the visible displays and the cash registers and then bellowed charity where are you a couple of teenage cashiers blinked at him and an elderly woman perusing the vitamins turned to gawk at him through her spectacles i sighed then nodded to the nearest cashier a tooskinny tooblonde girl who looked as though she were impatient for her cigarette break uh hi i said did you see me come in here a minute ago or a pregnant woman michael said about this high he stuck his hand out flat about at the level of his own ear the female cashier traded a look with her counterpart seen you mister i nodded another guy like me tall skinny all in blackjacket like mine but all black clothes underneath the girl licked her lips and gave us a calculating look maybe i have she said whats in it for me michael rolled forward a step a growl bubbling up out of his throat i grabbed at his shoulder and leaned back whoah whoah michael i yelped slow down man there isnt time to slow down michael muttered you detect im looking with that he turned and strode off deeper into the store casually carrying the sword in his left hand his right upon the weapons grip charity i muttered something unflattering under my breath then turned back to the cashier i fumbled in my pockets for my billfold and managed to produce a sorry trio of wrinkled fives i held them up and said okay my evil twin or else a pregnant woman you seen either one the girl looked at the bills and then back at me and rolled her eyes then she leaned out from her counter and plucked them from my hands yeah she said she went down aisle five a few minutes ago back toward the freezer section yeah i asked then what she smiled what is this your brother or something running around with your woman am i going to see this on larry fowler tomorrow i narrowed my eyes its complicated i said what else did you see she shrugged she paid for some stuff and went to that van out there it wouldnt start i saw youor the guy that looks like you come up to her and start talking to her she looked pretty pissed at him but she walked off with him i didnt think anything of it my stomach gave a little lurch walked off i said which way the cashier shrugged look mister she just looked like she was getting a ride somewhere she wasnt fighting or nothing which way i thundered the cashier blinked and her jaded exterior wobbled for a moment she pointed down the streettoward graceland michael i shouted come on then i turned around and banged my way back outside and into the rain and the dark i stopped at charitys van for a second and tapped at the hood it wobbled up without resistance to reveal a mess of torn wires and shredded belts and broken pieces of metal i winced and shielded my eyes from the rain trying to scan down the street toward the cemetery in the far distance just barely i saw two figuresone ungainly with long hair the other stood tall over her slender walking toward the cemetery holding her firmly by the hair they vanished into the shadows at the base of the stone wall around graceland i gulped and looked around michael i shouted again i peered through the grocerys windows but i couldnt see him anywhere dammit i said and kicked at the front bumper of the van i was in no shape to go after the nightmare on my own it was full of power it had stolen from me it had the booga booga factor going for it and it had my friends wife and unborn child as hostages hells bells all i had was a headache an hourglass quickly running out of sand and a case of the shakes chicagos biggest cemetery on a dark rainy night when the border between here and the spirit world was leaking like a sieve it would be full of spooks and crawlies and i would be alone yeah i muttered that figures i sprinted for the darkness into which i had seen the nightmare disappear with charity chapter twentyone ive done smarter things in my life once for example i threw myself out of a moving car in order to take on a truckload of lycanthropes singlehandedly that had been nominally smarter at least i had been fairly certain that i could kill them if i had to at the time which put me one step ahead of where i was now i had already killed the nightmareor helped to kill it at least something about that just didnt seem fair there should be some kind of rule against needing to kill anything more than once rain fell in sheets rather than drops sluicing down into my eyes i had to keep on wiping my brow sweeping water away only to have it fill my vision again i started to give serious thought to what it might be like to drown right there on the sidewalk i cut across the street toward the cemetery fence seven feet of red brick the fence rose in a jagged stairstep fashion every hundred feet or so keeping up with the slow slope of the street along its southern perimeter as it moved west at one point a gaping slash of darkness marred the fences exterior and i slowed as i approached it the bricks had been torn like paper and lay in rubble two feet deep around the hole in the wall i tried to peer beyond it and saw only more rain green grass the shadows of trees cast over the carefully tended grounds i paused outside the graveyard a dull restless energy pressed against me like when weariness and caffeine mix around threethirty in the morning it rolled against my skin and i heard actually heard whispering voices through the rain dozens hundreds of whispers ghostly sussurance i put my hand on the wall and felt the tension there there are always fences around cemeteries always whether stone or brick or chainlink its one of those unwritten things that people dont really notice they just do it by reflex any kind of wall is a barrier in more than merely a physical sense lots of things are more than what they seem in a purely physical sense walls keep things out walls around cemeteries keep things in i looked back hoping that michael had followed me but i didnt or couldnt see him in the rain i still felt weak shaken the voices whispered clustering around the weak point in the wall where the nightmare had torn its way in even if only one death in a thousand had produced a ghost and more than that did there might be dozens of restless spirits wandering the grounds some even strong enough for nonpractitioners of the art to experience tonight there werent dozens dozens would have been a happy number i closed my eyes and could feel the power they stirred up the way the air wavered and shook with the presence of hundreds of spirits easily crossed over from the turbulent nevernever it made my knees shake my belly quiverboth from the wounds that had been inflicted on me by the nightmare and from simple primitive fear of darkness the rain and a place of the dead the inmates of graceland felt my fear they pressed close to the break in the wall and i began to hear actual physical moans i should wait here i muttered to myself shaking in the rain i should wait for michael that would be the smart thing to do somewhere in the darkness of the cemetery a woman screamed charity what i wouldnt have given to have my dead mans talisman back now son of a bitch i gripped my staff knuckles white and got out my blasting rod then i clambered through the break in the wall and headed into the darkness i felt them the moment i crossed into the cemetery the second my shoes hit the ground ghosts shades haunts whatever you want to call them they were dead as hell and they werent going to take it anymore they were weak spirits each of them something that would barely have given me a passing shiver on a normal nightbut tonight wasnt a chill fell over me abrupt as winters first wind i took a step forward and felt a resistance but not as though someone was trying to keep me out it felt more like those movies ive seen with tourists struggling through crowds of beggars in dusty middle eastern cities thats what i experienced in a chilling and spectral kind of waypeople pushing against me struggling to get something from me something that i wasnt sure i had and that i didnt think would do any good even if i gave it to them i gathered in my will and slipped my mothers amulet from around my neck i held it aloft in the smothering clammy darkness and fed power into it the blue wizard light began to glow to cast out a dim radiance not so bright as usual the silver pentagram within the circle was the symbol of my faith if thats what you wanted to call it in magic in the concept of power being controlled ordered used for constructive purpose i wondered for a minute if the dimness was a reflection of my injuries or if it said something about my faith i tried to think of how often id had to set something on fire the past few years how many times id had to blow something up or smash a building or otherwise wreak havoc i ran out of fingers and shivered maybe id better start being a little more careful the spirits fell back from that light but for a few who still clustered close whispering things into my ears i didnt pay them any attention or stop to listen that way lay madness i shoved forward more an effort of the heart than of the body and started searching charity i shouted charity where are you i heard a short sound a call off to my right but it cut off swiftly i turned toward it and began moving forward at a cautious lope glowing pentacle held aloft like diogeness lamp thunder rumbled again the rain had already soaked the grass made the dirt beneath my feet soft and yielding a brief disturbing image of the dead tearing their way up through the softened earth brought me a brief chill and a dozen spirits clustering close as though to feed from it i shoved both fear and clutching unseen fingers aside and pressed forward i found charity laying upon a bier within a marble edifice that looked like nothing so much as a greek temple the roof open to the sky michaels wife lay upon her back her hands clutched over her swollen belly her teeth bared in a snarl the nightmare stood over her with my dark hair plastered to its head my dark eyes reflecting the gleam of my pentacle it held one hand in the air over charitys belly its other over her throat it tilted its head and watched me approach in the edges of my wizards light shapes moved flitted spirits swirling around like moths wizard the nightmare said demon i responded i wasnt feeling much like any snappier patter it smiled teeth showing is that what i am it said interesting i wasnt sure it lifted its hand from charitys throat pointed a finger toward me and murmured goodbye wizard fuego i felt the surge of power before any fire rose up and swept toward me through the rain i lifted my staff in my left hand in front of me horizontally and slammed power recklessly into a shield riflettum fire and rain met in a furious hiss and a cloud of steam a foot in front of my outstretched staff the rain helped i think i would never have been stupid enough to try for a gout of flame in a downpour like this it was too easily defeated charity moved the instant the nightmares attention was distracted she spun her feet toward it and with a furious cry planted both her heels high in the things chest with a vicious shove charity wasnt a weak woman the thing grunted and flew back away from her and at the same time the motion pushed charitys body off the bier she fell to the other side crying out curling her body around her unborn child to protect it i sprinted forward charity i shouted get out run she turned her head toward me and i saw how furious she was she bared her teeth at me for a moment but her face clouded with confusion dresden she said no time i shouted on the other side of the bier the nightmare rose to its feet again dark eyes gone now instead blazing with scarlet fury i didnt have time to think about it running forward run charity i knew it would be suicide to wrestle with something that had torn down a brick wall a few minutes agobut i had a sinking feeling that i was outclassed in the magic department if he got another spell off i didnt think i could counter it i held my staff in both hands planted it at the base of the bier and vaulted up swinging my feet toward the nightmares face i had speed and surprise on my side i hit it hard and it staggered back my staff spun out of my hands and my hip struck painfully on the edge of the bier and scraped along my ribs as i continued forward riding the thing into the marble flooring my concentration gone the blue wizard light died out and i fell in darkness i hit the ground with a wheeze and scrambled back if the nightmare got hold of me that would be it i had just reached the edge of the bier when something seized my leg right below the knee a grip like an iron band around me i struggled to draw myself back but there was nothing to grab onto but rainslicked marble the nightmare stood up and a flash of lightning somewhere overhead showed me its dark eyes its face like mine it was smiling and so it ends wizard it said i am rid of thee at last i tried to get away but the nightmare simply whirled me by one leg whipping me into a circle in the air then i flew upwards and saw one of the columns coming toward me then there was a flash of light and a sharp pain in the center of my forehead the impact with the ground came as a secondary sensation relatively pleasant compared with the first unconsciousness would have been a mercy cold rain instead kept me awake enough to experience every agonizing second of expanding pain in my skull i tried to move my limbs and couldnt and for a second i thought that my neck must have broken then in the corner of my vision i saw my fingers twitch and thought with a flash of depression that i wasnt out of the fight yet a major effort got my hand down onto the ground another major effort pushed me up and made my head spin my stomach heave i leaned back against the column gasping for breath through the rain and tried to gather my strength it didnt take longthere just wasnt all that much strength left to gather i opened my eyes slowly focused them i felt a sharp tang in my mouth i touched my hand to my mouth my cheek and my fingers came away stained with something warm and dark blood i tried to rise up and couldnt just couldnt everything spun too much water coursed down over me chilling me pooling at the base of the little hill the greek templecummausoleum stood upon running a stream down toward another creek so much water purred a female voice beside me so many things flowing down away i wonder if some of them are not being wasted i rolled my head enough to see my godmother standing beside me in her green dress leas skin had evidently recovered from the ghost dust id dumped upon her in agatha hagglethorns demesne her golden cateyes studied me with their old familiar warmth her hair spilling around her in a mane that seemed unaffected by the rain she didnt seem to mind it soaking her dress though it clung to the curves of her body showed the perfection of her breasts their tips clearly showing through the silken fabric as she knelt down beside me what are you doing here i muttered she smiled reached out a finger and ran it over my forehead then drew it back to her mouth and slipped it between her lips and suckled gently upon it her eyes closed and she let out a long and shivering sigh such a sweet boy you always were such a sweet boy i tried to push myself to my feet and couldnt something in my head seemed broken she watched me with that same benign smile thy strength is fading my sweet here in the place of the dead it may fail thee altogether this isnt the nevernever godmother i rasped you dont have any power here she pursed her lips in what would have been a seductive pout on a human my blood had stained them even darker my sweet you know it is not true i simply only have what i am given here what i have fairly traded for i bared my teeth at her youre going to kill me then she threw back her head in a rich laugh kill you i never intended to kill you my sweet barring moments of frustration our bargain was for your lifenot your death one of her hounds appeared out of the darkness and crouched beside her fastening its dark eyes upon me she laid a fond hand upon its broad head and it shivered in pleasure i felt myself grow colder at that staring at the hound you dont want me dead you want me i couldnt finish the sentence tamed lea smiled she scratched the dogs ears fondly but not like this her mouth twisted into a contemptuous smirk not as you are pathetic really harry allowing yourself to be eaten so justin and i taught you better than that somewhere close charity shouted again thunder rolled overhead i groaned and struggled to push myself up lea watched me through golden catslitted eyes interested and uncaring i managed to get to my feet my back and most of my weight leaning against the column in the rain i could dimly see charity on her knees the nightmare stood over her one hand clutching her hair it pushed the other toward her head she fought it uselessly shuddering in the rain its fingers sunk into her skull and charitys struggles abruptly ceased i groaned and pushed myself forward to get closer to do something everything spun around and i fell to the earth again hard sweet boy lea sighed poor child she knelt down beside me again and stroked my hair it felt nice through my nausea and pain i think the nausea and pain definitely cut down on the seductive potential of it though would you like me to help you i managed to look up at her lovely face help me i asked hhow her eyes sparkled i can give you what you need to save the white knights lady i stared up at her all the pain the terror the stupid rainy cold made me ache horribly i heard charity whimper i had tried dammit i had done my best to help the woman she didnt even like me it wasnt my fault if she died right i had done everything in my power hadnt i i swallowed down the sickly taste of bile and acid and asked what do you want godmother she shivered and drew in a swift breath what i have always wanted sweet boy this bargain is no different than the one we made years ago it is in fact a part of the same i give you power and in return i get you her eyes flashed i want your promise wizard i want your promise that when the woman is safe you will come to me you will take my hand here tonight you want me to go back with you i whispered but you dont want me like this godmother all torn up im empty inside she smiled and stroked the hellhounds head yes in time you will heal and i will make that time pass swiftly my sweet she leaned closer to me golden eyes burning such pleasures i will teach you no man could wish for a merrier passing she looked up again over the bier that hid my view of charity and the nightmare the white knights lady sees such things now soon she will be trapped as is the police woman how did you know about murphy i demanded i know many things i know that you may die if you do nothing my sweet you may die here cold and alone i dont care about that i said i charity let out a choking sobbing sound nearby lea smiled and murmured time is fleeting child it waits for no one not man nor sidhe nor wizard lea already had me over a barrel if i deepened our pact reconfirmed it id be letting her nail it closed with me inside but i couldnt get up i couldnt do a damned thing to save charity without getting some help i closed my eyes and saw michaels little daughter i thought of her growing up without a mother damn it i accept your bargain godmother when i spoke the words i felt something stir against me something that sealed closed lea gasped eyes closing as she shuddered again then opening with a feral glow she leaned down and murmured the answer my sweet is all around you then she kissed my forehead and was gone in a flicker of shadows i found myself thinking clearly again it still hurt to movestars did it hurt but i managed it i clambered to my feet leaned against the bier and looked up to let the rain wash the blood from my eyes the answer was all around me what the hell kind of idiotic advice was that i glared around but saw nothing but rolling lawns trees and graves lots of graves plain tombstones and marble markers graves with ponds beside them graves with lights graves with small fountains dead people thats what was all around i focused my eyes on charity and the nightmare and felt cold anger inside i moved around the edge of the bier gaining a little stability and balance as i went and shouted hey you ugly the nightmare turned its head to blink in my direction surprised then it smiled again and said thou art not yet dead how interesting it released charity fingers gliding out of her as they had from murphy and she fell limply to her side i can finish that one at leisure but thou wizard i will make an end to at once yadda yadda yadda i muttered i bent down and recovered my staff standing again with it in both hands people dont talk like that anymore all those thous and thees hells bells at least the faeries can keep up with the dialect the nightmare frowned at me and started walking toward me dost thou not realize it fool this is thy death come upon thee a boot planted itself heavily on the marble beside me then another amoracchius cast a glowing white light upon my shoulder and michael said i think not i glanced aside at michael you i groaned have very good timing he bared his teeth in an unpleasant fierce expression my wife shes alive i said but wed better get her out of here he nodded ill kill it again he said he passed me something hard and coola crucifix you get her give her this the nightmare came to a halt its eyes narrowing upon the pair of us thou it said to michael i knew it would come to this oh shut up i shouted exasperated michael killing this thing already michael started forward the swords white fire lighting the night like a halogen torch the nightmare screamed in fury and threw itself to one side avoiding the blade then rushed back in toward michael fingers raking like claws michael ducked under them planted a shoulder in the things gut and shoved it away spun and whipped the sword at it amoracchius cut into the nightmares midsection and white fire erupted from the wound i hurried forward around michaels back to charity already she was stirring trying to sit up dresden she whispered to me my husband hes busy kicking ass i said and pressed the crucifix into her fingers here take this can you walk mind your tongue mr dresden she grasped the crucifix and bowed her head for a second i dont know she said oh lord help me i think her whole body tightened and she let out a low gasp pressing her hand against her belly what i said had she been injured behind me i could hear michael grunting see the sweep of amoracchiuss white fire making shadows dance charity what is it she let out a low groan the baby she said oh i think i think my water broke earlier when i fell her face twisted up flushing bright red and she groaned again oh i said oh oh no no this is not happening i put the heel of my hand to my forehead this is just wrong i shot an accusing glance skywards someone up there has a sick sense of humor nnngggrhhh charity groaned oh lord preserve mr dresden i dont have much time no i sighed naturally not i bent down to pick her up and all but fell on my face i managed to keep from sprawling onto her but wobbled as i stood up again charity was not a dainty flower there was no way i could carry her out of there michael i shouted michael weve got a problem michael threw himself behind one of the biers as a stone whistled out of the darkness and shattered to powder against it what charity i shouted her babys coming harry michael shouted look out i turned and the nightmare appeared from the darkness behind me moving almost more swiftly than i could see it reached down and simply tore a marble headstone from the earth lifting it high i threw myself between it and charity but even as i did i knew it would be a futile gestureit was strong enough to crush her right through me but i did it anyway now screamed the nightmare put down your sword knight put it down or i crush them both michael started towards us his face pale not a step closer the nightmare snarled not an inch michael stopped he stared at charity who groaned again panting eyes forced shut hharry he said i could get out of the things way i could draw its fire maybe but if i moved it could simply crush charity shed have no chance at all the sword the nightmare said voice cool drop it oh lord michael whispered dont do it michael i said its only going to kill us anyway be thou silent the nightmare said my quarrel is with thee wizard and with the knight the woman and her child are nothing to me so long as i have both of you rain sleeted down for a long and otherwise silent moment then michael closed his eyes harry he said he lowered the great sword then gave it a gentle toss to one side letting it fall on the ground im sorry i cant do it the nightmare met my eyes with its own glowing faint scarlet and its lips curled up into a gleeful smile wizard it said in a whisper thy friend should have listened to thee i saw the gravestone start to come down toward me charitys arm abruptly swept up the crucifix id passed her held in it the symbol flickered and then kindled with white fire that threw harsh horrormovie shadows up over the nightmares face it twisted and recoiled from that light screaming and the tombstone crashed down to the earth rending the damp vulnerable soil everything slowed down and came into crystalline focus i could clearly see the grounds the shadows of the trees i could hear charity beside me uttering something in harsh latin and out of the corner of my eye could see the restless shades moving about the cemetery i could feel the cold sharpness of the rain feel it coursing down over me flowing down the gentle slopes to run in rivulets and streams to the nearby pond running water the answer was all around me i moved forward toward the nightmare it swung at me with one flailing arm and i felt it clip my shoulder as it swept down then i threw myself into the nightmares body hit it hard we tumbled together down the slope toward the newly forming stream you ever hear the legend of sleepy hollow remember the part with poor old ichabod riding like blazes for the covered bridge and safety running water grounds magical energies creatures of the nevernever spirit bodies cannot cross it without losing all the energy required to keep those bodies here that was the answer i rolled down the slope with the nightmare and felt its hands tearing at me we went down into the stream together as one of its hands clenched my throat and shut off my breath and then it began to scream it jerked and twisted atop me in eight or nine inches of running water shrieking the things body just started melting away like sugar in water starting at its feet and moving up i watched it watched myself dissolve with a morbid kind of fascination it writhed it bucked it thrashed wizard it said voice bubbling this is not over not over when the sun sets again wizard i will be back for thee melt already i mumbled and seconds later the nightmare vanished leaving only sticky gook behind on my coat my throat i stood up out of the water drenched and shivering and slogged my way back up the little hill michael had gone to his wife and crouched down beside her he got his arms underneath her and lifted her as though she were a basket of laundry like i said before michaels buff harry he said the sword i got it i replied i trudged up to where hed let amoracchius fall and picked it up the great blade weighed less than i would have thought and it fairly hummed with power vibrating in my fingers i didnt have a sheath for it so i just slung it up on one shoulder and hoped i wouldnt fall and cut my head off or something i recovered my other stuff too and turned to walk out with michael that was when lea arrived appearing before me with a trio of her hellhounds around her my sweet she said it is time to fulfill your bargain i yelped and jumped back from her no i said no wait i beat this thing but its still loose it will be able to come back from the nevernever tomorrow night that is of no concern to me lea said and shrugged our bargain was for you to save the woman with what i gave you you didnt give me anything i said you just blanked out some of the pain it isnt as though you made the water godmother she shrugged smiling semantics i pointed it out to you did i not i would have realized it on my own i said perhaps but we have a bargain she lowered her face eyes gleaming gold and dangerous are you going to attempt to escape it once more id given my word and broken promises add up to trouble but the nightmare hadnt been defeated driven back sure but it would only be back the next night ill go with you i said when ive beaten the nightmare youll go now lea smiled this instant or pay the price the three hellhounds took a pace toward me baring their teeth in a silent snarl i fumbled everything out of my grasp but the sword and gripped it tightly i dont know a thing about broadswords but it was heavy and sharp and even without its vast power i was pretty sure i could stick the pointy part into one of those hounds i cant do that i said not yet harry michael shouted wait it cant be used like that one of the hounds leapt toward me and i lifted the blade then there was a flash of light and a jolt of pain that lanced up through my hands and arms the blade twisted in my grasp fell out of it and spun to the ground the hellhound snapped at me and i stumbled back my hands gone numb and useless leas laughter rang out through the graves like silver bells yes she caroled stepping forward she bent and with a casual motion picked up the great sword i knew you would try to cheat me again sweet boy she smiled at me a flash of dainty canines i must thank you harry i would never have been able to touch this had not the one who held it betrayed its purpose i felt a flash of anger at my own stupidity no i stammered wait cant we talk about this godmother well talk again sweet boy ill see you both very soon lea laughed again eyes gleaming and then she turned her hellhounds gathering at her feet and took a step forward vanishing into the night the sword went with her i stood there in the rain feeling tired and cold and stupid michael stared at me for a second his expression shocked eyes wide charity curled against him shuddering and moaning quietly harry michael whispered i think he was crying but i couldnt see the tears in the rain oh my god what have you done chapter twentytwo all hospital emergency rooms have the same feel to them theyre all decorated in the same dull muted tones and softened edges which are meant to be comforting and arent they all have the same smell too one part tangy antiseptics one part cool dispassion one part anxiety and one part naked fear they wheeled charity away first michael at her side triage being what it is i got bumped to the front of the line i felt like apologizing to the fiveyearold girl holding a broken arm sorry honey head trauma before fractured limbs the doctor who examined me wore a nameplate that read simmons she was broadly built and toughlooking hair going grey in sharp contrast to her rich dark skin she sat down on a stool in front of me and leaned over putting her hands on either side of my head they were large warm strong i closed my eyes how are you feeling she asked releasing me after a moment and reaching for some supplies on a table next to her like a supervillain just threw me into a wall she let out a soft chuckle more specifically are you in pain dizzy nauseous yes no and a little you hit your head yeah i felt her start to daub at my forehead with a cold cloth cleaning off grime and dried blood though there wasnt much left thanks to the rain mmmm well theres some blood here are you sure its yours i opened my eyes and blinked at her mine whose else would it be the doctor lifted an eyebrow at me dark eyes glittering from behind her glasses you tell me mister she checked her charts dresden she frowned and then peered up at me harry dresden the wizard i blinked im not really famous despite being the only wizard in the phone book im more infamous people dont tend to spontaneously recognize my name yeah thats me she frowned i see ive heard of you anything good not really she let out a cross sigh theres no cut here i dont appreciate jokes mister dresden there are people in need to attend to i felt my mouth drop open no cut but there had been a nice flowing gash in my head at some point pouring blood into my eyes and mouth i could still taste some of it almost how could it have vanished i thought of the answer and shivered godmother no cut she said something that might have been cut a few months ago thats impossible i said more to myself than to her that just cant be she shone a light at my eyes i winced she peered at each eye mechanically professionallywithout the intimacy that triggers a soulgaze and shook her head if youve got a concussion im winona ryder get off that bed and get out of here make sure to talk to the cashier on the way out she pressed a moist towelette into my hand ill let you clean up this mess mister dresden i have enough work to do but you shouldnt come into the emergency room unless its absolutely necessary but i didnt dr simmons didnt stop to listen to me she turned around and strode off over to the next patientthe little girl with the broken arm i got up and made my bruised way into the bathroom my face was a mess of faint dried blood it had settled mostly into the lines and creases making me look older a mask of blood and age i shivered and started cleaning myself off trying to keep my hands from shaking i felt scared really honestly scared i would have been much happier to have needed stitches and painkillers i wiped away blood and peered at my forehead there was a faint pink line beginning about an inch below my hair and slashing up into it at an angle it felt very tender and when i accidentally touched it with the rag it hurt so much that i almost shouted but the wound was closed healed magic my godmothers magic that kiss on the forehead had closed the wound if you think i should have been happy about getting a nasty cut closed up then you probably dont realize the implications working magic directly on a human body is difficult its very difficult conjuring up forces like my shield or elemental manifestations like the fire or wind is a snap compared to the complexity and power required to change someones hair a different coloror to cause the cells on either side of an injury to fuse back together closing it the healing cut was a message for me my godmother had power over me on earth now too as well as in the nevernever id made a bargain with one of the fae and broken it that gave her power over me which she demonstrated aptly by the way shed wrought such a powerful and complex working on meand id never even felt it happening that was the part that scared me id always known that lea had outclassed meshe was a creature with a thousand years or more of experience knowledge and she had been born to magic like i had been born to breathing so long as i remained in the real world though shed had no advantage over me our world was a foreign place to her just as hers was to me id had the home field advantage had being the operative word had hells bells i gave up and let my hands shake while i wiped off my face i had a good reason to be afraid besides my clothes were soaked from the rain and i felt desperately cold i finished washing the blood away and went to stand in front of the electric hand dryer i had to slam the button a dozen times before it started i had the nozzle of the thing turned up directing the hot air up my shirt when stallings came in sans for once rudolph he looked as though he hadnt slept since id seen him last his suit was rumpled his grey hair a little greyer and his moustache was almost the same color as the bags underneath his eyes he went to the sink and splashed cold water on his face without looking at me dresden he said we got word you were in the hospital heya john hows murphy she slept we just brought her in i blinked at him christ is it dawn already about twenty minutes ago he moved over to the dryer next to mine his started on the first slap of the button shes sleeping still the docs are arguing about whether shes in a coma or on some kind of drug you tell them what happened i asked he snorted yeah ill just tell them that a wizard put her under a spell and shes sleepy he glanced over at me so whens she going to wake up i shook my head my spell wont hold her for long maybe a couple more days at the most each time the sun comes up its going to degrade it a little more what happens then she starts screaming unless i find the thing that got her and figure out how to undo what it did thats what you want kravoss book for stallings said i nodded yeah he reached into his pocket and produced the booka little journal thick but not broad bound in dark leather it was sealed in a plastic evidence bag i reached for it but stallings pulled it away dresden if you touch this if you open it up youre going to be leaving your prints on it skin cells all sorts of things unless it disappears i frowned at him whats the big deal kravos is all but put away right hell we caught him with the murder weapon with a body at the scene there isnt anything in the journal to beat that is there he grimaced if it was just his trial it wouldnt be a problem what do you mean he shook his head inside shit i cant talk about it but if you take this book dresden its got to vanish fine i said reaching for it its gone he pulled it away again i mean it he said promise something about the quiet intensity of his words touched me all right i said i promise he stared at the book for a second then slapped it into my palm hell with it he said if you can help murph do it john i said hey man if i didnt think i needed it whats going on here internal affairs stallings said looking at si again dont they have anything better to do what set them off this time nothing stallings lied he turned to go john i said what arent you telling me here he paused at the door and grimaced theyre interested in the kravos case thats all i can say you should hear word in the next day or so youll know it when you hear it wait i said something happened to kravos ive got to go harry good luck wait stallings he headed out the door i cursed and started after him but he lost me i wound up standing in the hallway shivering like a wet puppy dammit cops were tight a special kind of brotherhood theyd work with you but if you werent a cop you were on the outside in a billion subtle waysone of which was that they didnt let you in on the departments secrets what could have happened to kravos something serious hell maybe the nightmare had taken out a little vengeance on him as well as long as it was out and about served him right though if it had happened i stood there for a minute trying to work out what to do i had no money on me no car no way to get either i needed michael i asked someone for directions and headed for maternity i took a long route around staying away from anything that looked technical or expensive the last thing i wanted was to blow up grandpas iron lung i found michael standing in a hallway his hair had dried all curled and mussed there seemed to be more grey in it this way than usual his beard had a rough untrimmed look to it his eyes were sunken mud spattered his boots and his jeans to the knee amoracchiuss black scabbard hung over his shoulder empty michael stood in front of a big picture window rows of little people in rolling cradles faced the window heat lamps making sure that they didnt get chills i stood there quietly with him looking at the babies for a time a nurse looked up and then did a double take staring at us before hurrying out of the room aha i said that nurse recognizes us i didnt realize we were back down at cook county didnt recognize the place without something being on fire charitys doctor is here uhhuh i said so which one is the newest little carpenter michael remained silent i got a sick little feeling and glanced aside at him michael when he spoke his voice was exhausted numb the labor was complicated she was cold and might have been getting sick with something her water did break back at the graveyard i guess it makes it a lot harder on the baby i just listened to him feeling sicker they had to go ahead and do a csection but they think there might be damage she got hit in the stomach at one point they think they dont know if shell be able to have children again the baby silence michael he stared at the infants and said the doctor says that if he lasts thirtysix hours he might have a chance but hes weakening theyre doing everything they can tears started at his eyes and rolled down his cheeks there were complications complications i tried to find something to say and couldnt dammit tired frustration stirred my already unsteady belly this shouldnt have happened if id been faster or smarter or made a better decision maybe i could have stopped charity from getting hurt or the baby i put my hand on michaels shoulder and squeezed tight just trying to let him know that i was there for all the good id done he took in a breath the doctor thinks i beat her thats how she got the bruises he never said anything but thats ridiculous i said at once stars and stones michael thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard his voice came out hard bitter he stared at his faint reflection in the glass it might as well have been me harry if i hadnt gotten myself involved this demon wouldnt have gone after her i heard his knuckles pop as he clenched his fists it should have come after me youre right i said holy hell michael youre right he shot me a look what are you talking about i rubbed my hands together trying to sort through the ideas flashing across my brain in neon lights its a demon this thing were after right its a demons ghost an orderly walking by pushing a tray gave me an odd look i smiled at him feeling rather manic he hurried along yes michael said demons are tough michael theyre dangerous and theyre scary but theyre really kind of clueless in a lot of ways how so they just dont get it about people they understand things like lust and greed and the desire for power but they just dont get things like sacrifice and love its alien to most of themdoesnt make any sense at all i dont understand what youre driving at remember what i said about how i knew the worst way to get to you would be through your family his frown darkened but he nodded i know that because im human i know what its like to care about someone other than myself demons dontespecially the thugtype demons who make pacts with twobit sorcerers like kravos even knowing that i thought the best way to get to you would be through someone close to you i dont think a demon would have understood the context of that information so what youre saying is that this demon would have had no reason to go after my wife and child im saying its inconsistent if it was just a question of a demons ghost going after the people who had killed it then it should have just hammered on us all until we died and been done with it i dont think it ever would have occurred to it to take a shot at someone that we care abouteven if it did have my knowledge about you theres got to be something else going on here michaels eyes widened a bit the nightmare is a catspaw he said someone else is using it to hit at us someone who can cast those barbedwire torment spells i said and weve been chasing around after the tool instead of going after the hand thats wielding it blood of god michael swore it was about the second most powerful oath he used who could it be i shook my head i dont know someone who has us both in common i guess how many enemies do we share he wiped his eyes on his sleeve expression intent im not sure ive made enemies with pretty much every creature in the country ditto i said morosely even some of the other wizards wouldnt mind seeing me fall down a few flights of stairs not knowing our attackers identity doesnt bother me as much as something else though whats that why he hasnt taken us out already they want to hurt us first vengeance his brow beetled could your godmother be behind this i shook my head i dont think so shes a faerie they arent usually this methodical or organized and they arent impatient either this things been active every night like it couldnt wait to get going michael looked at me for a moment then he said harry you know that i dont think its my place to judge another person i hear a but coming he nodded but how did you get mixed up with the likes of that faerie shes bad harry some of them are merely alien but that one is malevolent she enjoys causing pain yeah i said i didnt exactly pick her who did i shrugged my mother i think she was the one with power my father wasnt a wizard wasnt into their world i dont understand why she would do that to her child something inside me broke with a little snapping sensation and i felt tears at my eyes i scowled they were a childs tears to go with a childs old pain i dont know i said i know that she was mixed up with some bad people bad beings whatever maybe lea was one of her allies lea its short for leanandsidhe isnt it yeah i dont know her real name she takes blood from mortals and gives them inspiration in return artists and poets and things thats how she amassed most of her power michael nodded ive heard of her this bargain you have with her what is it i shook my head it isnt important something shifted in michael became harder more resolute it is important to me harry tell me i stared at the babies for a minute before i said i was a kid things fell out with my old teacher justin he sent a demon to kill me and i went on the run i made a bargain with lea enough power to defeat justin in exchange for my service to her my loyalty and you broke faith with her more or less i shook my head shes never pushed it before now and ive been careful to stay out of her way she doesnt usually get this involved with mortal business michael moved his hand to amoracchiuss empty scabbard she did take the sword though i winced yeah i guess that was my fault if i hadnt have tried to use it to weasel out of the deal you couldnt have known michael said i should have i said it isnt as though it was a tough one to figure out michael shrugged though his expression was less casual than the gesture whats done is done but i dont know how much help to you i can be without the sword well get it back i said leah cant help herself she makes deals well figure out a way to get it back from her but will we do it in time michael said he shook his head grim the sword wont stay in her hands forever the lord wont allow that but it may be that my time to wield it has passed what are you talking about i asked perhaps it was a sign perhaps that i am no longer worthy to serve him in this way or that the burden of it has passed on to someone else he grimaced staring at the glass the infants my family harry perhaps its time they had a fulltime father oh great all i needed now was a crisis of faith and bad case of career doubt from the fist of god i needed michael i needed someone to watch my back someone who was used to dealing with the supernatural sword or no sword he had a steady head and his faith had a subtle power of its own he could be the difference between me getting killed and defeating whoever was out there besides he had wheels lets get going times awasting he frowned i cant im needed here michael look is someone with your kids at home yes i called charitys sister last night she went over father forthill was going to get some sleep and then stay on is there anything more you can do for charity here he shook his head only pray shes resting now and her mother is on the way here okay then weve got work to do you expect me to leave them again no not leave them but we need to find the person behind the nightmare and take care of them harry what are we going to do kill someone if we have to hells bells michael they might have murdered your son his face hardened and i knew then that i had him that hed follow me into hell to get at whoever had hurt his wife and child i had him all rightand i hated myself for it way to go harry jerk those heartstrings like a fucking puppeteer i held up the book i think ive got a line on the nightmares name ill bet you anything that kravos recorded it in his book of shadows here if im right i might be able to use it to make contact with the nightmare and then trace his leash back to whoevers holding it michael stared at the glass at the kids beyond it i need you to drive me home from my lab i might be able to sort out whats going on before things get any more out of hand then we go handle it he didnt say anything michael all right he said voice quiet lets go chapter twentythree back in my lab it felt a little creepy to be working by candlelight intellectually i knew that it was still full daylight outside but last night had brought out the instinctive fear of the dark that is a part of being human i had been wounded everything every shadow every small sound made me twitch and jerk and look aside steady harry i told myself you have time before sundown just relax and get it over with good advice michael and i had driven around most of the morning collecting what i would need for the spell id read through kravoss journal while michael drove sick stuff hed been careful about listing out every step of his rituals complete with notes on the physical ecstasy hed experienced during the killingsnine in all most of them had been women or children hed killed with a cruelly curved knife hed roped a bunch of young people into his fold with drugs and blackmail and then thrown orgies where hed either participate or else channel the energy raised by all that lust into his magic that seemed to be standard operating procedure for guys like kravos winwin situation a thorough man thorough in his efforts to kill and corrupt lives to acquire more power thorough in the documentation of his sick pleasuresand thorough in the listing of his efforts to secure a familiar demon by the name of azorthragal the name had been carefully written each syllable marked for specific emphasis magic is a lot like language its all about stringing things together linking one thing with another one idea with another after you establish links then you pour power into them and make something happen thats what we call thaumaturgy in the businesscreating links between small things and big things then you make something happen on the small scale and it happens on the large scale too voodoo dolls are the typical example for that one but simulacra like a voodoo doll arent the only way to create links a wizard can use fingernail clippings or hair or blood if its fresh enough or just about any other body part to create a link back to the original being or you can use its name or maybe i should say its name names have power everyones name says something about them whether theyre aware of it or not a wizard can use that name to forge a link to someone its difficult with people peoples selfconcepts are always changing evolving so even if you get someone to tell you their full name if you try to establish the link when theyre in a radically different mood or after some lifechanging event that alters the way they see themselves it might not work a wizard can get a persons name only from their own lips but if he doesnt use it fairly quickly its likely to get stale demons however are a different matter demons arent people they dont have the problem of having a soul and they dont worry about silly things like good and evil or right and wrong demons are if a demon is going to be inclined to eat your face its going to eat your face then and now and a thousand years from now its almost comforting in a wayand it makes them vulnerable once you know a demons name you can get to it whenever you want to i had azorthragals name even though it was a ghost now instead of a demon it ought to respond to the memory of its name if nothing else time to get to it five white candles surrounded my summoning circle the points of an invisible pentacle white for protection and because theyre the cheapest color at walmart hey being a wizard doesnt make money grow on trees between each candle was an object from someone the nightmare had touched my shield bracelet was there michael had given me his wedding ring and charitys id gone by the station and grabbed the handlettered nameplate murphy had kept stubbornly on her office door until the publicity last year had driven the municipal politicians into getting her a real one it lay on the floor beside them a visit to a grateful malone household had turned up mickys retirement watch it completed the circle between the last pair of candles i drew in a breath and checked my props you dont need all the candles and knives and whatnot to work magic but they help they make it easier to focus in my weakened condition i needed all the help i could get so i lit the incense and paced around the outside of the summoning circle leaving myself enough room to work with inside the circle of incense and outside the circle of copper i put out a little willpower as i did just enough to close the circle and felt the energy levels rise as random magic coalesced harry michael called down from the room above are you finished i suppressed a flash of irritation just getting started fortyfive minutes until sundown he said i couldnt keep the annoyance out of my voice gee thanks no pressure michael can you do it or not harry father forthill is staying at my house with the children if you cant stop this thing now ive got to go back to charity i sure as hell cant do it with you breathing down my neck hells bells michael get out of the way and let me work he growled something to himself about patience or turning the other cheek or something i heard his feet on the floor above as he retreated from the door leading down to my lab michael didnt come down into the lab with me because the whole concept of using magic without the almighty behind it didnt sit well with him regardless of what wed been through together he could tolerate it but not approve of it i got back to work closing my eyes and forcing myself to clear my thoughts to focus on the task at hand i started to draw my concentration toward the copper circle the incense smoke tickled at my senses and swirled about inside the perimeter of the outer circle not leaving it the energy grew slowly as i concentrated and then i picked up the knife in my right hand and a handful of water from a bowl on my left now for the three steps enemy mine enemy i spoke slipping power into the words i seek you i passed the knife over the copper circle straight down i couldnt see it without opening my sight but could feel the silent tension as i cut a slit between the mortal world and the nevernever enemy mine enemy i spoke again i search for you show me your face i cast the water up over the circle where the energy of the spell atomized it into a fine drifting mist filled with rainbows from the surrounding candles shifting shapes and colors now for the hard part azorthragal i shouted azorthragal azorthragal appare i used the knife to cut my finger and smeared the blood onto the edge of the copper circle power surged out of me into the circle through the rent in the fabric of reality and as it did the circle sprang up like a wall around the band of copper in the floor i felt the cut as an acute vicious pain enough to make me blink tears out of my eyes as the power quested out fueled by the energy of the circle guided by the articles spread around it the spell quested about in the nevernever like the blind tentacle of the kraken scouring the deck looking for some hapless soul to grab it shouldnt have happened like that it should have zipped to the nightmare like a lariat and brought it reeling in i reached out and put more power into the spell picturing the thing that i had been fighting the results of its work trying to give the spell more guidance it wasnt until i hit upon the sense of the nightmare for lack of a better word the terror it had inspired that the spell latched onto something there was a moment of startled stillness and then a wild bucking energy a resistance that made my heart pound in my chest the cut in my finger burn as though someone had poured salt over it appare i shouted forcing will into my voice reeling back in on the spell i command thee to appear i slip into the archaic at dramatically appropriate moments so sue me the swirling mist of rainbows swayed and wavered as though some kind of halfsolid thing were stirring the air within the summoning circle it struggled like a maddened bull trying to tear away from my spell appare upstairs the telephone rang i heard michael walk across the floor while i struggled through several silent furious seconds the nightmare trying to escape the web of my concentration hello michael said hed left the door open and i heard him clearly appare i grated again i felt the thing slip and i jerked it closer in vicious triumph the mists and lights swirled began to take on shape vaguely humanoid oh yes but hes a little busy michael said uhhuh no not exactly i thinkyes but michael sighed just a minute i heard his feet cross to the trap door again harry michael called susans on the phone she says she needs to talk to you i all but screamed struggling to hold onto the nightmare ill call her back i managed to gasp she says its really important michael i halfscreamed im a little busy here harry michael said his voice serious i dont know what youre doing down there but she sounds very upset says shes been trying to get in touch with you for a while without any luck the nightmare started slipping away from me i gritted my teeth and hung on not now all right michael said he retreated from the door down to the lab and i heard him speaking quietly on the phone again i blocked it out blocked out everything but my spell the circle and the thing on the other end of it i was tiring but so was it i had all the props the power and focus of the circleit was strong but i had the leverage on it and after another minute minute and a half i shouted appare for the last time the mist in the circle swirled and trembled taking on a vaguely humanoid shape the shape screamed a faint and bubbly sound still trying to escape you cant get away i shouted at it who brought you over who sent you wizard the thing screamed release me yeah right who sent you i forced more energy into my voice compulsion it screamed a distorted sound like a radio getting interference the shape refused to clarify or solidify anymore no one who sent you i said hammering on the spell and the nightmare with my will who has compelled you to harm these people hells bells you will answer me no one the nightmare snarled its struggling redoubled but i grabbed on tightly and then i felt ita third party intruding from the other side i felt that cold horrible power that had been behind the tormentspell on micky malone and on agatha hagglethorns ghost it poured into the nightmare like nitrous into an engine supercharging it the nightmare went from raging bull to frenzied elephant and i felt it begin to tear free of my spell to get loose wizard it howled in triumph wizard the sun is sinking i will tear out thy heart i will hunt thy friends and their children i will slay them all its thine heart i muttered and no you wont i lifted my left hand and slashed it at the sparkling mist sprinkling droplets of blood at it bound thou art i snarled i reached out toward the thing and found the part of me that was still inside of it a warm sensation like coming home again after a long trip i could only barely brush it but it was enough for what i wanted to do no other souls wilt thou harm no other blood wilt thou spill thy quarrel is now with me bound i make thee bound and with the third repetition of the word i felt the spell lock felt it settle around the nightmare like steel coils i couldnt keep it from getting away i couldnt forbid it from the mortal world altogether but i could damn well make sure that the only person it could mess with would be me now lets see how you do in a fair fight asshole it screamed all but bursting the bonds of my spell the sound reverberating through the room i lifted the knife in my other hand and ripped it at the air over the circle releasing the holding spell pouring everything i had left into the strike i saw the magic lance out into the circle even as the nightmare faded it split the rainbow mist like the sweep of some invisible woodsmans axe and once more the nightmare screamed then the mist gathered together in a horrible rush an implosion of space and the creature was gone a handful of water splattered the ground and the candles went out i collapsed forward to my forearms wheezing and gasping for breath my muscles shaking id hurt the bastard it wasnt invincible id hurt it maybe nothing much more inconvenient than the cut on my finger or a slap in the face but it hadnt expected that i hadnt been able to get to the person behind it but id felt somethingid sensed their presence gotten a clear whiff of their perfume in a metaphysical sense maybe i could use that take that jerk i mumbled i lay there gasping for several minutes my head spinning from the effort of the spell then i put my things away and shambled up out of my lab into the room above michael helped me to a seat hed built up the fire and i soaked in its warmth gratefully he went to the kitchen and brought me a coke a sandwich i drank and ate greedily only after id finished the last of the drink did he ask what happened i called it up the nightmare someone helped it get away but not before i laid a binding on it he frowned at me grey eyes studying my face what kind of binding i kept it from going after you or murphy or your family i couldnt keep it out but i could limit its targets michael blinked at me for a moment then said slowly by making it come after you i grinned at him a fierce show of teeth and nodded a touch of pride filled my voice i had to do it at the last second on the fly i hadnt really planned it but it worked so long as im alive it cant mess with anyone else so long as youre alive michael said he frowned and leaned his thick forearms on his knees pressing his palms together harry yeah doesnt that mean its certainly going to try to kill you no torment no sadistic torturesjust flatout mayhem and death i nodded sobering yeah and whatever person is behind the nightmare whoever helped it escapethat means that youve just put yourself in their way they cant use their weapon until theyve removed you yeah so if they didnt need you dead before theyre going to stop at nothing else now i was quiet for a moment thinking about that i made my choice man i said finally but hell im already in water so deep it doesnt matter if it gets any deeper let the nightmare and my godmother duke it out for who gets to be first in line his eyes flickered up at mine oh harry you shouldnt have done that i scowled at him hey its better than anything else weve managed so far youd have done the same thing if you could yes michael said but my family is well provided for he paused and then added in a gentle voice and im sure of my souls destination when its time for me to go ill worry about hell later besides i think i have a plan he grimaced you arent concerned about your soul but you have a plan i dont intend to get killed just yet weve got to take the offensive michael if we just sit back and wait its going to be able to take us apart take you apart you mean he said his expression grew more troubled harry without amoracchius im not sure how much help ill be to you you know what youre doing michael and i dont think the almighty is going to quit the team just because we fumbled the ball right of course not harry he is ever faithful i leaned toward him put a hand on his shoulder and looked him right in the eyes i dont do that to people very often there arent many i can michael this thing is big and its bad and it scares the hell out of me but i might be the only one who can stop it now i need you i need your help hell man i need to know that youre at my back that you believe in what im doing here are you with me or not he studied my face youve lost much of your power you say and i dont have the sword anymore our enemies know it we could both be killed or worse if we stay here doing nothing were going to get killed anyway and maybe murphy and charity and your kids with us he bowed his head and nodded youre right theres not really any choice his hand covered mine for a moment big and calloused and strong and then he stood up again his back straight and his shoulders squared we just have to have faith the good lord wouldnt give us more than we could bear i hope youre right i said so whats the plan harry what are we going to do i got up and went to the mantel over the fire but what i needed wasnt there i frowned looking around the room and spied it on the coffee table i bent down and plucked up the white envelope taking the goldlettered invitation kyle and kelly hamilton had delivered were going to a party chapter twentyfour michael parked his truck on the street outside biancas mansion he put the keys in his leather belt pouch and buttoned it with the silver cross button then he straightened the collar of his doublet which showed through the neck of the mail and reached behind the seat for the steel helmet that slipped on over his head tell me again harry why this is a good idea why are we going to a masquerade ball with a bunch of monsters everything points us this way i said how i took a breath trying to be patient and passed him the white cloak look we know that someones been stirring up the spirit world we know that they did it in order to create this nightmare thats been after us we know that the girl lydia was connected to the nightmare somehow yes michael said all right bianca i said sent out her thugs to take lydia and biancas hosting a party for the nastiest bad guys in the region stallings told me that people have been going missing off the streets theyve probably been taken for food or something even if bianca isnt behind it and im not saying she isnt chances are that anyone who could be is going to be at the party tonight and you think youll be able to spot them michael asked pretty sure i responded all ill have to do is get close enough to touch them to feel their aura i felt whoever was backing the nightmare when they helped it get away from me i should be able to tell when i feel them again i dont like it michael said why didnt the nightmare come after you the minute the sun went down maybe i scared it i cut it up a little michael frowned i still dont like it there are going to be dozens of things in there that have no right to exist in this world it will be like walking into a roomful of wolves all you have to do i said is keep your mouth shut and watch my back the bad guys have to play by the rules tonight weve been given the protection of the old laws of hospitality if bianca doesnt respect that its going to kill her reputation in front of her guests and the vampire court i will protect you harry michael said as i will protect anyone who these things threaten we dont need any fights michael thats not why were here he looked out the truck window and set his jaw i mean it michael its their turf theres probably going to be bad stuff inside but we have to keep the big picture in focus here the big picture he said harry if theres someone in there that needs my help theyre getting it michael if we break the truce first were open game you could get us both killed he turned to look at me and his eyes were granite i am what i am harry i threw my arms up in the air and banged my hands on the roof of the truck there are people who could get killed if we mess this up it isnt only our own lives were talking about here i know he said my family are some of them but that doesnt change anything michael i said im not asking you to smile and chat and get cozy just keep quiet and stay out of the way dont shove a crucifix down anyones throat thats all im asking i wont stand by harry he said i cant he frowned and said i dont think you can either i glared at him hells bells michael i dont want to die here nor do i we must have faith great i said thats just great harry will you join me in prayer i blinked at him what a prayer michael said id like to talk to him for a moment he half smiled at me you dont have to say anything just be quiet and stay out of the way he bowed his head i squinted out the window of the truck silent i dont have anything against god far from it but i dont understand him and i dont trust a lot of the people that go around claiming that theyre working in his best interests faeries and vampires and whatnotthose i can fathom even demons sometimes even the fallen i can understand why they do what they do but i dont understand god i dont understand how he could see the way people treat one another and not chalk up the whole human race as a bad idea i guess hes just bigger about it than i would be lord michael said we walk into darkness now our enemies will surround us please help to make us strong enough to do what needs to be done amen just that no fancy language no flashy beseeching the almighty for aid just quiet words about what he wanted to get done and a request that god would be on his sideon our side simple words and yet power surrounded him like a cloud of fine mist prickling along my arms and my neck faith i calmed down a little we had a lot going for us we could do this michael looked up at me and nodded all right he said im ready how do i look i asked him he smiled white teeth showing youre going to turn heads thats for sure i had to smile back at him okay i said lets party we got out of the truck and started walking toward the gates around biancas estate michael buckled on the white cloak with its red cross as he went he had a matching surcoat boots and armored guards on his shoulders he had a pair of heavy gauntlets tucked through his boots and wore a pair of knives on his belt one on either side he smelled like steel and he clanked a little bit when he walked it sounded comforting in a friendly dreadnought kind of way it would have been more stylish to drive up through the gates and have a valet park the truck but michael didnt want to hand over his truck to vampires i didnt blame him i wouldnt trust a bloodsucking night stalking fiend of the shadows valet either the gate had an honesttogoodness guard house with a pair of guards neither one of them looked like they were carrying guns but they held themselves with an armed arrogance that neither myself nor michael missed i held up the invitation they let us in we walked up the drive to the house a black limo pulled up along the drive as we did and we had to step off to the side to let it past when we got to the front of the house the occupants were just getting out of the car the driver came around to the rear door of the limo and opened it music washed out something loud and hard there was a moments pause and then a man glided out of the limo he was tall pale as a statue sable hair fell in tousled curls to his shoulders he was dressed in a pair of opalescent butterfly wings that rose from his shoulders fastened to him by some mysterious mechanism he wore white leather gloves their gauntlet cuffs decorated in winding silver designs and similar designs were set around his calves down to his sandals at his side hung a sword delicately made the handle wrought as though out of glass the only other thing he had on was a loincloth of some soft white cloth he had the body for it muscle but not too much of it good set of shoulders and the pale skin wasnt darkened anywhere by hair hells bells i noticed how good he looked the man smiled bright enough for a toothpaste commercial and then reached a hand back down to the car a pair of gorgeous legs in pink high heels slid out of the car followed by a slender and scrumptious girl barely covered in flower petals she had a short tight skirt made out of them and more petals cupped her breasts like delicate hands other than that and the babys breath woven into the tumbled mass of her black hair she wore nothing and she wore it well in the heels she might have been fiveseven and she had a face that made me think that she was both lovely and sweet her cheeks were flushed in a delicate pink blush vibrant and alive her lips parted and she had a look to her eyes that told me she was on something harry michael said youre drooling im not drooling i said that girl cant be nineteen years old im not drooling i scowled gripped my cane in hand and stalked on up the driveway to the house and wiped at my mouth with my sleeve just in case the man turned toward me and both his eyebrows lifted he looked me and my costume up and down and burst out into a rich rolling laugh oh my he said you must be harry dresden that got my hackles up it always bugs me when someone knows me and i dont know them yeah i said thats me who the hell are you if the hostility bothered him it didnt bother his smile the girl with him slipped beneath his left arm and nestled against him watching me with stoned eyes oh of course he said i forget that you probably know very little of the intricacies of the court my name is thomas of house raith of the white court white court i said three vampire courts michael supplied black red and white i knew that michael shrugged one shoulder sorry thomas smiled well only two for all practical purposes the black court has fallen on hard times of late the poor darlings his tone of voice suggested muted glee rather than pity mister dresden allow me to introduce justine justine the girl beneath his arm gave me a sweet smile i halfexpected her to extend her hand to me to be kissed but she didnt she just molded her body to thomass in what looked like a most pleasant fashion charmed i said this is michael michael thomas mused and studied the man up and down dressed as a knight templar something like that michael said how ironic thomas said his eyes returned to me and that smile widened and you mister dresden your costume is going to make quite a stir why thank you shall we go inside oh lets we all trouped up the front stairs affording me an uncomfortably proximate view of justines legs along the way lean and lovely and made for doing things that had nothing to do with locomotion a pair of tuxedoclad doormen who looked human swung open the mansions doors for us the entry hall to biancas mansion had been redecorated since the last time id been there the oldstyle decor had been lavishly restored shed had marble laid out instead of gleaming hardwood all the doorways stood in graceful arches rather than stolid rectangles alcoves every ten feet or so sported small statuary and other pieces of art it was lit only by the spots on each alcove creating deep pools of shadow in between rather tacky thomas sniffed his butterfly wings quivering have you been to any court functions before mister dresden are you aware of the etiquette not really i said but it had better not involve anyone drinking anyones bodily fluids particularly mine thomas laughed richly no no well he admitted not formally in any case though there will be ample opportunity to indulge if you wish his fingers caressed the girls waist again and she focused her eyes on me in a disconcertingly intent fashion i dont think so what do i need to know well were all outsiders not being members of the red court and this is a red function first well be presented to the company and theyll have the chance to come meet us mingle eh just so afterwards well be presented to bianca herself and she in turn will give us a gift a gift i asked shes the hosting party of course shell be giving gifts he smiled at me its only civilized i eyed him i wasnt used to vampires being so chatty why are you being so helpful he laid his fingers upon his chest lifting his eyebrows in a perfectly executed who me expression why mister dresden why should i not help you youre a vampire so i am he said but im afraid im not a terribly good one he gave me a sunny smile and said of course i could also be lying i snorted so mister dresden rumor had it you had refused biancas invitation i had what changed your mind business business thomas asked youre here on business i shrugged something like that i stripped off my gloves trying to look casual and offered him my hand thanks again his head tilted to one side and he narrowed his eyes he looked down at my hand and then back up at me his gaze calculating before trading grips with me there was a faint flickering aura about him i felt it dance and glide over my skin like a soft cool wind it felt odd different than the energy that surrounded a human practitionerand nothing like the sense of whatever had been pumping up the nightmare thomas wasnt my man i must have relaxed visibly because he smiled and said i pass the test eh i dont know what youre talking about whatever you say youre an odd duck harry dresden but i like you and with that he and his escort turned and glided together down the length of the entry hall and through the curtained doors at the far end i glowered after them anything michael asked hes clean i said relatively speaking must be someone else here youll get the chance to do some handshaking it sounds like michael said yeah you ready lord willing michael said we started together down the hall and through the curtained doorway and emerged into vampire party central we stood on a concrete deck elevated ten feet off the rest of a vast outdoor courtyard music flowed up from below people crowded the courtyard in a blur of color and motion talk and costume like some kind of impressionist painting glowing globes rested on wire stands here and there giving the place a sort of torchlit mystique a dias opposite the entryway we stood in rose up several feet higher in the air a suspiciously thronelike chair upon it i had just started to take in details when a brilliant white light flooded my eyes and i had to lift a hand against it the music died down a bit and the chatter of people quieted some evidently michael and i had just become the center of attention a servant stepped forward and asked calmly may i have your invitation sir i passed it over and a moment later heard the same voice over a modest public address system ladies and gentlemen of the court i am pleased to present harry dresden wizard of the white council and guest i lowered my hands and the voices fell completely silent from either side of the throne opposite a pair of spotlights glared at me i shrugged my shoulders to get my cape to fall into place correctly tattered red lining flashing against the black cotton exterior the collar of the thing came up high on either side of my face the spot glared off of the painted gold plastic medallion i wore at my throat the worn powderblue tux beneath it could have made an appearance at someones prom in the seventies the servants at the party had better tuxes than i did i made sure to smile so that they could see the cheap plastic fangs i suppose the spotlight must have bleached my face out to ghostly whiteness especially with the white clown makeup i had on the fake blood drooling out the corners of my mouth would be standing out bright red against it i lifted a whitegloved hand and said slurring a little through the fangs hi how are you all doing my words rang out on deathly silence from below i still cant believe michael said sotto voce that you came to the vampires masquerade ball dressed as a vampire not just a vampire i said a cheesy vampire do you think they got the point i managed to peer past the spotlights enough to make out thomas and justine at the foot of the stairs thomas was staring around at the courtyard with undisguised glee then flashed me a smile and a thumbsup i think michael said that youve just insulted everyone here im here to find a monster not make nice with them besides i never wanted to come to this stupid party in the first place all the same i think youve peeved them off peeved come on how bad could that be peeved from the courtyard below came several distinctive sounds a few hisses the rasp of steel as several someones drew knives or maybe swords the nervous clickclack of someone with a semiautomatic working the slide michael shrugged in his cloak and i sensed more than saw him put his hand on the hilt of one of his knives i think were about to find out chapter twentyfive silence lay heavy over the courtyard i gripped my cane and waited for the first gunshot or whistle of a thrown knife or bloodcurdling scream of fury michael was a steelsmelling presence beside me silent and confident in the face of the hostility hells bells id meant to give the vamps a little thumb of the nose with the costume but wow i didnt think id get this much of a reaction steady harry michael murmured theyre like mean dogs dont flinch or run it will only set them off your average mean dog doesnt have a gun i murmured back or a knife or a sword but i remained where i stood my expression bland the first sound to ring out was neither gunshot nor battle cry but rich silvery laughter it drifted up masculine somehow merry and mocking bubbling and scornful all at once i squinted down through the lights to see thomas posed like some bizarre postchrysalis incarnation of errol flynn one foot up on the stairs hand braced his other hand on the crystalline hilt of his sword his head was thrown back every lean line of muscle on him displayed with the casual disregard of skilled effort the butterfly wings caught the light at the edges of the spots and threw them back in dazzling colors ive always heard thomas drawled his voice loud enough to be heard by all artfully projected that the red court gave its guests a warm welcome i hadnt thought id get such a picturesque demonstration though he turned toward the dias and bowed lady bianca ill be sure to tell my father all about this dizzying display of hospitality i felt my smile harden and i peered past the spotlights to the dias bianca dear there you are this was a costume party was it not a masquerade and we were all supposed to come dressed as something we werent if i misread the invitation i apologize i heard a womans voice murmur something and the spotlights flicked off i was left in the dark for a minute until my eyes could adjust and i could regard the woman standing across from me upon the dias bianca wasnt tall but she was statuesque in a way you only find in erotic magazines and embarrassing dreams pale of skin dark of hair and eye full of sensuous curves from her mouth to her hips everything possessed of luscious ripeness coupled with slender strength that would have caught the eye of any man she wore a gown of flickering flame i dont mean that she wore a red dressshe wore flame gathered about her in the shape of an evening gown blue at its base fading through the colors of a candle to red as it cupped her full gorgeous breasts more flame danced and played through the elegant piles of her dark hair flickering over her like a tiara she had on a pair of real heels at least adding several inches to her rather unimpressive height the shoes did interesting things to the shape of her legs the curve of her smile promised things that were probably illegal and bad for you and would carry warnings from the surgeon general but that youd still want to do over and over again i wasnt interested i had seen what was underneath her mask once before i couldnt forget what was there well she purred her voice carrying over the whole of the courtyard i suppose i shouldnt have expected any more taste from you mister dresden though perhaps we will see about your taste later in the evening her tongue played over her teeth and she gave me a dazzling smile i watched her watched behind her a pair of figures in black cloaks hardly more than vague shapes behind her stood quietly as though ready to attack if she snapped a finger i suppose every decent flame casts shadows i think youd better not try it bianca laughed again several in the courtyard joined in with her though it was a nervous thing mister dresden she said many things can change a mans mind she crossed her legs slowly flashing naked skin up to her taut silky thigh as she did perhaps well find something that changes yours she waved her hand lazy and arrogant music we are here to celebrate let us do so the music began again while i sorted out the meaning behind what bianca had just said she had given her tacit permission for her people to try to get to me they couldnt just walk up and bite me maybe but yeesh id have to be on my guard i thought of kelly hamiltons narcotic kisses on my throat the glowing warmth that had surrounded me infused me and shivered some part of me wondered what it might be like to let the vamps catch me and if it would be all that bad another chewed furiously over everything id seen so far that eveningbianca clearly had something in mind i shook my head and glanced back at michael he nodded to me a slight motion beneath the great helm and we both descended the stairs my legs were shaking making the trip down unsteady i prayed that none of the vamps noticed it wouldnt do to let them see weakness even if i was as nervous as a bird in a coal mine do what you need to do harry michael said low ill be a couple steps behind you to your right ill watch your back michaels words steadied me calmed me and i felt profoundly grateful for them i expected the vamps to descend on me in a charming and dangerous cloud when i reached the courtyard but they didnt instead thomas was waiting for me with one hand on the hilt of his sword his pale body on shameless display justine stood a bit behind him his face practically glowed with glee oh my that was marvelous harry may i call you harry no i said i caught myself though and tried to soften the answer but thanks for what you said when you did things might have gotten ugly thomass eyes danced they still might mister dresden but we couldnt have it descending into a general brawl now could we we couldnt no of course not there would be far fewer opportunities to seduce and deceive and backstab i snorted i suppose youve got a point the tip of his tongue touched his teeth when he smiled i usually do um thanks thomas he glanced aside and frowned i followed his gaze justine had drifted away from him and now stood with a bright smile on her sweet face as she spoke to a lean smiling man dressed in a scarlet tux and a domino mask while i watched the man reached out and stroked his fingers over her shoulder he made some comment that made the lovely girl laugh excuse me thomas said with distaste i cant abide poachers do enjoy the party mister dresden he drifted off toward them and michael stepped up to me i halfturned my head toward him to hear him murmur theyre surrounding us i looked around the courtyard was full of people many of them were young pretty folk dressed in all manner of black poster children for the goth subculture leather plastic and fishnet seemed to be the major themes in display complete with black domino masks heavy hoods upon cloaks and a variety of different kinds of face paint they talked and laughed drank and danced to the music some of them wore a band of scarlet cloth about their arm or a bloodred choker around their throats while i watched i saw a toolean young man bend over a table to inhale something through one nostril a trio of giggling girls two blondes and a brunette all dressed up like draculas cheerleading squad complete with blackandred pompoms counted to three together and washed down a pair of pills with glasses of dark wine other young people pressed together in sensual motion or simply sat or stood kissing touching a few already partied out lay upon the courtyard smiling dreamily their eyes closed i scanned the crowd with my eyes and picked out the differences at once drifting among the young people clad in black were lean figures in scarletperhaps two or three dozen in all male and female of a variety of appearances and costumes all shared the scarlet clothes beauty and a confident stalking kind of motion that marked them as predators the red court i said i licked my lips and looked around some more the vampires were being casual about it but they had wandered into a ring around us if we remained there any longer we wouldnt be able to walk out of the courtyard without coming within a few feet of one of them the kids with the red bands are what junior vampires marked cattle id say michael rumbled there was anger in it steady and slow anger easy michael we need to move around a little make it harder for them to hem us in agreed michael nodded toward the drink table and we headed that way our pace brisk the vamps tried to adjust to follow us but they couldnt make it look casual a couple in red moved to intercept us meeting michael and me just before we reached the table kyle hamilton wore a harlequins outfit all in shades of scarlet kelly followed along with him dressed in a scarlet body stocking that left nothing to the imagination but with a long cloak covering her shoulders and collarbones the hood up high around her face a scarlet mask hid her features except for her chin and luscious mouth i thought i could see a puckering of the skin at one side of her mouthperhaps the burns shed suffered harry dresden kyle greeted me in a tooloud voice with a toowide smile how pleasant to see you again i chucked him boisterously on the shoulder making his balance waver i wish it was mutual the smile became brittle and of course you remember my sister kelly sure sure i said hit that tanning bed a little too long did we i expected her to snarl or hiss or go for my throat but instead she turned to the table collected a silver goblet and a crystal wineglass from the attendant there and offered them to us with a smile that mirrored her brothers its so pleasant to see you harry im sorry that we didnt get to see the lovely miss rodriguez tonight i accepted the goblet she had to wash her hair kelly turned to michael and offered him the glass he accepted it with an inclination of his head stiffly polite i see she purred i had no idea you were into men mister dresden what can i say theyre just so big and strong of course kyle said if i was surrounded by people who wanted to kill me as badly as i want to kill you id want a bodyguard about too kelly sidled up to michael her breasts thrust forward straining the sheer fabric of the body stocking she walked in a slow circle around him while michael remained standing just as he was hes gorgeous she purred may i give him a kiss mister dresden harry michael said hes married kelly sorry she laughed pressing close to michael and tried to catch his eyes michael frowned and stared at nothing avoiding her no she asked well dont worry pretty man youll love it everyone wants to party like its their last night on earth she flashed a wicked smile up at him now you get to the young lady is too kind michael said so stiff i admire that in a man she shot me a glance from behind her mask you really shouldnt drag poor defenseless mortals into these things mister dresden she looked michael up and down again admiring this one will be delicious later dont bite off more than you can chew i advised her she laughed as though delighted well mister dresden i see his crosses but we all know the value of them to most of the world she reached her hand toward michaels arm possessively for a moment you almost had me thinking that he might be a true knight templar no i said judiciously not a knight templar kellys hand touched michaels steelclad armand erupted into sudden white flame as brief and violent as a stroke of lightning she screamed a piercing wail and fell back from him to the ground she lay there curled helplessly around her blackened hand struggling to get enough breath back to scream kyle flew to her side i looked at michael and blinked wow i said color me impressed michael looked vaguely embarrassed it happens like that sometimes he said apologetically i nodded and took that in stride i turned my gaze back to the vampire twins let that be a lesson to you hands off the fist of god kyle shot me a murderous look his face rippling my heart sped up but i couldnt let the fear show go ahead kyle i dared him start something break the truce your own leader set up violate the laws of hospitality the white council will burn this place down so fast people will call it little pompeii he snarled at me and picked kelly up this isnt over he promised one way or another dresden ill kill you uhhuh i flicked my wrist at him my hand right in his face shoo shoo i have to mingle kyle snarled but the pair withdrew and i turned my gaze slowly around the courtyard everything in the immediate vicinity had stopped while people black and redclad alike stared at us some of the vampires in scarlet looked at michael swallowed and took a couple of steps back i grinned as cocky and as confident as i could appear and lifted my glass a toast i said to hospitality they were quiet for a moment then hurriedly mumbled an echo to my toast and sipped from their drinks i drained my goblet in a single gulp hardly noticing the delightful flavor of it and turned to michael he lifted his glass to the mouth of his helm in a token sip but didnt take any all right i said i got to touch kyle hes out too though i didnt expect him to be our man or woman or monster michael looked slowly around as the scarletclad vampires continued to withdraw it looks like weve cowed them for now i nodded still uneasy the crowd parted at one side and thomas and justine came to us blazes of pale skin and brilliant color amidst the scarlet and black there you are thomas said he glanced down at my goblet and let out a sigh im glad i found you in time in time for what i asked to warn you he said he flicked a hand at the refreshments table the wine is poisoned chapter twentysix poisoned i said witlessly thomas peered at my face and then down at my goblet he leaned over it enough to see that it was empty and said ah oops harry michael stepped up beside me and set his own glass aside i thought you said that they couldnt try anything so overt my stomach kept churning my heart beat more quickly though whether this was from the poison or the simple cold fear that thomass words had brought to me i couldnt say they cant i said if i pitch over dead the council would know what happened i sent word in today that i was coming here tonight michael shot thomas a hard look what was in the wine the pale man shrugged slipping his arm around justine once more the girl leaned against him and closed her eyes i dont know what they put in it he said but look at these people he nodded to those blackclad folk who were already stretched out blissfully upon the ground they all have wineglasses i looked a bit closer and it was true the servants moved about the courtyard plucking up glasses from the fallen as i watched another young couple dancing slowly together sank down to the ground in a long deep kiss that faded away into simple stillness hells bells i swore thats what theyre doing what michael asked they dont want me dead i said not from this i didnt have much time i stalked past the refreshments table to a potted fern and bent over it i heard michael take up a position behind me guarding my back i shoved a finger down my throat simple quick nasty the wine burned my throat coming back up and the ferns fronds tickled the back of my neck as i spat it back out into the base of the plant my head spun as i sat back up again and when i looked back toward michael everything blurred for a moment before it snapped back into focus a slow delicious numbness spread over my fingers everyone i mumbled what michael knelt down in front of me and gripped my shoulder with one arm harry are you all right im fuzzy i said vampire venom naturally it felt good to have it in me again and i wondered for a moment what i was so worried about it was just that nice its for everyone theyre drugging everyones wine vamp venom that way they can say they werent just targeting me i wobbled and then stood up recreational poisoning put everyone in the party mood thomas mused rather hamhanded i suppose but effective he looked around at the growing numbers of young people joining the first few upon the ground in ecstatic stupor his fingers stroked justines flank absently and she shivered pressing closer to him i suppose im prejudiced i prefer my prey a little more lively weve got to get you out of here michael said i gritted my teeth and tried to push the pleasant sensations aside the venom had to have an enormously quick absorption rate even if id brought the wine back up i must have gotten a fairly good dose no i managed after a moment thats what they want me to do harry you can barely stand up michael objected you are looking a bit peaked thomas said bah if they want me incapacitated it means theyve got something to hide or just that they want you to get killed michael said or drugged enough to agree to let one of them feed on you no i disagreed if they wanted to seduce me theyd have tried something else theyre trying to scare me off or keep me from finding something out i hate to point out the obvious thomas said but why on earth would bianca invite you if she didnt want you to be here shes obligated to invite the council to witness that means me in this town and she didnt expect me to actually showpretty much everyone was surprised to see me at all they didnt think youd come michael murmured yeah aint i a stinker i took a couple of deep breaths and said i think the one were after is here michael weve got to stick this out for a little while see if i can find out exactly who it is exactly who is what thomas asked none of your beeswax thomas i said has anyone ever told you mister dresden that you are a thoroughly annoying man that made me grin to which he rolled his eyes well he said ill not intrude on your business any further let me know if theres anything i can do for you he and justine sauntered off into the crowd i watched justines legs go leaning on my cane a bit to help me balance nice guy i commented for a vampire michael said dont trust him harry theres something about him i dont like oh i like him i said but i sure as hell dont trust him what do we do now look around so far weve got food in black the vampires in red and then theres you and me and a handful of other people in different costumes the roman centurion michael said yeah and some hamletlooking guy lets go see what they are harry michael asked are you going to be okay i swallowed i felt dizzy a little sickened i had to fight to get clear thoughts through bulldogging them against the pull of the venom i was surrounded by things that looked at people like we look at cows and felt fairly sure that i was going to get myself killed if i stayed of course if i didnt stay other people could get killed if i didnt stay the people who had already been hurt remained in danger charity michaels infant son murphy if i didnt stay the nightmare would have time to recuperate and then it and its corporate sponsor who i thought was here at this party would feel free to keep taking pot shots at me the thought of remaining in that place scared me the thought of what could happen if i gave up now scared me a lot more come on i said lets get this over with michael nodded looking around his grey eyes dark hard this is an abomination before the lord harry these people theyre barely more than children what theyre doing consorting with these things michael chill out were here to get information not bring the house down on a bunch of nasties samson did michael said yeah and look how well things turned out for him you ready he muttered something and fell in behind me again i looked around and oriented on the man dressed as a roman centurion then headed toward him a man of indefinite years he stood alone and slightly detached from the rest of the crowd his eyes were an odd color of green deep and intense he held a cigarette between his lips his gear right down to the roman short sword and sandals looked awfully authentic i slowed a little as i approached him staring michael i murmured over my shoulder look at his costume it looks like the real thing it is the real thing said the man in a bored tone of voice not looking at me he exhaled a plume of smoke then put the cigarette back between his lips michael would have barely been able to hear my question this guy had picked it right out gulp interesting i said must have cost you a fortune to put together he glanced at me smoke curled from the corners of his mouth as he gave me a very slight very smug smirk and said nothing so i said and cleared my throat im harry dresden the man pursed his lips and said thoughtfully and precisely harry dresden when someone anyone says your name it touches you you almost feel it that sound that stands out from a crowd of others and demands your attention when a wizard says your name when he says it and means it it has the same effect amplified a thousandfold the man in the centurion gear said my part of my name and said it exactly right it felt like someone had just rung a tuning fork and pressed it against my teeth i staggered and michael caught my shoulder keeping me upright dear god he had just used one part of my full name my true name to reach out to me and casually backhand me off my feet hells bells i whispered michael propped me back up i planted my cane so that i would have an extra support and just stared at the man how the hell did you do that he rolled his eyes took the cigarette in his fingers and blew more smoke you wouldnt understand youre not white council i said he looked at me as though i had just stated that objects fall toward the ground a withering scathing glance how very fortunate for me harry michael said his voice tense just a minute harry look at his cigarette i blinked at michael what look at his cigarette michael repeated he was staring at the man with wide intent eyes and one hand had fallen to the hilt of a knife i looked it took me a minute to realize what michael was talking about the man blew more smoke out of the corner of his mouth and smirked at me the cigarette wasnt lit hes i said hes uh hes a dragon michael said a what the mans eyes flickered with interest for the first time and he narrowed his focusnot upon me but upon michael just so he said you may call me mister ferro why dont i just call you ferrovax michael said mister ferro narrowed his eyes and regarded michael with a dispassionate gaze you know something of the lore at least mortal wait a minute i said dragons dragons are supposed to be big scales claws wings this guy isnt big ferro rolled his eyes and said impatient we are what we wish to be master drafton dresden i snapped he waved a hand dont tempt me to show you what i can do by speaking your name and making an effort mortal suffice to say that you could not comprehend the kind of power i have at my command that my true form here would shatter this pathetic gathering of monkey houses and crack the earth upon which i stand if you gazed upon me with your wizards sight you would see something that would awe you humble you and quite probably destroy your reason i am the eldest of my kind and the strongest your life is a flickering candle to me and your civilizations rise and fall like grass in the summer well i said i dont know about your true form but the weight of your ego sure is pushing the crust of the earth toward the breaking point his green eyes blazed what did you say i dont like bullies i said you think im going to stand here and offer you my firstborn and sacrifice virgins to you or something im not that impressed well ferro said lets see if we cant make an impression i clutched my cane and gathered up my will but i was way way too slow ferro just waved a hand vaguely in my direction and something crushed me down to the earth as though i suddenly had gained about five thousand pounds i felt my lungs strain to haul in a breath and my vision clouded over with stars and went black i tried to gather up my magic to thrust the force away from me but i couldnt focus couldnt speak michael looked down at me dispassionately then said to ferro siriothrax should have learned that trick it might have kept me from killing him ferros cold regard swept back to michael bringing with it a tiny lessening in the pressurenot much but enough that i could gasp out riflettum and focus my will against it ferros spell cracked and began to flake apart i saw him look at me sensed that he could have renewed the effort without difficulty he didnt i climbed back to my feet gasping quietly so ferro said you are the one he looked michael up and down i thought youd be taller michael shrugged it wasnt anything personal im not proud of what i did ferro tapped a finger against the hilt of his sword then said quietly sir knight i would advise you to be more humble in the face of your betters he cast a disdainful glance at me and you might consider a gag for this one until he can learn better manners i tried for a comeback but i still couldnt breathe i just leaned against my cane and wheezed ferro and michael exchanged a short nod one where neither of them looked away from the others eyes then ferro turned and well just vanished no flicker of light no puff of flame just gone harry michael chided youre not the biggest kid on the block youve got to learn to be a little more polite good advice i wheezed next time you handle any dragons i will he looked around and said people are thinning out harry he was right as i watched a vampire in a tight red dress tapped the arm of a young man in black he glanced over to her and met her eyes they stared at one another for a while the woman smiling the mans expression going slowly slack then she murmured something and took his hand leading him out into the darkness beyond the globes of light other vamps were drawing more young people along with them there were fewer scarlet costumes around and more people blissed out on the ground i dont like the direction this is going i said nor do i his voice was hard as stone lord willing we can put a stop to this later first we talk to the hamlet guy then theres just bianca herself to check not one of the other vampires michael asked no way theyre all subordinate to bianca if they were that strong theyd have knocked her off by now unless they were in her inner circle thats kyle and kelly she doesnt have the presence of mind for it and hes already out so if its not a guest its probably bianca and if its not her lets not go there im floundering enough as it is i squinted around do you see hamlet anywhere michael squinted around taking a few paces to peer around another set of ferns i saw the flash of red out of the corner of my eye saw a form in a red cloak heading for michaels back from around the ferns i turned toward michael and threw myself at his attacker look out i shouted michael spun a knife appearing in his hand as though conjured i grabbed the red cloakedfigure and whirled it around to face me the hood fell back from susans face revealing her startled dark eyes shed pulled her hair into a ponytail she wore a lowcut white blouse and a little pleated skirt complete with white knee socks and buckledown shoes white gloves covered her hands a wicker basket dangled in the crook of her elbow and round mirrortoned spectacles perched upon the bridge of her slender nose susan i stammered what are you doing here she let out a breath and drew her arm out of my hand god harry you scared me what are you doing here i demanded you know why im here she said i came to get a story i tried to call you and talk you into it but no you were way too busy doing whatever you were doing to even spare five minutes to talk to me i dont believe this i muttered how did you get in here she looked at me coolly and flicked open her basket she reached inside and came out with a neat white invitation like my own i got myself an invitation you what well i had it made in any case i didnt think youd mind me borrowing yours for a few minutes which explained why the invitation hadnt been on the mantel back at my apartment hells bells susan you dont know what youve done youve got to get out of here she snorted like hell i mean it i said youre in danger relax harry im not letting anyone lick me and im not looking anyone in the eyes its kind of like visiting new york she tapped her specs with a gloved finger things have gone all right so far you dont get it i said you dont understand dont understand what she demanded you dont understand purred a dulcet voice behind me my blood ran cold by coming uninvited you have waived any right you had to the protection of the laws of hospitality there came a soft chuckle it means little red riding hood that the big bad wolf gets to eat you all up chapter twentyseven i turned to find lea facing me her hands on her hips she wore a slender strapless dress of pale blue which flowed over her curves like water crashing into white foamy lace at its hem she wore a cape of some material so light and sheer that it seemed almost unreal and it drifted around her catching the light in an opalescent sheen that trapped little rainbows and set them to dancing against her pale skin when people talk about models or movie stars being glamorous they take it from the old word from glamour from the beauty of the high sidhe faerie magic supermodels wish they had it so good as lea why godmother i said what big eyes you have are we straining the metaphor or what she drifted closer to me i dont make metaphors harry im too busy being one are you enjoying the party i snorted oh sure watching them drug and poison children and getting roughed up by every weird and nasty thing in chicagoland is a real treat i turned to susan and said we have to get you out of here susan frowned at me and said i didnt come here so that you could hustle me home harry this isnt a game susan these things are dangerous i glanced over at lea she kept drawing closer i dont know if i can protect you then ill protect myself susan said she laid her hand over the picnic basket i came prepared michael i said would you get her out of here michael stepped up beside us and said to susan its dangerous maybe you should let me take you home susan narrowed her dark eyes at me if its so dangerous then i dont want to leave harry here alone she has a point harry dammit we came here to find out whos behind the nightmare if i leave before i do that we might as well never have come just go and ill catch up with you yes lea said do go ill be sure to take good care of my godson no susan said her tone flat absolutely not im not some kind of child for you to tote around and make decisions for harry leas smile sharpened and she reached a hand toward susan touching her chin let me see those pretty eyes little one she purred i shot my hand toward my godmothers wrist jerking it away from susan before the faerie could touch her her skin was silksmooth cool lea smiled at me the expression stunning literally my head swam images of the faerie sorceress flooding my thoughts those berrysweet lips pressing to my naked chest smeared with my blood rosetipped breasts bared by the light of fire and full moon her hair a sheet of silken flame on my skin another flash of image came then accompanied by intense emotion myself looking up at her as i lay at her feet she stretched out her hand and lightly touched my head an absently fond gesture an overwhelming sense of wellbeing filled me like shining liquid light poured into me and filled every empty place within me calmed every fear soothed every pain i almost wept at the simple relief at the abrupt release from worry from hurt my whole body trembled i was just so damned tired so tired of hurting of being afraid so it will be when you are with me poor little one poor lonely child leas voice coursed over me as sweet as the drug already within me i knew she spoke the truth i knew it on a level so deep and simple that a part of me screamed at myself for struggling to avoid her so easy it would be so easy to lay down at my ladys feet now so easy to let her make all the bad things go away she would care for me she would comfort me my place would be there in the warmth at her feet staring up at her beauty like a good dog its tough to say no to peace to the comfort of it all through history people have traded wealth children land and lives to buy it but peace cant be bought can it chief prime minister the only ones offering to sell it always want something more they lie i shoved the feelings away from me the subtle glamour my godmother had cast i could have taken a cheese grater to my own skin with less pain but my pain my weariness my worries and fearthey were at least my own they were honest i gathered them back to me like a pack of mudspattered children and stared at lea hardening my jaw my heart no i said no lea surprise touched those delicate features dainty copper brows lifted harry she said her voice gentle perplexed the bargain is already made so mote it be there is no reason for you to go on hurting there are people who need me i said my balance wavered i still have a job to do broken faiths weaken you they bind you tighter lessen you every time you go against your given oath she sounded concerned genuinely compassionate godson i beg of youdo not do this to yourself i said struggling to be calm because if i do that there will be less for you to eat yes less power for you to take it would be a terrible waste she assured me no one wants that were under truce here godmother youre not allowed to work magic on me without violating hospitality but i didnt lea said ive not worked any magic on you this night bullshit she laughed silver and merry such language and in front of your lover too i stumbled michael was there at once supporting my weight with his shoulder drawing my arm across it harry he said what is it whats wrong my head kept on spinning and my limbs started to shake the drug already coursing through me plus this new weakness almost took me out blackness swam in front of my eyes and it was only with an effort of will that i kept myself from drowning in that darkness or giving in to the mad desire to throw myself down at leas feet im okay i stammered im fine susan moved to my other side her anger pouring off of her like heat from a desert highway what have you done to him she snapped at lea nothing lea replied in a cool voice he has done this to himself the poor little one one always risks dire consequences should one not keep a bargain with the sidhe what susan said michael grimaced and said aye shes telling the truth harry made a bargain last night when we fought the nightmare and drove it away from charity i struggled to speak to warn them not to let lea trick them but i was too busy trying to sort out where my mouth was and why my tongue wasnt working that doesnt give her the right to put a spell on him susan snapped michael rumbled i dont think she has i can usually feel it when someones done something harmful of course i havent lea said i have no need to do so hes already done it himself what i thought what was she talking about what susan said what are you talking about leas voice took on a patient fauxsympathetic tone poor little poppet all of your efforts to learn and you still know so little harry made a bargain with me long agoand broke it once then and once a few nights past he swore to uphold it again last night and broke it thrice now he reaps the consequences of his actions his own powers turn against him the poor dear to encourage him to fulfill his word to keep his promise they werent doing it a minute ago susan said only when you came up to him lea laughed warmly its a party dear poppet were here to mingle after all and i have lifted no weapon or spell against him this is of his own doing so back off susan said leave him alone oh this wont ever leave him alone poppet its a small thing now but it will grow in time and destroy him the poor dear boy id hate so much for that to happen so stop it lea focused her eyes on susan do you offer to purchase his debt away from me i dont think you could afford it dear poppet though i think surcease could be arranged susan shot a quick glance at me and then michael surcease purchase michael watched lea grimly shes a faerie leas voice crackled with irritation a sidhe michael looked at my godmother and continued a faerie miss rodriguez and theyre prone to making bargains and to getting the better of mortals when they do susans mouth hardened she was silent for a moment and then said how much witch how much for you to make this stop hurting harry i struggled to say something but my mouth didnt work things spun faster instead of slowing down i sagged more and michael labored to keep me on my feet why poppet lea purred what do you offer i dont have much money susan began money what is money lea shook her head no child such things mean nothing to me but let me see she walked in a slow circle around susan frowning at her looking her up and down such pretty eyes even though they are dark they will do my eyes susan stammered no lea asked very well your name perhaps your whole name dont michael said at once i know susan answered him she looked at lea and said i know better than that if you had my name you could do anything you wanted lea thrust out her lip her eyes and her name are too precious to allow her beloved to escape his trap very well then let us ask of her a different price her eyes gleamed and she leaned toward susan your love she murmured give me that susan arched her brows and peered over her spectacles honey you want me to love you youve got a lot of surprises coming if you think it works like that i didnt ask you to love me lea said her tone offended i asked for your love but well enough if that is also too steep a price perhaps memory will do instead my memory not all of it lea said she tilted her head to one side and purred indeed only some perhaps the worth of one year yes i think that would suffice susan looked uncertain i dont know then let him suffer he wont live the night with those arrayed against him such a loss lea turned to leave wait susan said and clutched at leas arm i ill make the trade for harrys sake one year of my memory and you make whatever is happening stop memory for relief done lea purred she leaned forward and placed a gentle kiss upon susans forehead then shivered drawing in her breath in a swift inhalation the tips of her breasts hardening against the silky fabric of her dress oh oh sweet poppet what a dear thing you are then she turned and slapped me across the face with a sharp sound of impact and i tumbled down to the ground despite michaels best efforts my head abruptly cleared the narcotic throb of the vampire venom lessened a bit and i found my thoughts running again slowly like a train gathering momentum witch michael hissed up at lea if you hurt either of them again for shame sir knight lea said her voice dreamy tis no fault of mine that harry made the agreement he did nor fault of mine that the girl loves him and would give anything for him nor was it my doing that the sword fell ownerless to the ground before me and that i picked it up she fixed michael with that dazzling smile should you wish to bargain to have it returned to you you have only to ask myself for the sword michael said done she let her head fall back and laughed oh oh my dear knight no for once the redeemers blade was in your hands again you would find the shattering of our pact a simple enough matter her eyes glittered again and you are in any case far too restricted for my tastes you are set in your ways unbendable michael stiffened i serve the lord as i may lea made a face faugh just so holy her smile turned sly again but there are others whose lives you hold and can bargain with you have children do you not she shivered again and said mortal children are so sweet and can be bent and shaped in so many many ways your eldest daughter i think would michael didnt snarl didnt roar didnt make any sounds at all he simply seized the front of leas dress and lifted her clear off the ground by it his voice came out in a vicious growl stay away from my family faerie or i will set such things in motion against you as will destroy you for all time lea laughed delighted vengeance is mine saith the lord is how the phrase runs is it not there was a liquid shimmering in the air and she abruptly stood upon the ground again facing michael out of his grasp your power weakens with rage dear man you will not bargainbut i suppose i had plans for the sword in any case until then good knight adieu she gave me one last smile and a mocking laugh then she vanished into the shadows and the darkness i gathered myself back to my feet and mumbled that could have gone better michaels eyes glittered with anger beneath his helmet are you all right harry im better i said stars and stones if this is some kind of selfinflicted spell ill have to talk to bob about this one later i rubbed at my eyes and asked what about you michael are you all right well enough michael said but we still dont have a culprit and its getting late ive got a bad feeling that were going to run into trouble if we dont get out of this place soon ive got a feeling youre right i said susan are you okay you ready to get out of here susan brushed her hair idly back from her face with one hand and turned to stare at me frowning slightly what i asked look you didnt have to do what you did but we can work on getting it taken care of lets just get out of here okay okay she said then her frown deepened and she peered at me this is going to sound odd butdo i know you chapter twentyeight i stared at susan in mute disbelief she looked apologetic oh im sorry i mean i didnt mean to upset you mister dresden i supplied in a whisper mister dresden then she frowned down at herself and smoothed a hand uncomfortably over the skirt then looked around her dresden arent you the guy who just opened a business as a wizard anger made me clench my teeth son of a harry michael said i think we need to leave rather than stand about cursing my knuckles whitened as i tightened my fingers on my cane no time for anger not now michael was right we had to move and quickly agreed i said susan did you drive here hey she said squaring off against me i dont know you okay my name is miss rodriguez look sumiss rodriguez my faerie godmother just stole a years worth of your memory actually michael put in you traded it away to her to keep some kind of spell from leaving harry helpless i shot him a glare and he subsided and now you dont remember me or i guess michael or this faerie godmother either susan said her face and stance still wary i shot lea a look she glanced over at me and her lips curved up into a smirk before she turned back to her conversation with thomas oh damn shes such a bitch susan rolled her eyes a little look guys its been nice chatting with you but this has got to be the lamest excuse for a pickup line ive ever heard i reached a hand toward her again her own flashed down into the picnic basket and produced a knife a giissue weapon from the last century its edge gleaming i told you she said calmly i dont know you dont touch me i drew my hand back look i just want to make sure youre all right susans breathing was a little fast but other than that she concealed her tension almost completely im perfectly fine she said dont worry about me at least get out of here youre not safe here you came in on an invitation you had made up do you remember that she screwed up her face into a frown how did you know that she asked you told me so about five minutes ago i said and sighed thats what im trying to tell you youve had a bunch of your memories taken i remember coming here susan said i remember having the counterfeit invitation made i know i said you got it off of my living room table do you remember that she frowned i got it her expression flickered and she swallowed glancing around i dont remember where i got it there i said do you see do you remember driving out to bail me out of jail a couple of nights ago shed lowered the knife by now i i remember that i went down to the jail and paid the bail money but i cant think okay okay i said my head hurt and i pinched the bridge of my nose between my thumb and forefinger it looks like she took all of your memories that had me directly in them or her what about michael do you remember him she looked at michael and shook her head i nodded okay then i need to ask you to trust me miss rodriguez youve been affected by magic and i dont know how we can get it fixed yet but youre in danger here and i think you should leave not with you she said at once i have no idea who you are other than some kind of psychic consultant for special investigations okay okay i said not with me but at least let us walk you out of here so that we can make sure you get out okay you cant swing a cat without hitting a vampire in here so let us get you out to your car and then you can go wherever you like i didnt get my interview she said but i feel so strange she shook her head and replaced her knife in her picnic basket i heard the click of a tape recorder being switched off okay she said i guess we can go i nodded relieved wonderful michael shall we he chewed on his lip maybe i should stay harry if your godmothers here the sword might be here too i might get the chance to take it back yeah and you might get the chance to get taken from behind without someone here to cover for you theres too much messed up stuff here man even for me lets go michael fell in behind me to my right susan walked beside him on my left keeping us both in careful view and one hand still inside her picnic basket i briefly wondered what kind of goodies shed been bringing in case the big bad wolf tried to head her off from grandmas house we reached the foot of the stairs that led back up into the house something prickled the hairs at the back of my neck and i stopped harry michael asked what is it theres someone i said and closed my eyes i brought up my sight just for a moment and felt the pressure just a little above the spot between my eyebrows i looked up again the sight cut through the enchantment in front of me like sunlight through a wispy cloud behind me michael and susan both took in sharp breaths of surprise the hamlet lookalike stood three stairs up half smiling i realized only then that the figure was a woman rather than a man the slender shape of her slim hips and breasts obscured by the sable doublet she wore giving her an odd androgynous appearance her skin was pallidnot pale not creamy pallid translucent almost greyish her lips were tinged very faintly blue as though shed been recently chilled or dead i shivered and lowered the sight before it showed me something that i didnt want to keep with me it didnt change her appearance one bit she wore a cap which hid her hair completely one of those puffy ones that fell over to one side and stood with one hip cocked out a rapier hanging from her belt she held a skull in her other handit was a real one and the bloodstains on it couldnt have been more than a few hours old well done wizard she said her voice sounded raspy a quiet hissing whisper the kind that comes from throats and mouths which are perfectly dry very few can see me when i do not wish to be seen thank you and excuse me i said we were just leaving bluish lips curved into a chill little smile other than that she didnt move not an inch oh but this is the hour for all to mingle and meet i have a right to introduce myself to you and to hear your names and exchange pleasantries in return her eyes fastened calmly on my face evidently not fearing to meet my gaze i figured that whatever she was she probably had an advantage on me in the devastating gaze department so i kept my own eyes firmly planted on the tip of her nose and tried very hard not to notice that her eyes had no color at all just a kind of flaccid bluegrey tinge to them a filmy coating like cataracts and what if i dont have time for the pleasantries i said oh she whispered then i might be insulted i might even be tempted to call for satisfaction a duel i asked incredulous are you kidding me her eyes drifted to my right of course if you would rather a champion fought in your place i would gladly accept i glanced back at michael who had his eyes narrowed focused on the womans doublet or upon her belt perhaps you know this lady shes no lady michael said his voice quiet he had a hand on his knife harry dresden wizard of the white council this is mavra of the black court of vampires a real vampire susan said i heard the click of her tape recorder coming on again a pleasure mavra whispered to meet you at last wizard we should talk i suspect we have much in common im failing to see anything we might possibly have in common maam do you two know each other yes michael said mavras whisper became chill the good knight here murdered my children and grandchildren some small time ago twenty years ago michael said three dozen people killed in the space of a month yes i put a stop to it mavras lips curved a little more and showed yellowed teeth yes just a little time ago i havent forgotten knight well i said its been nice chatting mavra but were on our way out no youre not mavra said calmly but for her lips and her eyes she still hadnt moved it was an eerie stillness not real real things move stir breathe mavra didnt yes we are no two of you are on your way out her smile turned chilly i know that the invitations said only one person could be brought with you therefore one of your companions is not under the protection of the old laws wizard if the knight is unprotected then he and i will have words a pity you do not have amoracchius with you sir knight it would have made things interesting at least i got a sinking feeling in my gut and if it isnt michael then you keep offensive company wizard and i am displeased with you i will demonstrate my displeasure decisively her gaze swept to susan by all means choose which two are leaving then i will have a brief conversation with the third you mean youll kill them mavra shrugged finally breaking her stillness i thought i heard a faint crackling of tendons as though theyd protested moving again one must eat after all and these little dazzled morsels the reds brought tonight are too sweet and insubstantial for my taste i took a step back and turned to michael speaking in a whisper if i get susan out of here can you take this bitch you might as well not whisper harry michael said it can hear you yes mavra said it can way to go harry endear yourself to the monsters why dont you well i asked michael can you michael looked at me for a moment his lips pressed together then he said take susan and go ill manage here mavra laughed a dry and raspy sound so very noble so pure so selfsacrificing susan stepped around me to close a triangle with michael and me as she did i noticed that mavra leaned back from her just slightly now just a minute susan said im a big girl i knew the risks when i came here im sorry miss rodriguez michael said his tone apologetic but this is what i do save me from chauvinist pigs susan muttered she turned her head around to me excuse me what do you think youre doing looking in your pickanick basket i responded as i flipped open one cover i whistled you came armed for bear miss rodriguez holy water garlic two crosses is that a thirtyeight susan sniffed a fortyfive garlic michael mused above us on the stairs mavra hissed i glanced up at her the black court was nearly wiped out thomas said i wonder if thats because they got a little too much publicity do you mind miss rodriguez i reached into the basket and produced a nice smelly clove of garlic then idly flicked it through the air toward mavra the vampire didnt retreatshe simply blurred and then stood several steps higher than she had been a moment before the garlic clove bounced against the stairs where shed been and tumbled back down toward us i bent down and picked it up id say thats a big yes i looked up at mavra is that what happened hmm stoker published the big book of black court vampire slaying those drownedblue lips peeled back from her yellowed teeth no fangs it matters little you are beings of paper and cotton i could tear apart a dozen score of your kind unless theyd had an extra spicy pizza i guess lets get out of here guys i started up the stairs mavra spread her hands out to either side and gathered darkness into her palms thats the only way i can explain it she spread out her hands and blackness rushed in to fill them gathering there in a writhing mass that shrouded her hands to the wrists try to force your way past me with that weapon wizard and i will take it as an attack upon my person and defend myself appropriately cold washed over me i extended my senses toward that darkness warily and it felt familiar it felt like frozen chains and cruel twists of thorny wire it felt empty and black and like everything that magic isnt mavra was our girl michael i said my voice strangled steel rasped as he drew one of his knives um susan said why are her hands doing that can vampires do that wizards can i said get behind me they both did i lifted my hand my face creasing in concentration i reached out and tried to call in my will my power it felt shaky uncertain like a pump that has lost its prime it came to me in dribs and drabs bit by bit stuttering like a nervous yokel but i gathered it around my upraised hand in a crystalline azure glow beautiful and fragile casting harsh shadows over mavras face her dead mans eyes looked down at me and i had an abrupt understanding of why michael had called her it mavra wasnt a woman anymore whatever she was she wasnt a person not like i understood people in any case those eyes pulled at mine pulled at me with a kind of horrid fascination the same sickly attraction that makes you want to see whats under the blanket in the morgue to turn over the dead animal and see the corruption beneath i fought and kept my eyes away from hers come wizard mavra whispered her face utterly without expression let us test one another thou and i i hardened the energy i held i wouldnt have enough juice to take two shots at her id have to take her out the first time or not at all cold radiated off of her little wisps of steam curling up as ice crystals formed on the steps at her feet but you wont take the first shot will you i didnt realize id spoken my thoughts aloud until after i had because then youd be breaking the truce i saw an emotion in that face finally anger strike wizard or do not strike and i will take the mortal of your choice from you you cannot claim the protection of hospitality to them both get out of the way mavra or dont get out of the way if you try to stop us from leaving if you try to hurt anyone under my protection youll be dealing with a wizard of the council a knight of the sword and a girl with a basket full of garlic and holy water i dont care how big bad and ugly you are there wont be anything left of you but a greasy spot on the floor you dare she whispered she blurred and came at me i took a breath but shed caught me on the exhale and i had no time to unleash the crystalline blast id prepared michael and susan moved at the same time hands thrusting past me she held a wooden cross simple and dark while he clutched his dagger by its blade the crusaderstyle hilt turned up into a cross as well both wood and steel flared with a cold white light as mavra closed and she slammed into that light as if it were a solid wall the shadows in her hand scattering and falling away like sand between her fingers we stood facing her my azure power and two blazing crosses which burned with a kind of purity and quiet power i had never seen before blood of the dragon that old serpent michael said quietly you and yours have no power here your threats are hollow your words are empty of truth just as your heart is empty of love your body of life cease this now before you tempt the wrath of the almighty he glanced aside at me and added probably for my benefit or before my friend harry turns you into a greasy spot on the floor mavra walked slowly back up the steps tendons creaking she bent and gathered up the skull shed dropped at some point during the discussion then turned back to us looking down with a quiet smile no matter she said the hour is up hour susan asked me in a tight whisper what hour is she talking about dresden the hour of socialization mavra whispered back she continued up to the top of the stairs and gently shut the doors leading out they closed with an ominous boom all the lights went out all but the blue nimbus around my hand and the faded glory of the two crosses great i muttered susan looked frightened her expression hard and tightly controlled what happens now she whispered her eyes sweeping around in the dark laughter gentle and mocking quiet hissing thick with something wet and bubbling came from all around us when it comes to spooky laughter its tough to beat vampires youre going to have to trust me on this one they know it well something glimmered in the dark and thomas and justine appeared in the glow of the power gathered in my hand he lifted both hands at once and said would you mind terribly if i stood with you i glanced at michael who frowned then at susan who was looking at thomas in all his nexttonaked glory somewhat intently i nudged her with my hip and she blinked and looked at me oh no not at all i guess thomas took justines hand and the two of them stood off to my right where michael kept a wary eye on them thank you wizard im afraid im not well loved here i glanced over at him there was a mark on his neck black and angry red like a brand in the shape of lovely feminine lips i would have thought it lipstick but i sensed a faint odor of burnt meat in the air what happened to your neck his face paled a few shades your godmother gave me a kiss damn i said well put are you ready ready for what for court to be held to be given our gifts the tenuous hold i had on the power faltered and i lowered my trembling hand let go of the tension gently before i lost control of it the last light flickered and went out leaving us in a darkness i wouldnt have believed possible and then the darkness was shattered by lightthe spotlights again shining up on the dias upon the throne there and bianca in her flaming dress upon it her mouth and throat and the rounded slopes of her breasts were smeared in streaks of fresh blood her lips stained scarlet as she smiled down at the darkness at the dozens of pairs of glowing eyes in it gazing up at the dias in adoration or terror or lust or all three all rise i whispered as soft whispers and moans rustled up out of the darkness around us not at all human vampire court is now in session chapter twentynine fear has a lot of flavors and textures theres a sharp silver fear that runs like lightning through your arms and legs galvanizes you into action power motion theres heavy leaden fear that comes in ingots piling up in your belly during the empty hours between midnight and morning when everything is dark every problem grows larger and every wound and illness grows worse and there is coppery fear drawn tight as the strings of a violin quavering on one single note that cannot possibly be sustained for a single second longerbut goes on and on and on the tension before the crash of cymbals the brassy challenge of the horns the threatening rumble of the kettle drums thats the kind of fear i felt horrible clutching tension that left the coppery flavor of blood on my tongue fear of the creatures in the darkness around me of my own weakness the stolen power the nightmare had torn from me and fear for those around me for the folk who didnt have the power i had for susan for michael for all the young people now laying in the darkness drugged and dying or dead already too stupid or too reckless to have avoided this night i knew what these things could do to them they were predators vicious destroyers and they scared the living hell out of me fear and anger always come hand in hand anger is my hiding place from fear my shield and my sword against it i waited for the anger to harden my resolve put steel into my spine i waited for the rush of outrage and strength to feel the power of it coalesce around me like a cloud it never came just a hollow fluttering sensation beneath my belt buckle for a moment i felt the fangs of the shadow demon from my dream once again i started shaking i looked around me all around the large courtyard was surrounded by high hedges cut with crenelated squares in imitation of castle walls trees rose up at the corners trimmed to form the shapes of the guard towers small openings in the hedge led out into the darkness of the houses grounds but were closed with ironbarred doors the only other way out that i saw was at the head of the stairs where mavra leaned against the doors leading back into the manor and out front she looked at me with those corpsemilk eyes and her lips cracked as she gave me a small chill smile i gripped my cane with both hands a sword cane of courseone made in merry old jack the ripper england not a knockoff from one of those mens magazines that sells lava lamps and laser pointers real steel clutching it didnt do much to make me feel better i still shook reason reason was my next line of defense fear is bred from ignorance so knowledge is a weapon against it and reason is the tool of knowledge i turned back to the front as bianca started speaking to the crowd some vainglorious bullshit i didnt pay any attention to reason facts fact one someone had engineered the uprising of the dead the torment of the restless souls most likely mavra had been the one to actually work the magic the spiritual turbulence had allowed the nightmare the ghost of a demon michael and i had slain to cross over and come after me fact two the nightmare was out to get me and michael personally by taking shots at us and all of our friends mavra might even have been directing it controlling it using it as a catspaw optionally bianca could have been learning from mavra and used it herself either way the results had been the same fact three it hadnt come after us at sundown the way wed half expected fact four i was surrounded by monsters with only the strength of a centuriesold tradition keeping them from tearing my throat out still it seemed to be holding for now unless hells bells i swore i hate it when i dont figure out the mystery that its too late dozens of gleaming red eyes turned toward me susan jabbed her elbow into my ribs shut up dresden she hissed youre making them look at us harry michael whispered thats their game i said quietly weve been set up michael grunted what this whole thing i said the facts started falling into place about two hours too late its been a setup from the very beginning the ghosts the nightmare demon the attacks on our family and friends all of it for what michael whispered whats it a setup for she meant to force us to show here from the very beginning shes getting set to take a lesson from history i said we have to get out of here a lesson from history michael said yeah remember what vlad tepesh did at his inauguration oh lord michael breathed lord preserve us i dont get it susan said voice quiet what did this guy do he invited all of his political and personal enemies to a feast then he locked them in and burned them all alive he wanted to start off his administration on a high note i see susan said and you think this is what biancas doing lord preserve us michael murmured again im told that he helps those who help themselves i said weve got to get out of here michaels armor clinked as he looked around theyve blocked the exits i know how many of them can you handle without the sword if it was only a question of holding them off but it isnt we may have to punch a hole through them michael shook his head im not sure maybe two or three lord willing i grimaced only one vampire guarded each way out but there were another two or three dozen in the courtyardnot to mention my godmother or any of the other guests like mavra well head for that gate michael said nodding toward one of the gates in the hedges i shook my head wed never make it you will he said i think i can manage that much ixnay on that upidstay anplay i said we need an idea that gets us all out alive no harry im supposed to stand between people and the harm things like these offer even if it kills me its my job youre supposed to have the sword to help its my fault that its gone so until i get it back for you ease off on the martyr throttle i dont need anyone else on my conscience or i thought a vengeful charity coming after me for getting her childrens father killed theres got to be a way out of this let me get this straight susan said quietly as biancas speech went on we cant leave now because it would be an insult to the vampires and all the excuse they would need to call for instant satisfaction instant satisfaction susan said whats that a duel to the death which means that one of them would tear my arms off and watch me bleed to death i said if im lucky susan swallowed i see and what happens if we just wait around bianca or one of the others finds a way to make us cross the line and throw the first punch then they kill us and if we dont throw the first punch susan asked i figure shell have a backup plan to wipe us out with just in case us susan asked im afraid so i looked at michael we need a distraction something that will get them all looking the other way he nodded and said you might be better for that than me harry i took a breath and looked around to see what i had to work with we didnt have much time bianca was bringing her speech to a close and so bianca said her voice carrying ably we stand at the dawn of a new age for our kind the first acknowledged court this far into the united states no longer need we fear the wrath of our enemies no longer shall we meekly bow our heads and offer our throats to those who claim power over us at this point her dark eyes fastened directly upon me finally with the strength of the entire court behind us with the lords of the outer night to empower us we will face our enemies and bring them to their knees her smile widened curving fangs blood red she trailed a fingertip across her throat then lifted the blood to her mouth to suckle it from her finger she shivered my dear subjects tonight we have guests among us guests brought here to witness our ascension to real power please my friends help me welcome them the spotlights swiveled around one of them splashed onto my little group me michael susan with thomas and justine just a little apart a second illuminated mavra at the head of the stairs in all her stark and unearthly pallor a third settled upon my godmother who glowed with beauty in its light casually tossing her hair back and casting a glittering smile around the courtyard at my godmothers side was mister ferro unlit cigarette still between his lips smoke dribbling out his nostrils looking martial and bland in his centurion gear and utterly unconcerned with everything that was going on applause listless and somehow sinister came out of the dark around us there should be some kind of law anything that is so bad that its applause is sinister should be universally banned or something or maybe i was just that nervous i coughed and waved my hand politely the red court would like to take this opportunity to present our guests with gifts at this time bianca said so that they may know how very very deeply we regard their goodwill so without further ado mister ferro would you honor me by stepping forward and accepting this token of the goodwill of myself and my court the spotlight followed ferro as he walked forward he reached the foot of the dias inclined his head in a shallow but deliberate nod then ascended to stand before bianca the vampire bowed to him in return and made a gesture with one hand one of the hooded figures behind her stepped forward holding a small cask about as big as a breadbox the figure opened it and the lights gleamed on something that sparkled and shone ferros eyes glittered and he stretched his hand down into the cask sinking it to the wrist a small smile stretched his lips and he withdrew his hand with slow reluctance a fine offering he murmured especially in this age of paupers i thank you he and bianca exchanged bows where she dipped her head just a fraction lower than his own ferro closed the cask and took it beneath one arm withdrawing a polite step before turning and descending the stairs bianca smiled and faced the courtyard again thomas of house raith of our brothers and sisters in the white court please step forward that i may give you a token of our regard i glanced over at thomas he took a slow breath and then said to me would you stand with justine for me while im up there i glanced at the girl she stood looking up at thomas one hand on his arm her eyes worried one sweet little lip between her teeth she looked small and young and frightened sure i said i held out a rather stiff arm the girls hands clutched at my forearm as thomas turned with a brilliant smile and swaggered into the spotlight and up the steps she smelled delicious like flowers or strawberries with a low heady musky smell underneath sensual and distracting she hates him justine whispered her fingers tightened on my arm through my sleeve they all hate him i frowned and glanced down at the girl even worried she was terribly beautiful though her proximity to me lessened the impact of her outfit or lack thereof i focused on her face and said why do they hate him she swallowed then whispered lord raith is the highest lord of the white court bianca extended her invitation to him the lord sent thomas in his stead thomas is his bastard son of the white court he is the lowest the least regarded his presence here is an insult to bianca i got over my surprise that the girl had spoken that many words all together is there some kind of grudge between them justine nodded as on the dias thomas and bianca exchanged bows she presented him with an envelope speaking too quietly for the crowd to hear he responded in kind justine said its me its my fault bianca wanted me to come be hers but thomas found me first she hasnt forgiven him for it she calls him a poacher which made sense in a way bianca had risen to where she was by being chicagos most infamous madame her velvet room provided the services of girls most men only got to daydream about for a hefty price she had enough dirt and political connections that she could protect herself from legal persecution even without counting any of her vampire tricks and shed always had more than her share of those bianca would want someone like justinesweet looking gorgeous unconsciously sexy probably dress her up in a plaid skirt and a starched white shirt with down harry hells bells is that why you stay with him i asked her because you feel that its your fault he has enemies she looked up at me for a moment and then away her expression more sad than anything you wouldnt understand look hes a vampire i know that they can affect people but you could be in danger i dont need rescuing mr dresden she said her lovely eyes sparkled with something hard determined but there is something you can do for me i got an edgy feeling and watched the girl warily yeah like what you can take thomas and me with you when you leave you guys showed up in a limo and you want a ride home with me dont be coy mr dresden she said i know what you and your friends were talking about i felt my shoulders creak with tension you heard us you arent human either im very human mister dresden but i read lips will you help him or not it isnt my business to protect him her soft mouth compressed into a hard line im making it your business are you threatening me her face flushed as pink as the dress she was almost wearing but she stood her ground we need friends mister dresden if you wont help us then ill try to buy biancas favor by exposing your plans to escape and claiming that i heard you talking about killing her thats a lie i hissed its an exaggeration she said her voice gentle she lowered her eyes but it will be enough for her to call duel or to force you to shed blood and if that happens you will die she took a breath i dont want it to be like that but if we dont do something to protect ourselves shell kill him and make me into one of her pet whores i wouldnt let that happen to you i said the words poured out of my mouth before id had time to run them past the thinking part of my brain but they had that solid certain ring of truth oh hell she looked up at me uncertain again catching one of those soft lips between her teeth really she whispered you really mean that dont you i grimaced yeah yeah i guess i do then youll help me youll help us michael susan justine thomas before long i was going to need a secretary just to keep track of everyone i was supposed to be looking out for you but thomas can look out for himself justines eyes filled with tears mister dresden please if theres anything i can do or say to convince you i dammit i swore earning a glare from michael dammit dammit dammit woman all women for that matter that earned me a glare from susan hes a vampire justine hes eating you why should you care if something happens to him hes also a person mister dresden justine said a person whos never done you any harm why shouldnt you care what happens to him i hate it when a woman asks me for help and i witlessly decide to go ahead and give it regardless of dozens of perfectly good reasons not to i hate it when i get threatened and strongarmed into doing something stupid and risky and i hate it when someone takes the moral high ground on me and wins justine had just done all three but i couldnt hold it against her she just looked too sweet and helpless all right i said against my better judgment all right just stay close you want my protection then you do what i say when i say and maybe we can all get out of this alive she let out a little shudder that ran through her most attractively and then she pressed herself against me thank you she murmured nuzzling her face into the hollow of my throat so that little lightningstreaks of sensation flickered down my spine thank you mister dresden i coughed uncomfortably and firmly shoved back any ideas of extracting a more thorough thanks from her later despite the clamoring of my sex drive probably the vampire venom i reasoned making me notice things like that even more sure i pushed justine gently away and looked up to see thomas returning from his visit to the dias holding an envelope in his hand well i greeted him quietly as he returned that looks like it went well enough he gave me a rather pallid smile it she can be rather frightening when she wishes cant she dont let her get to you i advised him what did she give you thomas accepted justine into the circle of his arm and she pressed her body to his as though she wanted to wallow in him and leave one of those angel shapes he lifted the envelope and said a condo in hawaii and a ticket there on a late flight tonight she suggested that i might want to leave chicago permanently one ticket i said and glanced at justine mmmm friendly of her i commented look thomas we both want to get out of here tonight just stay close to me and follow my lead all right he frowned a bit and then shot justine a reproachful look justine i asked you not to i had to she said her face earnest frightened i had to do something to help you he coughed i apologize mister dresden i didnt want to involve anyone else in my problems i rubbed at the back of my neck its okay we can help each other i guess thomas closed his eyes for a moment then he said very simply and very openly thank you sheesh i said i glanced up at bianca who was in converse with one of the robed and hooded shadows the pair of them vanished to the back of the dias while bianca watched and then returned lugging something that evidently weighted a good deal they settled the fairly large object hidden beneath a dark red cloth on the dias beside bianca harry dresden bianca purred old and esteemed acquaintance and wizard of the white council please come forward so that i can give you some of what ive been longing to for so long i gulped and shot a glance back at michael and susan look sharp i said if shes going to do something i guess it will be now when were separated he put his hand on her shoulder and said god go with you harry energy thrummed along my skin and the nearest vampires shifted about uneasily and took a few steps away he saw me notice and gave me a small sheepish smile be careful mister dresden susan said i bobbed my eyebrows at them nodded to thomas and justine and then walked forward my cane in one hand my cheesy cape flowing in the night air as i mounted the stairs to the dias a bit of sweat stung in the corner of my eye smearing my makeup probably i ignored it meeting biancas gaze as i came level with her vampires dont have souls she didnt have to fear my gaze and she wasnt good enough to sucker me into her eyes or at least she hadnt been a couple years ago she met my gaze steady her eyes dark and lovely and so very very deep i took the better course of valor and focused upon the tip of her perfectly upturned nose i saw her breasts rise and fall in pleasure beneath the flames that gowned her and she let out a small purring sound of satisfaction oh harry dresden i had looked forward to seeing you tonight you are a very handsome man after all but you look utterly ridiculous thanks i said no one except maybe the pair of robed attendants at the back of the dias could hear us how did you plan on killing me she fell quiet for a moment thoughtful then she asked me as she formally inclined her head for the benefit of the crowd below do you remember paula mister dresden i returned the gesture only more shallowly just to throw the little zing of insult into it i remember she was pretty polite i didnt really get to meet her much no she was dead within an hour of you setting foot in my house i thought she might have gone that way i said that you might have killed her you mean isnt my fault if you lost control and ate her bianca she smiled teeth blinding white oh but it was your fault mister dresden youd come to my house provoked me to near madness forced me to go along with you under threat of my destruction she leaned forward giving me a glimpse down the flamedress she was naked beneath now i get to return the favor im not someone you can simply walk over slap around whenever you have a need not anymore she paused and then said in a way im grateful to you dresden if i hadnt wanted so very badly to kill you i would never have amassed the power and the contacts that i have i never would have been elevated to the court she gestured to the crowd of vampires below the courtyard the darkness in a way all of this is your doing thats a lie i said quiet i didnt make you rope mavra into working for you i didnt make you order her to torture those poor ghosts stir up the nevernever and bring kravoss pet demon back across to send after a bunch of innocents while you tried to get to me her smile widened is that what you think happened oh my mister dresden you have an unpleasant surprise awaiting you anger made me lift my eyes to meet her gaze gave me the strength not to get pulled in by itno mistaking she had grown stronger in the past couple of years can we just get this over with anything worth doing is worth doing slowly she murmured but she reached out a hand and tugged on the dark red cloth uncovering the object there for you mister dresden with all of my most fervent sincerities the cloth slid away from a white marble tombstone set with a pentacle of gold in its center block letters carved into it read here lies harry dresden above the pentacle below it they read he died doing the right thing an envelope had been taped to the side of the tombstone do you like it bianca purred it comes complete with your own plot at graceland near to dear little inez im sure youll have ever so much to talk about when your time comes of course i looked from the tombstone back up to her go ahead i said make your move she laughed a rich sound that spilled back down into the crowd below oh mister dresden she said lowering her voice you really dont understand do you i cant openly strike you down regardless of what you may have done to me but i can defend myself i can stand by while my guests defend themselves i can watch you die and if things are hectic and confusing enough and a few others die along with you well thats hardly to be blamed upon me thomas i said and his little whore and the knight and your reporter friend im going to enjoy the rest of the evening harry my friends call me harry i said not you she smiled and said revenge is like sex mister dresden its best when it comes on slow quiet until it all seems inexorable you know what they say about revenge i hope you got a second tombstone bianca for the other grave my words stung her and she stiffened then she beckoned the attendants forward to lift my tombstone in their gloved hands and carry it back ill have it delivered to graceland mister dresden theyll have your bed all ready for you before the sun rises she flicked her wrist at me curt dismissal i bowed my head a bare stark motion cold well see hows that for a comeback then i turned and descended the stairs my legs shaking a little my back rigid and straight harry michael said as i drew close what happened i held up my hand and shook my head trying to think the trap was already closing around me i could feel that much but if i could figure out biancas plan see it coming maybe i could think my way out ahead of her i trusted michael and the others to keep an eye out for trouble while i furiously pondered tried to work through biancas logic my godmother glided forward at biancas bidding and i paused for a moment to glance up to the dias bianca presented her with a small black case lea opened it and a slow tremble ran down her body made her flamered hair shift and glisten my godmother closed it again and said a princely gift happily as is the custom of my people i have brought a matter of equal worth to exchange with you lea beckoned the attendant forward and was given a long dark case she opened it displaying it for a moment to bianca and then turned showing it to the gathered court amoracchius michaels sword it lay gleaming in the dark box casting back the ruddy light with a pure argent radiance michael went stiff beside me stifling a shout a murmur went up from the assembled vampires and sundry creatures they recognized the sword as well lea basked in it for a moment until she folded the case closed and passed it over to bianca bianca settled it across her lap and smiled down at me and i thought at michael a worthy reply to my gift bianca said i thank you lady leanandsidhe let mavra of the black court come forward my godmother retreated mavra glided out of the night and onto the dias mavra you have been a most gracious and honorable guest in my house bianca said and i trust that you have found your treatment here fair and equitable mavra bowed to bianca silent her rheumy eyes gleaming glancing down towards michael oh jesus i whispered son of a bitch he didnt mean it lord michael said harry what did you mean i clenched my teeth eyes flickering around everyone was watching me all the vampires mister ferro everyone they all knew what was coming the tombstone it was written on my damned tombstone bianca watched the realization come over me still smiling then please mavra accept these minor tokens of my goodwill and with them my hopes that vengeance and prosperity will belong to you and yours she offered forth the case containing the sword which mavra accepted bianca then beckoned to the background and the attendants brought out another covered bundle the attendants jerked the cover off of the bundlelydia her dark tousled hair had been trimmed into an elegant cut and she wore a halter and shorts of black lycra that emphasized her hips the beauty of her pale limbs her eyes stared into the lights glazed drugged and she sagged helplessly between the attendants my god susan said what are they going to do with that girl mavra turned to lydia reaching into the case as she did sweet her hissing voice rasped her eyes went to michael again now to open my gift it may tarnish the steel a bit but im sure ill get over it michael drew in a sudden breath whats going on susan blurted the blood of innocents he snarled the sword is vulnerable she means to unmake it harry we cannot allow it all around me vampires dropped their wineglasses slid out of their jackets bared their scarletsmeared fangs in slow smiles to me bianca started laughing up above me as mavra opened the case and withdrew amoracchius the sword seemed to almost chime with an angry sound as the vampire touched it but mavra only sneered down at the blade as she lifted the sword thomas moved closer to us pushing justine behind him as he drew his sword dresden he hissed dresden dont be a fool its only one lifeone girls life and a sword balanced against all of us if you act now you condemn us all harry susan asked her voice shaking michael too turned to look at me his expression grim faith dresden not all is lost all looked pretty damned lost to me but i didnt have to do anything i didnt have to lift a finger all i had to do to get out of here alive was to sit still to do nothing all i had to do was stand here and watch while they murdered a girl who had come to me a few days before begging me for protection all i had to do was ignore her screams as mavra gutted her all i had to do was let the monsters destroy one of the major bastions standing against them all i had to do was let michael go to his death claim the protection of the laws of hospitality upon susan and i could walk away michael nodded at me then drew both knives and turned toward the dias i closed my eyes god forgive me for what im about to do i grabbed michaels shoulder before he could start walking then i drew the sword blade forth from the cane holding the cane in my left hand reversing it in my grip as i drew in my will sent it coursing down the haft of the cane caused bluewhite light to flare in the runes etched there michael flashed me a fighting grin and took position at my right thomas took one look at me and whispered were dead but he fell in at my left crystalline sword glittering in his hand a howl went up from the vampires a sudden wave of deafening sound mavra turned her eyes to us gathering night into the fingers of her free hand again bianca slowly rose dark eyes glowing in triumph over to one side lea laid her hand on mister ferros arm frowning faintly standing well out of the way mavra hissed lifting amoracchius up high harry susan asked her shaking hand touched my shoulder what are we going to do stay behind me susan i clenched my teeth i guess im going to do the right thing even if it kills me i thought and all of you too chapter thirty in games and history books and military science lectures teachers and old warhorses and other scholarly types lay out diagrams and stand up models in neat lines and rows they show you in a methodical order how this division forced a hole in that line or how these troops held their ground when all others broke but thats an illusion a real struggle between combatants whether they number dozens or thousands is something inherently messy fluid difficult to follow the illusion can show you the outcome but it doesnt impress upon you the surge and press of bodies the screams the fear the faltering rushes forward or away within the battle everything is wild motion and sound and a blur of impressions that flash by almost before they have time to register instinct and reflex rule everythingthere isnt time to think and if theres a spare second or two the only thought in your head is how do i stay alive youre intensely aware of what is happening around you its an obscure kind of torture an acute and temporary hellbecause one way or another it doesnt last long a tide of vampires came toward us they rushed in animalswift a blur of twisted bulging faces and staring black eyes their jaws hung too far open fangs bared hissing and howling one of them held a long spear and shoved it toward thomass pale belly justine screamed thomas swept the crystalline sword he bore down in an arc parrying the spears tip aside and cutting through the haft undeterred the spearwielding vampire came on and sank its fangs into thomass forearm thomas shoved the vamp back but it held firm thomas switched tactics abruptly lifting the vampire up and clear of the ground and then rolled the swords blade around its belly splitting it open in a welter of gore the vampire fell to the ground a sound bubbling up from his throat that was one part fury and one part agony their bellies thomas shouted without the blood theyre too weak to fight michael caught a descending machetes blade on the metal guard around his forearm and whipped one of his knives across the belly of the vamp who held it blood splattered out of the vamp and it went down in convulsions i know michael snapped back flashing thomas an irritated look and then he was buried in a swarm of redclad bodies michael i shouted i tried to push toward him but found myself jostled aside i saw him struggle and drop to one knee saw the vampires shoving knives at him and fangs teeth tearing and worrying and if any of them were burning like before i couldnt see it kyle hamilton appeared across the dogpile over the fallen knight he bared his fangs at me and lifted a semiautomatic one of the expensive models goldplated fare thee well dresden i lifted the cane its runes shimmering blue and white and snapped venteferro the magic whispered silently out through the runes on the cane earth magic isnt really my forte but i like to keep my hand in the runes and the power i willed into the staff reached out and caught the gun in invisible waves of magnetism i had been worried that the spells id laid on the cane might have gone stale but they were still hanging in there the gun flew from kyles hands i whipped it through the air into the face of another vamp coming toward justine it hit at something just this side of the speed of sound and sent the thing flying back into the darkness justine whirled as a second vampire came at her only to have its legs literally scythed out from beneath it by thomass blade iesu domine michaels voice rang out from beneath the vampires like a brass army bugle and with a sudden explosion of pressure and unseen force bodies flew back and up away from him flesh ripped and torn from them hanging in ragged bloodless strips like cloth showing gleaming oily black flesh beneath domine michael shouted rising slewing gutted vamps off of him like a dog shakes off water lava quod est sordium come on i called and strode forward toward the stairs leading up to the dias michael had parted the scarlet sea as it werestunned vampires gathered themselves from the ground or slowed their attack hovering several feet away hissing susan and justine caught one of them starting to creep in closer and discouraged the others from following its example by splattering it with holy water from susans basket the thing howled and fell back clawing at its eyes flopping and wriggling like a halfcrushed bug bianca thomas shouted our only chance is to take out their leader a knife flew out of the dark too fast for me to see but thomas did he reached out and flicked the blade of his sword across its path with a contemptuous swat deflecting it out we reached the foot of the stairs thomas hold them here michael we go up i didnt wait to see who was listeningi just turned and headed up the stairs sword and cane out and ready my stomach sinking there was no way we would be in time to save lydia but we were the carnage had evidently drawn mavras attention and she stared at the blood withered lips pulled back from yellow teeth she looked at me and her expression twisted in malice she spun back to lydia sword held high michael i snapped and stretched out my cane venteferro amoracchius burst into conflicting shades of blue and golden light as my power wrapped around it a coruscation of sparks that made mavra howl in surprise and pain the vampire retreated but kept her pale hands clenched on the blade suit yourself sparky i muttered i gritted my teeth as the cane smoked and shook in my hand vente venteferro i whipped the cane in a wide arc and with a hiss the vampire found herself lifted clear of the ground by her grip on the sword and flung like a beach ball toward the courtyard below she smacked into the stones of the courtyard hard brittle popping sounds a gruesome accompaniment the sword exploded in another cloud of vengeful argent sparks and went spinning away from mavra the blade flashing where hit the ground a wave of exhaustion and dizziness swept over me and i nearly fell even using a focus the runeetched cane that effort had nearly been more than i could manage i had to clench my teeth and hope i wouldnt simply pitch to one side i was getting down to the bottom of the barrel as far as magic went harry michael shouted look out i looked up to see mavra bound up onto the dias again not bothering to take the stairs landing a few feet from me michael strode forward one hand holding a dagger up reversed point down a cross extended toward mavra the vampire flung her hands at michael and darkness spilled out of them like oil splattering toward the knight it sizzled and spat against him going up in puffs of steam and michael came on forward through it white fire gathering around the upheld cross mavra let out a dusty hissing scream and fell back from him forced away from me harry thomas shouted up the stairs hurry up we cant last much longer my eyes swept the dias but i could see no sign of bianca or her attendants in the shadows cast by the halogenbrightness of michaels blazing cross i hurried to lydia sheathing my slender blade before scooping her up longer im amazed were still alive now light shines brightest in the deepest dark michael shouted a fierce joy on his face his eyes alight with a passion and a vengeance i had never seen in him he kept forcing mavra back before the paralyzing fire of the cross until with a scream she fell from the dias let come the forces of night we will stand we will get the hell out of here is what we will do i muttered but louder i said back down the stairs lets go i turned to see thomas susan and justine holding off a ring of vampires at the base of the stairs to the dias between the pair of spotlights only scraps of skin and cloth clung to the vampires some of the red court still had partially human faces but most stood naked now free of the flesh masks they wore black flabby creatures twisted horrible faces bellies bulging mostly tight with fresh blood black eyes empty of anything but hunger glittered in the light long skinny fingers ended in black claws as did the grasping toes of their feet membranes stretched between their arms and flanks horribly slimecovered the beautiful bodies and shapes of before given way to the horror beneath a vampire lurched toward thomas while another reached out to grasp susan she thrust her cross in its face but unlike with mavra the wood did not blaze to light faith magic isnt always easy to work even on vampires and the red court creatures with a more solid hold on reality than the more magical denizens of the black were not so easily repelled the vampire howled mouth yawning open foaming slaver spattering susans red hood she twisted and fought and with her other hand swept up another baby food jar of holy waternot at the vampire but at the spotlight beside them with a screaming hiss the water vaporized against the heat of the light bursting out in a sudden cloud of steam that enfolded the vampire completely it let out a screech that swept upward through the range of human hearing vanishing above it and fell away from susan its skin sloughing off the black stringy muscles and bones beneath showing through susan fumbled her basket open and drew her gun she fired for the vampires belly the rapid thumpthumpthump of panic fire and the vampires abdomen ruptured blood spraying out in a cloud the vamp fell to the ground and i remember thinking that shed just killed the thingreally and truly taken one of them out a fierce pride shot through me and i headed down the stairs and then our streak of luck ended justine took a step too far to one side and bianca appeared out of nowhere seizing the girl by the hair and dragging her away from thomas thomas whirled but too late bianca held the girls back against her front her fingers wound with deceptive gentleness around justines throat with the other hand bianca still quite humanseeming and calm caressed the girls belly justine struggled but bianca simply turned her head to one side and drew her tongue slowly sensuously over justines throat the girls eyes widened panicked then they grew heavy she shuddered her body relaxing toward bianca arching slowly biancas rich mouth quirked and she murmured something into justines ear that made the girl whimper enough bianca said and as quickly as that the courtyard grew silent michael and i stood on the stairs a bit above thomas and susan the vampires ringed them in just out of reach of thomass sword i held lydia unmoving in my arms bianca looked up at me and said the game has ended wizard you havent taken us down yet i shot back smart for you and your people to get out of my way before i get cranky bianca laughed idly plucking some of the petals from justines top baring a bit more of her breasts surely you dont think me so stupid as to be bluffed now dresden you have already had a measure of your strength taken what remains barely keeps you standing if you could force your way out youd have done it already her eyes moved to michael and you sir knight you will die gloriously and take many of the horrid creatures of the night with you but you are outnumbered and alone and without the sword you will die i glanced at thomas and susan and said well then i guess its a good thing we brought help your whole court bianca and you couldnt take us down i swept my eyes back and forth over the vampires below and said all of your little minions here have eternity laid out before them eternity is a bad thing to lose and maybe you would get us eventually but whichever one of you would like to lose eternity first please just go ahead and step on up silence reigned over the courtyard for a moment i allowed a bit of hope to seep into my pounding heart kenny rogers eat your heart out if this bluff worked id be more of a gambler than hed ever dreamed bianca only smiled and said to thomas shes so beautiful my cousin of the white court ive wanted her ever since the moment i saw her bianca licked her lips what would you say to a bargain i sneered you think we would do business with you thomas glanced back up at me incredibly he was cleanbut for a sprinkling of scarlet droplets on his pale flesh unmarred loincloth wings and all go ahead he said im listening give them to us thomas raith bianca said give us these three and take the girl as your own uncontested i will have as many little pets as i wish now what is one over another thomas i said i know we just met but dont listen to her she set you up to get killed already thomas glanced back and forth between us he met my eyes for a momentalmost long enough to let me see inside him then looked away i had the impression that he was trying to tell me something i dont know what his expression seemed apologetic maybe i know mister dresden he said but im afraid the situation has changed he didnt kick susan so much as he simply planted his sandaled foot against her and shoved her into the crowd of vampires she let out a short startled scream and then they took her and dragged her into the darkness thomas lowered his sword and turned toward me his back to the vampires leering hissing they crept closer to michael and me around thomas one of them rubbing up against his legs his mouth twisted in distaste and he sidestepped im sorry mister dresden harry i do like you quite a bit but im afraid that i like myself a whole lot more thomas faded back while the vampires crowded around the bottom of the stairs somewhere in the dark susan let out a short terrified scream and then it faded to a moan and then silence bianca smiled sweetly at me over justines lolling head and so wizard it ends the pair of you will die but dont worry no one will ever find the bodies she glanced back toward where thomas had faded into the background and said aside kyle mavra kill the whitebellied little bastard too thomass head whipped around toward bianca and he snarled you bitch my mouth worked and twisted but no words came out how could they words couldnt possibly contain the frustration the rage the fear that poured through me it cut through my weariness sharp as thorns and barbed wire it wasnt fair wed done everything we could wed risked everything not we the choices had been mine id risked everything and id lost michael and i couldnt possibly fight them all alone theyd taken susan the help we thought wed found had turned against us they had susan and it was my fault i hadnt listened to her when i should have i hadnt protected her and now she was going to die because of me i dont know how that realization would make someone else feel i dont know if the despair and the selfloathing and the helpless fury would crumble them like toobrittle concrete or melt them like dirty lead or shatter them like cheap glass i only know what it did to me it set me on fire fire in my heart in my thoughts in my eyes i burned burned down deep in my gut burned in places i hadnt known i could hurt i dont remember the spell or the words i said but i remember reaching for that pain i remember reaching for it and thinking that if we had to go then so help me god weakened or not hopeless or not i was going to take these murdering bloodsucking sons of bitches with me i would show them that they couldnt play lightly with the powers of creation of life itself that it wasnt smart to cross a wizard of the white council when someone has stolen his girlfriend i think michael must have sensed something and taken the girl from my arms because the next thing i remember is thrusting my hands toward the night sky and screaming fuego pyrofuego burn you greasy batfaced bastards burn i reached for fireand fire answered me the treetowers of the topiary castle exploded into blazes of light and the hedgewalls complete with their crenelated tops went up with them fire leapt up into the air forty fifty feet and the sudden explosion of it lifted everyone but me up and off the ground sent wind roaring around us in a gale i stood amidst it my mind brilliantly lit by the power coursing through me it burned me and some part of me screamed out in joy that it did my cloak flapped and danced in the gale spreading out around me in a scarlet and sable cloud the abrupt glare fell on the scene of the vampires revelry lighting it harshly the young people of earlier lay about out in the darkness near the hedges near the fires pathetic little lumps some of them twitched some of them breathed a few whimpered and tried to crawl away from the heatbut most lay dreadfully perfectly still pale pretty dead the fury in me grew it swelled and burned and i reached out to the fires again flames flew out caught one of the more cowardly of the vampires huddled at the back scrabbling to slip his flesh mask back over his squashed bat face the fire touched him and then twined about him searing and blackening his skin then dragging him back winding and rolling him toward the blaze the magic danced in my eyes my head my chest flying wild and out of control i couldnt follow everything that happened more vampires got too close to the flames and began screaming tendrils of fire rose up from the ground and began to slither over the courtyard like serpents everything exploded into motion shadows flashing through the brightness seeking escape screaming i felt my heart clench in my chest and stop beating i swayed on my feet gasping michael got to me lydia slung over his shoulder in a firemans carry hed torn his cloak off and it lay to one side burning he dragged my arm across his shoulder and half carried me down the stairs smoke gathered on us thick and choking i coughed and retched helpless the magic coursed through me slower now a tricklenot because the floodgates had closed but because i had nothing left to pour out i hurt fire spread out from my heart my arms and legs clenching and twitching i couldnt get a breath couldnt think and i knew somewhere amidst all that pain that i was about to die lord michael coughed lord i know that harry hasnt always done what you would have done he staggered forward carrying me and the girl but hes a good man hes fought against your foes he deserves better than to die here lord so if you could be kind enough to show me how to get us out of here id really appreciate it and then abruptly the smoke parted and sweet untainted air hit us in the face like a bucket of ice water i fell to the ground michael dropped the girl somewhere near me and tore the cheap tuxedo open he laid his hand over my heart and let out a short cry after that i dont remember much more than pain and a series of dull hard thumps on my chest and then my heart lurched and began to beat again the red haze of agony receded i looked up the smoke had parted in a tunnel as though someone had shoved a glass tube of clean air through it and around us at the far end of the tunnel stood a slender willowy figure tall feminine something like wings spread out behind the figure though that might have been an illusion light falling on it from many angles so that it was all shadow and color i thought he wasnt so literal i choked michael drew back from me his sootstained face breaking into a brief smile are you complaining hheck no wheres susan ill come back in for her come on too tired to argue i let him haul me back to my feet he picked up lydia and we staggered forward and out to the figure at the tunnels far end lea my faerie godmother we both drew up short michael fumbled for his knife but it was gone lea quirked one delicate brow at us her dress still blue unsoiled flowed around her and her silken mane matched the bloody fires consuming the courtyard she looked almost good enough to drink and she still held the black box bianca had given her beneath one slender arm godmother i said startled well fool what are you waiting for i took the trouble to show you a way to escape do it you saved us i coughed she sighed and rolled her eyes though it pains me in ways i could not explain yes child how am i supposed to have you if i let this red court hussy kill you stars above wizard i thought you had better sense than this you saved me so you could get me not like this lea said holding a silken cloth to her nose delicately youre a husk and i want the whole fruit go rest child we will speak again soon enough and then she withdrew and was gone michael got me out of the house i remember the smell of his old truck sawdust and sweat and leather i felt its worn seat creak beneath me susan i said wheres susan ill try then i drifted in darkness for a while dimly conscious of a lingering pain in my chest of lydias warm skin pressed against my hand i tried to move to make sure the girl was all right but it was too much effort the truck door opened and slammed closed then came the rumble of its engine and then everything went mercifully black chapter thirtyone the darkness swallowed me and kept me for a long time there was nothing but silence where i drifted nothing but endless night i wasnt cold i wasnt warm i wasnt anything no thought no dreams no anything it was too good to last the pain of the burns came to me first burns are the worst injuries in the world id been scorched on my right arm and shoulder and it throbbed with a dull persistence that dragged me out of the peace all the other assorted scrapes and bruises and cuts came back to me i felt like a collection of complaints and malfunctions i ached everywhere memory came through the haze next i started remembering what had happened the nightmare the vampire ball the kids who had been seduced into being there and the fire oh god what had i done i thought of the fire towering up in walls of solid flame reaching out with hungry arms to drag the vampires screaming back into the pyre i had made of the hedges and the trees stars and stones those children had been helpless in that in the fire and the smoke that id needed a major sidhe sorceresss assistance to escape i had never stopped to think about that i had never even considered the consequences of unleashing my power that way i opened my eyes i lay in my bed in my room i stumbled out of the bed and into my bathroom someone must have fed me soup at some point because when i started throwing up there was something left to come out killed them i killed those kids my magic the magic that was the energy of creation and life itself had reached out and burned them to death i threw up until my belly ached with the violence of it wild grief running rampant over me i struggled but i couldnt force the images out of my head children burning justin burning magic defines a man it comes from down deep inside you you cant accomplish anything with magic that isnt in you somewhere to do and i had burned those children alive my power my choice my fault i sobbed i didnt come to myself until michael came into the bathroom by the time he did i lay on my side curled up tight the water of the shower pouring down over me the cold making me shiver everything hurt inside and out my face ached from being twisted up so tightly my throat had closed almost completely as i wept michael picked me up as though i weighed no more than one of his children he dried me with a towel and shoved me into my heavy robe he had on clean clothes a bandage on his wrist and another on his forehead his eyes looked a little more sunken as though short on sleep but his hands were steady his expression calm confident i gathered myself again very slowly by the time he was finished i lifted my eyes to his how many i asked how many of them died he understood i saw the pain in his eyes after i got the pair of you out i called the fire department and let them know that people needed a rescue they got there pretty quickly but how many michael he drew in a slow breath eleven bodies susan my voice shook he hesitated we dont know eleven was all they found theyre checking dental records they said the heat was so intense that the bones hardly look human i let out a bitter laugh hardly human there were more kids than that there i know but thats all they found and they rescued a dozen more alive its something at least what about the ones unaccounted for they were gone missing theyre theyre presumed dead i closed my eyes fire had to burn hot to reduce bones to ash had my spell been that powerful had it hidden most of the dead i cant believe it i said i cant believe i was so stupid harry michael said he put his hand on my shoulder weve no way to know we just dont they could have been dead before the fires came the vampires were feeding from them indiscriminately where we couldnt see i know i said i know god i was so arrogant such an idiot to go walking in there like that harry and those poor stupid kids paid the price dammit michael a lot of the vampires didnt make it out either harry it isnt worth it not if it wiped out all the vamps in chicago michael fell quiet we sat that way for a long time finally i asked him how long have i been out more than a day you slept through last night and yesterday and most of tonight the sun will rise soon god i said i rubbed at my face i could hear michaels frown i thought wed lost you for a while you wouldnt wake up i was afraid to take you to the hospital any place where thered be a record of you the vampires could trace it we need to call murphy and tell her murphys still sleeping harry i called sergeant stallings last night when i called the fire department si tried to take over the investigation but someone up the line called the police department off of it altogether bianca has contacts in city hall i guess they cant stop the missing persons investigations that are going to start cropping up as soon as people start missing those kids but they can stick a bunch of things in the way of it crap i know michael said i tried to find susan the girl justine and the sword after nothing we almost pulled it off sword and captives and all i know i shook my head hows charity the baby he looked down the babythey still dont know about him they cant find out whats wrong they dont have any idea why he is getting weaker im sorry is charity shes stuck in bed for a while but shell be fine i called her yesterday called you didnt go see her i guarded you michael said father forthill was with my family and there are others who can watch them when im away i winced she didnt like that did she that you stayed with me shes not speaking to me im sorry he nodded so am i help me up im thirsty he did and i only swayed a little as i stood i tottered out into the living area of my apartment what about lydia i asked michael remained silent and my eyes answered my own question a few seconds later lydia lay on the couch in my living room under a ton and a half of blankets curled up her eyes closed and her mouth a little open i recognize her michael said i frowned from where kravoss lair she was one of the kids they hauled away early on i whistled she must have known him known what he was going to do somehow try not to wake her up michael said his voice soft she wouldnt sleep i think theyd drugged her she was panicky gabbling i just got her quieted down half an hour ago i frowned a little and went into the tiny kitchen michael followed i got a coke out of the icebox thought better of it with my stomach the way it was and fetched a glass of water instead i drank unsteadily ive got hell to pay now michael he frowned at me how do you mean what you do comes back to you michael you know that much roll a stone and it rolls back upon you sow the wind and reap the whirlwind michael lifted his eyebrows i didnt realize youd read much of the bible proverbs always made a lot of sense to me i said but with magic things like that come a lot sharper and cleaner than with other things i killed people i burned them its going to come back to haunt me michael frowned and looked out at lydia the law of three eh i shrugged i thought you told me once that you didnt believe in that i drank more water i didnt i dont its too much like justice to believe that what you do with magic comes back to you threefold youve changed your mind i dont know all i know is that theres going to be justice michael for those kids for susan for whats happened to charity and your son if no one else is going to arrange it ill damn well do it myself i grimaced i just hope that if im wrong i can dodge karmic paybacks long enough to finish this harry the ball was the whole point it was biancas chance to put you down while staying within the terms of the accords she laid her trap and missed do you think shes going to keep pushing it i gave him a look of course and so do you or you wouldnt have played watchdog here for the past day good point i raked my fingers through my hair and reached for the coke my stomach be damned we just have to decide what our next move is going to be michael shook his head i dont know i need to be with charity and my son if hes if hes sick he needs me near him i opened my mouth to object but i couldnt michael had already risked his neck for me more than once hed given me a lot of good advice that i hadnt listened to especially about susan if id only paid more attention told her what i felt maybe i cut off that line of thought before the hysterical sob that rose in my throat became more than a blur of tears in my eyes all right i said i thank you for your help he nodded and looked down as though ashamed harry im sorry ive done all that i could but im not as young as i used to be and i lost the sword maybe im not the one to hold it anymore after all maybe this is how he is telling me that i need to be at home now be there for my wife my children i know i said its all right do what you think is best he touched the bandage on his forehead lightly if i had the sword maybe id feel differently he fell quiet go on i said look ill be all right here the council will probably give me some help if they didnt hear about the people whod died in the fire that is if they heard about that that id broken the first law of magic theyd take my head off my neck faster than you could say capital offense just go michael ill take care of lydia all right he said ill a thought occurred to me and i didnt hear what michael said next harry he asked harry are you all right im having a thought i said i something feels off about this to me doesnt it to you he just blinked at me i shook my head ill think about it make some notes try to sort this mess out i started toward the door come on ill let you out michael followed me to the door and i had my hand on the knob when the door abruptly rattled under several rapid blows that could only loosely be construed as knocking i shot him a glance over my shoulder and without a word he retreated to the fireplace and picked up the poker that had been laying against some of the logs the tip glowed orangered when a fresh barrage hammered against my door i jerked it open slipping to one side a slender figure of medium height stumbled into the room he wore a leather jacket jeans tennis shoes and a cubs ball cap he carried a rifle case made of black plastic and he smelled of sweat and feminine perfume you i snarled i grabbed the mans shoulder before he could get his balance and spun his shoulders hard sending him back against the wall i drove my fist hard at his mouth felt the bright smackthud of impact on my knuckles i grabbed the front of his jacket in both hands and with a snarl hurled him away from the wall to the floor of my living room michael stepped forward put his work boot on the back of the intruders neck and pressed the glowing tip of the poker close to his eyes thomas released the rifle case and jerked his hands up pale fingers spread jesus he gasped his full lower lip had split and was smeared with something pale and pinkish not much like human blood i glanced down at my knuckles and they were smeared with the same substance it caught the light of the fire and refracted in an opalescent sheen dresden thomas stammered dont do anything hasty i reached down and plucked the hat off of his head letting his dark hair spill out and down in an unkempt mane hasty like maybe turn traitor on you all of a sudden and let a bunch of monsters eat your girlfriend his eyes rolled back to michael and then over to me god wait it wasnt like that you didnt see all that happened afterwards at least shut the door and listen to me i glanced over at the open doorway and after a hesitation shut it no sense in leaving my back open just to be contrary i dont want to listen to him michael hes a vampire michael said and he betrayed us hes probably come here to try to trick us again you think we should kill him before he hurts someone michael said his tone was flat disinterested scary actually i shivered a little and drew my robe closed around me a little more tightly look thomas i said ive had a really bad day and i only woke up half an hour ago youre adding to it were all having a bad day dresden thomas said biancas people were after me all day and all night too i just barely got here without getting myself torn to pieces the night is young i said give me one good reason why i shouldnt kill you like the lying treacherous vampire sleaze you are because you can trust me he said i want to help you i snorted why the hell should i believe you you shouldnt he said dont im a good liar one of the best im not asking you to believe me believe the circumstances we have a common interest i scowled youre kidding me he shook his head and offered me a wry smile i wish i was i thought i would get the chance to help you out once bianca had taken her eyes off me but she double crossed me well thomas i dont know how new you are to all of this but bianca is what we colloquially refer to as a bad guy they do that thats one way you can tell theyre bad guys god save me from idealists thomas muttered michael growled and thomas shot him a hopeful puppylike smile look both of you they have dresdens woman i took a step forward my heart fluttering shes alive for now thomas said theyve got justine too i want her back you want susan back i think we can make a deal work together what do you say michael shook his head hes a liar harry i can tell just by being this close to him yes yes yes thomas said i confess to it but at the moment it isnt a part of my agenda to lie to anyone i just want her back justine thomas nodded so he can keep on draining the life out of her michael said harry if we arent going to kill him lets at least put him out if you do thomas said youll be making a huge mistake and i swear to you by my own stunning good looks and towering ego that im not lying to you okay i said to michael kill him wait thomas shouted dresden please what do you want me to pay you what do you want me to do i dont have anywhere else to go i studied thomass expression he looked weary desperate beneath the cool facade he was barely holding onto and beneath the fear he looked resigned determined okay i said its all right michael let him up michael frowned you sure i nodded michael fell back from thomas but he kept the poker gripped loosely in one hand thomas sat up running his fingers lightly over his throat where michaels boot had left a dark mark and then touched his split lip and winced thank you he said quietly look in the case i glanced at the black rifle case whats in it a deposit he said a down payment for your help i quirked an eyebrow and leaned over the case i ran my fingertips lightly over it there was no spiny buzz of energy around it to herald a sorcerous booby trap but a good one would be hard to notice there was something inside though something that hummed quietly a silent vibration of power that ran through the plastic and into my hand a vibration i recognized i flicked open the latches on the rifle case fumbling in my hurry and swung it open amoracchius lay gleaming against the grey foam inside the case unmarked from the inferno at biancas town house michael i said quietly i reached out and touched the blades hilt again still it buzzed with that quiet deep power at once reassuring and intimidating i withdrew my fingers michael paced over to the case and leaned down staring at the sword his expression wavered and became difficult to read his eyes filled with tears and he reached a broad scarred hand down to the weapons hilt he took it in hand and closed his eyes its all right he said they didnt hurt it he blinked his eyes open and looked upwards i hear you i glanced up toward my ceiling and said i hope you meant that in a figurative sense because i didnt hear anything michael smiled and shook his head i was weak for a while the swords are a burden a power yes but at a price i thought that perhaps the loss of the sword was his way of telling me it was time to retire he ran his other hand over the twisted metal nail set into the blade at the weapons crossguard but theres still work to be done i glanced up at thomas you say theyve got susan and justine huh where he licked his lips the town house he said the fire ruined the back of the house but only the exterior the inside was fine and the basement was untouched all right i said talk thomas did laying out facts in rapid order after the havoc of the fire bianca and the court had retreated into the mansion bianca had ordered the other vampires to each carry one of the helpless mortals out one of them had brought susan when the police and fire crews had arrived most of the action was over and the fire marshal had been worked up into a lather over the deaths hed gone inside to speak to bianca and come out calm and collected and ordered everyone to pack up and leave that he was satisfied that it had been a terrible accident and that everything was over after that the vampires had been able to relax and enjoy their guests i think theyre turning some of them thomas said bianca has the authority to allow it now and they lost too many in the fight and the fire i know mavra took a couple and took them with her when she left left i asked thomas nodded she skipped town just after sunset word is couple of hungry new mouths to feed you know and how do you know all of this thomas the last i heard biancas people were trying to kill you he shrugged theres more to a good liar than meets the eye dresden i was able to keep an eye on things for a while okay i said so theyve got our people at the manor house we just need to get inside get them and get out again thomas shook his head we need something else shes brought in mortal security guards with machine guns it would be a slaughter thats the spirit i said with a grim smile where in the house are they keeping the captives thomas looked at me rather blankly for a moment then he shook his head i dont know youve known everything so far michael said why are you drying up on us now thomas gave the knight a wary look im serious i havent seen any more of that house than you two michael frowned even if we do get in we cant go blundering around checking every broom closet we need to know about the inside of the house thomas shrugged im sorry im tapped i waved a hand dont worry we just need to talk to someone who has seen the inside of the house capture a prisoner michael asked i dont know how much luck wed have with that i shook my head and glanced over at the sleeping figure of lydia who hadnt stirred in all that time we just need to talk to her she was inside she might have some useful insights for us in any case shes got a gift for it gift cassandras tears she can see bits of the future i got dressed and we gave lydia another hour or so thomas went into the bathroom to shower while i sat out in the living room with michael what i cant figure i said is how we managed to get out of there so easily you call that easy michael said i grimaced maybe i would have expected them to come after us by now or to have sent the nightmare to get us michael frowned rolling the hilt of the sword between his two hands as though it were a golf club i see what you mean he was quiet for a minute and then said you really think the girl will be of help i hope so at that moment lydia started coughing i moved to her side and helped her drink some water she seemed groggy though she started to stir poor kid i commented to michael at least she got a little sleep i dont think shed had any for days michaels words froze me solid i started to push myself away from lydia but her fingers reached out and dug into the sweater i was wearing i jerked against them but she held me easily not at all moved the pale girl opened her sunken eyes and they were flooded with blood all through the whites scarlet she smiled slow and malicious she spoke and her voice came out in a low harsh sound totally unlike her natural tones alien and malevolent you should have kept her from sleeping or killed her before she woke michael started to his feet lydia rose and with one arm she lifted me clear of the ground bloody eyes glaring up at me with wicked exultation ive waited long enough for this the alien voice that of the nightmare purred goodbye wizard and the slender girl flung me like a baseball at the stone of my fireplace some days it just doesnt pay to get out of bed chapter thirtytwo i flailed my arms and legs and watched the fireplace get closer to breaking open my head at the last second i saw a blur of white and pink and then i slammed into thomas driving him into the stones of the fireplace he let out a grunt and i bounced off of him and back to the floor momentarily breathless i shoved myself up to my hands and knees and looked at him hed wrapped a pink bath towel around his hips but either the sheer speed of his movement or else the impact had knocked it mostly askew his ribs jutted out on one side oddly misshapen thomas looked up at me his face twisted into a grimace ill be all right he said look out i looked up to find lydia stalking toward me idiot she seethed at thomas what did you think you could accomplish so be it you just got added to the list michael slipped in between the possessed girl and me the sword glittering in the low light of the room thats far enough he said get back i struggled back to my feet and wheezed michael be careful lydia let out another twisted laugh and leaned forward pressing her sternum against amoracchiuss tip oh yes sir knight get back or what youll murder this poor child i dont think so i seem to remember there was something about this sword not being able to draw innocent blood wasnt there michael blinked and darted a glance back at me what i got to my feet this is really lydia it isnt a magical construct like we saw before the nightmare is possessing her anything we do to lydias body shes going to have to live with later the girl ran a hand over her breasts beneath the taut lycra licking her lips and staring at michael with bloody eyes yes just a sweet little innocent lamb wandered astray you wouldnt want to hurt her would you knight harry michael said how do we handle this you die lydia purred she rushed michael one hand reaching out to strike the swords blade aside when she rushed me i just got grabbed but michael had training experience he let the sword fall to the floor and rolled back with lydias rush he grabbed her forearms as she reached for his throat whirled and sent her tumbling into the couch knocking it over backwards and sending her into a sprawl on the far side keep her busy i shouted to him i can get it out of her and then i rushed back into my bedroom searching for the ingredients for an exorcism my room was a mess i scrambled through it while out in the living room lydia screamed again there was another thump this one rattling the wall beside the bedroom door and then the sounds of panting scuffling hurry up harry michael gasped shes strong i know i know i jerked open the door to my closet and started knocking things off the shelves rather than hunt through them behind the spare cans of shaving cream i located five trick birthday candles the kind that you cant blow out and a fivepound bag of salt okay i called im coming michael and lydia lay on the floor his legs wrapped around hers while his arms pinned hers back behind her in some kind of modified full nelson hold hold her there i shouted i rushed in a circle around them shoving back a chair and a footrest kicking rugs and carpets aside finally jerking the last one out from beneath michael lydia fought him twisting like an eel and screaming at the top of her lungs i tore open the salt and ran about the pair of them dumping it out into a white mound in a circle then i ran about again setting the candles down piling up enough salt around them to keep them from being turned over lydia saw what i was doing and screamed again redoubling her efforts flickum bicus i shouted shoving a hurried effort of will into the little spell the effort made me dizzy for a moment but the candles burst to light the circle of candles and salt gathering power i rose reaching out my right hand and feeding more energy into the circle setting it up in a spinning vortex winding about the three beings inside itlydia michael and the nightmare energy gathered in the circle spinning around whirling magic down into the earth grounding and dispersing it i could almost see the nightmare clutching tighter to lydia holding on all i needed was the right move to stun the nightmare to lock it up for a second so that the exorcism could sweep it away azorthragal i shouted bellowing out the demons name azorthragal azorthragal i stretched out my right hand again concentrating fiercely begone energy rushed out of my body as i completed the spell swept toward the nightmare within lydia like a wave lifting a sleeping seal off a rock and passed over leaving it untouched lydia began to laugh wildly and managed to catch one of michaels hands in hers she gave a twist and bones snapped with sharp pops and crackles michael let out an agonized scream twisting and jerking he knocked the circle of salt askew and lydia escaped him rising to face me such a fool wizard she said i didnt banter i didnt even stand there stunned that my spell had failed so miserably i wound back a hand and threw a punch at her as hard as i could hoping to stun the body the demon was riding in to keep it from reacting the possessed lydia glided from the path of my punch caught my wrist and dumped me onto my back i started to push myself up but she threw herself astride me and slammed my head back against the floor twice i saw stars lydia stretched above me purring and thrusting her hips down against mine i tried to escape during the moment of gloating but my arms and legs just didnt respond she reached down laying both of her hands almost delicately on my throat and murmured such a shame all this time and you didnt even know who it was after you you didnt even know who else wanted revenge i guess sometimes you find out the hard way i slurred sometimes lydia agreed smiling and then her hands closed over my throat and i didnt have any more air sometimes when youre facing death it feels like everything slows down everything stands out sharply in detail almost freezes you can see it all feel it all as though your brain has decided in sheer defiance to seize the last few moments of life and to squeeze them for every bit of living left my brain did that but instead of showing me my trashed apartment and how i really needed a new coat of paint on the ceiling it started frantically shoving puzzle pieces together lydia the shadow demon mavra the torment spells bianca one thing stood out in my mind a piece that didnt fit anywhere susan had been gone for a day or two where i had barely been able to talk to her shed said she was working on something that something was happening it fit somehow somewhere stars swam in my vision and fire started to spread through my lungs i struggled to pry her arms off of me but it was no usepossessed she was simply too strong to deal with susan had been asking me about something some insignificant part of the phone conversation we had between sexual innuendos what had it been i heard myself making a very slight sound something like gaghk aghk i tried to lever lydias weight up and off of me but she simply rolled with me taking my weight onto her and then continuing the motion slamming me to the floor again my vision began to darken though i opened my eyes wide it was like staring down a dark tunnel looking up at lydias bloodfilled eyes i saw michael struggle to his knees his face white as a fresh dusting of snow he moved toward lydia but she turned her head slightly and kicked him lashing out with one heel i heard something else snap as the force of the kick drove michael back murphy had been distracted about something too something shed hurriedly changed subjects on intuition drew a line between them and then an equal sign and then i had it the last piece of the puzzle i knew what had happened where the nightmare had come from why it was after me in particular i knew how to stop it knew what its limits were how bianca had enlisted it and why my spells had been so hardpressed to affect it almost a pity really id figured things out just in time to die vision faded altogether and a moment later so did the pain in my throat instead of drifting off into whatever lay beyond though i sucked in a breath of air choking and gasping my vision became red for a moment as blood rushed back through my head and then started to clear lydia still crouched over me up on her knees straddling mebut shed released my throat instead she had arched her arms up and back over her head to caress thomass naked shoulders the vampire had pressed up against lydias back his mouth nuzzled her throat slow kisses strokes of his tongue that made the girl shudder and quiver his hands roamed slowly over her body always touching skin fingers roaming up beneath the brief lycra top to caress her breasts lydia gasped bloodfilled eyes distant unfocused body responding with a slow sensual grace thomas looked past her through the dark fall of his hair to me his eyes werent bluegrey anymore they were empty white no color to them at all i felt cold coming off of him something i sensed more than felt on my skin a horrible and seductive cold he continued spreading a line of kisses up lydias neck to her ear making her whimper and shake i swallowed and crawled back on my elbows dragging my hips and legs out from beneath the pair of them thomas murmured so softly that i wasnt sure id heard him i dont know how long i can distract her dresden quit gawking and do something ill put on afternoon theater for you later if you want to watch that bad then his mouth covered the girls and she stiffened eyes flying open wide before they languidly closed deepening the kiss i flushed at thomass words which made my head pound painfully i rooted around the floor and recovered the candles still lit and the bag of salt i spread the salt in a circle around lydia and thomas as lydia drew the lycra shorts down and reached back to grasp at thomas to urge him toward her thomas let out a groan of pure anguish and said dresden hurry i settled the candles into place and gathered up whatever power i had left to close the circle and to begin the vortex again if i was right i would free lydia maybe permanently if i was wrong this was the last of my energy and id dump it into the earth for nothing the nightmare would presumably kill usand i didnt think any of us were in shape to do anything about it energy gathered in the circle rising in a growing whirl of invisible tingling power i stretched out my hand and willed more energy into it feeling dizzy the nightmare finally seemed to take notice of what was around it again lydia shivered and leaned a little away from thomas breaking some of the contact between themthen the bloodred eyes snapped open and focused on me lydia began to rise but thomas clutched onto her hard holding her the power rose again a second vortex whirling around the pair of them tugging at spiritual energies within lydia screamed leonid kravos i thundered i repeated the name and saw lydias eyes fly open wide in shock begone kravos you secondrate firecaller begone begone and with the last word i stamped my foot down releasing the power of the exorcism down into the earth lydia screamed her body arching her mouth dropping open wide within the whirling vortex glittering motes of silver and gold light gathered into a funnel centered on lydias gaping mouth scarlet energy flooded out of her screaming mouth and for a moment there was an unnerving overlap of screamsone highpitched young feminine terrified while the other was inhuman otherworldly more scarlet light lashed forth from lydias eyes stolen away by the vortexs power and then with a rush and an implosion of suddenly empty air the vortex swirled into an infinitely thin line and vanished dropping down into the floor lower deep into the earth lydia let out a low exhausted cry and dropped limply to the floor thomas still clutching her tumbled down with her silence fell on the room but for the four of us gasping for breath finally i managed to sit up michael i called my voice hoarse michael are you okay did you stop it he asked is the girl all right i think so thank god he said it kicked me got one of my ribs im not sure i can sit up dont i said and mopped sweat from my brow broken ribs could be bad thomas are youhey what the hell do you think youre doing thomas lay with his arms around lydia his pale naked body pressed against hers his lips nuzzling her ear lydias eyes were open colored naturally again but not focused on anything she didnt look conscious but she was making tiny aroused motions of her body her hips leaning back to him thomas blinked up at me when i spoke eyes still empty and white what he asked shes not unwilling shes probably just grateful to me for my help get away from her i snapped im hungry he said it wont kill her dresden not the first time youd be dead right now without me just let me no i said but no get off of her or you and i are going to have words a snarl split the air between us thomass full lips peeling back from his teeth they looked like human teeth not vampire fangs whiter and more perfect than human teeth but other than that normal i returned his stare coolly thomas looked away first he closed his eyes for a moment and when he opened them again there were pale rings of color in them once more slowly darkening he released lydia and rolled away from her his ribs still looked dented but not as much as before he got to his feet and wrapped the towel around his hips again then stalked back toward the bathroom without another word i checked lydias pulse blushed and tugged her shorts back into place then i righted the couch and put her back onto it beneath the blankets after that i went to michael what was that all about he asked i told him what had happened in terms as pg rated as possible he scowled flicking a glance back toward the bathroom theyre like that the white court seducers they feed on lust fear hatred emotions but they always use lust to seduce their victims they can force them to feel it indulge in sex its how they feed sex vampires i know i muttered still its interesting interesting michael sounded skeptical harry i wouldnt call it interesting why not i said i squinted after thomas thoughtfully whatever he used it worked on the nightmare caught it up that means that its either some kind of ambient magic maybe that cold i felt that works on everything around or else its something chemicallike red court venom something that got to lydias body and bypassed the nightmares control of her mind altogether pheromones maybe harry michael said i really dont mean to discourage your scholarly pursuits but would you mind very much helping me with these broken ribs we took inventory i had some nasty bruises on my throat but nothing more michael had one rib that was definitely broken and one more that might have been cracked tender as it was i got him wrapped up pretty well thomas came out of my room dressed in some of my spare jogging clothes they hung off of him and he had to roll the sleeves and legs of the sweatpants up he slouched into a chair his gaze settling on lydias sleeping form with a rather disconcerting intensity it all fits now i told them i know whats going on so i can finally do something about it im going to go to the town house and get everyone out michael frowned at me what fits it wasnt the demon that crossed over michael we were never fighting the demon it was kravos himself kravos is the nightmare michael blinked at me but we didnt kill kravos hes still alive dollars to donuts he isnt i figure the night before the nightmares attacks started he puts together a ritual and takes himself out why would he do that to come back as a ghost to get revenge think about itthats all the nightmare has been doing its been rampaging around avenging kravos could he do that michael asked i shrugged i dont see why he couldnt if he had raised a bunch of power and if he was focused on getting his vengeance and turning himself into a ghost especially with the border to the nevernever as turbulent as it was michael finished exactly which means that mavra and bianca helped him out specifically hell they probably put together the ritual that he used and if someone in federal custody here in chicago suddenly turned up suicided in his cell it would cause a big stir in local policeand would be serious news for the media which is why murphy was being so hushhush and susan was so distracted she was working on a story finding out what happened following up a rumor maybe thomas frowned let me get this straight this nightmare is the ghost of the sorcerer kravos the cult murderer in the news several months ago yeah the turbulence in the nevernever let him get made into a badass ghost turbulence thomas said i nodded someone began binding the local spooks with torment spells they went wild and started stirring the border between the real world and the nevernever i figure it was mavra working with bianca that same turbulence let kravos hit everyone he could in their dreams its how he got to me and how he got to poor malone and how he got to lydia just now lydia knew what he was doing thats why she never wanted to go to sleep i didnt see it coming when he hit me in my dreams i wasnt ready for a fight and he kicked my ass but now you can defeat him michael asked im ready for him now i beat this punk when he was alive now that i know what im dealing with i can do it to his shade too ill go to the house take out the nightmare bianca if i have to and get everyone out did you get hit on the head when i wasnt looking thomas asked dresden i told you about the guards the machine guns i did mention the machine guns didnt i i waved a hand im already past the point where a sane man would be afraid guards and machine guns whatever look bianca has susan plus justine and maybe twenty or thirty kids being held captive or getting set to get turned into fresh vampires the polices hands are tied on this someone has to do something and im the only one in a position to get riddled with bullets thomas interjected his tone dry my how very helpful that will be toward attaining our mutual goals oh ye of little faith michael said from his place in my easychair he swung his head back toward me go ahead harry what do you have in mind i nodded all right i figure bianca will have security all over the outside of the house shell cover all the approaches to it any cars that go in are going to get searched and so on exactly thomas said dresden i thought maybe we could pool our resources work something out with our contacts and spies perhaps disguise ourselves as caterers and sneak in he paused well you could pass for a caterer in any case but if we simply assault her house well all be killed if we walk up where they can see us thomas frowned you have something else in mind i doubt we could veil ourselves with magic in familiar surroundings shes going to be difficult to fool with those kinds of glamour i lifted an eyebrow at the vampire youre right i had something else in mind i came through the rift between the mortal world and the nevernever last i bore my staff and rod and wore my leather duster my shield bracelet and a copper ring upon my left hand matched by another upon my right the nevernever near my apartment looked like my apartment only a bit cleaner and brighter deep philosophical statement about the spirituality of my little basement maybe shapes moved in the shadows scurrying like rats or gliding over the floor like snakesspiritbeings that fed on the crumbs of energy that spilled over from my place in the real world michael bore amoracchius in his hand its blade glowing with a pearly luminescence as soon as he had picked up the blade his face had regained color and he had moved as though his bandaged ribs no longer pained him he wore denim and flannel and his steeltoed work boots thomas dressed in my castoffs and carrying an aluminum baseball bat from my closet looked about the place amused his dark hair still damp and curling wetly over his shoulders in a sack made of fishnet bobs skull hung from my fist the orange skulllights glowing dimly like candles harry bob asked are you sure about this i mean i dont really want to get caught in the nevernever if i can avoid it a few old misunderstandings you see you arent any more worried about it than i am if my godmother catches me here ive had it take it easy bob i said just guide us through the shortest path to biancas place then i tear a hole back over to our side into her basement we get everyone and get them out again and bring them home there is no shortest path harry bob said this is the spirit world things are linked together by concepts and ideas and dont necessarily adhere to physical distance like i know the basics bob i told him but the bottom line is that you know your way around here a lot better than i do get us there bob sighed all right but i cant guarantee well be in and out before sundown you might not even be able to make a hole through while the suns still up it tends to diffuse magical energies that bob save the lecture for later leave the wizarding to me the skull swung around to michael and thomas excuse me have either of you told harry what a brainless plan this is thomas raised his hand i did it didnt do much good bob rolled his eyelights it never does so help me dresden if you die im going to be very annoyed youll probably roll me under a rock at the last minute and ill be stuck there for ten thousand years until someone finds me dont tempt me less talk more guide si memsahib bob said seriously thomas snickered bob turned his eyelights toward the stairs leading out of the nevernever version of my apartment that way he said we passed out of the apartment and into a sort of vague representation of chicago which looked like a stage setflat building faces with no real substance to them vague light that could have come from sun or moon or streetlights plus a haze of greybrown fog from there bob guided us down a sidewalk then turned into an alley and opened a garage door which led to a stonecarved staircase winding down into the earth we followed his lead into the darkness at times the only light we had was the orange glow of the skulls eyelights bob turned his head in the direction required and we passed through a subterranean region that was mostly blackness and low ceilings eventually rising up a slope that emerged in the center of a ring of standing dolmens atop a long hill stars shone overhead in a fierce blaze and lights danced in the woods at the base of the hill skittering around like manic fireflies i stiffened in my boots bob i said bob you blew it man this is faerie of course it is bob said its the biggest place in the nevernever you cant get to anywhere without crossing through faerie at one place or another well hurry up and cross us out i said we cant stay here believe me i dont want to hang here either either we get the disney version of faerie with elves and tinkerbell pixies and who knows what sugary cuteness or we get the wicked witch version which is considerably more entertaining but less healthy even the summer court isnt all sweetness and light bob shut up which way the skull turned mutely toward what seemed to be the westernmost side of the hill and we descended down it its like a park thomas commented i mean the grass should be over our knees or no maybe like a good golf course harry michael said quietly im getting a bad feeling the skin on my neck started to crawl and i looked back to michael nodding bob which way out bob nodded ahead as we rounded a stand of trees an old colonialstyle covered bridge arched up over a ridiculously deep chasm there bob said thats the border where youre wanting isnt too far past that in the distance came the notes of a hunting horn dark and clearand the baying of hounds run for the bridge i snapped thomas sprinted beside me without apparent effort i glanced at michael who had reversed his grip on the sword and held it pommelfirst the blade laying against his forearm as he ran his face was twisted up in effort and pain but he kept pace harry bob commented if its all the same you might want to run a bit faster theres a hunt coming the horn belled again backed up by the dolmens and the cries of the pack rang out sharp and clear thomas whirled to look running a few paces backward before turning again i could have sworn they were miles away a moment ago its the nevernever i panted distance time its all fucked up here wow bob commented i hadnt realized that they grew hellhounds that big and look harry its your godmother hi lea if bob had a body hed have been jumping up and down and waving his fingers at her dont be so enthusiastic bob if she catches me i get to join the pack bobs eyelights swung toward me and he gulped oh he said theres been a falling out then or a falling further out at any rate since you werent on such great terms to begin with something like that i panted um run bob said run faster you really need to run faster harry my feet flew over the grass thomas reached the bridge first his feet thumping out onto it michael got there a pace later with a broken rib and twenty years on me he still outran me to that damn bridge ive got to work out more made it i shouted taking a last long step toward the bridge the lariat hit me about the throat before my feet had quite touched down and jerked me back through the air with a snap i lay on the ground stunned choking for the second time in two hours uhoh bob said harry whatever you do dont drop me especially under a rock thanks a lot i gasped reaching up to jerk the rope from its constricting hold on my throat heavy hooves sank into the turf on either side of my head i gulped and looked up at a nightblack steed with black and silver tack its hooves were shod with bladed shoes of some silvery metal it wasnt iron or steel there was blood on those shoes as though the horse had trampled some poor trapped thing to death or else sliced it apart my gaze slid on up past the horse to its rider lea rode the beast sidesaddle perfectly relaxed and confident wearing a dress of sable and midnight blue her hair caught back in a loose braid of flame her eyes gleamed in the starlight the other end of the lariat held in one lovely hand the hellhounds crowded around her steed all of them focused on yours truly call it a wild impression of the moment but they looked hungry feeling better are we lea asked with a slow smile thats wonderful we can finally conclude our bargain chapter thirtythree it only takes a couple of these rough little episodes of life to teach a man a certain amount of cynicism once a rogue wizard or three has tried to end your life or some berserk hexenwolves have worked really hard to have your throat torn out you start to expect the worst in fact if the worst doesnt happen you find yourself somewhat disappointed so really it was just as well that godmother had caught up to me in spite of my best efforts to avoid her id hate to find out that the universe really wasnt conspiring against me it would jerk the rug out from under my persecution complex therefore working on the assumption that some sadistic higher power would make sure my evening got as complicated as it possibly could i had formed a plan i jerked the lariat from about my throat and croaked thomas michael now the pair of them produced small cardboard boxes from their pockets palmsized and almost square with a shake michael cast the contents of the first box forward slewing the box left and right like a man scattering seeds thomas followed his lead on the other side of my body so that objects began to rain down atop and nearby me the faerie hounds let out startled yelps and leapt away my godmothers horse let out a scream and pranced back several steps putting distance between us i scrunched up my face and did my best to shield my eyes from the scattering nails they fell over me in a sharptoothed shower prickling as they struck and settled around me godmother had to let out on the rope that had looped about my throat as her horse backed away giving me a bit of slack iron hissed my godmother her lovely face turned livid furious you dare defile the awnsidhe soil with iron the queen will rip your eyes from your skull no thomas said theyre aluminum no iron content thats a lovely horse you have whats its name leas eyes flashed to thomas and then at the nails all over the ground while she did i dipped a hand into my pocket palmed my contingency plan and popped it into my mouth two or three chews and a swallow and i was finished i tried not to let the abrupt surge of terror show not steel lea said she beckoned sharply at the ground and one of the nails leapt up to her hand she gripped it frowning her expression abruptly wary what is the meaning of this its meant to be a distraction godmother i said i coughed and patted my chest i just had to eat something lea laid a hand on her horses neck and the savage beast calmed one of the shadowy hounds nosed forward nudging one of the nails with its snout lea gave the rope a little jerk taking up the slack again and said it will do you no good wizard you cannot escape this rope it is bound to hold you you cannot escape my power not here not in faerie i am too strong for you all true i agreed and got to my feet so lets get cracking turn me into a doggie and show me which trees i can pee on lea stared at me as though id gone mad her expression wary i took hold of the rope and shook it impatiently come on godmother make with the magic already do i get to pick my color i dont think i want to be that charcoal grey maybe you could do a nice sandy pelt for me or oh i know winter white with blue eyes i always wanted blue eyes and be silent lea snarled and shook the rope there was a sharp stinging sensation and my tongue literally stuck to the roof of my mouth i tried to keep talking but it made my throat buzz as though bees were in it angry stinging i kept silent well thomas said id like to see this ive never seen an external transformation before do proceed madame he waved his hand impatiently dog him already this is a trick lea hissed it will avail you naught wizard no matter what hidden powers your friends are preparing to cast at me were not michael put in i swear it on the blood of christ lea sucked in a breath as though the words had brought a sudden chill over her she rode the horse up to me close so that the animals shoulder pressed against mine she reeled in on the braided leather of the lariat as she did until she held it by a length of no more than six inches jerking hard against my throat hauling me almost off balance she leaned down close to me and whispered tell me wizard what are you hiding from me my tongue loosened again and i cleared my throat oh nothing much i just wanted a bite to eat before we left a bite lea murmured then she jerked me over toward her and leaned down close dainty nostrils flaring she inhaled slow the silken mass of her hair brushing against my cheek her mouth almost nuzzling mine i watched her face her expression changing to slow surprise i spoke to her in a quiet voice you recognize the smell yes the whites showed around her emerald eyes as they opened wider destroying angel she whispered you have taken death harry dresden yep i agreed toadstool amanita virosa whatever the amantin toxin is going to show up in my blood in about two minutes after that it will start tearing apart my kidneys and liver a few hours from now ill collapse and if i dont die then then ill apparently recover for a few days while my innards fall apart and then drop into arrest and die i smiled theres no specific antidote for it and i kind of doubt even you could use magic to put me back together again stitching closed a wound is a lot different from major internal transmutation so shall we i started walking in the direction lea had come from you should be able to enjoy tormenting me for a few hours before i start vomiting blood and die she jerked the lariat tight halting me this is a trick she hissed you are lying to me i looked up at her with a lopsided grin now godmother i said you know im a terrible liar do you think i could really lie to you do you not smell it yourself she stared at me her face twisting slowly into an expression of horror merciless winds she breathed you have gone mad not mad i assured her i know precisely what im doing i turned to glance back at the bridge goodbye michael goodbye thomas harry michael said are you sure we shouldnt shhh i said shooting him a look ixnay leas eyes flickered back and forth between us what she demanded what is it i rolled my eyes and gestured at michael well michael said as it happens i have something here that might help something lea demanded what michael reached into the pocket of his jacket and produced a small vial capped at one end its extract of st marys thistle he said they use it in a lot of hospitals in europe for mushroom poisoning theoretically it should do quite a bit to help a poisoning victim survive provided its taken in time of course leas eyes narrowed give it to me now i tsked godmother as your faithful pet and companion i feel i should warn you about how dangerous it is for one of the high sidhe to accept gifts it could bind you to the giver if you dont return a gift in kind leas face slowly flushed scarlet sweeping up from the creamy skin of her collarbones and throat over her chin and cheeks and up into her hair so she said you would drive a bargain with me you would take deadly toadstool to force me to release you i lifted my eyebrows and nodded with a smile essentially yes you see i figure its like this you want me alive im not of any use to you dead and you wont be able to undo the poisoning with magic i own you she snarled you are mine now beg to differ i said im yours for the next couple of days after that im dead and i wont be doing you any more good no she said i will not set you free in exchange for this potion i too can find the thistle maybe i admitted maybe you can even do it in time maybe not either way without a trip to the hospital theres not much chance of me living even with the extract and none at all really if i dont get it soon i will not trade you away you have given yourself to me michael shrugged one shoulder i believe that you wrought a bargain with a foolish young man caught in the heat of the moment but we arent asking you to undo it altogether lea frowned no naturally not thomas said the extract only offers harry a chance at life thats all wed ask from you youd be obliged to let him goand bound for a year and a day to do no harm to him or his freedom so long as he remains in the mortal world thats the deal i said as a faithful pet i should point something out if i die you never get me godmother if you let me go now you can always give it a shot another night it isnt as though you have a limited number of them is it you can afford to be patient lea fell silent staring at me the night fell silent as well we all waited saying nothing the quiet panic i already felt after eating the toadstool danced about my belly making it twitch and jerk why she said finally her voice very quiet pitched only for me why would you do this to yourself harry i dont understand i didnt think you would i said there are people who need me people who are in danger because of me i have to help them you cannot help them if you are dead nor if i am taken by you you would give your own life in place of theirs she asked her tone incredulous yes why because no one else can do this they need me i owe it to them owe them your life lea mused you are mad harry dresden perhaps it comes of your mother i frowned whats that supposed to mean lea shrugged she spoke as you do near the end she lifted her eyes to michael and straightened on the horse a dangerous play you made tonight wizard a bold play you cut the traditions of my people very close to the bone i accept your bargain and then with a casual flick she removed the lariat from me i stumbled back away from her gathered up my fallen staff and rod and bob in his net sack and made my way to the bridge once there michael gave me the vial i unstoppered it and drank the liquid within tasted gritty a little bitter i closed my eyes and took a deep breath after swallowing it down harry michael said watching lea are you sure youll be all right if i get to the hospital soon i said ive got somewhere between six and eighteen hours maybe a little longer i drank all that pink stuff before we left to line my stomach it might slow down the rate of digestion on the mushroom give the extract a chance to beat it to my guts i dont like this michael muttered hey im the one who ate the deadly poison man i dont much care for it myself thomas blinked at me you mean you were telling her the truth i glanced at him nodding yeah look i figure well be in there and out again in an hour tops or else well be dead either way it will happen in plenty of time before the first round of symptoms sets in thomas just stared at me for a moment i thought you were lying he said bluffing i dont bluff if i can help it im not too good at it so you really could die your godmother is right you know you are mad as a hatter nutty as a fruitcake crazy like a fox i said all right bob wake up i shook the skull and its empty eye sockets kindled with orangered lights somehow too far back inside them harry bob said surprised youre alive for a while i said i explained to him how wed gotten me away from my godmother wow bob said youre dying what a great plan i grimaced the hospital should be able to take care of it sure sure in some places the survival rate is as high as fifty percent in the case of amantin poisoning i took extract of milk thistle i said a little defensive bob coughed delicately i hope you got the dosage right or it could do more harm than good now if youd come to me about this to begin with harry michael said sharply look i turned to look at my godmother who had ridden a little way off and sat still upon her dark steed she raised in her hand something dark and gleaming maybe a knife she waved it to the four corners north west south east she said something in a twisting slippery tongue and the trees began to moan as the wind rose washing through them power washed out from the sidhe sorceress from the dark knife in her hand and raised the hairs on my arms the nape of my neck wizard she called to me you have made bargain with me tonight i will not seek you but you have made no such bargain with others she threw back her head in a long loud cry somehow terrifying and beautiful at once it echoed over the rolling land and then was answered more sounds came drifting back highpitched howls whistling shrieks and deep throaty coughing roars many there are who owe me lea sneered i will not be cheated of you you have had the potion you would not have placed your life in such jeopardy without a cure to hand i will raise no hand against youbut they will bring you to me one way or another harry dresden you will be mine this night the wind continued to rise and overhead sudden clouds began to blot out the stars the howls and calls came closer carried on the rising wind shit i said bob we have to get out of here now its still a pretty good walk to the spot you showed me on the map bob said a mile maybe two in subjective terms two miles michael noted clinically i cant run that far not with my ribs like they are and i cant carry you thomas said im amazing and studly but i have limits lets go harry its just me and you my mind raced and i struggled to put together a plan michael couldnt keep up he had managed the sprint before but his face looked a little greyish now and he carried himself stiffly as though in pain i trusted michael i trusted him at my side and at my back i trusted him to be able to take care of himself but alone against a wrathful faerie posse how would he do i couldnt be sureeven with the sword he was still a man he could still lose his life and i didnt want another life on my conscience i glanced over at thomas the handsome vampire managed to wear my castoff clothes and make them look like some kind of fashion statement slouch nouveau he returned my glance with a perfect shining smile and i thought about what he had said about what a good liar he was thomas had sided with me mostly hed been friendly enough he even apparently had every reason to want to help me and work with me to get justine back unless he was lying to me unless she hadnt been taken at all i couldnt trust him the two of you are staying here i said hold the bridge you wont have to do it for long just slow them down make them go around oooo bob said good plan that should make it a real pain for them harry i mean until they kill michael and thomas and come after you but that could take minutes hours even i glanced at the skull and then at michael he shot thomas a look and then nodded to me if theres trouble youll need me to protect you thomas objected i can watch out for myself i told him look this whole plan is based on surprise and speed and quiet i can be quiet better alone if it turns out that fighting has to be done one or two people wouldnt make a difference if we have to fight this whole thing is over thomas grimaced so you want us to stay here and die for you is that it i glared hold the bridge until i can make it out of the nevernever after that they shouldnt have any reason to come after you the wind rose to a howl and shapes began to crest the top of the hill with the dolmens dark things moving swift and close to the ground harry go michael said he took amoracchius into his hands dont worry well keep them off of your back are you sure you wouldnt rather i come with you thomas asked and took a step toward me the shining steel of michaels sword abruptly dropped in front of thomas the sharp edge of it pressing against his belly im sure id rather not leave him alone with you vampire michael said his tone polite do i make myself clear as water thomas said sourly he glanced at me and said youd better not leave her there dresden or get killed i wont i said especially that second part and then the first monstrous thing like a mountain lion made all of shadows bounded past lea and a set of dark talons flashed toward me thomas shoved me out of the way of the strike crying out as the thing tore into his arm michael shouted in latin and his sword flared into argent light cutting the vaguely catlike beast and dropping it into two squirming struggling halves to the floor of the bridge go michael roared god go with you i ran the sounds of fighting died behind me until i could only hear my own laboring breaths the nevernever changed from sculpted faerietale wilderness to dark close forest with cobwebs hanging down across a narrow trail through glowering trees eyes flashed in the shadows things that never quite could be clearly seen and i stumbled on there bob called his orange eyelights swung to shine upon the split trunk of a dead hollow tree open a way there and it will take us through i grunted and came to a halt gasping are you sure yes yes bob said hurry some of the awnsidhe will be here at any moment i cast a fearful glance behind me and then started gathering in my will it hurt to do i felt so weak the poison in my belly hadnt started tearing my body apart yet but i almost thought that i could feel it stirring moving licking its chops and eyeing my organs with malevolent glee i shoved all of that out of my thoughts and forced myself to breathe steadily to gather in my strength and reach out to part the curtain between worlds uh harry bob said suddenly wait a minute behind me something broke a branch there was a swift rushing sound of something moving toward me i ignored it and reached out a hand sinking my fingers into the friable border substance of the nevernever harry bob said i really think you should hear this not now i muttered the rushing noise grew closer the rattle of undergrowth shunted aside by something large behind me a warbling bellow shook the ground holy brillig and slithy toves batman aparturum i shouted thrusting out with my will and opening a way the rent in reality shone with dim light i threw myself forward into it willing the way closed behind me something snagged at one corner of my leather duster but with a jerk i was free of it and through i tumbled forward onto the floor the smell of autumn air and damp stone all around me my heart thudded painfully with the effort of both the running and the spell i lifted my head to look around me and get my bearings bob had been good to his word he had brought me out of the nevernever right into biancas mansion i found myself on the floor at the head of a staircase down away from the front doors and the main hall i also found myself surrounded by a ring of vampires all of them in their inhuman forms the flesh masks gone there had to be a dozen of them there dark eyes glittering their noses snuffling drool spattering out and dripping from their bared fangs to the floor while their talons clawed at the air or ran lightly over their flabby black bodies some of them showed burns on their rubbery hide patches of shrunken wrinkled scarlike tissue i didnt move anything i sensed would have set them off any motion any move to flee or fight or escape would have ignited a frenzy with myself on the receiving end while i watched frozen bianca came up the stairs dressed in a white silk nightgown that whispered around her shapely calves she carried a single candle that bathed her in soft radiance she smiled at me very slowly very sweetly and the bottom dropped out of my stomach well she purred harry dresden such a pleasant surprise to have you visit i tried to tell you bob said his voice miserable the curtain felt weak there like someone had just gone through it like they had been watching this side of course bianca murmured a guard for every door did you think me a fool mister dresden i glowered at her despairing there wasnt anything i could say i saved my breath and began to draw in my will to throw everything i had left into taking that smug smile off of her pretty false face dears bianca purred watching me bring him down they hit me so fast that i never saw them move there simply came a hideous rushing force i have memories of being passed from claw to claw thrown carried into the air toyed with snuffling squashed snouts and staring black eyes and hissing terrible laughter i was driven down carried tossed about everything torn from me bob disappearing without a sound they pressed me down while i struggled and screamed all useless my mind too full of terror to focus to defend myself and there in the dark they tore my clothes from me i felt bianca press her naked flesh to me a heated sinuous dreambody that unraveled into a nightmare i felt the skin split and burst apart around her true form the sweetness of her perfume gave way to a rottenfruit reek her purring voice became a whining hiss and their tongues soft intimate warm moist pleasure that struck me like hammers while i tried to scream against it chemical pleasure animal sensation heartless and cold uncaring of my horror revulsion despair darkness horrible thick sensual darkness then pain then nothing chapter thirtyfour i have very few memories of my father i was about six years old when he died what i do remember is a careworn slightly stoopshouldered man with kind eyes and strong hands he was a magiciannot a wizard a stage magician a good one he never made it big though he spent too much time performing for childrens hospitals and orphanages to pull down much money he and i and his little show roamed around the country the memories of the first several years of my life are of my bed in the backseat of the station wagon going to sleep to the whisper of asphalt beneath the tires secure in the knowledge that my father was awake driving the car and there to take care of me the nightmares hadnt started until just before his death i dont remember them specificallybut i remember waking up screaming in a childs highpitched shriek of terror id scream in the darkness scrambling to squeeze into the smallest space i could find my father would come looking for me and find me and pull me into his lap he would hold me and make me warm and soon i would fall asleep again safe secure the monsters cant get you here harry he used to say they cant get you hed been right until now until tonight the monsters got me i dont know where real life left off and the nightmares began but i thrashed myself awake screaming a scratchy hollow scream that made little more noise than a whimper i screamed until i ran out of breath and then all i could do was sob i lay there naked undone no one came to hold me no one came to make it all better no one had really since my dad died breathing first then i forced myself to control it to stop the wracking sobs and to draw in slow steady breaths next came the terror the pain humiliation more than anything i wanted to crawl into a hole and pull it in after me i wanted to be not but i wasnt not i hurt too much i was very painfully very acutely very much alive the burn still hurt the most but the sweeping nausea running through me came in a photo finish second my hands told me that i was lying upon a floor but the rest of me thought i had been strapped into a giant gyroscope i ached my throat felt tight and burned as though seared by some hot liquid or chemical i didnt want to dwell too long on that i tested my limbs and found them all present and functional my belly twisted and roiled and for a moment locked up tight jerking me into a tight curl around it the sweat on my naked body went cold the mushroom the poison six to eighteen hours maybe a little more i felt thick dry mouthed fuzzy with the same aftereffects of the vampire venom that id felt before for a minute i stopped fighting i just lay there weak and thirsty and hurting and sick curled up into a ball i would have started crying again if id had that much feeling left in me i would have wept and waited to die instead some merciless steady voice in my head drove me to open my eyes i hesitated afraid i didnt want to open my eyes and see nothing i didnt want to find myself in that same darkness that darkness with hissing things all around me maybe there still just waiting for me to awaken so that they panic swept me for a moment and gave me enough strength to shiver and push myself up into a sitting position i took a deep breath and opened my eyes i could see light seared at my eyes a thin line of it surrounding a tall rectanglea doorway i had to squint for a moment so used were my eyes to the darkness i looked around the room wary it wasnt big maybe twelve by twelve or a little more i lay in a corner the smell was violently rotten my jailors apparently had no problems with letting me lie in my own filth some of it had crusted onto me onto my legs and arms vomit i guessed there was blood in it an early symptom of the mushroom poisoning there were other shapes in the dimness a lump of cloth in one corner like a pile of dirty laundry several laundry baskets as well a washer and dryer on the far wall from the door and justine dressed in as little as i curled up and sitting with her back to the wall her arms wrapped loosely around her drawnup knees watching me with dark feverish eyes youre awake justine said i didnt think youd ever wake up gone was the glamorous girl id seen at the ball her hair hung lank and greasy her pale body looked lean almost gaunt and her limbs what i could see of them were stained and dirty as was her face her eyes disturbed me there was something feral in them something unsettling i didnt look at her for too long even as bad off as i was i had enough presence of mind to not want to look into her eyes im not crazy she said her voice sharp edged i know what youre thinking i had to cough before i could talk and it made pains shoot through my belly again that wasnt what i was thinking of course it wasnt the girl snarled she rose all lean grace and tension and stalked toward me i know what you were thinking that theyd shut you in here with that stupid little whore no i said i that isnt what she hissed like a cat and raked her nails across my face scoring my cheek in three lines of fire i cried out and fell back the wall interrupting my retreat i can always tell when im like this justine said she gave me an abruptly careless look turned on the balls of her feet and walked several feet away before stretching and dropping to all fours watching me with an absent disinterested gaze i stared at her for a moment feeling the heat of the blood welling in the scratches i touched a finger to them and it came away sprinkled with scarlet i lifted my gaze to the girl and shook my head im sorry i said god what did they do to you this she said carelessly thrusting out one hand round bruised punctures marked her wrist and this she held out the other wrist showing another set of marks and this she stretched out her thigh to one side of her body parallel to the floor to show more marks along it they all wanted a little taste so they got it i dont understand i said she smiled with too many teeth and it made me uneasy they didnt do anything im like this this is the way i always am um i said you werent that way last night last night she snapped two nights ago at least that was because he was there thomas her lower lip abruptly trembled and she looked as though she might cry yes yes thomas he makes it quieter inside me theres so much trying to get out like at the hospital control they said i dont have the kind of control other people have its hormones but the drugs only made me sick he doesnt though only a little tired but her face darkened again shut up she snapped but but but idiot asking idiot questions fool who did not want me when i was willing to give nothing does that none of them because they all want to take take take i nodded and didnt say anything as she became more agitated it might have been politically incorrect of me but the word loony all but appeared in a giant neon sign over justines head okay i said just lets just take it easy all right she glowered at me falling silent then she slunk back to the space between the wall and the washing machine and sank into it she started playing with her hair and took no apparent notice of me i got up it was hard everything spun around on the floor i found a dusty towel i used it to sweep some of the grime off of my skin i went to the door and tried it it stood firmly locked i tested my weight against it but the effort made a sudden fire of scarlet flash through my belly and i dropped to the floor convulsing again i threw up in the middle of it and tasted blood in my mouth i lay exhausted for a while after that and might have dropped off to sleep again i looked up to find justine holding the towel and pushing it fitfully at my skin the fresh mess how long i managed to ask her how long have i been here she shrugged without looking up they had you for a while just outside this door i heard them taking you playing with you for two hours maybe and then they put you in here i slept i woke maybe another ten hours or less or more i dont know i kept an arm wrapped around my belly grimacing and nodded all right i said we have to get out of here she brayed out a sharp laugh there is no out of here this is the larder the christmas turkey doesnt get up and walk away i shook my head i i was poisoned if i dont get to a hospital im going to die she smiled again and played with her hair dropping the towel almost everyone dies in a hospital youd get to be someplace different isnt that better its one of those things i could live without i said justines expression went slack her eyes distant and she became still i stared at her waved my hand in front of her eyes snapped my fingers she didnt respond i sighed and stood up then tested the door again it was firmly bolted shut from the other side i couldnt move it super i sighed thats great im never going to get out of here behind me something whispered i spun putting the door at my back searching for the source of the sound a low mist crept out of the wall a smoky slithery mass that whirled itself down onto the floor like ethereal lace the mist touched lightly at my blood on the floor where id thrown up and then began to swirl and shape itself into something vaguely human great i muttered more ghosts if i get out of this alive ive got to get a new job the ghost took shape before me very slowly very translucently it resolved itself into the form of a young woman attractive dressed like an efficient secretary her hair was pulled up into a bun but for a few appealing tendrils that fell down to frame her cheeks her ghostly wrist was crusted with congealed blood spread around a pair of fangpunctures abruptly i recognized her the girl bianca had fed upon until she died rachel i whispered rachel is that you as i spoke her name she turned to me her eyes slowly focusing on me as though beholding me through a misty veil her expression turned no pun intended grave she nodded to me in recognition hells bells i whispered no wonder bianca got stuck on a vengeance kick she literally was haunted by your death the spirits face twisted in distress she said something but i could hear it only as a distant muffled sound accompanying the movement of her lips i cant understand you i said rachel i cant hear you she almost wept it seemed she pressed her hand to her ghostly breast and grimaced at me youre hurt i guessed you hurt she shook her head then touched her temple and drew her fingers slowly down over her eyes closing them ah i said youre tired she nodded she made a supplicating motion holding out her hands as though asking for help i dont know what i can do for you i dont know if i can help you rest or not she shook her head again then she nodded toward the door and made a bottleshaped curving gesture of her hands bianca i asked when she nodded i went on you think bianca can lay you to rest she shook her head shes keeping you here rachel nodded her ghostly pretty face agonized makes sense i muttered bianca fixates on you as you die tragically binds your ghost here the ghost appears to her and drives her into a vengeance and she blames it all on me rachels ghost nodded i didnt kill you i said you know that she nodded again but im sorry im sorry that me being in the wrong place at the wrong time set you up to die she gave me a gentle smilewhich transformed into a sudden expression of horror she looked past me at justine and then her image began to fade to withdraw into the wall hey i said hey wait a minute the mist vanished and justine started to move she rose casually and stretched then glanced down at herself and ran her hands appreciatively down over her breasts her stomach very nice she said voice subtly altered different rather like lydia in a lot of ways isnt she mister dresden i tensed up kravos i whispered justines eyes flooded with blood through the whites oh yes she said yes indeed man you need to get a life in the worst way that was you wasnt it the telephone call the night agatha hagglethorn went nuts my last call kravos said through justines ups nodding i wanted to savor what was about to happen like now bianca has ordered that you should receive no visitors but i just couldnt resist the chance to take a look at you you want to look at me i asked i tapped my head come on in theres a few things in here id like to show you justine smiled and shook her head it would be too much effort for too little return even without the shelter of a threshold possessing even a mind so weak as this childs requires a considerable amount of effort effort she added which was made possible by a grant from the harry dresden soul foundation i bared my teeth leave the girl alone oh but shes fine kravos said through justines lips shes really happier like this she cant hurt anyone you see or herself her ranting emotions cant compel her to act thats why the whites love her so much they feed on emotion and this little darling is positively mad with it justines body shivered and arched sensuously its rather exciting actually madness i wouldnt know i said look if were going to fight lets fight otherwise blow ive got things to do i know justine said youre busy dying of some kind of poisoning the vampires tried to drink from you but you made some of them very sick and so they left you more or less untapped highly miffed bianca was she wanted you to die as food for her and her new children what a shame come now dresden you and i are among the wise we both know you wouldnt want to die at the hands of a lesser being i might rank among the wise i said you kravos are nothing but a twobit troublemaker youre the stupid thug of wizard land and that you managed to live as long as you did without killing yourself is some kind of miracle in itself justine snarled and lunged for me she pinned me to the door with one hand and a casual supernatural strength that told me she could have pushed her hand through me just as easily so selfrighteous she snarled always sure that youre right that youre in command that you have all the power and all the answers i grimaced pain flared through my belly again and it was suddenly all i could do not to scream well dresden youre dead youve been slated to die youll be gone in the next few hours and even if you arent if you live through what they have planned the poison will kill you slowly and before you go youll sleep bianca wont stop me this time youll sleep and ill be there ill come into your dreams and i will make your last moments on earth a nightmare that lasts for years she leaned up close standing on tiptoe and spat into my face then the blood rushed from justines eyes and her head fell loosely forward as though shed been a horse struggling against the reins to find their pressure gone justine let out a whimper and sank against me i did my best to hold her we sort of wound up on the floor together neither one of us in much shape to move justine wept she cried piteously like a small child mostly quiet im sorry she said im sorry i want to help but theres too much in the way i cant think shhhhh i said i tried to stroke her hair to soothe her before she could become agitated again its going to be all right well die she whispered ill never see him again she wept for some time as the nausea and pain in my belly grew the light outside the door never wavered i didnt know if it was dark or light outside or if thomas and michael were still alive to come after me if they were gone and it was my fault id never be able to live with myself in any case i decided that it must be night it must be fullest darkest night no other time of day could possibly suit my predicament i rested my head on justines after she fell quiet and relaxed as though she were falling asleep after her weeping i closed my eyes and struggled to come up with a plan but i didnt have anything nothing it was all but over something stirred in the shadows where the laundry was piled both of us looked up i started to push justine away but she said dont dont go over there why not i asked you wont like it i glanced at the girl and then got up unsteadily and made my way over to the piled laundry i clutched the towel in my hand for lack of any other weapon someone lay in the piled clothing someone in a white shirt a dark skirt and a red cloak stars above i swore susan she groaned faintly as though very much asleep or drugged i hunkered down and moved clothing off of her hells bells susan dont try to sit up dont move let me see if youre hurt okay i ran my hands over her in the dimness she seemed to be whole not bleeding but her skin was blazing with fever im dizzy thirsty she said youve got a fever can you roll over here toward me the light it hurts my eyes it did mine too when i woke up it will pass dont justine whispered she sat on her heels and rocked slowly back and forth you wont like it you wont like it i glanced back at justine as susan turned toward me and then looked down at my girlfriend she looked back up to me her features exhausted confused she blinked her eyes against the light and lifted a slim brown hand to shield her face i caught her hand halfway and stared down at her her eyes were black all black black and staring glittering darker than pitch with no white to them at all to distinguish them as human my heart leapt up into my throat and things began to spin faster around me you wont like it justine intoned they changed her the red court changed her bianca changed her dresden susan whispered dear god i thought this cant be happening mister dresden im so thirsty chapter thirtyfive susan let out a whimper and a groan moving fitfully by chance her mouth brushed against my forearm still stained with drying blood she froze completely her whole body shuddering she looked up at me with those dark huge eyes her face twisting with need she moved toward my arm again and i jerked it back from her mouth susan i said wait what was that she whispered that was good she shivered again and rolled to all fours eyes slowly focusing on me i shot a glance toward justine but only saw her feet as she pulled them back to her slipping back into the tiny space between the washing machine and the wall i turned back to susan who was coming toward me staring as though blind on all fours i backed away from her and fumbled out to my side with one hand i found the bloodstained towel id been using before and threw it at her she stopped for a moment staring and then lowered her face with a groan beginning to lick at the towel i scooted back on all fours getting away from her still dizzy justine i hissed what do we do theres nothing to do justine whispered we cant get out she isnt herself once she kills shell be gone i flashed a glance at her over my shoulder once she kills what do you mean justine watched me with solemn eyes once she kills shes different but she isnt quite like them until its complete until shes killed someone feeding on them thats the way the reds work so shes still susan justine shrugged again her expression disinterested sort of if i could talk to her though get through to her we could maybe snap her out of it ive never heard of it happening justine said she shivered they stay like that it gets worse and worse then they lose control and kill and its over i bit my lip theres got to be something kill her shes still weak maybe we could together if we wait until shes further gone until the hunger gives her strength shell take us both thats why were in here no i said i cant hurt her something flickered in justines face when i spoke though i couldnt decide whether it was something warm or something heated angry she closed her eyes and said then maybe when she drinks you shell die of the poison in you dammit theres got to be something something else you can tell me justine shrugged and shook her head wearily were already dead mister dresden i clenched my teeth together and turned back to susan she kept licking at the towel making frustrated whimpering noises she lifted her face to me and stared at me i could have sworn i saw the bones of her cheeks and jaw stand out more harshly against her skin her eyes became drowning deep and pulled at me beckoned to me to look deeper into that spinning feverish darkness i jerked my eyes away before that gaze could trap me my heart pounding but it had already begun to fall away susan furrowed her brow in confusion for a moment blinking her eyes whatever dark power that had touched them fading slipping unsteadily but even if that gaze hadnt trapped me hadnt gone all the way over into hypnosis it made something occur to me susans memories of the soulgaze hadnt been removed my godmother couldnt have touched those i was such an idiot when a mortal looks on something with the sight really looks as a wizard may the memories of what he sees are indelibly imprinted on him and when a wizard looks into a persons eyes its just another way of using the sight a twoway use of it because the person you look at gets to peer back at you too susan and i had soulgazed more than two years before shed tricked me into it it was just after that she began pursuing me for stories more closely lea couldnt have taken memories around a soulgaze but she could have covered them up somehow misted them over no practical difference for the average person but hell im a wizard i aint average susan and i had always been close since wed started dating intimate time together the sharing of words ideas time bodies and that kind of intimacy creates a bond a bond that i could perhaps use to uncover fogged memories to help bring susan back to herself susan i said forcing my voice out sharp and clear susan rodriguez she shivered as i named her at least in part i licked my lips and moved towards her susan i want to help you all right i want to help you if i can she swallowed another whimper but im so thirsty i cant i reached out as i approached her and plucked a hair from her head she didnt react to it though she leaned closer to me inhaling through her nose letting out a slow moan on the exhale she could smell my blood i wasnt clear on how much of the toxin would be in my bloodstream but i didnt want her to be hurt no time to dawdle harry i took the hair and wound it about my right hand it went around twice i closed my fist over it then grimaced reaching out to grab susans left hand i spat on my fingers and smoothed them over her palm then pressed her hand to my fist the bond already something tenuously felt in any case thrummed to life like a bass cello string amplified by my spit upon her by the hair in my own hands the joining of our bodies where our flesh pressed together i closed my eyes it hurt to try to draw in the magic my weakened body shook i reached for it tried to piece together my will i thought of all the times id had with susan all the things id never had the guts to tell her i thought of her laugh her smile the way her mouth felt on mine the smell of her shampoo in the shower the press of her warmth against my back as we slept i summoned up every memory i had of us together and started trying to push it through the link between us the memories flowed down my arm to her handand stopped pressing against some misty and elastic barrier godmothers spell i shoved harder at it but its resistance only grew greater more intense the harder i pushed susan whimpered the sound lost confused hungry she rose up onto her knees and pressed against me leaning on me she snuggled her mouth down against the hollow of my throat i felt her tongue touch my skin sending an electric jolt of lust flashing through me even close to death hormones will out i guess i kept struggling against godmothers spell but it held in place powerful subtle i felt like a child shoving fruitlessly at a heavy glass door susan shivered and kept licking at my throat my skin tingled pleasantly and then started to go numb some of my pain faded then i felt her teeth against my throat sharp as she bit at me i let out a startled cry it wasnt a hard bite shed bitten me harder than that for fun but she hadnt had eyes like that then her kisses hadnt made my skin go narcoticnumb then she hadnt been halfway to membership in club vampire then i pushed harder at the spell but my best efforts grew weaker and weaker susan bit harder and i felt her body tensing growing stronger no longer did she lean against me i felt one of her hands settle on the back of my neck it wasnt an affectionate gesture it was to keep me from moving she took a deep shuddering breath in here she whispered its in here its good susan i said keeping the feeble pressure on my godmothers spell susan please dont dont go i need you here you could hurt yourself please i felt her jaws begin to close her teeth didnt feel like fangs but human teeth can rip open skin just fine she was vanishing i could feel the link between us fading growing weaker and weaker im so sorry i never meant to let you down i said i sagged against her there wasnt much reason to keep fighting but i did anyway for her if not for me i held onto that link to the pressure i had forced against the spell to the memories of susan and me together i love you why it worked right then why the webbing of my godmothers spell frayed as though the words had been an open flame i dont know i havent found any explanation for it there arent any magical words really the words just hold the magic they give it a shape and a form they make it useful describe the images within ill say this though some words have a power that has nothing to do with supernatural forces they resound in the heart and mind they live long after the sounds of them have died away they echo in the heart and the soul they have power and that power is very real those three words are good ones i flooded into her through the link into the darkness and the confusion that bound her and i saw through her thoughts that my coming was a flame in the endless cold a beacon flashing out against that night the light came our memories the warmth of us she and i and battered down the walls inside her crushed away leas lingering spell tore those memories away from my godmother wherever she was and brought them back home i heard her cry out at the sudden flush of memory as awareness washed over her she changed right there against methe hard alien tension changed it didnt vanish but it changed it became susans tension susans confusion susans pain aware alert and very much herself again the power of the spell faded away leaving only the blurred impression of it like lightning that crackles through the night leaving dazzling colors in the darkness behind i found myself kneeling against her holding her hand she still held my head her teeth still pressed against my throat sharp and hard i reached up with my other shaking hand and stroked at her hair susan i said gentle susan stay with me the pressure lessened i felt hot tears fall against my shoulder harry she whispered oh god im so thirsty i want it so much i closed my eyes i know i said im sorry i could take you i could take it she whispered yes you couldnt stop me youre weak sick i couldnt stop you i agreed say it again i frowned what say it again it helps please its so hard not to i swallowed i love you i said she jerked as though id punched her in the pit of the stomach i love you i said again susan she lifted her mouth from my skin and looked up into my eyes they were her eyes againdark rich warm brown bloodshot filled with tears the vampires she said they i know she closed her eyes more tears falling i trtried to stop them i tried pain hit me again pain that didnt have anything to do with poison or injuries it hit me sharp and low just beneath my heart as though someone had just shoved an icicle through me i know you did i told her i know you did she fell against me weeping i held her after a long time she whispered its still there it isnt going away i know what am i going to do well work on that i said i promise we have other problems right now i filled her in on what had happened holding her in the dimness is anyone coming for us she asked i i dont think so even if thomas and michael got away they couldnt storm this place if they ever even got out of the nevernever michael could go to murphy but she couldnt just smash her way in here without a warrant and biancas contacts could probably stall that for a while we have to get you out of here she said youve got to get to a hospital works in theory now we just have to work out the details she licked her lips i can you even walk i dont know that last spell if there was much left in me that spell took it out what if you slept she asked kravos would have his chance to torture me i paused and stared at the far wall god susan whispered she hugged me gently i love you harry you should get to hear itt she stopped and looked up at me what thats it i said thats what needs to happen what needs to happen i dont understand the more i thought about it the crazier it sounded but it might work if i could time it just right i looked down taking susans shoulders in my hands staring at her eyes can you hold on can you keep it together for another few hours she shivered i think so ill try good i said i took a deep breath because i need to be asleep long enough to start dreaming but kravos susan said kravos will get inside of you hell kill you yeah i said i took a slow breath im pretty much counting on it chapter thirtysix my nightmares came quickly dull cloud of poisonous confusion blurring my senses distorting my perceptions for a moment i was hanging by one wrist over an inferno of fire smoke and horrible creatures the steel of the handcuffs suspending me cutting into my flesh drawing blood smoke smothered me forced me to cough and my vision blurred as i started to fade out then i was in a new place in the dark cold stone chilled me where i lay upon it all around me where the whispers of things moving in the shadows scaly rasps soft hungry hisses together with the gleam of malevolent eyes my heart pounded in my throat there you are whispered one of the voices i watched them have you you know i sat up shivering violently yeah well thats why they call them monsters its what they do they enjoyed it came the whispering voice if only i could have videotaped it for you tv will rot your brain kravos i said something blurred out of the darkness and struck me across the face the blow drove me back and down my vision blurred over with scarlet and my perceptions sharpened through a burst of pain but i didnt drop unconscious you dont as a rule in dreams jokes the voice hissed jokes will not save you now hells bells kravos i muttered sitting up again do they produce a cliche lines textbook for villains or something go for broke tell me that since youre going to kill me anyway you might as well reveal your secret plan the dark blurred toward me again i didnt bother trying to defend myself it drove me to the ground and sat on my chest i stared up at kravos forms and shapes hung about him like misty clothes i could see the shape of the shadow demon around him i could see my own face drifting among the layers i saw justine there and lydia and there at the center of that distorted drifting mass i saw kravos he didnt look much different he had a thin pinched face and brown hair faded with grey he wore a full untrimmed beard but it only made his head seem misshapen he had wide leathery shoulders and symbols painted in blood ritual things whose meanings i could vaguely piece together covered his chest he lifted his hands and delivered two more blows to my face explosions of pain where are your gibes now wizard kravos snarled where are your jokes weak petty selfrighteous fool we are going to have a very good time together until bianca comes to finish you you think so i asked im not sure its our first date maybe we should take this one step at a time kravos hit me again across the bridge of my nose and my vision blurred with tears you arent funny he shouted you are going to die you cant treat this as a joke why not i shot back kravos i took you out with a piece of chalk and a ken doll youre the biggest joke of a spellslinger ive ever seen even i didnt expect you to drop like that maybe the link with that doll worked so well because it was anatomically corr i didnt get the chance to finish the sentence kravos screamed and took my dream self by the throat it felt real it felt completely as though he had me his weight pinning my weakened body down his fingers crushing into my windpipe my head pounded i struggled against him futile and reflexive motionsbut to no avail he kept on choking me the pressure increasing blackness covered my dream vision and i knew that he would hold it until he was sure i was dead people who have neardeath experiences often talk about moving toward the light at the end of the tunnel or ascending toward the light or flying or floating or falling i didnt get that im not sure what that says about the state of my soul there was no light no kindly beckoning voice no lake of fire to fall into there was only silence deep and timeless where not even the beating of my heart thudded in my ears i felt an odd pressure against my skin my face as though i had pressed into and through a wall of plastic wrap i felt a dull thud on top of my chest and a sudden lessening of the burning in my lungs then another thud more easing on my lungs then more blows to my chest my heart lurched back into motion with a hesitant thunder and i felt myself take a wheezing breath the plasticwrap sensation tugged at me for a moment then lifted away i shuddered and struggled to open my eyes again when i did kravos still holding my throat blinked his eyes in shock no he snarled youre dead youre dead susans giving his real body cpr someone said behind him kravos whipped his head around to look just in time to catch a stiff cross to the tip of his chin he cried out in startled fear and fell off of me i sucked in another labored breath and sat up hells bells i gasped it worked kravos struggled to his feet and backed away staring his eyes flying open wide as they looked back and forth between me and my savior my savior was me too or rather something that looked a very great deal like me it was my shape and coloring and had bruises and scratches mixed with a few burns all over it its hair was a wild mess its eyes sunken over circles of black in a pale sickly face my double peered at me and said you know we really look like hell whats this hissed kravos what trick is this i offered myself a hand up so i took it it took me a moment to balance but i said hell kravos as flexible as the boundaries between here and the spirit world have been i would have expected you to figure it out by now kravos looked at the two of us and bared his teeth your ghost he hissed technically my ghost said harry actually died for a minute dont you remember how ghosts are made normally there wouldnt be enough latent energy to create an impression like me but with him being a wizarda real wizard not a petty fake like youand with the border to the nevernever in such a state of flux it was pretty much inevitable that was very well said i told my ghost just be glad your theory worked i wouldnt be very good at this solo well thank kravos here it was him and bianca and mavra who stirred things up enough to make this possible we looked at kravos you arent getting to sneak attack me while im doped unconscious bub it isnt going to be like last time any questions kravos hurled himself at me in a fury he overpowered me and bore down on me far too strong for me to overcome directly i thrust a thumb into his eye he screamed and bit at my hand and then my ghost came in he wrapped his arms around kravoss neck and leaned back hard tugging the mans body into a bow kravos strained and struggled his arms flailing strong as any maddened beast my ghost was a little stronger than i but he wouldnt be able to hold kravos for long harry my ghost shouted now i gripped kravos by the throat letting all the frustration and fury inside well up i held up my left hand and my dream selfs nails lengthened into glittering claws kravos stared at me in shock you think youre the only one who can play in dreams kravos if id been ready for you the last time youd have never been able to do to me what you did my face twisted mouth extending into a muzzle this time im ready youre in my dream now and im taking back whats mine i tore into his guts i ripped him open with my claws and wolfed into his vitals just as he had to me bits of him flew free dreamblood splashing dreamvitals steaming i tore and worried and gulped down bloody meat he screamed and fought but he couldnt get away i tore him to pieces and devoured him the blood a hot sweet rush on my tongue his ghostflesh hot and good easing the ache of emptiness inside of me i ate him all up as i did i felt power surety confidence all rushing back into me my stolen magic came raging back into me filling me like silver lightning a tingling almost painful rush as i took back what was mine but i didnt stop there my ghost fell away as i kept going kept tearing kravos apart and gulping down the pieces i got to his own power when i ate his heartred livid power vital and primitive and dangerous kravoss magic had been for nothing but causing harm i took it i had plenty of harm to start causing by the time id finished tearing him to shreds the pieces were vanishing like the remnants of any foul dream i crouched on the dreamfloor as they did shaking with the rushing energy inside of me i felt a hand on my shoulder and looked up i must have looked feral my ghost took a step back and lifted both hands easy easy he said i think you got him i got him i said quietly he was a ghost my ghost said he wasnt really a person any more and even as ghosts go he was a bad egg you dont have anything to regret easy for you to say i said you dont have to live with me true my ghost answered he glanced down at himself his bruised limbs grew slowly translucent and he began vanishing thats the only bad thing about this gig as a ghost once you accomplish whatever it was that caused you to get created youre done kravosthe real kravosis already gone just his shell stayed behind and this would have happened to him too if hed killed you do unto others before they do unto you i said thanks it was your plan my ghost said i feel like hell anyway i know i guess you do try not to get killed again okay working on it he waved one hand and faded away i blinked open my eyes susan knelt over me striking my face with her hand i felt wretchedbut that wasnt all my body almost buzzed with the energy i held my skin tingling as though i hadnt used a whit of magic in weeks she struck me twice more before i let out a strangled groan and lifted a hand to intercept hers harry she demanded harry are you awake i blinked my eyes yeah i said yeah im up kravos she hissed i pushed his buttons and he lost control he got me i said then i got him you did it just right susan sat back on her heels trembling god when you stopped breathing i almost screamed if you hadnt told me to expect it i dont know what i would have done you did fine i said i rolled over and pushed myself to my feet though my body groaned in protest the pain felt like something happening very far away to someone else it wasnt relevant to me the energy coursing through methat was relevant i had to release some of it soon or id explode susan started to help me and then sat back staring at me harry what happened i got something back i said its a high i still hurt but that doesnt seem to be important i stretched my arms out over my head then i stalked over to the dirty laundry and found a pair of boxers that fit me more or less i gave susan a selfconscious glance and slipped into them get something on justine and were out of here i tried she wont come out from behind the washing machine i clenched my jaw irritated and snapped my fingers while saying ventas servitas there was an abrupt surge of moving air and justine came tumbling out from behind the washing machine with a yelp she lay there for a moment naked and stunned staring up at me with wide dark eyes justine i said were leaving i dont care how crazy you are youre coming with me leaving justine stammered susan helped her sit up and wrapped the red cloak around her shoulders it fell to midthigh on the girl who rose trembling like a deer before headlights but were going to die were i said past tense i turned back to the door and reached into all that energy glittering through me pointed my finger and shouted ventas servitas with another roar of wind the door exploded outwards into a large empty room splinters flying everywhere and shattering one of the two lightbulbs illuminating the room beyond i said voice crackling with tension and anger get behind me both of you dont get in front of me unless you want to get hurt i took a step toward the doorway an arm shot around the edge of the door followed swiftly by kyle hamiltons body in its masquerade costume his flesh mask back in place he got me by the throat whirling me in a half circle to slam me against the wall harry susan shouted got you kyle purred pinning me in place with supernatural force behind him kelly followed him in her oncepretty face twisting and bulging beneath her flesh mask as though she could barely contain the creature inside her her face was warped twisted distorted as though whatever was beneath it had been so horribly mangled that not even a vampires powers of masquerade could wholly conceal its hideousness come along sister kyle said tainted or not we shall tear open his heart and see what a wizards blood tastes like chapter thirtyseven fury surged through me before fear or anxiety a fury so scarlet and bright that i could scarcely believe it was mine maybe it wasnt after all you are what you eateven if youre a wizard let go kyle i grated youve got one chance to live through this walk away right now kyle laughed letting his fangs extend no more bluffs wizard he purred no more illusions take him sister kelly came at me in a rush but i had been waiting for that i lifted my right hand and snarled ventas servitas a furious column of wind slammed into her like a bag of sand catching her in midair and driving her across the room into the wall kyle screamed in fury drawing his hand back off of my throat and then driving it at me i dodged the first blow by jerking my head to one side and heard his hand crunch into the stone the dodge cost me my balance and as i teetered he lashed out again aiming for my neck all i could do was watch it come and then susan came between us i didnt see her move toward us but i saw her catch the blow in both of her hands she spun twisting her hips and body and shoulders letting out a furious scream she threw kyle across the room in the air the whole way and with no noticeable trajectory he slammed into his sister driving them both into the wall once more i heard kelly scream incoherent and bestial the black slimecovered batthing beneath the pleasant flesh mask tore its way out shredding damply flapping skin with its talons as it started raking at kyle he struggled against her shouting something that became lost in his creatureforms scream as he too tore his way free the two of them started clawing at one another in a frenzy fangs and tongues and talons flashing i snarled and rolled my wrist flipping my hand toward them in a gesture wholly unfamiliar to me words spilled from my lips in thundering syllables satharak nakadum that scarlet furious power i had stolen from kravos flashed over me following the gesture of my right hand lashing out in a blaze of scarlet light that spun around the maddened vampires the scarlet blaze whirled about them winding too swiftly to be seen a ribbon of flame that cocooned them both burned brighter and hotter the spell enfolding them in fire they screamed as they died sounds like metal sheets tearing and somehow also like terrified children heat thrummed back against us almost singeing the exposed hairs on my legs my chest greasy black smoke started to spread over the floor and it stank i watched as they burned though i could see nothing beneath the blazing flamecocoon part of me wanted to dance in malicious glee to throw my arms up in the air and crow my defiance and scorn to my enemies while they died and to roll through their ashes when theyd cooled more of me grew sickened i stared at the spell i had wrought and couldnt believe it had come from mewhether or not id taken the power maybe even some primal knowledge of this spell from kravoss devoured spirit the magic had come from me i had killed them as swiftly and as efficiently and with as little forethought as one gives to crushing an ant they were vampires some part of me said they had it coming they were monsters i glanced aside at susan who stood panting her white shirt stained dark brown with blood she stared at the fire her eyes dark and wide the whites filled in with black i watched her shudder and close her eyes when she opened them again they were normal once more blurred with tears within the confines of my spell the screams stopped now there were only cracklings poppings the sound of overheated marrow boiling bursting out of bone i turned away toward the door and said lets go susan and justine followed me i led them through the basement it was large and unfinished and damp the room outside the washroom had a large drain in the center of the floor there were corpses there children from the masquerade others dressed in rags and castoff clothes the missing street people i stopped long enough to send my senses questing out over them but there was no stirring of breath no faint pulse of heartbeat the corpses showed no lividity at all the floor lay damp beneath our feet and a hose still ran out a trickle of water to one side dinner had already been served i hate them i said my voice rang out too loud in that room i hate them susan she said nothing in answer im not going to let them keep this up ive tried to stay out of their way before i cant now not after what ive seen you cant fight them justine whispered theyre too strong there are too many of them i held up a hand and justine fell silent i tilted my head to one side and heard a faint thrumming at the very edges of my magical perception i stalked across the room around the bodies to an alcove in the wall cheap shelving had been installed in the alcove and on the shelves sat my shield bracelet my blasting rod and bobs skull still in its fishnet sack even as i approached the skulls eyes flared to life harry bob said stars and skies youre all right he hesitated for a second and then said and looking grim even dressed in boxers with yellow duckies on them i glanced down and did my best to picture a vampire wearing boxers with yellow duckies or a wizard wearing yellow duckies for that matter bob i said bob whistled wow your aura is different you look a lot like shut up bob i said my voice very quiet he did i put on my bracelet and took up my rod i scanned around and found my staff wedged into a corner and took it out as well bob i asked what is all my stuff doing here oh bob said that well bianca got the idea somewhere that your stuff might explode if anyone messed around with it i heard the wryness in my voice though i didnt feel it she did did she i cant imagine how im doubling your pay i took bobs skull and handed it back to justine carry this dont drop it bob whistled hey cutie thats a real nice red cloak you got there will you let me see the lining i swatted the skull on the way past drawing an outraged ow from bob stop goofing around were still inside biancas and we still have to get out i frowned and glanced at justine then swiftly left and right wheres susan justine blinked she was right here behind she turned staring water dripped silence reigned justine started trembling like a leaf here she whispered theyre here we cant see them whats this we stuff kimosabe bob muttered the skull spun about in its fishnet sack i dont see any veils harry i swept my eyes left and right gripping my blasting rod did you see her leave or anyone take her bob coughed well truth be told i was looking at justines luscious little i get the point bob sorry i shook my head irritated they snuck in under a veil maybe grabbed susan and went why the hell didnt they stick around just put a knife in my back why didnt they take justine too good questions bob said ill tell you why because they werent here they couldnt have just carried susan off that easy not now why not bob asked trust me shed be a handful they couldnt do it without making a fuss which wed notice assuming youre right bob said why would she just walk away justine glanced back at me and licked her lips bianca could make her ive seen her do it she made susan walk into the laundry room on her own i grunted looks like biancas been hitting the books bob vampire wizard bob said black magic could be very tough so can i justine stay behind me keep your eyes open yes sir she said her voice quiet i strode past her toward the stairs some of the energy id felt before had faded away my pain and weakness grew closer to me more noticeable i did everything i could to shove it to the back of my mind a swift little thrill of panic gabbled in my throat and tried to make me start screaming i shoved that away too i just walked to the bottom of the stairs and looked up them the doors at the top were elegant wood and standing open a soft breeze and the smell of night air flowed down the stairs late night faint with the traces of dusty dawn i glanced back at justine and she all but flinched away from me stay down here i told her bob some things are going to start flying give her whatever help you can all right harry bob said you know that doors been opened for you theyre going to be waiting for you to walk up there yeah i said im not getting any stronger might as well do it now you could wait until dawn then theyd i cut him off short then theyd force their way down here to escape the sunlight and it would still be a fight i glanced at justine and said ill get you out if i can she chanced a swift glance at my face and back down thank you mister dresden for trying sure kid i flexed my left hand feeling the cool silver of the shield bracelet there i gripped my staff tight then rolled the blasting rod through my fingers feeling the runes carved into the wood formulae of power fire force i put one foot on the stairs my bare foot made little sound but the board creaked beneath my weight i squared my shoulders and went up the next stair and the next resolute i guess terrified certainly seething with power with a simmering anger ready to boil over again i tried to clear my mind to hang onto the anger and to dismiss the fear i had limited success but i made it up the stairs at the top bianca stood at one end of the great hall through the open doors she wore the white gown id seen her in before the soft fabric draping and stretching in alluring curves creating shadows upon her with an artists conviction susan knelt beside her shaking her head bowed bianca kept one hand on her hair spread out around and behind bianca were a dozen vampires skinny limbs flabby black bodies and drooling fangs the flaps of skin between arm and flank and thigh stretched out here and there like halffunctional wings some of the vampires had climbed up the walls and perched there like gangly black spiders all of them even susan had huge dark eyes all of them stood looking at me in front of bianca knelt a halfdozen men in plain suits that bulged in odd places they held guns in their hands great big guns some kind of assault weapons i thought their eyes looked a little vague like theyd only been allowed to see some of what was in the room just as well i looked back at them and leaned on my staff and i laughed it came out a wheezing cackle that echoed around the great hall and caused the vampires to stir restlessly bianca let her lips curve into a slow smile and what do you find so amusing my pet i smiled back there was nothing friendly in it all of this for a guy with two sticks and a pair of yellow ducky boxer shorts you must think im a real dangerous man as a matter of fact i do bianca said were i you i would consider it flattery would you i asked bianca let her smile widen oh oh yes gentlemen she said to the men with guns fire chapter thirtyeight i lifted my left hand before me pouring energy into the shield bracelet and shouted riflettum the guns roared with fire and thunder sparks showered off of a barrier less than six inches away from my hand the bracelet grew warm as the security men poured a hail of gunfire at me it stopped just short and bullets shot aside chewing through the expensive woodwork and bouncing wildly around the room one of the vampires let out a yowl and dropped from the wall to splat on the ground like a fat bug one of the security mens guns suddenly jumped and twisted and he cried out in pain reeling back blood streaming from his hands and the ruins of his face technology doesnt tend to work too well around magic including the feeding mechanisms of automatic weapons two of the guns jammed before dumping their full clips and the others fell silent spent i still stood one hand extended bullets lay all over the floor in front of me misshapen slugs of lead the security men stared and stumbled away from me behind bianca and the vampires and out the door i dont blame them if all i had was a gun and it had just been that useless i would run too i took a step forward scattering bullets with my bare feet get out of my way i said let us out no one else has to get hurt kyle bianca said stroking susans hair kelly she was quite mad in any case not all of them make the transition well her gaze traveled down to susan the smile i wore sharpened last chance bianca let us out peacefully and you walk away alive and if i say no she asked very mild i snarled my temper snapping i lifted the blasting rod whirled it around my head as i drew in my will and snarled fuego power exploded from the rod circular coruscations following a solid scarlet column of energy that lanced forward toward the vampires head bianca kept smiling she lifted her left hand mumbled some gibberish and i saw cold darkness gather before her a concave disk that met my energy lance and absorbed it scattered it sent smaller bolts of fire darting here and there splashing on the floor in small blazing puddles i just stared at her for a moment i knew that shed known some tricks maybe a veil or two a glamour or two maybe how to whip up a fascination but that kind of straightforward deflection wasnt something just anyone could do some of the people on the white council couldnt have stopped that shot without help bianca smiled at me and lowered her hand the vampires laughed hissing inhuman laughter the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and a cold shudder glided gleefully up and down my spine well mister dresden she purred it would appear that mavra was an able instructor and my lessons well learned we seem to be at something of a standoff but theres one more piece id like to put on the board she clapped her hands and gestured to one side one of the vampires opened a door standing behind it both hands on a stylish cane stood a mediumsized man dark of hair and coloring brawny through the chest and shoulders he wore a tailored suit of dark grey in an immaculate cut he made me think of native south americans with a sturdy jaw and broad strong features nice suit i told him he looked me up and down nice ducks okay i said ill bite whos that my name the man said is ortega don paolo ortega of the red court hiya don i said id like to lodge a complaint he smiled a show of broad white teeth im sure you would mister dresden but i have been monitoring the situation here and the baroness he nodded to bianca has broken none of the accords nor has she violated the laws of hospitality nor her own given word oh come on i said shes broken the spirit of all of them ortega tsked alas that in the accords it was agreed that there is no spirit of the law between our kinds mister dresden only its letter and baroness bianca has strictly adhered to its letter you have instigated multiple combats in her home murdered her sworn bondsman inflicted damage to her property and her reputation and now you stand here prepared to continue your grievance with her in a most unlawful and cavalier fashion i believe that what you do is sometimes referred to as cowboy justice if theres a point in here somewhere i said get to it ortegas eyes glittered i am present as a witness to the red king and the vampire courts at large that is all i am merely a witness bianca turned her eyes back to me a witness who will carry word of your treacherous attack and intrusion back to the courts she said it will mean war between our kindred and the white council war between the vampires and the white council son of a bitch it was unthinkable such a conflict hadnt happened in millennia not in living memoryand some wizards live a damned long time i had to swallow and hide the fact that i had just gulped well since he isnt running off to tattle right this second i can only assume that youre about to offer me a deal i never thought you were slow on the uptake mister dresden bianca said will you hear my offer i ached more with every moment that went by my body was failing i had ridden the rush of magic through the last several moments but i had spent a lot of that power it would come back but i was running the batteries downand the more i did it the more i couldnt ignore my weakness my dizziness legally speaking the vampires had me over a barrel i needed a plan i needed a plan in the worst way i needed time sure i said ill hear you out bianca curled her fingers through susans hair first you shall be forgiven your excesses of bad taste of the last few days but for the two deaths none of it is unworkableand those two would have died shortly in any case i will forgive you mister dresden thats so kind it gets better you may take your equipment your skull and the white bastards whore with you when you leave unharmed and free of future malice all accounts will be called even i let the dry show in my tone how could i possibly say no she smiled you killed someone very dear to me mister dresdennot directly true but your actions mandated her death for that too i will forgive you i narrowed my eyes bianca ran her hands over susans hair this one will stay with me you stole away someone dear to me mister dresden and i am going to take away someone dear to you after that all will be equal she gave ortega a very small smile and then glanced at me and asked well what say you if you prefer to remain with her im sure a place could be made for you here after suitable assurances of your loyalty of course i remained silent for a moment stunned well wizard she snapped harsher how do you answer accept my bargain my compromise or it is war and you will become its first casualty i looked at susan she stared blankly her mouth partially open caught in a trance of some kind i could probably snap her out of it provided a bunch of vampires didnt tear me limb from limb while i tried i looked up at bianca at ortega at the hissing vampire cronies they were drooling on the polished floor i hurt all over and i felt so very damned tired i love her i said i didnt say it very loud what bianca stared at me what did you say i said i love her she is already half mine so i still love her she isnt even fully human any longer dresden it wont be long before she is as a sister to me maybe maybe not i said get your hands off my girlfriend biancas eyes widened you are mad she said you would flirt with chaos destructionwith war for the sake of this one wounded soul i smote my staff on the floor reaching deep for power deeper than ive ever reached before outside in the gathering morning the air crackled with thunder bianca even ortega looked abruptly uncertain looking up and around before focusing on me again for the sake of one soul for one loved one for one life i called power into my blasting rod and its tip glowed incandescent white the way i see it theres nothing else worth fighting a war for biancas face distorted with fury she lost it she split apart her skin like some gruesome caterpillar the black beast clawing its way out of her flesh mask jaws gaping black eyes burning with feral fury kill him she shouted kill him kill him kill him the vampires came for me across the floor along the walls scuttling like roaches or spiderstoo fast for easy belief bianca gathered shadow into her hands and hurled it at me i fell back a pace caught biancas strike with my staff and parried it into one of her flunkies the darkness enfolded the vampire and it screamed from within when the fog around it vanished nothing remained but dust i responded with another gout of fire from the rod sweeping it like a scythe through the oncoming vampires setting them aflame they writhed and screamed spittle sliced toward me from above and to one side and i barely ducked away in time the vampire clinging to the ceiling followed its venom down but it met the end of my staff in its belly the other end solidly planted against the floor the vampire rebounded with a burping sound and landed hard on the floor i lifted the staff and smote down on the things head to the sound of more thunder outside power lashed down through the staff and crushed the vampires skull like an egg dust rained down from the ceiling and the vampires claws scratched a frantic staccato on the floor as it died i had done well for the momentthe vamps nearest me were falling back teeth bared but more were coming from behind them bianca hurled another strike at me and though i interposed both staff and shield the deathly cold of it numbed my fingers i was running out of strength panting my weariness and weakness struggling to claim me i fought off the dizziness enough to send another flash of fire at an oncoming vampire but it skittered aside and all i did was plow a blazing furrow in the floorboards they fell back for a moment separated from me by an expanse of flame and i struggled to catch my breath they were coming the vampires would be coming for me my brain kept chattering at me frantic panicked theyre coming justine susan and i might as well be dead dead like all the others dead like all their victims i leaned against the wall by the stairs panting fighting to hold on to some sense of clarity dead victims the victims below the dead i dropped the blasting rod i fell to my knees with my staff i scratched a circle around me in the dust it was enough the circle closed with a thrum of power magic ran rampant in that house the sea of supernatural energy stirred to froth i had no guide for this kind of spell i had no focus nothing to target but that wasnt the kind of magic i was working with i shoved my senses down into the earth like reaching fingers i blanked out the burning hall my enemies biancas howling i shut away the fire the smoke the pain the nausea i focused and reached beneath me and i found them i found the dead the victims the ones who had been taken not just the few piled below like so much trash to be discarded i found others dozens of others scores hundreds bones hidden away never marked never remembered restless shades trapped in the earth too weak to act to take vengeance to seek peace maybe on another night or in another place i couldnt have done it but the way had been prepared for me by bianca and her people theyd thought to weaken the border between life and death to use the dead as a weapon against me but that blade can cut both ways i found those spirits reached out and touched them one by one memorium i whispered memoratum memortius energy rushed out of me i shoved it out as fast as it would go and i gave it to them to the lost ones the seduced the betrayed the homeless the helpless all the people the vampires had preyed on through the years all the dead i could reach i reached out into the turmoil bianca and her allies had created and i gave those wandering shades power the house began to shake from below in the basement there came a rumbling sound it began as a moan it rose to a wail and then it became a screaming mob a roar of sound that shattered the senses that made my heart and my belly shiver with the sheer force of it the dead came they erupted through the floor and took forms of smoke and flame and cinder i saw them as i swayed weakened finished by the effort of the spell i saw their faces i saw newsboys from the roaring twenties and greaser street punks from the fifties i saw delivery people and homeless transients and lost children rise up deadly in their fury the ghosts reached out with flaming hands to burn and sear they shoved their smoky bodies into noses and throats they howled their names and the names of their murderers the names of their loved ones and their vengeance shook that grand old house like a thunderstorm like an earthquake the ceiling began to fall in i saw vampires being dragged into the flames down into the basement as burning sections of floor gave way some tried to flee but the spirits of the dead knew no more pity than they had rest they hammered at the vampires raked at them ghostly hands and bodies made nearly tangible by the power id channeled into them vampires died ghosts swarmed and screamed everywhere terrible and beautiful heartbreaking and ridiculous as humanity itself the sound banished any thought of speech hammered upon my skin like physical blows i was more terrified than i had ever been in my life i struggled to my feet and beckoned down the stairs justine stumbled up them bobs eyelights blazing bright orange a beacon in the smoke i grabbed her wrist and tried to make my way around the trembling house the gaping hole in the floor that led down to an inferno i saw a spirit leap for bianca with blazing hands reached out and she smote it from the air with a blast of frozen black air she seized susan by the wrist and started dragging her toward the front door more spirits hurtled toward her the eldest of the murderers of this house fire and smoke and splintereven one that had forged a body for itself out of the spent bullets laying upon the floor she fought them off talon and magic she thrust her way through them and toward the front door susan began to wake up to look around her her expression terrified susan i shouted susan she began to struggle against bianca who hissed turning toward susan she fought to drag my girlfriend closer to the front door but one of the ghosts clawed at the vampires leg setting it aflame bianca screamed berserk out of control she lifted one hand high her claws glittering dark and swept it down at susans throat i sent my spell hurtling out along with susans name the last strength of my body and mind i saw her rise rachels ghost she appeared simple and translucent and pretty and put herself between biancas claws and susans throat blood gouted from the ghost scarlet and horrible susan tumbled limply to one side bianca started screaming high enough to shatter glass as the bloody ghost simply pressed against her wrapping her arms around the monstrous black form my spell followed on the heels of rachels ghost and took bianca full in the face a nearsolid column of wind which seized her hurtled her up and then smashed her down into the floor the overstrained boards gave way beneath her with a creak and a roar and flame washed up toward me in a wave of reeking black smoke i felt my balance spin and i struggled to make it to the exit but fell to the ground spirits flooded after bianca fire and smoke following the vampire sorceress down the hole the house itself screamed a sound of tortured wood and twisted beam and began to fall i couldnt get my balance i felt small strong hands under one of my arms and then i felt susan beneath the other powerful and terrified she lifted me to my feet justine stayed by my other side and together we stumbled out of the old house we had gone no more than a dozen paces when it collapsed with a roar we turned and i saw the house drawing in upon itself sucked down into the earth into an inferno of flame the fire department later called it some kind of inverted backblast but i know what i saw i saw the ghosts the dead had left behind settle the score i love you i said or tried to say to susan i love you she pressed her mouth to mine i think she was crying hush she said harry hush i love you too it was done there was no more reason to hold on chapter thirtynine i regard it as one last sadistic gibe of whatever power had decided to make my life a living hell that the burn ward was full and i was given a room to share with charity carpenter she had recovered in spirit if not in body and she started in on me the moment i awoke the womans tongue was sharper than any sword even amoracchius i smiled through most of it michael would have been proud the baby i learned had taken an abrupt turn for the better in the hours before dawn the morning biancas house had burned i thought that maybe kravos had taken a bite of the little guy and i had gotten it back for him michael thought god had simply decreed the morning to be a day of good things whatever the results were what counted weve decided michael said stretching a strong arm around charity to name him harry charity glowered at me but remained silent harry i asked harry carpenter michael what did that poor kid ever do to you but it made me feel good and they kept the name charity got out of the hospital three days before me michael or father forthill remained with me for the rest of my stay no one ever said anything but michael had the sword with him and forthill kept a crucifix handy just in case i had some nasty visitors one night when i couldnt sleep i mentioned to michael that i was worried about the repercussions of my workings the harmful magic i had dished out i worried that it was going to come back to haunt me im not a philosopher harry he said but heres something for you to think about at least what goes around comes around and sometimes you get whats coming around he paused for a moment frowning faintly pursing his lips and sometimes you are whats coming around you see what i mean i did i was able to get back to sleep michael explained that he and thomas had escaped the fight at the bridge only a few moments after it had begun but time had stretched oddly between the nevernever and chicago and they hadnt emerged until two oclock the following afternoon thomas brought us out into this flesh pit michael said im not a wizard thomas pointed out i can only get in and out of the nevernever at points close to my heart a house of sin michael said his expression stern a gentlemens club thomas protested and one of the nicest ones in town i kept my mouth shut who says i never grow any wiser murphy came out of the sleeping spell a couple days later i had to go in a wheelchair but i went to kravoss funeral with her she pushed me through a drizzling rain to the grave site there was a city official there who signed off on some papers and left then it was just us and the grave diggers shovels whispering on earth murphy watched the proceedings in complete silence her eyes sunken the blue faded out until they seemed almost grey i didnt push and she didnt talk until the hole was half filled in i couldnt stop him she said then i tried but we beat him thats why were here and hes there you beat him murphy said a lot of good i did you he sucker punched you even if youd been a wizard hed have gotten to youlike he damn near did me i shivered remembered agony making the muscles of my belly tight karrin you cant blame yourself for that i know she said but she didnt sound like she meant it she was quiet for a long time and i finally figured out that she wasnt talking because id hear the tears in her voice the ones the rain hid from me she didnt bow her head though and she didnt look away from the grave i reached out and found her hand with mine i squeezed she squeezed back silent and tight we stayed there in the rain until the last bit of earth had been thrown over kravoss coffin on the way out murphy stopped my wheelchair frowning at a white headstone next to a waiting plot he died doing the right thing she read she looked down at me i shrugged and felt my mouth curl up on one side not yet not today michael and forthill took care of lydia for me her real name was barbara something they got her packed up and moved out of town apparently the church has some kind of equivalent of the witness protection program for getting people out of the reach of supernatural baddies forthill told me how the girl had fled the church because shed been terrified that she would fall asleep and gone out to find some uppers the vampires had grabbed her while she was out which was when id found them in that old building she sent me a note that read simply im sorry thank you for everything when i got out of the hospital thomas sent me a thankyou letter for saving justine he sent it on a little note card attached to a bow which was all justine was wearing ill let you guess where the bow was i took the note but not the girl there was too much of an ick factor in sharing girls with a sex vampire justine was pretty enough and sweet enough when she wasnt walking the razors edge of an organic emotional instabilitybut i couldnt really hold that against her plenty of people have to take some kind of medication to keep stable lithium supermodel sex vampireswhatever works i guess i had woman problems of my own susan sent me flowers and called me every day in the hospital but she didnt ever talk to me for long and she didnt come to visit when i got out i went to her apartment she didnt live there anymore i tried to call her at work and never managed to catch her finally i had to resort to magic i used some hair of hers left on a brush at my apartment and tracked her down on a beach along lake michigan on one of the last warm days of the year i found her laying in the sun wearing a white bikini that left maximum surface area bared to it i sat down next to her and her manner changed subtly a quiet tension that i didnt miss though i couldnt see her eyes behind the sunglasses she wore the sun helps she said sometimes it almost goes away for a while ive been trying to find you i said i wanted to talk to you i know she said harry things have changed for me in the daylight its not too bad but at night she shivered i have to lock myself inside i dont trust myself around people harry i know i said you know whats happening i talked to thomas she said and justine they were nice enough i guess they explained things to me i grimaced look i said im going to help you ill find some way to get you out of this we can find a cure i reached out and took her hand oh hells bells susan im no good at this i just fumbled the ring onto it clumsy as you please i dont want you far away marry me she sat up and stared at her hand at the dinky ring id been able to afford then she leaned close to me and gave me a slow heated kiss her mouth meltingwarm our tongues touched mine went numb i got a little dizzy as the slow throb of pleasure that id felt before coursed through me a drug id craved without realizing it she drew away from me slowly her face expressionless behind the sunglasses she said i cant you already made me ache for you harry i couldnt control myself with you i couldnt sort out the hungers she pressed the ring into my hand and stood up gathering her towel and a purse with her dont come to me again ill call you and she left id bragged to kravos at the end that id been trained to demolish nightmares when i was younger and to a certain extent it was true if something came into my head for a fight i could put up a good one but now i had nightmares that were all my own a part of me and they were always the same darkness trapped with the vampires all around me laughing their hissing laughter id wake up screaming and crying mister curled against my legs would raise his head and rumble at me but he wouldnt pad away hed just settle down again purring like a snowmobiles engine i found it a comfort and i slept with a light always close harry bob said one night you havent been working youve barely left your apartment the rent was due last week and this vampire research is going nowhere fast shut up bob i told him this unguent isnt right if we can find a way to convert it to a liquid maybe we can work it into a supplement of some kind harry bob said i looked up at the skull harry the council sent a notice to you today i stood up slowly the vampires the councils at war i guess paris and berlin went into chaos almost a week ago the council is calling a meeting here the white council is coming to chicago i mused yeah theyre going to want to know what the hell happened i shrugged i sent them my report i only did what was right i said or as close to it as i could manage i couldnt let them have her bob i couldnt the skull sighed i dont know if that will hold up with them harry it has to i said there was a knock at my door i climbed up from the lab murphy and michael had shown up at my door with a care package soup and charcoal and kerosene for me as the weather got colder groceries fruit michael had rather pointedly included a razor how are you doing dresden murphy asked me her blue eyes serious i stared at her for a moment then at michael i could be worse i said come in friends they make it easier so the vampires are out to get me and every other wizard on the block the little wizardlings of the city the havenots of magic are making it a point not to go outside after dark i dont order pizza for delivery anymore not after the first guy almost got me with a bomb the council is going to be furious at me but what else is new susan doesnt call doesnt visit but i got a card from
