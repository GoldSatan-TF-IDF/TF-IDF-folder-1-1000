jeffery deaver carte blanche a book in the james bond series to the man who taught us we could still believe in heroes ian fleming authors note this is a work of fiction however with a few exceptions the organisations referred to are real the world of intelligence counterintelligence and espionage is one of acronyms and shorthand since the alphabet soup of security agencies can be a bit daunting i thought a glossary might prove helpful it appears at the end of the book jd what is needed is a new organisation to coordinate inspire control and assist the nationals of the oppressed countries we need absolute secrecy a certain fanatical enthusiasm willingness to work with people of different nationalities and complete political reliability the organisation should in my view be entirely independent of the war office machinery hugh dalton minister of economic warfare describing the formation of britains special operations executive espionage and sabotage group at the outbreak of the second world war sunday the red danube his hand on the deadman throttle the driver of the serbian rail diesel felt the thrill he always did on this particular stretch of railway heading north from belgrade and approaching novi sad this was the route of the famed arlberg orient express which ran from greece through belgrade and points north from the s until the s of course he was not piloting a glistening pacific steam locomotive towing elegant mahoganyandbrass dining cars suites and sleepers where passengers floated upon vapours of luxury and anticipation he commanded a battered old thing from america that tugged behind it a string of more or less dependable rolling stock packed snugly with mundane cargo but still he felt the thrill of history in every vista that the journey offered especially as they approached the river hisriver and yet he was ill at ease among the wagons bound for budapest containing coal scrap metal consumer products and timber there was one that worried him greatly it was loaded with drums of mic methyl isocyanate to be used in hungary in the manufacture of rubber the driver a round balding man in a wellworn cap and stained overalls had been briefed at length about this deadly chemical by his supervisor and some idiot from the serbian safety and wellbeing transportation oversight ministry some years ago this substance had killed eight thousand people in bhopal india within a few days of a leak from a manufacturing plant there hed acknowledged the danger his cargo presented but a veteran railwayman and union member hed asked what does that mean for the journey to budapest specifically the boss and the bureaucrat had regarded each other with the eyes of officialdom and after a pause settled for just be very careful the lights of novi sad serbias secondlargest city began to coalesce in the distance and ahead in the encroaching evening the danube appeared as a pale stripe in history and in music the river was celebrated in reality it was brown undramatic and home to barges and tankers not candlelit vessels filled with lovers and viennese orchestras or not here at least still it wasthe danube an icon of balkan pride and the railwaymans chest always swelled as he took his train over the bridge his river he peered through the speckled windscreen and inspected the track before him in the headlight of the general electric diesel nothing to be concerned about there were eight notch positions on the throttle number one being the lowest he was presently at five and he eased back to three to slow the train as it entered a series of turns the horsepower engine grew softer as it cut back the voltage to the traction motors as the cars entered the straight section to the bridge the driver shifted up to notch five again and then six the engine pulsed louder and faster and there came a series of sharp clangs from behind the sound was the driver knew simply the couplings between wagons protesting at the change in speed a minor cacophony hed heard a thousand times in his job but his imagination told him the noise was the metal containers of the deadly chemical in car number three jostling against each other at risk of spewing forth their poison nonsense he told himself and concentrated on keeping the speed steady then for no reason at all except that it made him feel better he tugged at the air horn lying at the top of a hill surrounded by obscuring grass a man of serious face and hunters demeanour heard the wail of a horn in the distance miles away a glance told him that the sound had come from the train approaching from the south it would arrive here in ten or fifteen minutes he wondered how it might affect the precarious operation that was about to unfurl shifting position slightly he studied the diesel locomotive and the lengthy string of wagons behind it through his nightvision monocular judging that the train was of no consequence to himself and his plans james bond turned the scope back to the restaurant of the spa and hotel and once again regarded his target through the window the weathered building was large yellow stucco with brown trim apparently it was a favourite with the locals from the number of zastava and fiat saloons in the car park it was eight forty and the sunday evening was clear here near novi sad where the pannonian plain rose to a landscape that the serbs called mountainous though bond guessed the adjective must have been chosen to attract tourists the rises were mere hills to him an avid skier the may air was dry and cool the surroundings as quiet as an undertakers chapel of rest bond shifted position again in his thirties he was six foot tall and weighed lb his black hair was parted on one side and a comma of loose strands fell over one eye a threeinch scar ran down his right cheek this evening hed taken some care with his outfit he was wearing a dark green jacket and rainproof trousers from the american company which made the best tactical clothing on the market on his feet were wellworn leather boots that had been made for pursuit and sure footing in a fight as night descended the lights to the north glowed more intensely the old city of novi sad as lively and charming as it was now bond knew the place had a dark past after the hungarians had slaughtered thousands of its citizens in january and flung the bodies into the icy danube novi sad had become a crucible for partisan resistance bond was here tonight to prevent another horror different in nature but of equal or worse magnitude yesterday saturday an alert had rippled through the british intelligence community gchq in cheltenham had decrypted an electronic whisper about an attack later in the week meeting at noahs office confirm incident friday night th estimated initial casualties in the thousands british interests adversely affected funds transfers as discussed not long after the government eavesdroppers had also cracked part of a second text message sent from the same phone same encryption algorithm but to a different number meet me sunday at restaurant rostilj outside novi sad i am foot tall irish accent then the irishman whod courteously if inadvertently supplied his own nickname had destroyed the phone or flicked out the batteries as had the other text recipients in london the joint intelligence committee and members of cobra the crisis management body met into the night to assess the risk of incident twenty socalled because of fridays date there was no solid information on the origin or nature of the threat but mi was of the opinion that it was coming out of the tribal regions in afghanistan where alqaeda and its affiliates had taken to hiring western operatives in european countries sixs agents in kabul began a major effort to learn more the serbian connection had to be pursued too and so at ten oclock last night the rangy tentacles of these events had reached out and clutched bond whod been sitting in an exclusive restaurant off charing cross road with a beautiful woman whose lengthy description of her life as an underappreciated painter had grown tiresome the message on bonds mobile had read niact call cos the night action alert meant an immediate response was required at whatever time it was received the call to his chief of staff had blessedly cut the date short and soon he had been en route to serbia under a level project order authorising him to identify the irishman plant trackers and other surveillance devices and follow him if that proved impossible the order authorised bond to conduct an extraordinary rendition of the irishman and spirit him back to england or to a black site on the continent for interrogation so now bond lay among white narcissi taking care to avoid the leaves of that beautiful but poisonous spring flower he concentrated on peering through the restoran roštiljs front window on the other side of which the irishman was sitting over an almost untouched plate and talking to his partner as yet unidentified but slavic in appearance perhaps because he was nervous the local contact had parked elsewhere and walked here providing no number plate to scan the irishman had not been so timid his lowend mercedes had arrived forty minutes ago its plate had revealed that the vehicle had been hired today for cash under a false name with a fake british driving licence and passport the man was about bonds age perhaps a bit older six foot two and lean hed walked into the restaurant in an ungainly way his feet turned out an odd line of blond fringe dipped over a high forehead and his cheekbones angled down to a squarecut chin bond was satisfied that this man was the target two hours ago he had gone into the restaurant for a cup of coffee and stuck a listening device inside the front door a man had arrived at the appointed time and spoken to the head waiter in english slowly and loudly as foreigners often do when talking to locals to bond listening through an app on his phone from thirty yards away the accent was clearly midulster most likely belfast or the surrounding area unfortunately the meeting between the irishman and his local contact was taking place out of the bugs range through the tunnel of his monocular bond now studied his adversary taking note of every detail small clues save you small errors kill as the instructors at fort monckton were wont to remind he noted that the irishmans manner was precise and that he made no unnecessary gestures when the partner drew a diagram the irishman moved it closer with the rubber of a propelling pencil so that he left no fingerprints he sat with his back to the window and in front of his partner the surveillance apps on bonds mobile could not read either set of lips once the irishman turned quickly looking outside as if triggered by a sixth sense the pale eyes were devoid of expression after some time he turned back to the food that apparently didnt interest him the meal now seemed to be winding down bond eased off the hillock and made his way through widely spaced spruce and pine trees and anaemic undergrowth with clusters of the ubiquitous white flowers he passed a faded sign in serbian french and english that had amused him when hed arrived spa and restaurant roštilj located in a declared therapeutic region and is recommended by all for convalescences after surgeries especially helping for acute and chronic diseases of respiration organs and anaemia full bar he returned to the staging area behind a decrepit garden shed that smelt of engine oil petrol and piss near the driveway to the restaurant his two comrades as he thought of them were waiting here james bond preferred to operate alone but the plan hed devised required two local agents they were with the bia the serbian security information agency as benign a name for a spy outfit as one could imagine the men however were undercover in the uniform of local police from novi sad sporting the golden badge of the ministry of internal affairs faces squat heads round perpetually unsmiling they wore their hair closecropped beneath navyblue brimmed caps their woollen uniforms were the same shade one was around forty the other twentyfive despite their cover roles as rural officers theyd come girded for battle they carried heavy beretta pistols and swathes of ammunition in the back seat of their borrowed police car a volkswagen jetta there were two greencamouflaged kalashnikov machine guns an uzi and a canvas bag of fragmentation hand grenades serious ones swiss hg s bond turned to the older agent but before he spoke he heard a fierce slapping from behind his hand moving to his walther pps he whirled round to see the younger serb ramming a pack of cigarettes into his palm a ritual that bond a former smoker had always found absurdly selfconscious and unnecessary what was the man thinking quiet he whispered coldly and put those away no smoking perplexity sidled into the dark eyes my brother he smokes all time he is out on operations looks more normal than notsmoking in serbia on the drive here the young man had prattled on and on about his brother a senior agent with the infamous jso technically a unit of the state secret service though bond knew it was really a blackops paramilitary group the young agent had let slip probably intentionally for he had said it with pride that big brother had fought with arkans tigers a ruthless gang that had committed some of the worst atrocities in the fighting in croatia bosnia and kosovo maybe on the streets of belgrade a cigarette wont be noticed bond muttered but this is a tactical operation put them away the agent slowly complied he seemed about to say something to his partner then thought better of it perhaps recalling that bond had a working knowledge of serbocroatian bond looked again into the restaurant and saw that the irishman was laying some dinars on the metal tray no traceable credit card of course the partner was pulling on a jacket all right its time bond reiterated the plan in the police car they would follow the irishmans mercedes out of the drive and along the road until he was a mile or so from the restaurant the serbian agents would then pull the car over telling him it matched a vehicle used in a drug crime in novi sad the irishman would be asked politely to get out and would be handcuffed his mobile phone wallet and identity papers would be placed on the boot of the mercedes and hed be led aside and made to sit facing away from the car meanwhile bond would slip out of the back seat photograph the documents download what he could from the phone look through laptops and luggage then plant tracking devices by then the irishman would have caught on that this was a shakedown and offered a suitable bribe hed be freed to go on his way if the local partner left the restaurant with him theyd execute essentially the same plan with both men now im ninety per cent sure hell believe you bond said but if not and he engages remember that under no circumstances is he to be killed i need him alive aim to wound in the arm he favours near the elbow not the shoulder despite what one saw in the movies a shoulder wound was usually as fatal as one to the abdomen or chest the irishman now stepped outside feet splayed he looked around pausing to study the area was anything different hed be thinking new cars had arrived since theyd entered was there anything significant about them he apparently decided there was no threat and both men climbed into the mercedes its the pair of them bond said same plan da the irishman started the engine the lights flashed on bond oriented his hand on his walther snug in the dm bullard leather pancake holster and climbed into the back seat of the police car noticing an empty can on the floor one of his comrades had enjoyed a jelen pivo a deer beer while bond had been conducting surveillance the insubordination bothered him less than the carelessness the irishman might grow suspicious when stopped by a cop with beer on his breath another mans ego and greed can be helpful bond believed but incompetence is simply a useless and inexcusable danger the serbs got into the front the engine hummed to life bond tapped the earpiece of his srac the shortrange agent communication device used for cloaked radio transmissions on tactical operations channel two he reminded them da da the older man sounded bored they both plugged in earpieces and james bond asked himself yet again had he planned this properly despite the speed with which the operation had been put together hed spent hours formulating the tactics he believed hed anticipated every possible variation except one it appeared the irishman did not do what he absolutely had to he didnt leave the mercedes turned awayfrom the drive and rolled out of the car park on to the lawn beside the restaurant on the other side of a tall hedge unseen by the staff and diners it was heading for a weedriddled field to the east the younger agent snapped govno what he is doing the three men stepped out to get a better view the older one drew his gun and started after the car bond waved him to a halt no wait hes escaping he knows about us no its something else the irishman wasnt driving as if he were being pursued he was moving slowly the mercedes easing forward like a boat in a gentle morning swell besides there was no place to escape to he was hemmed in by cliffs overlooking the danube the railway embankment and the forest on the fruška gora rise bond watched as the mercedes arrived at the railtrack a hundred yards from where they stood it slowed made a uturn and parked the bonnet facing back towards the restaurant it was close to a railway work shed and switch rails where a second track peeled off from the main line both men climbed out and the irishman collected something from the boot your enemys purpose will dictate your response bond silently recited another maxim from the lectures at fort moncktons specialist training centre in gosport you must find the adversarys intention but what washis purpose bond pulled out the monocular again clicked on the night vision and focused the partner opened a panel mounted on a signal beside the switch rails and began fiddling with the components inside bond saw that the second track leading off to the right was a rusting disused spur ending in a barrier at the top of a hill so it was sabotage they were going to derail the train by shunting it on to the spur the cars would tumble down the hill into a stream that flowed into the danube but why bond turned the monocular towards the diesel engine and the wagons behind it and saw the answer the first two cars contained only scrap metal but behind them a canvascovered flatbed was marked opasnostdanger he saw too a hazardousmaterials diamond the universal warning sign that told emergency rescuers the risks of a particular shipment alarmingly this diamond had high numbers for all three categories health instability and inflammability the wat the bottom meant that the substance would react dangerously with water whatever was being carried in that car was in the deadliest category short of nuclear materials the train was now threequarters of a mile away from the switch rails picking up speed to make the gradient to the bridge your enemys purpose will dictate your response he didnt know how the sabotage related to incident twenty if at all but their immediate goal was clear as was the response bond now instinctively formulated he said to the comrades if they try to leave block them at the drive and take them no lethal force he leapt into the drivers seat of the jetta he pointed the car towards the fields where hed been conducting surveillance and jammed down the accelerator as he released the clutch the light car shot forward engine and gearbox crying out at the rough treatment as it crashed over brush saplings narcissi and the raspberry bushes that grew everywhere in serbia dogs fled and lights in the tiny cottages nearby flicked on residents in their gardens waved their arms angrily in protest bond ignored them and concentrated on maintaining his speed as he drove towards his destination guided only by scant illumination a partial moon above and the doomed trains headlight far brighter and rounder than the lamp of heaven the impending death weighed on him niall dunne crouched among weeds thirty feet from the switch rails he squinted through the fading light of early evening at the serbian rail drivers cab of the freight train as it approached and he again thought a tragedy for one thing death was usually a waste and dunne was first and foremost a man who disliked waste it was almost sinful diesel engines hydraulic pumps drawbridges electric motors computers assembly lines all machines were meant to perform their tasks with as little waste as possible death was efficiency squandered yet there seemed to be no way around it tonight he looked south at the glistening needles of white illumination on the rails from the trains headlight he glanced round the mercedes was out of sight of the train parked at just the right angle to keep it hidden from the cab it was yet another of the precise calculations he had incorporated into his blueprint for the evening he heard in memory his bosss voice this is niall hes brilliant hes my draughtsman dunne believed he could see the shadow of the drivers head in the cab of the diesel death he tried to shrug away the thought the train was now four or five hundred yards away aldo karic joined him the speed dunne asked the middleaged serb is it all right he seems slow in syrupy english the serbian said no is good accelerating now look you can see is good karic a bearish man sucked air through his teeth hed seemed nervous throughout dinner not hed confessed because he might be arrested or fired but because of the difficulty in keeping the ten thousand euros secret from everyone including his wife and two children dunne regarded the train again he calculated speed mass incline yes it wasgood at this point even if someone tried to wave the train down even if a belgrade supervisor happened to notice something was amiss phoned the driver and ordered him to apply full brakes it would be physically impossible to stop the train before it hit the switch rails now configured to betray and he reminded himself sometimes death is necessary the train was now three hundred yards away it would all be over in ninety seconds and then but what was this dunne was suddenly aware of movement in a field nearby an indistinct shape pounding over the uneven ground making directly for the track do you see that he asked karic the serbian gasped yes i am seeing its a car what is happening it was indeed in the faint moonlight dunne could see the small lightcoloured saloon assaulting hillocks and swerving around trees and fragments of fences how could the driver keep his high speed on such a course it seemed impossible teenagers perhaps playing one of their stupid games as he stared at the mad transit he judged velocity he judged angles if the car didnt slow it would cross the track with some seconds to spare but the driver would have to vault over the tracks themselves there was no crossing here if it were stuck on the rail the diesel would crush it like a tin of vegetables still that wouldnt affect dunnes mission here the tiny car would be pitched aside and the train continue to the deadly spur now wait what was this dunne realised it was a police car but why no lights or siren it must have been stolen a suicide but the police cars driver had no intention of stopping on the rail or crossing to the other side with a final leap into the air from the crest of hill the saloon crashed to earth and skidded to a stop just short of the roadbed around fifty yards in front of the train the driver jumped out a man he was wearing dark clothing dunne couldnt see him clearly but he appeared not to be a policeman neither was he trying to flag down the engine driver he ran into the middle of the track itself and crouched calmly directly in front of the locomotive which bore down upon him at fifty or sixty miles an hour the frantic blare of the trains horn filled the night and orange streaks of sparks shot from the locked wheels with the train feet away from him the man launched himself from the track and vanished into the ditch what is happening karic whispered just then a yellowwhite flash burst from the tracks in front of the diesel and a moment later dunne heard a crack he recognised the explosion of a small ied or grenade a similar blast followed seconds later the driver of the police car it seemed had a blueprint of his own one that trumped dunnes no he wasnt a policeman or a suicide he was an operative of some sort with experience in demolition work the first explosion had blown out the spikes fixing the rail to the wooden ties the second had pushed the unsecured track to the side slightly so that the diesels front left wheels would slip off karic muttered something in serbian dunne ignored him and watched the disc of the diesels headlight waver then with a rumble and a terrible squeal the engine and the massive wagons it tugged behind sidled off the track and spewing a world of dust pushed forward through the soil and chipped rock of the rail bed from the ditch james bond watched the locomotive and the cars continue their passage slowing as they dug into the soft earth peeling up rails and flinging sand dirt and stones everywhere finally he climbed out and assessed the situation hed had only minutes to work out how to avert the calamity that would send the deadly substance into the danube after braking to a stop hed grabbed two of the grenades the serbians had brought with them then leapt on to the tracks to plant the devices as he had calculated the locomotive and wagons had stayed upright and hadnt toppled into the stream hed orchestrated hisderailment where the ground was still flat unlike the intended setting of the irishmans sabotage finally hissing groaning and creaking the train came to a standstill not far from the irishman and his partner though bond could not see them through the dust and smoke he spoke into the srac radio this is leader one are you there silence are you there he growled respond bond massaged his shoulder where a sliver of hot whistling shrapnel had torn through his jacket and sliced skin a crackle finally the train is derailed it was the older serbians voice did you see where are you listen to me carefully what has happened listen we dont have much time i think theyll try to blow up or shoot the hazmat containers its their only way to spill the contents im going to fire towards them and drive them back to their car wait till the mercedes is in that muddy area near the restaurant then shoot out the tyres and keep them inside it we should take them now no dont do anything until theyre beside the restaurant theyll have no defensive position inside the mercedes theyll have to surrender do you understand me the srac went dead damn bond started forward through the dust towards the place where the third rail car the one containing the hazardous material waited to be ripped open niall dunne tried to reconstruct what had happened hed known he might have to improvise but this was one thing he had not considered a preemptive strike by an unknown enemy he looked out carefully from his vantagepoint a stand of bushes near where the locomotive sat smoking clicking and hissing the assailant was invisible hidden by the darkness of night the dust and fumes maybe the man had been crushed to death or fled dunne lifted the rucksack over his shoulder and made his way round the diesel to the far side where the derailed wagons would give him cover from the intruder if he was still alive and present in a curious way dunne found himself relieved of his nagging anxiety the death had been averted hed been fully prepared for it had steeled himself anything for his boss of course but the other mans intervention had settled the matter as he approached the diesel he couldnt help but admire the massive machine it was an american general electric dash b old and battered as you usually saw in the balkans but a classic beauty horsepower he noted the sheets of steel the wheels vents bearings and valves the springs hoses and pipes all so beautiful elegant in simple functionality yes it was such a relief that he was startled by a man staggering towards him begging for help it was the train driver dunne shot him twice in the head it was such a relief that he hadnt been forced to cause the death of this wonderful machine as hed been dreading he ran his hand along the side of the locomotive as a father would stroke the hair of a sick child whose fever had just broken the diesel would be back in service in a few months time niall dunne hitched the rucksack higher on his shoulder and slipped between the wagons to get to work the two shots james bond had heard had not hit the hazardousmaterials car he was covering that from thirty yards away he guessed the engine driver and perhaps his mate had been the victims then through the dust he saw the irishman gripping a black pistol he stood between the two jackknifed wagons filled with scrap metal directly behind the engine a rucksack hung from his shoulder it seemed to be full which meant that if he intended to blow up the hazardousmaterial containers he hadnt set the charges yet bond aimed his pistol and fired two shots close to the irishman to drive him back to the mercedes the man crouched startled then vanished fast bond looked towards the restaurant side of the track where the mercedes was parked his mouth tightened the serbian agents hadnt followed his orders they were now flanking the work shed having pulled the irishmans slavic associate to the ground and slipped nylon restraints around his wrists the two were now moving closer to the train incompetence bond scrabbled to his feet and keeping low ran towards them the serbs were pointing at the tracks the rucksack now sat on the ground among some tall plants near the engine obscuring a man crouching the agents moved forward cautiously the bag was the irishmans but of course the man behind it was not the drivers body probably no bond whispered into the srac its a trick are you there but the older agent wasnt listening he stepped forward shouting ne mrdaj do not move at that moment the irishman leant out of the engines cab and fired a burst from his pistol hitting him in the head he dropped hard his younger colleague assumed that the man on the ground was firing and emptied his automatic weapon into the dead body of the driver bond shouted opasnost but it was too late the irishman leant out of the cab again and shot the younger agent in the right arm near the elbow he dropped his gun and cried out falling backwards as the irishman leapt from the train he let go half a dozen rounds towards bond who returned fire aiming for the feet and ankles but the haze and vapours were thick he missed the irishman holstered his gun shouldered the rucksack and dragged the younger agent towards the mercedes they disappeared bond sprinted back to the jetta jumped in and roared off five minutes later he soared over a hillock and landed skidding in the field behind restoran roštilj the scene was one of complete chaos as diners and staff fled in panic the mercedes was gone glancing towards the derailed train he could see that the irishman had killed not only the older agent but his own associate the serbian hed dined with hed shot him as hed lain on his belly hands bound bond got out of the jetta and frisked the body for pocket litter but the irishman had stripped the man of his wallet and any other material bond pulled out his own oakley sunglasses wiped them clean then pressed the dead mans thumb and index finger against the lens he ran back to the jetta and sped after the mercedes urging the car to seventy miles an hour despite the meandering road and potholes pitting the tarmac a few minutes later he glimpsed something lightcoloured in a layby ahead he braked hard barely controlling the fishtailing skid and stopped the car engulfed in smoke from its tyres a few yards from the younger agent he got out and bent over the man who was shivering crying the wound in his arm was bad and hed lost a great deal of blood one shoe was off and a toenail was gone the irishman had tortured him bond opened his folding knife cut the mans shirt with the razorsharp blade and bound a wool strip round his arm with a stick he found just off the layby he made a tourniquet and applied it he leant down and wiped sweat from the mans face where is he going gasping his face a mask of agony he rambled in serbocroatian then realising who bond was he said you will call my brother you must take me to the hospital i will tell you a place to go i need to know where he went i didnt say nothing he tried but i didnt tell nothing about you the boy had spilt out everything he knew about the operation of course but that wasnt the issue now bond said where did he go the hospital take me and i will tell you tell me or youll die in five minutes bond said evenly loosening the tourniquet on his right arm blood cascaded the young man blinked away tears all right you bastard he ask how to get to e sevenfive the fast road from highway twentyone that will take him to hungary he is going north please bond tightened the tourniquet again he knew of course that the irishman wasnt going north the man was a cruel and clever tactician he didnt need directions bond saw his own devotion to tradecraft in the irishman even before he had arrived in serbia the man would have memorised the geography around novi sad hed go southon highway the only major road nearby hed be making for belgrade or an evacuation site in the area bond patted the young agents pockets and pulled out his mobile he hit the emergency call number when he heard a womans voice answer he propped the phone beside the mans mouth then ran back to the jetta he concentrated on driving as fast as he could over the uneven road surface losing himself in the choreography of braking and steering he took a turn fast and the car skidded crossing the white line an oncoming lorry loomed a big one with a cyrillic logo it veered away and the driver hit the horn angrily bond swerved back into his lane missing a collision by inches and continued in pursuit of the only lead they had to noah and the thousands of deaths on friday five minutes later approaching highway bond slowed ahead he saw a flicker of orange and in the sky roiling smoke obscuring the moon and stars he soon arrived at the accident site the irishman had missed a sharp bend and sought refuge in what seemed to be a wide grass shoulder but in fact was not a line of brush masked a steep drop the car had gone over and was now upsidedown the engine was on fire bond pulled up killed the jettas motor and got out then drawing the walther he half ran half slid down the hill to where the vehicle lay scanning for threats and seeing none as he closed on it he stopped the irishman was dead still strapped into the seat he was inverted arms dangling over his shoulders blood covered his face and neck and pooled on the cars ceiling squinting against the fumes bond kicked in the drivers window to drag the body out he would salvage the mans mobile and what pocket litter he could then wrench open the boot to collect luggage and laptops he opened his knife again to cut the seat belt in the distance the urgent wahhaof sirens growing louder he looked back up the road the fire engines were still a few miles away but theyd be here soon get on with it the flames from the engine were increasingly energetic the smoke was vile as he began to saw away at the belt though he thought suddenly firefighters already that made no sense police yes but not the fire brigade he gripped the drivers bloodied hair and turned the head it was not the irishman bond gazed at the mans jacket the cyrillic lettering was the same as on the lorry hed nearly hit the irishman had forced the vehicle to stop hed cut the drivers throat strapped him into the mercedes and sent it over the cliff here then called the local fire service in order to slow the traffic and prevent bond pursuing him the irishman would have taken the rucksack and everything else from the boot of course inside the car though on the inverted ceiling towards the back seat there were a few scraps of paper bond jammed them into his pockets before the flames forced him away he ran back to the jetta and sped off towards highway away from the approaching flashing lights he fished out his mobile it resembled an iphone but was a bit larger and featured special optics audio systems and other hardware the unit contained multiple phones one that could be registered to an agents official or nonofficial cover identity then a hidden unit with hundreds of operational apps and encryption packages because the device had been developed by q branch it had taken all of a day for some wit in the office to dub them iqphones he opened an app that gave him a priority link to a gchq tracking centre he recited into the voicerecognition system a description of the yellow zastava eurozeta lorry the irishman was driving the computer in cheltenham would automatically recognise bonds location and determine projected routes for the truck then train the satellite to look for any nearby vehicle of this sort and track it five minutes later he heard his phone buzz excellent he glanced at the screen but the message was not from the snoops it was from bill tanner chief of staff at bonds outfit the subject heading said crash dive shorthand for emergency eyes flipping from the road to the phone bond read on gchq intercept serbian security agent assigned to you in incident operation died on way to hospital reported you abandoned him serbs have priority order for your arrest evacuate immediately monday the ragandbone man after three and a half hours sleep james bond was woken at seven am in his chelsea flat by the electronic tone of his mobile phones alarm clock his eyes focused on the white ceiling of the small bedroom he blinked twice and ignoring the pain in his shoulder head and knees rolled out of the double bed prodded by the urge to get on the trail of the irishman and noah his clothes from the mission to novi sad lay on the hardwood floor he tossed the tactical outfit into a training kitbag gathered up the rest of his clothes and dropped them into the laundry bin a courtesy to may his treasure of a scottish housekeeper who came three times a week to sort out his domestic life he would not think of having her pick up his clutter naked bond walked into the bathroom turned on the shower as hot as he could stand it and scrubbed himself hard with unscented soap then he turned the temperature down stood under freezing water until he could tolerate thatno longer stepped out and dried himself he examined his wounds from last night two large auberginecoloured bruises on his leg some scrapes and the slice on his shoulder from the grenade shrapnel nothing serious he shaved with a heavy doublebladed safety razor its handle of light buffalo horn he used this fine accessory not because it was greener to the environment than the plastic disposables that most men employed but simply because it gave a better shave and required some skill to wield james bond found comfort even in small challenges by seven fifteen he was dressed a navyblue canali suit a white sea island shirt and a burgundy grenadine tie the latter items from turnbull asser he donned black shoes slipons he never wore laces except for combat footwear or when tradecraft required him to send silent messages to a fellow agent via prearranged loopings onto his wrist he slipped his steel rolex oyster perpetual the mm model the date window its only complication bond did not need to know the phases of the moon or the exact moment of high tide at southampton and he suspected very few people did most days he had breakfast his favourite meal of the day at a small hotel nearby in pont street occasionally he cooked for himself one of the few things he was capable of whipping up in the kitchen three eggs softly scrambled with irish butter the steaming curds were accompanied by bacon and crisp wholemeal toast with more irish butter and marmalade today though the urgency of incident twenty was in full bloom so there was no time for food instead he brewed a cup of fiercely strong jamaica blue mountain coffee which he drank from a china mug as he listened to radio to learn whether or not the train incident and subsequent deaths had made the international news they had not his wallet and cash were in his pocket his car key too he grabbed the plastic carrier bag of the items he had collected in serbia and the locked steel box that contained his weapon and ammunition which he could not carry legally within the uk he hurried down the stairs of his flat formerly two spacious stables he unlocked the door and stepped into the garage the cramped space was large enough just for the two cars that were inside plus a few extra tyres and tools he climbed into the newer of the vehicles the latest model bentley continental gt its exterior the companys distinctive granite grey with supple black hide inside the turbo w engine murmured to life tapping the downshift paddle into first gear he eased into the road leaving behind his other vehicle less powerful and more temperamental but just as elegant a s etype jaguar which had been his fathers driving north bond manoeuvred through the traffic with tens of thousands of others who were similarly making their way to offices throughout london at the start of yet another week although of course in bonds case this mundane image belied the truth exactly the same could be said for his employer itself three years ago james bond had been sitting at a grey desk in the monolithic grey ministry of defence building in whitehall the sky outside not grey at all but the blue of a highland loch on a bright summers day after leaving the royal naval reserve he had had no desire for a job managing accounts at saatchi saatchi or reviewing balance sheets for natwest and had telephoned a former fettes fencing teammate who had suggested he try defence intelligence after a stint at di writing analyses that were described as both blunt and valuable he had wondered to his supervisor if there might be a chance to see a little more action not long after that conversation he had received a mysterious missive handwritten not an email requesting his presence for lunch in pall mall at the travellers club on the day in question bond had been led into the dining room and seated in a corner opposite a solid man in his midsixties identified only as the admiral he wore a grey suit that perfectly matched his eyes his face was jowled and his head crowned with a sparse constellation of birthmarks evident through the thinning sweptback brown and grey hair the admiral had looked steadily at bond without challenge or disdain or excessive analysis bond had no trouble in returning the gaze a man who has killed in battle and nearly died himself is not cowed by anyones stare he realised however that he had absolutely no idea what was going on in the mans mind they did not shake hands menus descended bond ordered halibut on the bone steamed with hollandaise boiled potatoes and grilled asparagus the admiral selected the grilled kidney and bacon then asked bond wine yes please you choose burgundy i should think bond said côte de beaune or a chablis the alex gambal puligny perhaps the waiter suggested perfect the bottle arrived a moment later the waiter smoothly displayed the label and poured a little into bonds glass the wine was the colour of pale butter earthy and excellent and exactly the right temperature not too chilled bond sipped nodded his approval and the glasses were half filled when the waiter had departed the older man said gruffly youre a veteran and so am i neither of us has any interest in smalltalk ive asked you here to discuss a career opportunity i thought as much sir bond hadnt intended to add the final word but it had been impossible not to do so you may be familiar with the rule at the travellers about not exposing business documents afraid well have to break it the older man withdrew from his breast pocket an envelope he handed it over this is similar to the official secrets act declaration ive signed one of course you have for defence intelligence the man said briskly revealing his impatience at stating the obvious this has a few more teeth read it bond did so more teeth indeed to put it mildly the admiral said if youre not interested in signing well finish our lunch and discuss the recent election or trout fishing in the north or how those damn kiwis beat us again last week and get back to our offices he lifted a bushy eyebrow bond hesitated only a moment then scrawled his name across the line and handed it back the document vanished a sip of wine the admiral asked have you heard of the special operations executive i have yes bond had few idols but high on the list was winston churchill in his young days as a reporter and soldier in cuba and sudan churchill had formed a great respect for guerrilla operations and later after the outbreak of the second world war he and the minister for economic warfare hugh dalton had created the soe to arm partisans behind german lines and to parachute in british spies and saboteurs also called churchills secret army it had caused immeasurable harm to the nazis good outfit the admiral said then grumbled they closed it down after the war interagency nonsense organisational difficulties infighting at mi and whitehall he took a sip of the fragrant wine and conversation slowed while they ate the meal was superb bond said so the admiral rasped chef knows what hes about no aspirations to cook his way on to american television are you familiar with how five and six got going yes sir ive read quite a lot about it in in response to concerns about a german invasion and spies within england concerns that had been prompted curiously by popular thriller novels the admiralty and the war office had formed the secret service bureau not long after that the ssb split into the directorate of military intelligence section or mi to handle domestic security and section or mi to handle foreign espionage six was the oldest continuously operating spy organisation in the world despite chinas claim to the contrary the admiral said whats the one element that stands out about them both bond couldnt begin to guess plausible deniability the older man muttered both five and six were created as cutouts so that the crown the prime minister the cabinet and the war office didnt have to get their hands dirty with that nasty business of spying just as bad now lot of scrutiny of what five and six do sexedup dossiers invasion of privacy political snooping rumours of illegal targeted killings everybodys clamouring for transparency of course no one seems to care that the face of war is changing that the other side doesnt play by the rules much any more another sip of wine theres thinking in some circles that weneed to play by a different set of rules too especially after nineeleven and sevenseven bond said so if i understand correctly youre talking about starting a new version of the soe but one that isnt technically part of six five or the mod the admiral held bonds eye i read those reports of your performance in afghanistan royal naval reserve yet still you managed to get yourself attached to forward combat units on the ground took some doing the cool eyes regarded him closely i understand you also managed some missions behind the lines that werent quite so official thanks to you some fellows who could have caused quite a lot of mischief never got the chance bond was about to sip from his glass of pulignymontrachet the highest incarnation of the chardonnay grape he set the glass down without doing so how the devil had the old man learnt about those in a low even voice the man said theres no shortage of special air or boat service chaps about who know their way around a knife and sniper rifle but they dont necessarily fit into other shall we say subtler situations and then there are plenty of talented five and six fellows who know the difference between he glanced at bonds glass a côte de beaune and a côte de nuits and can speak french as fluently as they can arabic but whod faint at the sight of blood theirs or anyone elses the steel eyes zeroed in you seem to be a rather rare combination of the best of both the admiral put down his knife and fork on the bone china your question my about a new version of the special operations executive the answer is yes in fact it already exists would you be interested in joining i would bond said without hesitation though i should like to ask what exactly does it do the admiral thought for a moment as if polishing burrs off his reply our mission he said is simple we protect the realm by any means necessary in the sleek purring bentley bond now approached the headquarters of this very organisation near regents park after half an hour of the zigzagging that driving in central london necessitates the name of his employer was nearly as vague as that of the special operations executive the overseas development group the directorgeneral was the admiral known only as m officially the odg assisted britishbased companies in opening or expanding foreign operations and investing abroad bonds oc or official cover within it was as a security and integrity analyst his job was to travel the world and assess business risks no matter that the moment he landed he assumed an noc a nonofficialcover with a fictitious identity tucked away the excel spreadsheets put on his tactical outfit and armed himself with a rifle with nikon buckmasters scope or perhaps hed slip into a wellcut savile row suit to play poker with a chechnyan arms dealer in a private kiev club for the chance to assess his security detail in a runup to the evenings main event the mans rendition to a black site in poland tucked away inconspicuously in the hierarchy of the foreign and commonwealth office the odg was housed in a narrow sixstorey edwardian building on a quiet road just off devonshire street it was separated from bustling marylebone road by lacklustre but camouflaging solicitors quarters ngo offices and doctors surgeries bond now motored to the entrance of the tunnel leading to the car park beneath the building he glanced into the iris scanner then was vetted again this time by a human being the barrier lowered and he eased the car forward in search of a parking bay the lift too checked bonds blue eyes then took him up to the ground floor he stepped into the armourers office beside the pistol range and handed the locked steel box to redheaded freddy menzies a former corporal in the sas and one of the finest firearms men in the business he would make sure the walther was cleaned oiled and checked for damage the magazines filled with bonds preferred loads shell be ready in half an hour menzies said she behave herself bond had professional affection for certain tools of his trade but he didnt personify them and if anything a calibre walther even the compact police pistol short would definitely be a he acquitted itself well he replied he took the lift to the third floor where he stepped out and turned left walking down a bland whitepainted corridor the walls a bit scuffed their monotony broken by prints of london from the era of cromwell to victorias reign and of battlefields aplenty someone had brightened up the windowsills with vases of greenery fake of course the real thing would have meant employing external maintenance staff to water and prune bond spotted a young woman in front of a desk at the end of a large open area filled with work stations sublime he had thought upon meeting her a month ago her face was heartshaped with high cheekbones and surrounded by rossetti red hair that cascaded from her marvellous temples to past her shoulders a tiny offcentre dimple which he found completely charming distressed her chin her hazel eyes golden green held yours intently and to bond her figure was as a womans should be slim and elegant her unpainted nails were trimmed short today she was in a kneelength black skirt and an apricot shirt highnecked yet thin enough to hint at lace beneath managing to be both tasteful and provocative her legs were embraced by nylon the colour of café au lait stockings or tights bond couldnt help but wonder ophelia maidenstone was an intelligence analyst with mi she was stationed with the odg as a liaison officer because the group was not an intelligencegathering organisation it was operational tactical largely accordingly like the cabinet and the prime minister it was a consumer of product as intelligence was called and the odgs main supplier was six admittedly phillys appearance and forthright manner were what had initially caught bonds attention just as her tireless efforts and resourcefulness had held it equally alluring though was her love of driving her favourite vehicle was a bsa spitfire the a one of the most beautiful motorcycles ever made it wasnt the most powerful bike in the birmingham small arms line but it was a true classic and when properly tuned which god bless her she did herself it left a broad streak of rubber at the takeoff line shed told bond she liked to drive in all weather and had bought an insulated leather jumpsuit that let her take to the roads whenever she fancied hed imagined it as an extremely tightfitting garment and arched an eyebrow hed received in return a sardonic smile which told him that his gesture had ricocheted like a badly placed bullet she was it emerged engaged to be married the ring which hed noted immediately was a deceptive ruby so that settled that philly now looked up with an infectious smile james hello why are you looking at me like that i need you she tucked back a loose strand of hair delighted to help if i could but ive got something on for john hes in sudan theyre about to start shooting the sudanese had been fighting the british the egyptians other nearby african nations and themselves for more than a hundred years the eastern alliance several sudanese states near the red sea wanted to secede and form a moderate secular country the regime in khartoum still buffeted by the recent independence movement in the south was not pleased by this initiative bond said i know i was the one going originally i drew belgrade instead the foods better she said with studied gravity if you like plums its just that i collected some things in serbia that should be looked into its never just with you james her mobile buzzed she frowned peering at the screen as she took the call her piercing hazel eyes swung his way and regarded him with some humour she said into the phone i see when she had disconnected she said you pulled in some favours or bullied someone me never it seems that war in africa will have to soldier on without me so to speak she went to another work station and handed the khartoum baton to a fellow spook bond sat down there seemed to be something different about her space but he couldnt work out what it was perhaps shed tidied it or rearranged the furniture as far as anyone could in the tiny area when she came back she focused her eyes on him right then im all yours what do we have incident twenty ah that i wasnt on the hot list so youd better brief me like bond ophelia maidenstone was developed vetting cleared by the defence vetting agency the fco and scotland yard which permitted virtually unlimited access to topsecret material short of the most classified nucleararms data he briefed her on noah the irishman the threat on friday and the incident in serbia she took careful notes i need you to play detective inspector this is all we have to go on he handed her the carrier bag containing the slips of paper hed snatched from the burning car outside novi sad and his own sunglasses ill need identification fast very fast and anything else you dig up she lifted her phone and requested collection of the materials for analysis at the mi laboratory or if that proved insufficient scotland yards extensive forensic operation in specialist crimes she rang off runners on his way she found a pair of tweezers in her handbag and extracted the two slips of paper one was a bill from a pub near cambridge the date recent it had been settled in cash unfortunately the other slip of paper read boots march no later than thatwas it code or merely a reminder from two months ago to pick up something at the chemist and the oakleys she was gazing down into the bag theres a fingerprint in the middle of the right lens the irishmans partner there was no pocket litter she made copies of the two documents handed him a set kept one for herself and replaced the originals in the bag with the glasses bond then explained about the hazardous material that the irishman was trying to spill into the danube i need to know what it was and what kind of damage it could have caused afraid ive ruffled some feathers among the serbs they wont want to cooperate well see about that just then his mobile buzzed he looked at the screen though he knew this distinctive chirp quite well he answered moneypenny the womans low voice said hello james welcome back m he asked m the sign beside the topfloor office read directorgeneral bond stepped into the anteroom where a woman in her midthirties sat at a tidy desk she wore a pale cream camisole beneath a jacket that was nearly the same shade as bonds a long face handsome and regal eyes that could flick from stern to compassionate faster than a formula one gearbox hello moneypenny itll just be a moment james hes on the line to whitehall again her posture was upright her gestures economical not a hair was out of place he reflected as he often did that her military background had left an indelible mark shed resigned her commission with the royal navy to take her present job with m as his personal assistant just after hed joined the odg bond had dropped into her office chair and flashed a broad smile rank of lieutenant were you moneypenny hed quipped id prefer to picture you aboveme bond had left the service as a commander hed received in reply not the searing rejoinder he deserved but a smooth riposte oh but ive found in life james that all positions must be earned through experience and im pleased to say i have little doubt that my level of such does not beginto approach yours the cleverness and speed of her retort and the use of his first name along with her radiant smile instantly and immutably defined their relationship shed kept him in his place but opened the avenue of friendship so it had remained ever since caring and close but always professional still he harboured the belief that of all the section agents she liked him best moneypenny looked him over and frowned you had quite a time of it over there i heard you could say so she glanced at ms closed door and said this noah situations a tough one james signals flying everywhere he left at nine last night came in at five this morning she added in a whisper he was worried about you there were some moments last night when you were incommunicado he was on the phone quite often then they saw a light on her phone extinguish she hit a button and spoke through a nearly invisible stalk mike its sir she nodded at the door towards which bond now walked as the donotdisturb light above it flashed on this occurred silently of course but bond always imagined the illumination was accompanied by the sound of a deadbolt crashing open to admit a new prisoner to a medieval dungeon morning sir m looked exactly the same as he had at the travellers club lunch when theyd met three years ago and might have been wearing the same grey suit he gestured to one of the two functional chairs facing the large oak desk bond sat down the office was carpeted and the walls were lined with bookshelves the building was at the fulcrum where old london became new and ms windows in the corner office bore witness to this to the west marylebone high streets period buildings contrasted sharply with euston roads skyscrapers of glass and metal sculptures of high concept and questionable aesthetics and lift systems cleverer than you were these scenes however remained dim even on sunny days since the window glass was both bomb and bulletproof and mirrored to prevent spying by any ingenious enemy hanging from a hotair balloon over regents park m looked up from his notes and scanned bond no medical report i gather nothing escaped him ever a scratch or two not serious the mans desk held a yellow pad a complicated console phone his mobile an edwardian brass lamp and a humidor stocked with the narrow black cheroots m sometimes allowed himself on drives to and from whitehall or during his brief walks through regents park when he was accompanied by his thoughts and two p branch guards bond knew very little of ms personal life only that he lived in a regency manorhouse on the edge of windsor forest and was a bridge player a fisherman and a rather accomplished watercolourist of flowers a personable and talented navy corporal named andy smith drove him about in a wellpolished tenyearold rollsroyce give me your report bond organised his thoughts m did not tolerate a muddled narrative or padding ums and ers were as unacceptable as stating the obvious he reiterated what had happened in novi sad then added i found a few things in serbia that might give us some details phillys sorting them now and finding out about the hazmat on the train philly bond recalled that m disliked the use of nicknames even though he was referred to exclusively by one throughout the organisation ophelia maidenstone he explained our liaison from six if theres anything to be found shell sniff it out your cover in serbia i was working false flag the senior people at bia in belgrade know im with the odg and what my mission was but we told their two field agents i was with a fictional un peacekeeping outfit i had to mention noah and the incident on friday in case the bia agents stumbled across something referring to them but whatever the irishman got out of the younger man it wasnt compromising the yard and five are wondering with the train in novi sad do you think incident twentys about sabotaging a railway line here serbia was a dry run i wondered that too sir but it wouldnt be the sort of operation thatd need much rehearsal besides the irishmans partner rigged the derailment in about three minutes our rail systems here must be more sophisticated than a freight line in rural serbia a bushy eyebrow rose perhaps disputing that assumption but m said youre right it doesnt seem like a prelude to incident twenty now bond sat forward what id like to do sir is get back to station y immediately enter through hungary and set up a rendition op to track down the irishman ill take a couple of our doubleone agents with me we can trace the lorry he stole itll be tricky but m was shaking his head rocking back in his wellworn throne it seems theres a bit of a flap it involves you whatever belgrades saying the young agent who died m waved a hand impatiently yes yes of course what happened was their fault there was never any question about that explanation is a sign of weakness dont know why youre doing it now sorry sir im speaking of something else last night cheltenham managed to get a satellite image of the lorry the irishman escaped in very good sir so his tracking tactic had apparently succeeded but ms scowl suggested bonds satisfaction was premature about fifteen miles south of novi sad the lorry pulled over and the irishman got into a helicopter no registration or id but gchq got a masint profile of it material and signature intelligence was the latest in hightech espionage if information came from electronic sources like microwave transmissions or radio it was elint from photographs and satellite images imint from mobile phones and emails sigint and from human sources humint with masint instruments collected and profiled data such as thermal energy sound waves airflow disruption propeller and helicopter rotor vibrations exhaust from jet engines trains and cars velocity patterns and more the directorgeneral continued last night five registered a masint profile that matched the helicopter he escaped in bloody hell if mi had found the chopper that meant it was in england the irishman the sole lead to noah and incident twenty was in the one place where james bond had no authority to pursue him m added the helicopter landed northeast of london at about one am and vanished they lost all track he shook his head i dont see why whitehall didnt give us more latitude about operating at home when they chartered us would have been easy hell what if youd followed the irishman to the london eye or madame tussauds what should you have done rung for gods sake these are the days of globalisation of the internet the eu yet we cant follow leads in our own country the rationale for this rule however was clear mi conducted brilliant investigations mi was a master at foreign intelligence gathering and disruptive action such as destroying a terrorist cell from within by planting misinformation the overseas development group did rather more including occasionally if rarely ordering its section agents to lie in wait for enemies of the state and shoot them dead but to do so within the uk however morally justifiable or tactically convenient would play rather badly among bloggers and the fleet street scribblers not to mention that the crowns prosecutors might be counted on to have a say in the matter as well but politics aside bond adamantly wanted to pursue incident twenty hed developed a particular dislike for the irishman his words to m were measured i think im in the best position to find this man and noah and to suss out what theyre up to i want to keep on it sir i thought as much and i wantyou to pursue it ive been on the phone this morning with five and specialist operations at the yard theyre both willing to let you have a consulting role consulting bond said sourly then realised that m would have done some impressive negotiating to achieve that much thank you sir m deflected the words with a jerk of his head youll be working with someone from division three a fellow named osbornesmith division three british security and police operations were like human beings forever being born marrying producing progeny dying and even bond had once joked undergoing sexchange operations division three was one of the more recent offspring it had some loose affiliation with five in much the same way that the odg had a gossamer thin connection to six plausible deniability while five had broad investigation and surveillance powers it had no arrest authority or tactical officers division three did it was a secretive reclusive group of hightech wizards bureaucrats and former sas and sbs tough boys with serious firepower bond had been impressed with its recent successes in taking down terrorist cells in oldham leeds and london m regarded him evenly i know youre used to having carte blancheto handle the mission as you see fit you have your independent streak and its served you well in the past a dark look most of the time but at home your authoritys limited significantly do i make myself clear yes sir so no longer carte blanche bond reflected angrily more carte grise another dour glance from m now a complication that security conference security conference havent read your whitehall briefing m asked petulantly these were administrative announcements about internal government matters and accordingly no bond did not read them sorry sir ms jowls tightened we have thirteen security agencies in the uk maybe more as of this morning the heads of five six soca jtac so thirteen di the whole lot myself included will be holed up in whitehall for three days later in the week oh the cia and some chaps from the continent too briefings on islamabad pyongyang venezuela beijing jakarta and therell probably be some young analyst in harry potter glasses touting his theory that the chechnyan rebels are responsible for that damned volcano in iceland a bloody inconvenience the whole thing he sighed ill be largely incommunicado chief of staff will be running the incident twenty operation for the group yes sir ill coordinate with him get on to it and remember youre operating in the uk treat it like a country youve never been to which means for gods sake be diplomatic with the natives its pretty bad sir are you sure you want to see it to the foreman the man replied immediately yes right then ill drive you out who else knows just the shift chief and the lad what found it casting a glance at his boss the man added theyll keep quiet if thats what you want severan hydt said nothing under an overcast and dusty sky the two men left the loading bay of the ancient headquarters building and walked to a nearby car park they climbed into a peoplecarrier emblazoned with the logo of green way international disposal and recycling the company name was printed over a delicate drawing of a verdant leaf hydt didnt much care for the design which struck him as mockingly trendy but hed been told that the image had scored well in focus groups and was good for public relations ah the public hed responded with veiled contempt and reluctantly approved it he was a tall man six foot three and broadshouldered his columnar torso encased in a bespoke suit of black wool his massive head was covered with thick curly hair black streaked with white and he wore a matching beard his yellowing fingernails extended well past his fingertips but were carefully filed they were long by design not neglect hydts pallor accentuated his dark nostrils and darker eyes framed by a long face that appeared younger than his fiftysix years he was a strong man still having retained much of his youthful muscularity the van started through his companys dishevelled grounds more than a hundred acres of low buildings rubbish tips skips hovering seagulls smoke dust and decay as they drove over the rough roads hydts attention momentarily slipped to a construction about half a mile away a new building was nearing completion it was identical to two that stood already in the grounds fivestorey boxes from which chimneys rose the sky above them rippling from the rising heat the buildings were known as destructors a victorian word that severan hydt loved england was the first country in the world to make energy from municipal refuse in the s the first power plant to do so was built in nottingham and soon hundreds were operating throughout the country producing steam to generate electricity the destructor now nearing completion in the middle of his disposal and recycling operation was no different in theory from its gloomy dickensian forebears save that it used scrubbers and filters to clean the dangerous exhaust and was far more efficient burning rdf refusederived fuel as it produced energy that was pumped for profit of course into the london and home county power grids indeed green way international plc was simply the latest in a long british tradition of innovation in refuse disposal and reclamation henry iv had decreed that rubbish should be collected and removed from the streets of towns and cities on threat of forfeit mudlarks had kept the banks of the thames clean for entrepreneurial profit not government wages and rag pickers had sold scraps of wool to mills for the production of cheap cloth called shoddy in london as early as the nineteenth century women and girls had been employed to sift through incoming refuse and sort it according to future usefulness the british paper company had been founded to manufacture recycled paper in green way was located nearly twenty miles east of london well past the boxed sets of office buildings on the isle of dogs and the seamine of the o past the ramble of canning town and silvertown the docklands to reach it you turned southeast off the a and drove towards the thames soon you were down to a narrow lane unwelcoming even forbidding surrounded by nothing but brush and stalky plants pale and translucent as a dying patients skin the tarmac strip seemed a road to nowhere until it crested a low rise and ahead you could see green ways massive complex forever muted through a haze in the middle of this wonderland of rubbish the van now stopped beside a battered skip six feet high twenty long two workers somewhere in their forties wearing tan green way overalls stood uncomfortably beside it they didnt look any less uneasy now that the owner of the company himself no less was present crikey one whispered to the other hydt knew they were also cowed by his black eyes the tight mass of his beard and his towering frame and then there were those fingernails he asked in there the workers remained speechless and the foreman the name jack dennisonstitched on his overalls said thats right sir then he snapped to one of the workers right sunshine dont keep mr hydt waiting he hasnt got all day has he the employee hurried to the side of the skip and with some effort pulled the large door open assisted by a spring inside were the ubiquitous mounds of green bin liners and loose junk bottles magazines and newspapers that people had been too lazy to separate for recycling and there was another item of discard inside a human body a womans or teenage boys to judge from the stature there wasnt much else to go on since clearly death had occurred months ago he bent down and probed with his long fingernails this enjoyable examination confirmed the corpse was a womans staring at the loosening skin the protruding bones the insect and animal work on what was left of the flesh hydt felt his heart quicken he said to the two workers youll keep this to yourselves theyll keep quiet yes sir of course sir wait over there they trotted away hydt glanced at dennison who nodded that theyd behave themselves hydt didnt doubt it he ran green way more like a military base than a rubbish tip and recycling yard security was tight mobile phones were banned all outgoing communications monitored and discipline harsh but in compensation severan hydt paid his people very very well a lesson of history was that professional soldiers stuck around far longer than amateurs provided you had the money and that particular commodity was never in short supply at green way disposing of what people no longer wanted had always been and would forever be a profitable endeavour alone now hydt crouched beside the body the discovery of human remains here happened with some frequency sometimes workers in the construction debris and reclamation division of green way would find victorian bones or desiccated skeletons in building foundations or a corpse was that of a homeless person dead from exposure to the elements drink or drugs hurled unceremoniously upon the bin liners sometimes it was a murder victim in which case the killers were usually polite enough to bring the body here directly hydt never reported the deaths the presence of the police was the last thing he wanted besides why should he give up such a treasure he eased closer to the body knees pressing against what was left of the womans jeans the smell of decay like bitter wet cardboard would be unpleasant to most people but discard had been hydts lifelong profession and he was no more repulsed by it than a garage mechanic is troubled by the scent of grease or an abattoir worker the odour of blood and viscera dennison the foreman however stood back some distance from the perfume with one of his jaundiced fingernails hydt reached forward and stroked the top of the skull from which most of the hair was missing then the jaw the finger bones the first to be exposed her nails too were long though not because they had grown after her death which was a myth they simply appearedlonger because the flesh beneath them had shrunk he studied his new friend for a long moment then reluctantly eased back he looked at his watch he pulled his iphone from his pocket and took a dozen pictures of the corpse then he glanced around him he pointed to a deserted spot between two large mounds over landfills like barrows holding phalanxes of fallen soldiers tell the men to bury it there yes sir dennison replied as he walked back to the peoplecarrier he said not too deep and leave a marker so ill be able to find it again half an hour later hydt was in his office scrolling through the pictures hed taken of the corpse lost in the images sitting at the threehundredyearold gaol door mounted on legs that was his desk finally he slipped the phone away and turned his dark eyes to other matters and there were many green way was one of the world leaders in the disposal reclamation and recycling of discard the office was spacious and dimly lit located on the top storey of green ways headquarters an old meatprocessing factory dating to renovated and turned into what interior design magazines might call shabby chic on the walls were architectural relics from buildings his company had demolished scabby painted frames around cracked stained glass concrete gargoyles wildlife effigies mosaics st george and the dragon were represented several times st joan too on one large basrelief zeus operating undercover as a swan had his way with beautiful leda hydts secretary came and went with letters for his signature reports for him to read memos to approve financial statements to consider green way was doing extremely well at a recyclingindustry conference hydt had once joked that the adage about certainty in life should not be limited to the wellknown two people had to pay taxes they had to die and they had to have their discard collected and disposed of his computer chimed and he called up an encrypted email from a colleague out of the country it was about an important meeting tomorrow tuesday confirming times and locations the last line stirred him the number of dead tomorrow will be significant close to hope that suits it did indeed and the desire that had arisen within him when hed first gazed at the body in the skip churned all the hotter he glanced up as a slim woman in her midsixties entered wearing a dark trouser suit and black shirt her hair was white cut in a businesswomans bob a large unadorned diamond hung from a platinum chain around her narrow neck and similar stones though in more complex arrangements graced her wrists and several fingers ive approved the proofs jessica barnes was an american shed come from a small town outside boston the regional lilt continued charmingly to tint her voice a beauty queen years ago shed met hydt when she was a hostess at a smart new york restaurant theyd lived together for several years and to keep her close hed hired her to review green ways advertisements another endeavour hydt had little respect for or interest in hed been told however that shed made some good decisions from time to time with regard to the companys marketing efforts but as hydt gazed at her he saw that something about her was different today he found himself studying her face that was it his preference insistence was that she wore only black and white and kept her face free of makeup today she had on some very faint blush and perhaps he couldnt quite be certain some lipstick he didnt frown but she saw the direction of his eyes and shifted a bit breathing a little differently her fingers started towards a cheek she stopped her hand but the point had been made she proffered the ads do you want to look at them im sure theyre fine he said ill send them off she left his office her destination not the marketing department hydt knew but the cloakroom where she would wash her face jessica was not a foolish woman shed learned her lesson then she was gone from his thoughts he stared out of the window at his new destructor he was very aware of the event coming up on friday but at the moment he couldnt get tomorrow out of his head the number of dead close to his gut twisted pleasantly it was then that his secretary announced on the intercom mr dunnes here sir ah good a moment later niall dunne entered and swung the door shut so that the two were alone the cumbersome mans trapezoid face had rarely flickered with emotion in the nine months theyd known each other severan hydt had little use for most people and no interest in social niceties but dunne chilled even him now what happened over there hydt asked after the incident in serbia dunne had said they should keep their phone conversations to a minimum the man turned his pale blue eyes to hydt and explained in his belfast accent that he and karic the serbian contact had been surprised by several men at least two bia serbian intelligence officers masquerading as police and a westerner whod told the serbian agent he was with the european peacekeeping and monitoring group hydt frowned its there is no such group dunne said calmly it had to be a private operation there was no backup no central communications no medics the westerner probably bribed the intelligence officers to help him it isthe balkans after all may have been a competitor he added maybe one of your partners or a worker here let slip something about the plan he was referring to gehenna of course they did everything they could to keep the project secret but a number of people around the world were involved it wasnt impossible that thered been a leak and some crime syndicate was interested in learning more about it dunne continued i dont want to minimise the risk they were pretty clever but it wasnt a major coordinated effort im confident we can go forward dunne handed hydt a mobile phone use this one for our conversations better encryption hydt examined it did you get a look at the westerner no there was a lot of smoke and karic i killed him the blank face registered the same emotion as if hed said yes its cool outside today hydt considered what the man had told him no one was more precise or cautious when it came to analysis than niall dunne if he was convinced this was no problem then hydt would accept his judgement dunne continued im going up to the facility now once i get the last materials up there the team say they can finish in a few hours a fire flared within hydt ignited by an image of the womans body in the skip and the thought of what awaited up north ill come with you dunne said nothing finally he asked in a monotone you think thats a good idea might be risky he offered this as if hed detected the eagerness in hydts voice dunne seemed to feel that nothing good could come out of a decision based on emotion ill chance it hydt tapped his pocket to make certain his phone was there he hoped thered be an opportunity to take some more photographs after leaving ms lair bond walked up the corridor he greeted a smartly dressed asian woman keyboarding deftly at a large computer and stepped into the doorway behind her youve bought the duty he said to the man hunched over a desk as loaded with papers and files as ms was empty i have indeed bill tanner looked up im now the grand overlord of incident twenty take a pew james he nodded to an empty chair or rather the empty chair the office boasted a number of seats but the rest were serving as outposts for more files as bond sat the odgs chief of staff asked so most important did you get some decent wine and a gourmet meal on sas air last night an apache helicopter courtesy of the special air service had plucked bond from a field south of the danube and whisked him to a nato base in germany where a hercules loaded with van parts completed his journey to london he said apparently they forgot to stock the galley tanner laughed the retired army officer a former lieutenant colonel was a solid man in his fifties ruddy of complexion and upright in all senses of the word he was in his usual uniform dark trousers and light blue shirt with the sleeves rolled up tanner had a tough job running the odgs daytoday operations and by rights he should have had little sense of humour though in fact he had a fine one hed been bonds mentor when the young agent had joined and was now his closest friend within the organisation tanner was a devout golfer and every few weeks he and bond would try to get out to one of the more challenging courses like royal cinque ports or royal st georges or if time was tight sunningdale near windsor tanner was of course generally familiar with incident twenty and the hunt for noah but bond now updated him and explained about his own downsized role in the uk operation the chief of staff gave a sympathetic laugh carte grise eh must say youre taking it rather well hardly have much choice bond allowed is whitehall still convinced that the threats out of afghanistan lets just say they hopeits based there tanner said his voice low for several reasons you can probably work them out for yourself he meant politics of course then he nodded towards ms office did you catch his opinion on that security conference hes been shanghaied to attend this week not much room for interpretation bond said tanner chuckled bond glanced at his watch and stood up ive got to meet a man from division three osbornesmith you know anything about him ah percy bill tanner raised a cryptic eyebrow and smiled good luck james he said perhaps its best just to leave it at that o branch took up nearly the entire fourth floor it was a large open area ringed with agents offices in the centre were work stations for pas and other support staff it might have been the sales department of a major supermarket if not for the fact that every office door had an iris scanner and keypad lock there were many flatscreen computers in the centre but none of the giant monitors that seemed de rigueur in spy outfits on tv and in movies bond strode through this busy area and nodded a greeting to a blonde in her mid twenties perched forward in her office chair presiding over an ordered work space had mary goodnight worked for any other department bond might have invited her to dinner and seen where matters led from there but she wasnt in any other department she was fifteen feet from his office door and was his human diary his portcullis and drawbridge and was capable of repelling the unannounced firmly and most important in government service with unimprovable tact although none were on view goodnight occasionally received from office mates friends and dates cards or souvenirs inspired by the film titanic so closely did she resemble kate winslet good morning goodnight that play on words and others like it had long ago moved from flirtatiousness to affection they had become like an endearment between spouses almost automatic and never tiresome goodnight ran through his appointments for the day but bond told her to cancel everything hed be meeting a man from division three coming over from thames house and afterwards he might have to be off at a minutes notice shall i hold the signals too she asked bond considered this i suppose ill plough through them now should probably clear my desk anyway if i have to be away i dont want to come back to a weeks worth of reading she handed him the topsecret greenstriped folders with approval from the keypad lock and iris scanner beside his door bond entered his office and turned on the light the space wasnt small by london office standards about fifteen by fifteen but was rather sterile his governmentissue desk was slightly larger than but the same colour as his desk at defence intelligence the four wooden bookshelves were filled with volumes and periodicals that had been or might be helpful to him and varied in subject from the latest hacking techniques used by the bulgarians to thai idioms to a guide for reloading lapua sniper rounds there was little of a personal nature to brighten the room the one object he might have had on display his conspicuous gallantry cross awarded for his duty in afghanistan was in the bottom drawer of his desk hed accepted the honour with good grace but to bond courage was simply another tool in a soldiers kit and he saw no more point in displaying indications of its past use than in hanging a spent cipher pad on the wall bond now sat in his chair and began to read the signals intelligence reports from requirements at mi suitably buffed and packaged the first was from the russia desk their station r had managed to hack into a government server in moscow and suck out some classified documents bond who had a natural facility for language and had studied russian at fort monckton skipped the english synopsis and went to the raw intelligence he got one paragraph into the leaden prose when two words stopped him in his tracks the russian words for steel cartridge the phrase pinged deep inside him just as sonar on a submarine notes a distant but definite target steel cartridge appeared to be a code name for an active measure the soviet term describing a tactical operation it had involved some deaths but there was nothing specific on operational details bond sat back staring at the ceiling he heard womens voices outside his door and looked up philly holding several files was chatting with mary goodnight bond nodded and the six agent joined him taking a wooden chair opposite his desk whatve you found philly she sat forward crossing her legs and bond believed he heard the appealing rustle of nylon first your photo skills were fine james but the light was too low i couldnt get high enough resolution of the irishmans face for recognition and there were no prints on the pub bill or the other note except for a partial of yours so the man would have to remain anonymous for the time being but the prints on the glasses were good the local was aldo karic serbian he lived in belgrade and worked for the national railway she pursed her lips in frustration which emphasised the charming dimple but its going to take a little longer than id hoped to get more details the same with the hazmat on the train nobodys saying anything you were right belgrades not in the mood to cooperate now for the slips of paper you found in the burning car i got some possible locations bond noted the printouts she was producing from a folder they were of maps emblazoned with the cheerful logo of mapquest the online directionsfinding service are you having budget problems at six id be happy to ring the treasury for you she laughed a breathy sound i used proxies of course just wanted an idea of where on the pitch were playing she tapped one the receipt the pub is here it was just off the motorway near cambridge bond stared at the map who had eaten there the irishman noah other associates or someone whod hired the car last week and had no connection whatsoever with incident twenty and the other piece of paper with the writing on it boots march no later than that she produced a lengthy list i tried to think of every possible combination of what it could mean dates footwear geographical locations the chemist her mouth tightened again she was displeased that her efforts had fallen short nothing obvious im afraid he rose and pulled down several ordnance survey maps from the shelf he flipped through one scanning carefully mary goodnight appeared in the doorway james someone downstairs to see you from division three he says percy osbornesmith philly must have caught the sea change in bonds expression ill make myself scarce now james ill keep on at the serbs theyll crack i guarantee it oh one more thing philly he handed her the signal hed just been reading i need you to catch everything you can about a soviet or russian operation called steel cartridge theres a little in here not much she glanced down at the printout he said sorry its not translated but you can probably ya govoryu po russki bond smiled weakly and with a far better accent than mine he told himself never to sell her short again philly examined the printout closely this was hacked from an online source who has the original data file one of your people would it came out of station r ill contact the russia desk she said ill want to look at the metadata coded in the file thatll have the date it was created who the author was maybe cross references to other sources she slipped the russian document into a manila folder and took a pen to tick off one of the boxes on the front how do you want it classified he debated for a moment our eyes only our she asked that pronoun was not used in official document classification yours and mine he said softly no one else a brief hesitation and then in her delicate lettering she penned at the top eyes only sis agent maidenstone odg agent james bondand priority she wondered aloud at this question bond did not hesitate at all urgent bond was sitting forward at his desk doing some research of his own in government databases when he heard footsteps approaching accompanied by a loud voice im fine just great you can peel off now please and thank you i can do without the satnav with that a man in a closefitting striped suit strode into bonds office having discarded the section p security officer whod accompanied him hed also bypassed mary goodnight who had risen with a frown as the man stormed past ignoring her he walked up to bonds desk thrusting out a fleshy palm slim but flabby unimposing he nonetheless had assertive eyes and large hands at the end of his long arms he seemed the sort to deliver a bonecrusher so bond darkening his computer screen and standing up prepared to counter it shooting his hand in close to deny him leverage in fact percy osbornesmiths clasp was brief and harmless though unpleasantly damp bond james bond he motioned the division three officer to the chair philly had just occupied and reminded himself not to let the mans coiffure dark blond hair combed and apparently glued to the side of his head pouting lips and rubbery neck deceive a weak chin did not mean a weak man as anyone familiar with field marshal montgomerys career could certify so osbornesmith said here we are excitement galore with incident twenty who thinks up these names do you wonder the intelligence committee i suppose bond tipped his head noncommittally the mans eyes swept around the office alighted briefly on a plastic gun with an orange muzzle used in closecombat training and returned to bond now from what i hear defence and six are firing up the boilers to steam down the afghan route looking for baddies in the hinterland makes you and me the awkward younger brothers left behind stuck with this serbian connection but sometimes its the pawns that win the game isnt it he dabbed his nose and mouth with a handkerchief bond couldnt recall the last time hed seen anyone under the age of seventy employ this combination of gesture and accessory heard about you bond james lets go with givens shall we my surnames a bit of a mouthful crosses to bear just like my title deputy senior director of field operations rather unskilfully inserted bond reflected so its percy and james sounds like a standup act at a comic relief show anyway ive heard about you james your reputation precedes you not exceeds of course at least not from what i hear oh god bond thought his patience already worn thin he preempted a continuation of the monologue and explained in detail what had happened in serbia osbornesmith took it all in jotting notes then he described what had happened on the british side of the channel which wasnt particularly informative even enlisting the impressive surveillance skills of mis a branch known as the watchers no one had been able to confirm more than that the helicopter carrying the irishman had landed somewhere northeast of london no masint or other trace of the chopper had been found since so our strategy osbornesmith said though not as a question rather it was a preface to a directive while defence and six and everybody under the sun are prowling the desert looking for afghans of mass destruction i want to go all out here find this irishman and noah wrap them up in tidy ribbons and bring them in arrest them well detain might be the happier word actually im not sure thats the best approach bond said delicately for gods sake be diplomatic with the natives why not we dont have time to surveille bond noticed a faint lisp only to interrogate if thousands of lives are at risk the irishman and noah cant be operating alone they might even be pretty low in the food chain all we know for sure is that there was a meeting at noahs office nothing ever suggested he was in charge of the whole operation and the irishman hes a triggerman certainly knows his craft but basically hes muscle i think we need to identify them and keep them in play until we get more answers osbornesmith was nodding agreeably ah but youre not familiar with my background james my curriculum vitae the smile and the smarminess vanished i cut my teeth grilling prisoners in northern ireland and belmarsh the infamous socalled terrorists prison in london ive sunned myself in cuba too he continued guantánamo yes indeed people end up talking to me james after ive been going at them for a few days theyll hand me the address where their brothers hiding wont they or their son or daughter oh people talk when i ask them ever so politely bond wasnt giving up but if noah has partners and they learn hes been picked up they might accelerate whatevers planned for friday or disappear and well lose them until they strike again in six or eight months when all the leadsve gone cold this irishman would have planned for a contingency like that im sure of it the soft nose wrinkled with regret its just that well if we were on the continent somewhere or padding about in red square id be de lighted to sit back and watch you bowl leg or off breaks as you thought best but well it isour cricket ground here the whip crack was of course inevitable bond decided there was no point in arguing the dandified puppet had a steel spine he also had ultimate authority and could shut out bond entirely if he wished to its your call of course bond said pleasantly so i suppose the first step is to find them let me show you the leads he passed over a copy of the pub receipt and the note boots march no later than that osbornesmith was frowning as he examined the sheets what do you make of them he asked nothing very sexy bond said the pubs outside cambridge the notes a bit of a mystery march the seventeenth a reminder to drop in at the chemist maybe bond said dubiously i was thinking it might be code he pushed forward the mapquest printout that philly had provided if you ask me the pubs probably nothing i cant find anything distinctive about it its not near anywhere important off the m near wimpole road he touched the sheet probably a waste of time but it ought to be looked into why dont i take that ill head up there and look around cambridge maybe you could run the march note past the cryptanalysts at five and see what their computers have to say that holds the key i think i will do but actually if you dont mind james its probably best if i handle the pub myself i know the lie of the land i was at cambridge magdalene the map and the pub receipt vanished into osbornesmiths briefcase with a copy of the march note then he produced another sheet of paper can you get that girl in bond lifted an eyebrow which one the pretty young thing outside single i see you mean my pa bond said drily he rose and went to the door miss goodnight would you come in please she did so frowning our friend percy wants a word with you osbornesmith missed the irony in bonds choice of names and handed the sheet of paper to her make a copy of this would you with a glance towards bond who nodded she took the document and went to the copier osbornesmith called after her doublesided of course waste works to the enemys advantage doesnt it goodnight returned a moment later osbornesmith put the original in his briefcase and handed the copy to bond you ever get out to the firearms range from time to time bond told him he didnt add six hours a week religiously indoor here with small arms outdoor with fullbore at bisley and once a fortnight he trained at scotland yards fats range the highdefinition computerised firearms training simulator in which an electrode was mounted against your back if the terrorist shot you before you shot him you ended up on your knees in excruciating pain we have to observe the formalities dont we osbornesmith gestured at the sheet in bonds hand application to become a temporary afo only a very few law enforcers authorised firearms officers could carry weapons in the uk its probably not a good idea to use my name on that bond pointed out osbornesmith seemed not to have thought of this you may be right well use a nonofficial cover why dont you john smithll do just fill it in and do the quiz on the back gun safety and all that if you hit a speed bump give me a shout ill walk you through ill get right to it good man glad thats settled well coordinate later after our respective secret missions he tapped his briefcase off to cambridge he pivoted and strode out as boisterously as hed arrived what a positively wretched man goodnight whispered bond gave a brief laugh he pulled his jacket off the back of his chair and tugged it on picked up the ordnance survey im going down to the armoury to collect my gun and after that ill be out for three or four hours what about the firearms form james ah he picked it up tore it into neat strips and slipped them into the map booklet to mark his places why waste departmental postit notes works to the enemys advantage you know an hour and a half later james bond was in his bentley continental gt a grey streak speeding north he was reflecting on his deception of percy osbornesmith hed decided that the lead to the cambridge pub wasnt in fact very promising yes possibly the incident twenty principals had eaten there the bill suggested a meal for two or three but the date was more than a week ago so it was unlikely that anyone on the staff would remember a man fitting the irishmans description and his companions and since the man had proved to be particularly clever bond suspected he rotated the places where he dined and shopped he would not be a regular there the lead in cambridge had to be followed up of course but equally important bond needed to keep osbornesmith diverted he could simply not allow the irishman or noah to be arrested and hauled into belmarsh like a drug dealer or an islamist whod been buying excessive fertiliser they needed to keep both suspects in play to discover the nature of incident twenty so bond a keen poker player had bluffed hed taken inordinate interest in the clue about the pub and had mentioned it was not far from wimpole road to most people this would have meant nothing but bond guessed that osbornesmith would know that a secret government facility connected to porton down the ministry of defence biological weapons research centre in wiltshire happened also to be on wimpole road true it was eight miles to the east on the other side of cambridge and nowhere near the pub but bond believed that associating the two would encourage the division three man to descend on the idea like a seabird spotting a fish head this relegated bond to the apparently fruitless task of wrestling with the cryptic note boots march no later than that which he believed he had deciphered most of phillys suggestions about its meaning had involved the chemist boots which had shops in every town across the uk shed also offered suggestions about footwear and about events that had taken place on march but one suggestion towards the end of her list had intrigued bond shed noted that boots and march were linked with a dash and she had found that there was a boots road that ran near the town of march a couple of hours drive north of london she had seen too the full stop between march and given that the last phrase no later than that suggested a deadline made sense as a date but was possibly may tomorrow clever of her bond had thought and in his office waiting for osbornesmith he had gone into the golden wire a secure fibreoptic network tying together records of all major british security agencies to learn what he could about march and boots road he had found some intriguing facts traffic reports about road diversions because a large number of lorries were coming and going along boots road near an old army base and public notices relating to heavy plant work references suggested that it had to be completed by midnight on the seventeenth or fines would be levied he had a hunch that this might be a solid lead to the irishman and noah and tradecraft dictated that you ignored such intuition at your peril so he was now en route to march losing himself in the consuming pleasure of driving which meant of course driving fast bond had to exercise some restraint of course since he wasnt on the n in the pyrenees or off the beaten track in the lake district but was travelling north along the a as it switched identities arbitrarily between motorway and trunk road still the speedometer needle occasionally reached mph and frequently hed tap the lever of the silken millisecondresponse quickshift gearbox to overtake a slowmoving horsebox or ford mondeo he stayed mostly in the right lane although once or twice he took to the hard shoulder for some exhilarating if illegal overtaking he enjoyed a few controlled skids on stretches of adverse camber the police were not a problem while the jurisdiction of odg was limited in the uk carte grise not blanche bond now joked to himself it was often necessary for o branch agents to get around the country quickly bond had phoned in an ndr a null detain request and his number plate was ignored by cameras and constables with speed guns ah the bentley continental gt coupé the finest offthepeg vehicle in the world bond believed he had always loved the marque his father had kept hundreds of old newspaper photos of the famed bentley brothers and their creations leaving bugattis and the rest of the field in the dust at le mans in the s and s bond himself had witnessed the astonishing bentley speed take the chequered flag at the race in back in the game after threequarters of a century it had always been his goal to own one of the stately yet wickedly fast and clever vehicles while the etype jaguar sitting below his flat had been a legacy from his father the gt had been an indirect bequest hed bought his first continental some years ago depleting what remained of the lifeinsurance payment that had come his way upon his parents deaths hed recently traded up to the new model he now came off the motorway and proceeded towards march in the heart of the fens he knew little about the place hed heard of the march march march a walk by students from march to cambridge in of course the third month of the year there was whitemoor prison and tourists came to see st wendredas church bond would have to trust the tourist offices word that it was spectacular he hadnt been inside a house of worship other than for surveillance purposes in years ahead loomed the old british army base he continued in a broad circle to the back which was surrounded by vicious barbedwire fencing and signs warning against intrusion he saw why it was being demolished so this was the work hed learnt of half a dozen buildings had already been razed only one remained three storeys high old red brick a faded sign announced hospital several large lorries were present along with bulldozers other earthmoving equipment and caravans which sat on a hill a hundred yards from the building probably the temporary headquarters for the demolition crew a black car was parked near the largest caravan but no one was about bond wondered why today was monday and not a bank holiday he nosed the car into a small copse where it could not be seen climbing out he surveyed the terrain complicated waterways potato and sugarbeet fields and clusters of trees bond donned his tactical outfit with the shrapnel tear in the shoulder of the jacket and tainted from the smell of scorching from rescuing the clue in serbia that had led him here then stepped out of his city shoes into low combat boots he clipped his walther and two holsters of ammunition to a canvas web utility belt if you hit a speed bump give me a shout he also pocketed his silencer a torch tool kit and his folding knife then bond paused going into that other place where he went before any tactical operation dead calm eyes focused and taking in every detail branches that might betray with a snap bushes that could hide the muzzle of a sniper rifle evidence of wires sensors and cameras that might report his presence to an enemy and preparing to take a life quickly and efficiently if he had to that was part of the other world too and he was all the more cautious because of the many questions this assignment had raised fit your response to your enemys purpose but what was noahs purpose indeed who the hell was he bond moved through the trees then cut across the corner of a field dotted with an early growth of sugarbeet he diverted around a fragrant bog and moved carefully through a tangle of brambles making his way towards the hospital finally he came to the barbedwire perimeter posted with warning signs eastern demolition and scrap was doing the work they announced hed never heard of the company but thought he might have seen their lorries there was something familiar about the distinctive greenandyellow colouring he scanned the overgrown field in front of the building the parade grounds behind he saw nobody then began to clip his way through the fence with wire cutters thinking how clever it would be to use the building for secret meetings relevant to incident twenty the place would soon be torn down which would destroy any evidence of its use no workers were nearby but the presence of the black car suggested someone might be inside he looked for a back door or other unobtrusive entrance five minutes later he found one a depression in the earth ten feet deep caused by the collapse of what must have been an underground supply tunnel he climbed down into the bowl and shone his torch inside it seemed to lead into the basement of the hospital about fifty yards away he started forward noting the ancient cracked brick walls and ceiling just as two bricks dislodged themselves and crashed to the floor on the ground there were smallgauge rail tracks rusting and in places covered with mud halfway along the grim passage pebbles and a stream of damp earth pelted his head he glanced up and saw that six feet above the tunnel ceiling was scored like a cracked eggshell it looked as if a handclap would bring the whole thing down on him not a great place to be buried alive bond reflected then he added wryly to himself and just where exactly wouldbe brilliant job severan hydt told niall dunne they were alone in hydts site caravan parked a hundred yards from the dark brooding british army hospital outside march since the gehenna team had been under pressure to finish the job by tomorrow hydt and dunne had halted demolition this morning and made sure that the crew stayed away most of hydts employees knew nothing of gehenna and he had to be very careful when the two operations overlapped i was satisfied dunne said flatly in the tone with which he responded to nearly everything be it praise criticism or dispassionate observation the team had left with the device half an hour ago having assembled it with the materials dunne had provided it would be hidden in a safehouse nearby until friday hydt had spent some time walking around the last building to be razed the hospital erected more than eighty years ago demolition made green way a huge amount of money the company profited from people paying to tear down what they no longer wanted and by extracting from the rubble what other people didwant wooden and steel beams wire aluminium and copper pipes beautiful copper a ragandbone mans dream but hydts interest in demolition of course went beyond the financial he now studied the ancient building in a state of tense rapture as a hunter stares at an unsuspecting animal moments before he fires the fatal shot he couldnt help but think of the hospitals former occupants too the dead and dying hydt had snapped dozens of pictures of the grand old lady as hed strolled through the rotting halls the mouldy rooms particularly the mortuary and autopsy areas collecting images of decay and decline his photographic archives included shots of old buildings as well as bodies he had quite a number some rather artistic of places like northumberland terrace palmers green on the north circular road the nowvanished pura oil works on bow creek in canning town and the gothic royal arsenal and royal laboratory in woolwich his photos of lovells wharf in greenwich a testament to what aggressive neglect could achieve never failed to move him on his mobile niall dunne was giving instructions to the driver of the lorry that had just left explaining how best to hide the device they were quite precise details in accord with his nature and that of the horrific weapon although the irishman made him uneasy hydt was grateful their paths had intersected he could not have proceeded as quickly or as safely on gehenna without him hydt had come to refer to him as the man who thinks of everything and indeed he was so severan hydt was happy to put up with the eerie silences the cold stares the awkward arrangement of robotic steel that was niall dunne the two men made an efficient partnership if an ironic one an engineer whose nature was to build a ragandbone man whose passion was destruction what a curious package we humans are predictable only in death faithful only then too hydt reflected and then discarded that thought just after dunne disconnected there was a knock on the door it opened eric janssen a green way security man whod driven them up to march stood in the doorway his face troubled mr hydt mr dunne someones gone into the building what hydt barked turning his huge equine head the mans way he went in through the tunnel dunne rattled off a number of questions was he alone had there been any transmissions that janssen had monitored was his car nearby had there been any unusual traffic in the area was the man armed the answers suggested that he was operating by himself and wasnt with scotland yard or the security service did you get a picture or a good look at him dunne asked no sir hydt clicked two long nails together the man with the serbs from last night he asked dunne the private operator not impossible but i dont know how he could have traced us here dunne gazed out of the caravans dirtspattered window as if he wasnt seeing the building hydt knew the irishman was drafting a blueprint in his mind or perhaps examining one hed already prepared in case of such a contingency for a long moment he was motionless finally drawing his gun dunne stepped out of the caravan gesturing to janssen to follow the smells of mould rot chemicals oil and petrol were overwhelming bond struggled not to cough and blinked tears from his stinging eyes could he detect smoke too the hospitals basement here was windowless only faint illumination filtered in from where hed entered the tunnel bond splayed light from his torch around him he was beside a railway turntable designed to rotate small locomotives after theyd carted in supplies or patients his walther in hand bond searched the area listening for voices footsteps the click of a weapon chambering bullets or going off safety but the place was deserted hed entered through the tunnel at the south end as he moved farther north and away from the turntable he came to a sign that prompted a brief laugh mortuary it consisted of three large windowless rooms that had clearly been occupied recently the floors were dustfree and new cheap work benches were arranged throughout one of these rooms seemed to be the source of the smoke bond saw electricity cables secured to the wall and floor with duct tape presumably providing power for lights and whatever work had been going on perhaps an electrical short had produced the fumes he left the mortuary and came to a large open space with a double door to the right east opening to the parade ground light filtered through the crack between the panels a possible escape route he noted and he memorised its location and the placement of columns that might provide cover in the event he had to make his way to it under fire ancient steel tables stained brown and black were bolted to the floor each with its own drain for postmortems of course bond continued to the north end of the building which ended in a series of smaller rooms with barred windows a sign here suggested why mental health ward he tried the doors leading up to the ground floor found them locked and returned to the three rooms next to the turntable a systematic search finally revealed the source of the smoke on the floor in the corner of one room there was an improvised hearth he spotted large curls of ash on which he could discern writing the flakes were delicate he tried to pick one up but it dissolved between his fingers careful he told himself he walked over to one of the wires running up the wall he pulled off several pieces of the silver duct tape securing the cord and sliced them into sixinch lengths with his knife he then carefully pressed them on to the grey and black ash curls slipped them into his pocket and continued his search in a second room something silvery caught his eye he hurried to the corner and found tiny splinters of metal littering the floor he picked them up with another piece of tape which he also pocketed then bond froze the building had begun to vibrate a moment later the shaking increased considerably he heard a diesel engine rattling not far away that explained why the demolition site had been deserted the workers must have been at lunch and now theyd returned he couldnt get to the ground or higher floors without going outside where hed surely be spotted it was time to leave he stepped back into the turntable room to leave through the tunnel and was saved from a broken skull by a matter of a few decibels he didnt see the attacker or hear his breathing or the hiss of whatever he swung but bond sensed a faint muting of the diesels rattle as the mans clothing absorbed the sound instinctively he leapt back and the metal pipe missed him by inches bond grabbed it firmly in his left hand and his attacker stumbled off balance too surprised to release his weapon the young blond man wore a cheap dark suit and white shirt a security mans uniform bond assessed he had no tie hed probably removed it in anticipation of the assault his eyes wide in dismay he staggered again and nearly fell but righted himself fast and clumsily launched himself into bond together they crashed to the filthy floor of the circular room he was not bond noted the irishman bond jumped up and stepped forward clenching his hands into fists but it was a feint he intended to get the muscular fellow to step back and avoid a blow which he accommodatingly did giving bond the chance to draw his weapon he didnt however fire he needed the man alive covered by bondscalibre pistol he froze although his hand went inside his jacket leave it bond said coldly lie down arms spread still the man remained motionless sweating with nerves hand hovering over the butt of his gun a glock bond noted the mans phone began to hum he glanced at his jacket pocket get down now if he drew bond would try to wound but he might end up killing the man the phone stopped ringing now bond lowered his aim focusing on the attackers right arm near the elbow it appeared the blond man was going to comply his shoulders drooped and in the shadowy light his eyes widened with fear and uncertainty at that moment though the bulldozer must have rolled over the ground nearby bricks and earth rained down from the ceiling bond was struck by a large chunk of stone he winced and stepped back blinking dust out of his eyes had his assailant been more professional or less panicked he would have drawn his weapon and fired but he didnt he turned and ran down the tunnel bond slipped into his preferred stance a fencers left foot pointing forward and the right perpendicular and behind twohanded he fired a single deafening shot that struck the man in the calf screaming he went down hard about ten yards from the entrance to the tunnel bond raced after him as he did so the shaking grew stronger the rattle louder and more bricks fell from the walls cascades of plaster and dust poured from the ceiling a cricket ball of concrete landed directly on bonds shoulder wound and he grunted at the burst of pain but he kept moving steadily along the tunnel the assailant was on the ground dragging himself towards the fissure where sunlight eased in the bulldozer seemed directly overhead now move dammit bond told himself they were probably about to knock the whole bloody place down as he got closer to the wounded man the chug chug chugof the diesel engine rose in volume more bricks plummeted to the floor not a great place to be buried alive only ten yards to the wounded man get a tourniquet on him get him out of the tunnel and under cover and start asking questions but at a stunning crash the soft illumination of the spring day at the end of the tunnel dimmed it was replaced by two burning white eyes glowing through the dust they paused and then as if they belonged to a lion spotting its prey shifted slightly turning directly towards bond with a fierce cough the bulldozer ploughed relentlessly forward pushing a surge of mud and stone before it bond aimed his gun but there was no target the blade of the machine was high protecting the operators cab the vehicle crawled steadily on pushing before it a mass of earth brick and other debris no cried the wounded man as the bulldozer pressed forward the driver didnt see him or if he did he couldnt have cared less about the mans death with a scream bonds assailant disappeared under the rocky blanket a moment later the rattling treads rolled over the spot where he was buried soon the headlights were gone blocked by debris and then all was total darkness bond clicked his torch on and sprinted back to the turntable room at the entrance he tripped and fell hard as earth and brick piled up to his ankles then calves a moment later his knees were held fast behind him the bulldozer continued to ram forward shoving the muddy detritus farther into the room bond was now gripped to the waist another thirty seconds and his face would be covered but the weight of the debris mountain proved too much for the bulldozer or perhaps it had hit the buildings foundation the tide ceased to move forward before the operator could manoeuvre for better purchase bond dug himself free and scrabbled out of the room his eyes stung his lungs were in agony spitting dust and grit he shone the torch back up the tunnel it was completely plugged he hurried back through the three windowless rooms where hed collected the ash and the bits of metal he paused beside the door that led to the autopsy chamber had they sealed the exit to force him into a trap were the irishman and other security people waiting in there he screwed the silencer on to his walther inhaling deep breaths he paused for a moment then pushed the door open fast dropping into a defensive shooting position torch pointing forward from his left hand on which rested his right clutching the pistol the massive empty hall yawned but the double doors hed seen earlier admitting a shaft of light were sealed the bulldozer had piled tons of dirt against them too trapped he sprinted to the smaller rooms on the north side of the basement the mental health ward the largest of these the office he assumed had a door but it was securely locked bond aimed the walther and standing at an oblique angle fired four wheezing shots into the metal lock plate then four into the hinges this had no effect lead even halfjacketed lead is no match for steel he reloaded and slipped the spent magazine into his left pocket where he always kept the empties he was regarding the barred windows when a loud voice made him jump attention opgelet groźba nebezpeči swinging around bond looked for a target but the voice came from a loudspeaker on the wall attention opgelet groźba nebezpeči this is the threeminute warning the last sentence a recording was repeated in dutch polish and ukrainian warning evacuate immediately danger explosive charges have been set bond shone the torch around the room the wires they werent to provide electricity for construction they were attached to explosives bond hadnt seen them since the charges were taped to steel joists high in the ceiling the entire building had been rigged for demolition three minutes the torch revealed dozens of packets of explosive enough to turn the stone walls around him to dust and bond into vapour and all the exits had been sealed his heart rate ratcheting sweat dotting his forehead bond slipped the torch and pistol away and gripped one of the iron bars over a window he tugged hard but it held in the hazy light trickling through the glass he looked about then climbed a nearby girder he ripped one of the explosive packets down and leapt back to the floor the charges were an rdx composite to judge from the smell with his knife he cut off a large wad and jammed it against the knob and lock on the door that should be enough to blow the lock without killing himself in the process get on with it bond stepped back about twenty feet steadied his aim and fired he hit the explosive dead on but as hed feared nothing happened except that the yellowgrey mass of deadly plastic fell undramatically to the floor with a plop composites explode only with a detonator not with physical impact even that of a bullet travelling at feet per second hed hoped this substance might prove the exception the twominute warning resounded through the room bond looked up to where the detonator hed pulled from the charge now dangled obscenely but the only way to set it off was with an electric current electricity the loudspeakers no the voltage was far too low to set off a blasting cap so was the battery in his torch the voice rang out again giving the oneminute warning bond wiped the sweat from his palms and worked the pistols slide ejecting a bullet with his knife he prised out the lead slug and tossed it aside he then pressed the cartridge filled with gunpowder into the wad of explosive which he moulded to the door he stepped back aimed carefully at the tiny disc of his cartridge and squeezed off a round the bullet hit the primer which set off the powder and in turn the plastic with a huge flare the explosion blew the lock to pieces it also knocked bond to the floor amid a shower of wood splinters and smoke for a few seconds he lay stunned then struggled to his feet and staggered to the door which was open though jammed the gap was only about eight inches wide he grabbed the knob and began to slowly wrest the heavy panel open attention opgelet groźba nebezpeči in the site caravan severan hydt and niall dunne stood beside each other watching the old british army hospital in tense anticipation everybody even the gearcold dunne hydt speculated enjoyed watching a controlled explosion bring down a building since janssen had not answered his phone and dunne had heard a gunshot from inside the irishman had told hydt he was sure the security man eric janssen had to be dead he had sealed the hospital exits then sprinted back to the caravan running like an awkward animal and had told hydt that he was going to detonate the charges in the building it was scheduled to come down tomorrow but there was no reason that the demolition couldnt be brought forward dunne had activated the computerised system and pressed two red buttons simultaneously starting the sequence an insurance liability policy required that a second recorded warning be broadcast throughout the building in languages representing those spoken by ninety per cent of the workers it would have taken longer to override the safety measure but if the intruder wasnt buried in the tunnel he was stuck in the mortuary there was no way he could escape in time if tomorrow or the next day someone came asking about a missing person hydt could reply certainly well check what oh my god we had no idea we did all we were supposed to with the fence and the signs and how could he have missed the recorded warnings were sorry but were hardly responsible fifteen seconds dunne said silence as hydt mouthed the countdown the timer on the wall now hit and the computer sent its prearranged signal to the detonators they couldnt see the flash of the explosions at first the initial ones were internal and low to take out the main structural beams but a few seconds later bursts of light flared like paparazzi cameras followed by the sound of christmas crackers then deeper booms the building seemed to shudder then as if kneeling to offer its neck to an executioners blade the hospital slowly dipped and went down a cloud of dust and smoke rolling outwards fast after a few moments dunne said people will have heard it we should go hydt though was mesmerised by the pile of debris so very different from the elegant if faded structure it had been a few moments ago what had been something had become naught severan dunne persisted hydt found himself aroused he thought of jessica barnes her white hair her pale textured skin she knew nothing about gehenna so he hadnt brought her today but he was sorry she wasnt there well hed ask her to meet him at his office then drive home his belly gave a pleasant tap a sensation supercharged by the memory of the body hed found at green way that morning and in anticipation of what would happen tomorrow a hundred deaths yes yes severan hydt collected his briefcase and stepped outside he didnt climb into the audi a immediately though he turned to study once more the dust and smoke hovering over the destroyed building he noted that the explosive had been skilfully set he reminded himself to thank the crew rigging charges is a true art the trick is not to blow up the building but simply to eliminate what keeps it upright allowing nature gravity in this case to do the job which was hydt now reflected a metaphor for his own role on earth earlyafternoon zebra bands of sun and shadow rolled over the low rows of sugarbeet in the fenland field james bond lay on his back arms and legs splayed like a child whod been making angels in snow and didnt want to go home surrounded by the sea of low green leaves he was thirty yards from the pile of rubble that had been the old army hospital the pile of rubble that had very nearly entombed him he was temporarily he prayed deprived of his hearing thanks to the shockwaves from the plastic explosive hed kept his eyes closed against the flash and shrapnel but hed had to use both hands to manage his escape wrenching open the mentalhealth wards door as the main charges detonated and the building came down behind him he now rose slightly sugar beet in may provided scant cover and gazed around for signs of a threat nothing whoever had been behind the plan the irishman noah or an associate wasnt searching for him they were probably convinced he had died in the collapse breathing hard to clear his lungs of dust and sour chemical smoke he got to his feet and staggered from the field he returned to the car and dropped into the front seat he fished a bottle of water from the back and drank some then leant outside and poured the rest into his eyes he fired the massive engine comforted that he could now hear the bubble of the exhaust and took a different route out of march heading east to avoid running into anyone connected with the demolition site then doubling back west soon he was on the a heading back to london to decipher whatever cryptic messages about incident twenty the scraps of ash hed collected might hold at close to four that afternoon bond pulled into the odg car park beneath the building he thought of having a shower but decided he didnt have time he washed his hands and face stuck a plaster on a small gash courtesy of a falling brick and hurried to philly he handed her the pieces of duct tape can you get these analysed for gods sake james what happened she sounded alarmed the tactical trousers and jacket had taken the bulk of the abuse but some new bruises were already showing in glorious violet little runin with a bulldozer and some c or semtex im fine find out everything you can about eastern demolition and scrap and id like to know who owns the army base outside march the mod or have they sold it ill get on to it bond returned to his office and had just sat down when mary goodnight buzzed him james that man is on line two her tone made clear who the caller was bond stabbed the button percy the slick voice james hello im en route back from cambridge thought you and me should have a chinwag see if weve found any pieces to our puzzle you and me unfortunate pronoun from an oxbridge man how about yourexcursion when i got up there i did some looking around turns out the porton down folk have a little operation nearby stumbled across it quite by chance this amused bond well thats interesting and is there a connection between biochemicals and noah or incident twenty cant say their cctvs and visitor logs didnt turn up anything that stood out but ive got my assistant toiling away and the pub curry was all right the waitress didnt remember whod ordered the pie or the ploughmans so long ago but we could hardly expect her to could we what about you did the mysterious note about the chemist and two days past the ides of march pan out bond had prepared for this i tried a long shot i went to march boots road and ran across an old military base a pause ah the division three man laughed though the sound seemed devoid of humour so youd misread the clue when we were chatting earlier and was the infamous number seventeen tomorrows date by any chance whatever else osbornesmith was sharp possibly when i got up there the place was being demolished bond added evasively it turned up more questions than anything else im afraid the techies are looking at some finds a few small things ill send over their reports do thanks im peering into all things islamic here afghan connection spikes in sigint the usual should keep me busy for a while good bond couldnt have asked for a better approach to deputy senior director of field operations mr percy osbornesmith keep him busy they rang off and bond called bill tanner to brief him about what had happened in march they agreed to do nothing for now about the body of the man who had attacked bond at the hospital preferring to keep his cover intact rather than learn anything about the corpse mary goodnight stuck her head through the door philly called when you were on the phone shes found a few things for you i told her to come up his pa was frowning her eyes turned to one of bonds dim windows a shame isnt it about philly what are you talking about i thought youd heard tim broke it off he sat her down a few days ago they even had the church booked and her hen do was planned a girls weekend in spain i was going how observant am i bond thought thats what was missing from her desk on the third floor the pictures of her fiancé probably the engagement ring had gone mia too what happened he asked i suppose its always more than one thing isnt it they hadnt been getting on well recently more than a few bad patches rows about her driving too fast and working all hours she missed a big family reunion at his parents then out of the blue he had the chance of a posting to singapore or malaysia he took it theyd been together for three years hadnt they sorry to hear that the discussion of the drama ended though with the arrival of the person in question not noticing the still atmosphere into which shed walked philly strode past goodnight with a smile and into bonds office where she dropped breezily into a chair her sensuous face seemed to have narrowed and her hazel eyes shone with the intensity of a hunter picking up sure track it made her even more beautiful a hen party in spain with the girls god he simply could notpicture that any more than he could see philly lugging home two waitrose carrier bags to assemble a hearty dinner for a man named tim and their children matilda and archie enough he upbraided himself and concentrated on what she was telling him our people could read one scrap of the ash the words were the gehenna plan and below that friday may gehenna familiar but i cant place it theres a reference to it in the bible ill find out more i only ran gehenna plan through the security agencies and criminal databases it returned negative whats on the other piece of ash that was more badly damaged our lab could make out the words term and five million pounds but the rest was beyond them they sent it to specialist crime at the yard under an eyesonly order theyll get back to me by this evening term terms of the deal id guess payment or down payment of five million for the attack or whatever its to be that suggests noahs doing it for money not for the sake of politics or ideology she nodded about the serbian connection my hungarian ploy didnt work the folk in belgrade are really quite cross with you james but i had your i branch set me up as somebody from the eu the head of the directorate of transportation safety investigations what the hells that i made it up i did a pretty good swissfrench accent though i say it myself the serbs are dying to do anything they can to keep the european union happy so theyre scurrying to get back to me about hazmats on the train and more details about karic philly was truly golden and eastern demolition have headquarters in slough they were low bidders for the demolition project at the british army base in march is it a public limited company private and owned by a holding company also private green way international its quite big and operates in half a dozen countries one man owns all the shares severan hydt thats really his name she laughed at first i wondered what his parents were thinking but it seems he changed it by deed poll when he was in his twenties what was his birth name maarten holt holt to hydt bond mused i dont see the point though its hardly remarkable but maarten to severan why in heavens name she shrugged green way is a huge rubbishcollection and recycling operation youve seen their lorries but probably havent thought much about them i couldnt find a great deal because theyre not public and hydt stays clear of the press article in the timesdubbed him the worlds richest ragandbone man the guardian ran a profile of him a few years ago and was fairly complimentary but he gave them only a few generic quotes and that was it i found out he was dutchborn kept dual citizenship for a time and is now just british phillys body language and the hunters sheen in her eyes hinted that she hadnt revealed all and bond asked she smiled i found some online references to when he was a mature student at the university of bristol where he did rather well by the way she explained that hydt had been active in the universitys sailing club captaining a boat in competitions he not only raced but built his own it earned him a nickname and what was it bond asked though he had a feeling he knew noah the time was now half past five since it would be several hours before philly received the intelligence she was waiting for bond suggested they meet for dinner she agreed and returned to her work station while bond composed an encrypted email to m copying in bill tanner saying that noah was severan hydt and including a synopsis of his background and what had happened in march he added that hydt referred to the attack involved in incident twenty as the gehenna plan more would be forthcoming he received a terse reply authorised to proceed appropriate liaison with domestic organisations expected m my carte grise bond left his office took the lift to the second floor and entered a large room filled with more computers than an electronics shop a few men and women laboured at monitors or at the type of work stations to be found in a university chemistry laboratory bond walked to a small glasswalled office at the far end and tapped on the window sanu hirani head of the odgs q branch was a slim man of forty or so his complexion was sallow and his luxuriant black hair framed a face handsome enough to get him roles in bollywood a brilliant cricketer known for his fast bowling he had degrees in chemistry electrical engineering and computer science from top universities in the uk and america where he had been successful in everything except introducing his sport to the yanks who could neither grasp the games subtleties nor tolerate the length of a test match q branch was the technical support enclave within the odg and hirani oversaw all aspects of the gadgetry that has always been used in tradecraft wizards for departments like q branch and the cias science and technology division spent their time coming up with hardware and software innovations like miniature cameras improbable weapons concealments communications devices and surveillance equipment such as hiranis latest a hypersensitive omnidirectional microphone mounted within a dead fly a bug in a bug bond had commented wryly to its creator who had replied that he was the eighteenth person to make the joke and by the way a fly was not biologically speaking a bug since the odgs raison dêtrewas operational much of hiranis work lay in ensuring he had sufficient monoculars binoculars camouflage communications devices specialised weapons and countersurveillance gear to hand in this regard he was like a librarian who made sure the books were checked out appropriately and returned on time but hiranis particular genius was his ability to invent and improvise coming up with devices like the iqphone the odg was of all things the patent holder on dozens of his inventions when bond or other o branch agents were in the field and found themselves in a tight spot one call to hirani at any time of day or night and he would find a solution he or his people might put something together in the office and pop it into the fco diplomatic pouch for overnight delivery more often though time was critical and hirani would enlist one of his many wily innovators and scroungers around the world to build find or modify a device in the field james the men shook hands youve bought incident twenty i hear seems so bond sat down noticing a book on hiranis desk the secret war of charles frasersmith it was one of his own favourites on the history of gadgetry in espionage how serious is it rather bond said laconically not sharing that hed nearly been killed twice already in pursuing the assignment which hed had for less than fortyeight hours sitting beneath pictures of early ibm computers and of indian cricketers hirani asked what do you need bond lowered his voice so that the closest q branch worker a young woman raptly staring at her screen could not hear what kind of surveillance kits do you have that one man could put in place i cant get to the subjects computer or phone but i may be able to plant something in his office vehicle or home disposable i probably cant retrieve it later ah yes hiranis luminescent eyes dimmed some problem sanu well i must tell you james not ten minutes ago i had a call from upstairs bill tanner no farther upstairs m dammit bond thought he could see where this was going hirani went on and he said that if anyone from o branch wished to check out a surveillance kit i was to let him know immediately a touch coincidental a touch bond said sourly so hirani said with a qualified smile shall i tell him that someone from o branch wishes to check out a surveillance kit perhaps you could hold off for a bit well get it sorted he said the gleam in his face restored i have some wonderfulpackages for you to choose from he sounded like a car salesman a microphone thats powered by induction you only have to place it near a power cord no battery needed itll pick up voices from fifty feet away and adjust the volume automatically so theres no distortion oh and another thing weve been having great success with is a twopound coin the ninetyfour tercentenary of the bank of england commemorative its relatively rare so a target tends to keep it for good luck but not so rare that he would sell it battery lasts for four months bond sighed the offlimits devices sounded so damn perfect he thanked the man and told him hed be in touch he returned to his office where he found mary goodnight at her desk he saw no reason for her to stay scoot on home now good evening goodnight she glanced at his latest injuries and forewent the opportunity for mothering him which from past experience she knew would be deflected she settled for see to those james then gathered up her handbag and coat sitting back bond was suddenly aware of the stench of his sweat and the crescents of brick dust under his nails he wanted to get home and shower have his first drink of the day yet there was something he had to sort out first he turned to his screen and entered the golden wires general information database from which he learnt where severan hydts business and home were located the latter curiously in a lowincome area of east london known as canning town green ways main premises were on the thames near rainham abutting the wildspace conservation park bond peered at satellite maps of hydts home and green ways operation it was vitally important to set up surveillance on the man but there was no legitimate way to conduct it without enlisting osbornesmith and the a branch snoop teams from mi and the instant the division three man learnt hydts identity hed move in to detain him and the irishman bond considered the risk again how realistic was his concern that if the two were pulled in other coconspirators would accelerate the carnage or vanish until they struck again next month or next year evil james bond had learnt can be tirelessly patient surveillance or not he debated after a moments hesitation he reluctantly picked up the phone at half past six bond drove to his flat and in the garage reversed into the spot beside his racinggreen jaguar he climbed the stairs to the first floor unlocked the door disarmed the alarm and confirmed with a separate security function a fastframed video that only may his housekeeper had been there feeling somewhat embarrassed hed told her when shed started working for him that the security camera was a requirement of his government employers the flat had to be monitored when he was away even if she was working there considering what you must do for the country being a patriot and all its no bothers the staunch woman had said using the fragment of sir a mark of respect reserved for him alone he checked messages on his home phone he had only one it was from a friend who lived in mayfair fouad kharaz a wily largerthanlife jordanian who had all manner of business dealings involving vehicles mostly cars planes and the most astonishing yachts bond had ever seen kharaz and he were members of the same gaming club in berkeley square the commodore unlike many such clubs in london where membership could be had with twentyfour hours notice and five hundred pounds the commodore was a proper establishment requiring patience and considerable vetting to join once you were a member you were expected to adhere strictly to a number of rules such as the dress code and behave impeccably at the tables it also boasted a fine restaurant and cellar kharaz had called to invite bond to dine there tonight a problem james i have fallen heir to two beautiful women from sainttropez how it happened is too long and delicate a story to leave as a message but i cant be charming enough for both of them will you help smiling bond rang him back and told him he had another engagement a rain check was arranged then he went through his shower ritual steaming hot then icy cold and dried himself briskly he ran his fingers over his cheeks and chin and decided to maintain a lifelong prejudice against shaving twice in one day then he chided himself why were you even thinking about it philly maidenstones pretty and clever and she rides a hell of a fine motorcycle but shes a colleague thats all the black leather jumpsuit however made an unbidden appearance in his mind in a towelling robe bond stepped into the kitchen and poured two fingers of bourbon basil haydens into a glass dropped in one ice cube and drank half enjoying the sharp nutty flavour the first sip of the day was invariably the best especially coming as this one did after a harrowing excursion against an enemy and ahead of an evening with a beautiful woman he caught himself again stop he sat in an old leather chair in the living room which was sparsely furnished the majority of the items in it had been his parents inherited when they had died and kept in storage near his aunts in kent hed bought a few things some lamps a desk and chairs a bose sound system he rarely had a chance to listen to on the mantelpiece there were silverframed photos of his parents and grandparents on his fathers side in scotland his mothers in switzerland several showed his aunt charmian with the young bond in kent on the walls were other photographs taken by his mother a freelance photojournalist mostly black and white the photos depicted a variety of images political gatherings labour union events sports competitions panoramic scenes of exotic locations there was also a curious objet dartin the mantelpieces centre a bullet it had nothing to do with bonds role as an agent in the section of the odgs o branch its source was a very different time and place of bonds life he walked to the fireplace and turned the solid piece of ammunition in his hand once or twice finally replacing it and returning to his chair then despite his protest that he keep affairs with philly that he keep matters relating to agent maidenstonepurely professional he couldnt stop thinking of her as a woman and one no longer betrothed bond had to admit that what he felt for philly was more than pure physical lust and he now asked himself a question that had arisen at other times about other women albeit rarely could something serious develop between them bonds romantic life was more complicated than most the barriers to his having a partner were to some degree his extensive travelling the demands of his job and the constant danger that surrounded him but more fundamental was the tricky matter of admitting who he really was and more tellingly his duties within the section which some perhaps most women would find distasteful if not abhorrent he knew that at some point he would have to admit to at least part of it to any woman who became more than a casual lover you can keep secrets from those youre close to for only so long people are far more clever and observant than we think and between romantic partners ones fundamental secrets stay hidden only because the other chooses to let them remain so plausible deniability might work in whitehall but it didnt last between lovers yet with philly maidenstone this was not a problem there would be no confessions about his profession over dinner or amid tousled morning bedclothes she knew his cv and his remit knew them intimately and shed suggested a restaurant near her flat what sort of message lay in that choice james bond glanced at his watch it was time to dress and attempt to decipher the code at eight fifteen the taxi dropped bond at antoines in bloomsbury and he immediately approved of phillys choice he hated crowded noisy restaurants and bars and on more than one occasion had walked out of upmarket establishments when the decibel level had proved to be too irritating upscale pubs were more ghastly than gastro hed once quipped but antoines was quiet and dimly lit an impressive wine selection was visible at the back of the room and the walls were filled with muted portraits from the nineteenth century bond asked for a small booth not far from the wall of bottles he settled into the plush leather facing the front as always and studied the place business people and locals he judged something to drink asked the waiter a pleasant man in his late thirties with a shaved head and pierced ears bond decided on a cocktail crown royal on ice a double please add a halfmeasure of triple sec two dashes of bitters and a twist of orange peel yes sir interesting drink based on an old fashioned my own creation actually does it have a name not yet he said ive been looking for the right one a few moments later it arrived and he took a sip it was constructed perfectly and bond said so hed just set the glass down when he saw philly coming through the door radiant with a smile it seemed that her pace quickened when she saw him she was in closefitting black jeans a brown leather jacket and under it a tight dark green sweater the colour of his jaguar he half rose as she joined him sitting to his side rather than across she was carrying a briefcase you all right she said hed half expected something a bit more personal than this rather casual greeting but then he asked himself sternly why she had barely taken off her jacket before shed caught the eye of the waiter who greeted her with a smile ophelia aaron ill have a glass of the mosel riesling on its way her wine arrived and bond told aaron theyd wait to order their glasses nodded at one another but did not clink first bond murmured edging a little closer hydt tell me about him i checked with specialist operations at the yard six interpol ncic and cia in america and the aivd in the netherlands i made some discreet enquiries at five too shed obviously deduced the tension between bond and osbornesmith no criminal records no watchlists more tory than labour but doesnt have much interest in politics not a member of any church treats his people well no labour unrest of any kind no problems with the inland revenue or health and safety he just seems to be a wealthy businessman verywealthy all hes ever done professionally is rubbish collection and recycling the ragandbone man hes fiftysix never married both parents they were dutch are dead now his father had some money and travelled a lot on business hydt was born in amsterdam then came here with his mother to live when he was twelve she had a breakdown so he grew up mostly under the care of the housekeeper whod accompanied them from holland then his father lost most of his money and vanished from his sons life because she wasnt getting paid the housekeeper called in social services and vanished after eightyears of looking after the boy philly shook her head in sympathy he was fourteen philly continued he started working as a dustman at fifteen then hes off the radar until hes in his twenties he opened green way just as the recycling trend caught on what happened did he inherit some money no its a bit of a mystery he started penniless as far as i can tell when he was older he put himself through university he read ancient history and archaeology and green way it handles general rubbish disposal wheeliebin collection removal of construction waste at building sites scrap metal demolition recycling document shredding dangerousmaterials reclamation and disposal according to the business press its moving into a dozen other countries to start up rubbish tips and recycling centres philly displayed a printout of a company sales brochure bond frowned at the logo it looked like a green dagger resting on its side its not a knife philly said laughing i thought the same thing its a leaf global warming pollution and energy are the sexiest subjects in the au courantenvironmental movement but rising quickly are planetfriendly rubbish disposal and recycling and green ways one of the big innovators any serbian connection through a subsidiary he owns part of a small operation in belgrade but like everybody else in the organisation nobody there has any criminal past i just cant work out his game bond said hes not political has no terrorist leanings it almost looks like hes been hired to arrange the attack or whatever its to be on friday but he hardly needs money he sipped his cocktail right then detective inspector maidenstone tell me about the evidence that other bit of ash from up in march six made out the gehenna plan and friday may did forensics at the yard find anything else her voice dropped which necessitated his leaning closer he smelt a sweet but undefined scent her sweater cashmere brushed the back of his hand they did they think the rest of the words were course is confirmed blast radius must be a hundred feet minimum ten thirty is the optimal time so an explosive device of some kind ten thirty friday pm according to the original intercept and course a shipping route or plane most likely now she continued the metal you found its a titaniumsteel laminate unique nobody in the lab has ever seen anything like it the pieces were shavings theyd been machined in the past day or so was that what hydts people had been doing in the basement of the hospital were they building a weapon with this metal and defence still owns the facility but it hasnt been used for three years his eyes swept over her marvellous profile from forehead to breasts as she sipped her wine philly continued as for the serbs i practically said id force them to take on the euro in place of the dinar if they didnt help me but they came through the man working with the irishman aldo karic was a load scheduler with the railway hed have known exactly which train the hazmat was on yes then she frowned about that though james its odd the material was pretty bad methyl isocyanate mic its the chemical that killed all those people in bhopal god but look heres the inventory of everything on board the train she showed him the list translated into english the chemical containers are practically bulletproof you can drop one from a plane and supposedly it wont break open bond was confused by this so a train crash wouldnt have produced a spill very unlikely and another thing the wagon with the chemical contained only about three hundred kilos of mic its really bad stuff certainly but at bhopal fortytwo thousandkilos were released even if a few of the drums had broken open the damage would have been negligible but what else would the irishman have been interested in bond looked over the list aside from the chemicals the cargo was harmless boilers vehicle parts motor oil scrap girders timber no weapons unstable substances other risky materials maybe the incident had been an elaborate scheme to kill the train driver or someone living at the bottom of the hill below the restaurant had the irishman been going to stage the death to look like an accident until they could home in on noahs purpose there could be no effective response bond could only hope that the surveillance hed reluctantly put into play earlier in the evening would pay off he asked any more on gehenna hell im sorry her face broke into a smile gehenna is where the judaeochristian concept of hell came from the words a derivation of gehinnom or the valley of hinnom a valley in jerusalem ages ago some people think it was used as a site to burn rubbish and there may have been natural gas deposits in the rocks that kept the fires going perpetually in the bible gehenna came to mean a place where sinners and unbelievers would be punished the only recent significant reference if you can call a hundred and fifty years ago recent was in a rudyard kipling poem shed memorised the verse and recited down to gehenna or up to the throne he travels the fastest who travels alone he liked that and repeated it to himself she said now for my other assignment steel cartridge relax bond told himself he raised an eyebrow nonchalantly philly said i couldnt see any connection between the gehenna plan and steel cartridge no i understand that i dont think theyre related this is something else from before i joined the odg the hazel eyes scanned his face pausing momentarily on the scar you were defence intelligence werent you and before that you were in afghanistan with the naval reserve thats right afghanistan the russians were there of course before we and the americans decided to pop in for tea does it have to do with your assignments there could very well i dont know philly realised she was asking questions he might not want to answer i got the original russian data file that our station r hacked and i went through the metadata it sent me to other sources and i found out that steel cartridge was a targeted killing operation sanctioned at a high level thats what the phrase some deaths referred to i cant find out whether it was kgb or svr so we dont know the date yet in the kgb the infamous soviet security and spy apparatus was redesigned as russias fsb with domestic jurisdiction and the svr with foreign the consensus among those following the espionage world was that the change was cosmetic only bond considered this targeted killing thats right and one of our clandestine operators an agent with six was in some way involved but i dont know who or how yet maybe our man was tracking the russian assassin maybe he wanted to turn him and run him as a double or our agent might even have been the target himself im getting more soon ive opened channels he noticed that he was staring at the tablecloth brow furrowed he gave her a fast smile brilliant philly thanks on his mobile bond typed a synopsis of what philly had told him about hydt incident twenty and green way international omitting the information on operation steel cartridge he sent the message to m and bill tanner then he said right now its time for sustenance after all our hard work first wine red or white im a girl who doesnt play by the rules philly let that linger teasingly it seemed to bond then she explained ill do a big red a margaux or st julien with a mildmannered fish like sole and ill have a pinot gris or albariño with a nice juicy steak she relented im saying whatever youre in the mood for james is fine with me she buttered a piece of her roll and ate it with obvious pleasure then snatched up the menu and examined the sheet like a little girl trying to decide which christmas present to open first bond was charmed a moment later aaron the waiter was beside them philly said to bond you first i need seven seconds more ill start with the pâté then ill have the grilled turbot philly ordered a rocket and parmesan salad with pear and to follow the poached lobster with haricots verts and new potatoes bond picked a bottle of an unoaked chardonnay from napa california good she said the americans have the best chardonnay grapes outside burgundy but they really must have the courage to throw out some of their damned oak casks bonds opinion exactly the wine arrived and then the food which proved excellent he complimented her on her choice of restaurant casual conversation ensued she asked about his life in london recent travels where hed grown up instinctively he gave her only the broad brush of information that was already in the public domain his parents death his childhood with his aunt charmian in idyllic pett bottom kent his brief tenure at eton and subsequent attendance at his fathers old school in edinburgh fettes yes i heard that at eton you got into a spot of bother something about a maid she let those words linger a bit too then smiled i heard the official story a touch scandalous but there were other rumours too that youd been defending the girls honour i think my lips must remain sealed on that he offered a smile ill plead the official secrets act unofficially well if its true you were quite young to play knight errant i think id just read tolkiens sir gawain bond told her and he couldnt help but note that shed certainly done her research on him he asked about her childhood philly told him about growing up in devon boarding school in cambridgeshire where as a teenager shed distinguished herself as a volunteer for human rights organisations then reading law at the lse she loved to travel and talked at length about holidays she was at her most animated when it came to her bsa motorcycle and her other passion skiing interesting bond thought something else in common their eyes met and held for an easy five seconds bond felt the electric sensation with which he was so familiar his knee brushed against hers partly by accident partly not she ran a hand through her loose red hair philly rubbed her closed eyes with her fingertips looking back to bond she said her voice low i must say this was a brilliant idea dinner i mean i definitely needed to she trailed off her eyes crinkling with amusement as she couldnt or didnt want to explain further im not sure im ready for the night to be over look its only half past ten bond leant forward their forearms touched and this time there was no regrouping philly said id like an afterdinner drink but i dont know exactly what they have here those were her words but what she was actually telling him was that she was had some port or brandy in her flat just over the road a sofa and music too and very likely something more awaited codes his next line was to have been i could use one too though maybe not here but then bond happened to notice something very small very subtle the index finger and the thumb of her right hand were gently rubbing the ring finger of her left he noted a faint pallor where the tan from a recent holiday was missing it had been cloaked from the sun by tims crimson engagement ring now absent her radiant goldengreen eyes were still fixed on bonds her smile intact he knew that yes they could settle the bill and leave and she would take his arm as they walked to her flat he knew the humorous repartee would continue he knew the lovemaking would be consuming he could tell that from the way her eyes and voice sparkled from how shed dived into her food from the clothes she wore and how she wore them from her laugh and yet he knew too that it wasnt right not now when shed slipped the ring off and handed it back shed also returned a piece of her heart he didnt doubt she was well on the way to recovery a woman who fishtailed a bsa motorcycle at speed along peak district byways wouldnt be down for long but he decided it was better to wait if ophelia maidenstone was a woman he might let into his life she would continue to be so in a month or two he said i believe i saw an armagnac on the afterdinner list that intrigued me id like to sample some and bond knew hed done the right thing when her face softened relief and gratitude outweighing the disappointment though only by a nose she squeezed his arm and sat back you order for me james im sure you know what id like tuesday death in the sand james bond awoke from a dream he could not recall but that had him sweating fiercely his heart pounding and pounding all the faster from the braying of his phone his bedside clock told him it was am he grabbed the mobile and glanced at the screen blinking sleep from his eyes bless him he thought he hit answer bonjour mon ami et toi aussi said the rich rasping voice we are encrypted are we not oui yes of course what did we do in the days before encryption asked rené mathis presumably in his office on boulevard mortier in pariss th arrondissement there were no days before encryption rené there were only days before there was an app for it on a touch screen well said james you are waxing wise comme un philosophe and so early in the morning the thirtyfiveyearold mathis was an agent for the french secret service the direction générale de la sécurité extérieure he and bond worked together occasionally in joint odg and dgse operations most recently wrapping up alqaeda and other criminal enterprises in europe and north africa they had also drunk significant quantities of lillet and louis roederer together and spent some rather well colourful nights in such cities as bucharest tunis and bari that freewheeling gem on italys adriatic coast it had been rené mathis whom bond had called yesterday evening not osbornesmith to ask his friend to run surveillance on severan hydt he had made the decision reluctantly but he had realised he had to take the politically risky step of circumventing not only division three but m himself he needed surveillance but had to make sure that hydt and the irishman remained unaware that the british authorities were on to them france of course has its own snoop operation like gchq in england the nsa in america and any other countrys intelligence agency with a flush budget the dgse was continually listening in to conversations and reading emails of the citizens of other countries the united kingdoms included yes the countries were allies at the moment but there wasthat little matter of the history between them so bond had called in a favour hed asked rené mathis to listen to the elint and sigint from london being hoovered up by the hundredmetre antenna of frances gravity gradient stabilised spy satellite searching for relevant key words mathis now said i have something for you james im dressing ill put you on speaker bond hit the button and leapt out of bed does this mean that the beautiful redhead lying beside you will be listening as well bond chuckled not least because the frenchman had happened to pick that particular hair colour a brief image surfaced of pressing his cheek against phillys last night on her doorstep as her vibrant hair caressed his shoulder before he returned to his flat i searched for signals tagged severan hydt or his nickname noah and anything related to green way international the gehenna plan serbia train derailments or threatoriented events this coming friday and all of those in proximity to any names sounding irish but it is very odd james the satellite vector was aimed right at green ways premises east of london but there was virtually no sigint coming out of the place its as if he forbids his workers to have mobiles very curious yes it was bond reflected he continued dressing fast but there are several things we were able to pick up hydt is presently at home and hes leaving the country this morning soon i believe going where i dont know but hell be flying there was a reference to an airport and another to passports and it will be in a private jet since his people had spoken to the pilot directly im afraid there was no clue as to which airport i know there are many in london we have them targeted for surveillance only i must add quickly bond couldnt help but laugh now james we found nothing about this gehenna plan but i have some disturbing information we decrypted a brief call fifteen minutes ago to a location about ten miles west of green way outside london probably hydts home mathis continued a mans voice said severan its me accented but our algorithms couldnt tell region of origin there were some pleasantries then this were confirmed for seven pm today the number of dead will be ninety or so you must be there no later than six fortyfive so hydt either was part of a plan to murder scores of people or was going to do so himself who are the victims and why are they going to die i dont know james but what i found just as troubling was your mr hydts reaction his voice was like that of un enfantoffered chocolate he said oh such wonderful news thank you so much his voice dark mathis said ive never heard that kind of joy at the prospect of killing but even stranger he then asked how close can i get to the bodies he said that indeed the man told him he could be very close and hydt sounded very pleased at that too then the phones went silent and havent been used again seven pm somewhere out of the country anything more im afraid not thank you for all this id better get on with the hunt i wish i could keep our satellite online longer but my superiors are already asking questions about why i am so interested in that insignificant little place called london next time the dom is on me rené but of course au revoir à bientôt et merci beaucoup bond hit disconnect in his years as a royal naval reserve commander and an agent for odg hed been up against some very bad people insurgents terrorists psychopathic criminals amoral traitors selling nuclear secrets to men mad enough to use them but what was hydts game purpose response well even if it wasnt clear what the mans twisted goal might be at least there was one response bond could initiate ten minutes later he ran down the stairs fishing the car key from his pocket he didnt need to look up severan hydts address hed memorised it last night thames house the home of mi the northern ireland office and some related security organisations is less impressive than the residence of mi which happens to be nearby across the river on the south bank sixs headquarters look rather like a futuristic enclave from a ridley scott film its referred to as babylonuponthames for its resemblance to a ziggurat and less kindly as legoland but if not as architecturally striking thames house is far more intimidating the ninetyyearold grey stone monolith is the sort of place where were it a police headquarters in soviet russia or east germany you would begin answering before questions were asked on the other hand the place doesboast some rather impressive sculpture charles sargeant jaggers britanniaand st george for instance and every few days tourists from arkansas or tokyo stroll up to the front door thinking its tate britain which is located a short distance away in the windowless bowels of thames house were the offices of division three the organisation conscientiously for the sake of deniability rented space and equipment from five and nobody has better equipment than mi all at arms length in the middle of this fiefdom was a large control room rather frayed at the edges the green walls battered and scuffed the furniture dented the carpet insulted by too many heels the requisite government regulatory posters about suspicious parcels fire drills health and trade union matters were omnipresent often tarted up by bureaucrats with nothing better to do w e a r e y e p r o t e c t i o n w h e n n e c e s s a r y but the computers here were voracious and the dozens of flatscreen monitors big and bright and deputy senior director of field operations percy osbornesmith was standing arms folded in front of the biggest and brightest in brown jacket and mismatched trousers hed woken at four am and dressed by five past osbornesmith was with two young men his assistant and a rumpled technician hovering over a keyboard osbornesmith bent forward and pressed a button listened again to the recording that had just been made by the surveillance hed put in place after the pointless drive up to cambridge for as it developed the sole purpose of eating a meal of chicken curry that had turned on him in the night the snooping didnt involve the suspect in incident twenty since no one had been courteous enough to share the mans identity but osbornesmiths boys and girls had managed to arrange a productive listenin without informing mi that they were doing so the troops had slapped some microphones on the windows of one of the anonymous evildoers coconspirators a lad named james bond section o branch overseas development group foreign and commonwealth office and so osbornesmith had learnt about severan hydt that he was noah and that he ran green way international bond seemed to have neglected to mention that his mission to boots the road not boots the chemist thank you very much had resulted in these rather important discoveries bastard said osbornesmiths adjutant a lean young man with an irritating mop of abundant brown hair bonds playing games with lives just calm it now eh osbornesmith said to the youngster whom he referred to as deputydeputy though not in his presence well he is bastard for his part osbornesmith was rather impressed that bond had contacted the french secret service otherwise nobody would have learnt that hydt was about to leave the country and kill ninetyodd people later today or at least be present at their deaths this intelligence solidified osbornesmiths determination to clap severan noah hydt in irons drag him into belmarsh or division threes own interrogation room which was not much more hospitable than the prisons and bleed him dry he said to deputydeputy run the whole battery on hydt i want to know about his good and his bad what medicine he takes the independent or the daily sport arsenal or chelsea his dietary preferences movies that scare him or that make him cry who hes dallying or whos dallying him and how and get an arrest team together say we didnt get bonds firearms authorisation form did we no sir now thispiqued osbornesmith wheres my eye in the sky he asked the young technician sitting at his videogames console they had tried to find hydts destination the easy way since the espionin paris had learnt the man was departing in a private aircraft theyd searched caa records for planes registered to severan hydt green way or any subsidiaries but none could be found so it was to be oldfashioned snooping if one could describe a million drone thus hold on hold on the technician said wasting breath finally got big bird peeping now osbornesmith regarded the screen the view from two miles overhead was remarkably clear but then he took in the image and said are you surethats hydts house not part of his company positive private residence the home occupied a full square block in canning town it was separated not surprisingly from the neighbours in their council houses or dilapidated flats by an imposing wall glistening at the crest with razor wire within the grounds there were neatly tended gardens in may bloom the place had apparently been a modest warehouse or factory around a century ago but had been done up recently it seemed four outbuildings and a garage were clustered together what was this about he wondered why did such a wealthy man live in canning town it was poor ethnically complex prone to violent crime and gangs but with fiercely loyal residents and activist councillors who worked very very hard for their constituents a massive amount of redevelopment was going on apart from the olympics construction which some said was taking the heart out of the place his father osbornesmith recalled had seen the police jeff beck and depeche mode perform at some legendary pub in canning town decades ago why does hydt live there he mused aloud his assistant called just had word that bond left his flat heading east he lost our man though bond drives like michael schumacher we knowwhere hes going osbornesmith said hydts he hated to have to explain the obvious as the minutes rolled by without any activity at hydts osbornesmiths young assistant gave him updates an arrest team had been assembled firearms officers included they want to know their orders sir osbornesmith considered this get them ready but lets wait and see if hydts meeting anybody i want to scoop up the entire cast and crew the technician said sir we have movement leaning closer to the screen osbornesmith observed that a bulky man in a black suit bodyguard he assessed was wheeling suitcases out of hydts house and into the detached garage sir bonds just arrived in canning town the man teased a joystick and the field of view expanded there he pointed thats him the bentley the subdued grey vehicle slowed and pulled to the kerb the assistant whistled a continental gt now thats a bloody fine automobile i think they reviewed it on top gear you ever watch the show percy sadly im usually working osbornesmith cast a mournful gaze towards touslehaired deputydeputy and decided that if the youngster couldnt muster a bit more humility and respect he probably wouldnt survive career wise much beyond the end of the incident twenty assignment bonds car was parked discreetly if the word could be used to describe a car in canning town about fifty yards from hydts house hidden behind several skips the assistant the arrest teams on board the chopper osbornesmith said put them in the air get them to hover somewhere near the gherkin the fortystorey swiss re office building rising above the city it looked more like a s spaceship than a pickled cucumber in osbornesmiths view was centrally located and thus a good place from which to begin the hunt alert security at all the airports heathrow gatwick luton stansted london city southend and biggin hill right sir more subjects the technician said on the screen three people were leaving the house a tall man in a suit with saltandpepper hair and beard walked next to a gangly blond man whose feet pointed outwards a slight woman in a black suit her hair white followed thats hydt the technician said the one with the beard any idea about the woman no sir and the giraffe osbornesmith asked with a snide inflection he was really quite irritated that bond had ignored his firearms form is he the irishman everyones talking about get a picture and run with it hurry up the trio walked into the garage a moment later a black audi a sped out through the front gate and pulled into the road accelerating fast head count all three are in the car along with the bodyguard deputydeputy called lock on it masint and paint it with a laser for good measure ill try the technician said you better had they watched bond in his bentley pulling smoothly into traffic and speeding after the audi pan out and stay on them osbornesmith said with the lisp he was forever trying to slice off though the affliction had proved a hydra all his life the camera latched on to the german car theres a good lad he said to the technician the audi speeded up bond was following discreetly but never missing a turn as skilful as the driver of the german car was bond was better anticipating when the chauffeur would try something clever some aborted turn or unexpected lane change and counter the measure the cars zipped through green amber and red alike going north prince regent lane so london city airports out the audi hit newham way all right deputydeputy enthused tugging at his eruption of hair its either stansted or luton going north on the a another technician a round blonde woman who had materialised from nowhere called then after some impressive fox and hound driving the competitors audi and bentley were on the m going anticlockwise its luton the assistant cried more subdued osbornesmith ordered get the whirlybird moving will do in silence they followed the progress of the audi finally it sped into the shortterm car park at luton airport bond wasnt far behind the car parked carefully out of view of hydts choppers setting down on the antiterror pad at the airport our peoplell deploy towards the car park no one got out of the audi osbornesmith smiled i knew it hydts waiting to meet associates well get them all tell our people to stay under cover until i give the word and get all the eyes at luton online he reflected that the cctv cameras on the ground might make it possible for them to see bonds shocked reaction when the division three teams descended like hawks and arrested hydt and the irishman that hadnt been osbornesmiths goal in ordering the video of course but it would be a very nice bonus hans groelle sat behind the wheel of severan hydts sleek black audi a the thickly built blond dutch army veteran had done some motocross and other racing in his younger days and he was pleased mr hydt had asked him to put his driving skills to use this morning relishing the memory of the frantic drive from canning town to luton airport groelle listened absently to the threeway conversation of the man and woman in the back seat and the passenger in the front they were laughing about the excitement of the race the driver of the bentley was extremely competent but more important intuitive he couldnt have known where groelle was going so hed had to anticipate the turns many of them utterly random it was as if the pursuing driver had had some sixth sense that told him when groelle was going to turn to slow to speed forward a natural driver but who was he well theyd soon find out no one in the audi had been able to get a description of the driver he was that clever but theyd pieced together the number plate groelle had called an associate in the green way headquarters who was using some contacts at the driver and vehicle licensing agency in swansea to find out who owned the car but whatever the threat hans groelle would be ready a colt sat snug and warm in his left armpit he glanced once more at the sliver of the bentleys grey wing and said to the man in the back seat it worked harry we tricked them call mr hydt the two passengers in the back and the man sitting beside groelle were green way workers involved in gehenna they resembled mr hydt ms barnes and niall dunne who were currently en route to an entirely different airport gatwick where a private jet was waiting to fly them out of the country the deception had been dunnes idea of course he was a cold fish but that didnt dull his brain thered been trouble up in march somebody had killed eric janssen one of groelles fellow security men the killer was dead but dunne had assumed there might be others watching the factory or the house perhaps both so he had found three employees close enough in appearance to deceive watchers and had driven them to canning town very early that morning groelle had then carted suitcases out to the garage followed by mr hydt ms barnes and the irishman groelle and the decoys whod been waiting in the audi then sped towards luton ten minutes later the real entourage got into the back of an unmarked green way international lorry and drove to gatwick now the decoys would remain in the audi as long as possible to keep whoever was in the bentley occupied long enough for mr hydt and the others to get out of uk airspace groelle said we have a bit of a wait he gestured at the radio with a glance toward the green way workers whatll it be they voted and radio took the majority ah ah it was a bloody decoy osbornesmith said his voice was as calm as always but the expletive if that was what it was nowadays indicated that he was livid a cctv camera in the luton car park was now beaming an image on to the big screen in division three and the reality show presently airing was not felicitous the angular view into the audi wasnt the best in the world but it was clear that the couple in the back seats were not severan hydt and his female companion and the passenger in the front whom hed taken to be the irishman was not the gawky blond man hed seen earlier plodding to the garage decoys they have to be going to somelondon airport deputydeputy pointed out lets split up the team unless they decided to cruise up to manchester or leedsbradford oh right send all the watchers in a branch hydts picture without delay yes sir osbornesmith squinted as he looked at the image broadcast from the cctv he could see a bit of the wing of james bonds bentley parked twentyfive yards from the audi if there was any consolation to the flap it was that at least bond had fallen for the ruse too combined with his lack of cooperation his questionable use of the french secret service and his holierthanthou attitude the lapse might just signal a significant downsizing of his career the fifteenfoot lorry leased to green way international but unmarked pulled up to the kerb at the executive flight services terminal at gatwick airport the door slid open and severan hydt an older woman and the irishman climbed out and collected their suitcases thirty feet away in the car park sat a blackandred mini cooper whose interior décor included a yellow rose in a plastic vase wedged into the cup holder behind the wheel james bond was watching the trio of passengers deploy to the pavement the irishman naturally was looking around carefully he never seemed to drop his guard what do you think of it bond asked into the handsfree connected to his mobile it the bentley it honestly james a car like this simply demandsa name philly maidenstone chided she was sitting in his bentley continental gt at luton airport having chased hydts audi all the way from canning town i never got into the habit of naming my cars any more than id give my gun a gender he reflected and kept his eyes on the threesome not far away bond had been convinced that after the incidents in serbia and march hydt or the irishman more likely would suspect he might be tailed in london he was also concerned that osbornesmith had arranged to follow bond himself so after he had talked to rené mathis hed left his flat and sped to a covered car park in the city where hed met philly to swap cars she was to trail hydts audi which bond was sure would be a decoy in his bentley while he in her mini would wait for the mans true departure which came just ten minutes after the german car had sped away from hydts canning town home bond now watched hydt head down making a phone call beside him stood the woman in her early to midsixties bond guessed she had attractive features though her face was pale and gaunt an image accentuated by her black overcoat too little sleep perhaps his lover bond wondered or a longtime assistant from her expression as she looked at hydt he decided the former also the irishman bond hadnt seen him clearly in serbia but there was no doubt the gawky stride feet turned out bad posture the odd blond fringe bond supposed he was the man in the bulldozer in march who had so ruthlessly crushed his security man to death he also pictured the dead in serbia the agents the train and lorry drivers as well as the mans own associate and he let the anger rising in him crest and dissolve philly said in answer to your question i liked it very much a lot of engines have horses nowadays you can get amg mercedes estate cars to take the kids to school for gods sake but how many pounds torque does the bentley have ive never felt anything like it a touch over five hundred oh my god philly whispered either impressed or envious perhaps both and im in love with the allwheel drive hows it distributed sixtyforty rear to front brilliant yours isnt bad either he told her of the mini you added a supercharger i did indeed whose autorotor the swedish outfit nearly doubled the horsepower close to three hundred now i thought as much bond was himself impressed i must get the name of your mechanic i have an old jaguar that needs work oh tell me its an etype thats the sexiest car in the history of motoring yet one more thing in common bond wrapped this thought up and put it quickly away ill leave you in suspense hold on hydts on the move bond climbed out of the mini and hid phillys key in the wheel arch he grabbed his suitcase and laptop bag slipped on a new pair of tortoiseshell sunglasses and eased into a crowd to follow hydt the irishman and the woman to gatwicks private jet terminal you there he asked into the handsfree i am philly replied whats happening with the decoys theyre just sitting in the audi theyll be waiting until hydt takes off and the planes out of uk airspace then theyll turn round to lead you and probably mr osbornesmith back to london you think ozzys watching bond had to smile youve got a drone hovering about ten thousand feet over you im sure theyre walking into the terminal now i should go philly i dont get out of the office enough james thanks for the chance to play formula one impulsively he said heres an idea maybe well take it out into the country together do some serious driving james she said crossly he wondered if hed crossed a line you simply cant keep referring to this magnificent machine as it i shall rack my brains and think up a proper name for her and yes a trip out to the country sounds divine provided you let me drive for exactly half the time and we put in a nulldetain request i already have a few points on my driving licence they rang off and bond discreetly followed his prey the threesome paused at a gate in a chainlink fence and presented passports to the guard bond saw that the womans was blue american the uniformed man jotted on a clipboard and gestured the three through as bond got to the fence he caught a glimpse of them climbing the stairs to a white private jet a large one seven round windows on each side of the fuselage running lights already on the door closed bond hit speeddial flanagan hello james maurice he said to the head of t branch the group within the odg that handled all things vehicular i need a destination for a private plane departing just about now from gatwick he read off the fiveletter registration painted on the engine give me a minute the aircraft moved forward dammit he thought angrily slow down he was all too aware that if rené mathiss information was correct hydt was on his way to oversee the murder of at least ninety people that evening maurice flanagan said i have it nice bird grumman fivefifty stateoftheart and damned expensive that ones owned by a dutch company in the business of waste and recycling one of hydts of course the flight plans filed for dubai dubai was that where the deaths were going to happen where will it stop for refuelling flanagan laughed james the range is over six and a half thousand miles flies at mach point eight eight bond watched the plane taxiing to the runway dubai was about miles from london with the time difference the grumman would land at three or four pm i need to beat that plane to dubai maurice what can you cobble together for me i have passports credit cards and three grand in cash whatever you can do oh i have my weapon youll need to take that into account bond kept staring at the sleek white jet wingtips turned up it looked less like a bird than a dragon though that might have been because he knew who the occupants were and what they had planned ninety dead several tense moments passed as bond watched the jet edge closer to the runway then flanagan said sorry james the best i can do is get you on a commercial flight out of heathrow in a few hours puts you in dubai around six twenty wont do maurice military government nothing available absolutely nothing damn at least he could have philly or bill tanner arrange with someone at sixs uae desk to have a watcher meet the flight at dubai airport and tail hydt and dunne to their destination he sighed put me on the commercial flight will do sorry bond glanced at his watch nine hours until the deaths he could always hope for a delay to hydts flight just then he saw the grumman turn on to the main runway and without pause accelerate fast lifting effortlessly from the concrete then shrinking to a dot as the dragon shot higher into the sky speeding directly away from him percy osbornesmith was leaning towards the large flatscreen monitor split into six rectangles twenty minutes ago theyd had a cctv hit on the number plate of a lorry registered to severan hydts company at the redhill and reigate exit from the a which led to gatwick he and his underlings were now scanning every camera in and around the airport for the vehicle the second technician to join them finished securing her blonde hair with an elastic band and pointed a pudgy finger to one of the screens there thats it it seemed that fifteen minutes ago according to the time stamp the lorry had paused at the kerb near the private aviation terminal and several people had got out yes it was the trio why didnt hydts face get read when he arrived we can find hooligans from rio before they get into old trafford but we cant spot a mass murderer in broad daylight my god does that say something about whitehalls priorities dont repeat that anyone scan the tarmac the technician manipulated the controls there was an image of hydt and the others walking to a private jet bring up the registration number run it to his credit deputydeputy already had owned by a dutch company that does recycling okay got the flight plan hes headed for dubai theyve already taken off where are they now where checking the assistant sighed just passing out of uk airspace teeth clenched osbornesmith stared at the still video image of the plane he mused wonder what it would take to scramble some harriers and force them down then he looked up to note everyone staring at him im not serious people though he had been just a little look at that the male technician interrupted look at bloody what deputydeputy said yes somebody elseis watching them the screen was showing the entrance to the private jet terminal at gatwick a man was standing at the wire fence staring at hydts plane my god it was bond so the bloody clever odg agent with a fancy car and without permission to carry a firearm in the uk had tailed hydt after all osbornesmith wondered briefly whod been in the bentley the ruse he knew had been not only to fool hydt but to fool division three with considerable contentment he watched bond turn from the fence and head back to the car park head down and speaking into his mobile undoubtedly enduring a verbal lashing from his boss for having let the fox slip away usually we never hear the sound that wakes us perhaps we might if it repeats an alarm or an urgent voice but a onceonly noise rouses without registering in our consciousness james bond didnt know what lifted him from his dreamless sleep he glanced at his watch it was just after one pm then he smelt a delicious aroma a combination of floral perfume jasmine he believed and the ripe rich scent of vintage champagne above him he saw the heavenly form of a beautiful middle eastern woman wearing a sleek burgundy skirt and longsleeved golden shirt over her voluptuous figure her collar was secured with a pearl which was different from the lower buttons he found the tiny cream dot particularly appealing her hair was as blueblack as crow feathers pinned up though a teasing strand fell loose cupping one side of her face which was subtly and meticulously madeup he said to her salam alaikum wa alaikum salam she replied she set the crystal flute on the tray table in front of him along with the elegant bottle of the king of moëts dom pérignon im sorry mr bond ive woken you im afraid the cork popped more loudly than id hoped i was just going to leave the glass and not disturb you shukran he said as he took the glass and dont worry my second favourite way to wake up is to the sound of champagne opening she responded to this with a subtle smile i can arrange some lunch for you too that would be lovely if its not too much trouble she returned to the galley bond sipped his champagne and looked out of the private jets spacious window the twin rollsroyce engines pulsing smoothly as it flew towards dubai at feet doing more than miles an hour the aircraft was bond reflected with amusement a grumman like severan hydts but bond was in a grumman the faster model with a greater range than the ragandbone mans bond had started the chase hours ago with the modern equivalent of a scene from an old american police movie in which the detective leaps into a taxi and orders follow that car hed decided that the commercial flight would get him to dubai too late to stop the killings so hed placed a call to his commodore club friend fouad kharaz who had instantly put a private jet at his disposal my friend you know i owe you the arab assured him a year ago he had approached bond awkwardly for help suspecting he did something that involved government security on his way home from school kharazs teenage son had become the target of some hooded thugs nineteen or twenty years old who flaunted their antisocial behaviour orders like insignias of rank the police were sympathetic but had little time for the drama worried sick about his son kharaz asked if there was anything bond could recommend in a moment of weakness the knight errant within bond had prevailed and he had trailed the boy home from school one day when nothing much was going on at the odg when the tormentors had moved in so had bond with a few effortless martial arts manoeuvres he had gently laid two of them out on the pavement and pinned the third the ringleader to a wall he had taken their names from their driving licences and whispered coldly that if the kharaz boy was ever troubled again the hoodies next visit from bond would not end so civilly the boys had strode off defiantly but the son was never troubled again his status at school had soared so bond had become fouad kharazs best friend of all best friends hed decided to call in the favour and borrow one of the mans jets according to the digital map on the bulkhead beneath the airspeed and altitude indicators they were over iran two hours to go until they touched down in dubai just after takeoff bond had called bill tanner and told him of his destination and about the ninety or so deaths planned for seven oclock that evening presumably in dubai but perhaps anywhere in the united arab emirates whys hydt going to kill them the chief of staff had asked im not sure he is but all those people are going to die and hell be there ill go through diplomatic channels tell the embassies theres some threat but we dont have anything concrete theyll leak word to the dubai security apparatus too through back channels dont mention hydts name he needs to get into the country undisturbed he cant suspect anything i have to find out what hes up to i agree well handle it on the sly hed asked tanner to check the golden wire about hydts affiliation with the emirates hoping there was a specific place he might be headed for a moment later the chief of staff was back no offices residences or business affiliations anywhere in the area and ive just done a datamining search no hotel reservations in his name bond wasnt pleased as soon as hydt landed he would disappear into the sprawling emirate of two and a half million people it would be impossible to find him before the attack just as he disconnected the flight attendant appeared we have many different dishes but i saw you look at the dom with appreciation so i decided you would like the best we have aboard mr kharaz said you were to be treated like a king she set the silver tray on the table beside his champagne flute which she refilled for him ive brought you iranian caviar beluga of course with toast not blinis crème fraîche and capers the capers were the large ones so large she had sliced them the grated onions are vidalia from america the sweetest in the world she added they are kind to the breath too we call them lovers onions to follow there is duck in aspic with minted yogurt and dates i can also cook you a steak he laughed no no this is more than enough she left him to eat when he had finished he had two small cups of cardamomflavoured arabic coffee as he read the intelligence that philly maidenstone had provided about hydt and green way he was struck by two things the mans care in steering clear of organised crime and his almost fanatical efforts to expand the company throughout the world she had discovered recently filed applications to do business in south korea china india argentina and half a dozen smaller countries he was disappointed that he could find no clue in any of the material as to the irishmans identity philly had run the mans picture along with that of the older woman through databases but found no matches and bill tanner had reported that the mi agents soca and specialist crime officers whod descended on gatwick had been told that unfortunately records about the passengers on the grumman seem to have vanished it was then that he received more troubling news an encrypted email from philly someone it seemed had been unofficially checking with six about bonds whereabouts and planned itinerary the someone bond supposed had to be his dear friend percy osbornesmith technically hed be out of the division three mans jurisdiction in dubai but that didnt mean the man couldnt make a great deal of trouble for him and even blow his cover bond had no relation with sixs people in dubai hed have to assume though that osbornesmith might which meant bond couldnt have local ops or assets meet hydts flight after all indeed he decided he couldnt have anything to do with anyof his countrymen a particular shame because the consul general in dubai was clever and savvy and a friend of bonds he texted bill tanner and told him to hold off setting up a liaison with six bond called the pilot on the intercom to learn the status of the jet they were pursuing it seemed that airtraffic control had slowed their own plane though not hydts and they would not be able to overtake him they would land half an hour at least after hydt did damn that thirty minutes could mean the difference between life and death for at least ninety people he stared out of the window at the persian gulf pulling out his mobile he was thinking again of the great espionage balance sheet as he scrolled through his extensive phone book to find a number im beginning to feel a bit like lehman brothers he thought my debts vastly outweigh my assets bond placed a call the limousine bearing severan hydt jessica barnes and niall dunne pulled up at the intercontinental hotel situated on broad peaceful dubai creek the solid stern driver was a local man theyd used before like hans groelle in england he doubled as a bodyguard and did a bit more than that from time to time they remained in the car while dunne read a text or an email he logged off his iphone looked up and said to hydt hans has found out about the driver of the bentley its interesting groelle had told someone at green way to check the numberplate hydt tapped his long fingernails together dunne avoided looking at them he said and theres a connection to march is there hydt tried to read dunnes eyes as usual they remained utterly cryptic the irishman said nothing more not with jessica present hydt nodded well check in now hydt lifted the cuff of his elegant suit jacket and regarded his watch two and a half hours to go the number of dead will be ninety or so dunne stepped out first his keen eyes made their usual scan for threats all right came the irishmans slight brogue its clear hydt and jessica climbed out into the astonishing heat and headed quickly into the chill of the intercontinental lobby which was dominated by a stunning tenfoothigh assembly of exotic flowers on a nearby wall hung portraits of the united arab emirates ruling families gazing down sternly and confidently jessica signed for the room which theyd taken in her name another of dunnes ideas though they would not be staying long their onward flight was this evening it was helpful to have somewhere to leave the bags and get some rest they handed the luggage to the bell captain to have it taken to the room leaving jessica beside the flowers hydt nodded dunne aside the bentley who was it registered to a company in manchester same address as midlands disposal midlands was connected to one of the bigger organisedcrime syndicates operating out of south manchester in america the mob had traditionally been heavily involved in waste management and in naples where the camorra crime syndicate ruled refuse collection was known as il re del crimine in britain organised crime was less interested in the business but occasionally some local underworld boss tried to bluster his way into the market like a heavy in a guy ritchie film and this morning dunne continued the coppers came round to the army base site showing pictures of somebody whod been spotted in the area the day before theres a warrant on him for grievous bodily harm he worked for midlands the police said hes gone missing as will happen hydt reflected when ones body is commencing to rot beneath a thousand tons of wrecked hospital what would he have been doing up there hydt asked dunne considered this probably planning to sabotage the demolition job something goes wrong you get bad publicity and midlands moves in to pick up some of your business so whoever was in the bentley only wanted to find out what happened to his mate yesterday right hydt was vastly relieved the incident had nothing to do with gehenna and more important the intruder wasnt the police or security service merely one more instance of the underbelly of the discard business good well deal with midlands later hydt and dunne returned to jessica niall and i have some things to take care of ill be back for dinner i think ill go for a walk she said hydt frowned in this heat it might not be good for you he didnt like her to stray too far afield he wasnt worried that shed let slip anything she shouldnt he had kept all aspects of gehenna from her and what she knew of the rest of his darker life well that was potentially embarrassing but not illegal it was just that when he wanted her he wanted her and severan hydt was a man whose belief in the inevitable power of decay had taught him that life is far too short and precarious to deny yourself anything at any time i can judge that she said but spoke timidly of course of course only a woman alone hydt continued the men you know how they can be you mean arab men jessica asked its not tehran or jeddah they dont even leer in dubai theyre more respectful than they are in paris hydt smiled his gentle smile that was amusing and true but still dont you think it would be best just to be safe anyway the hotel has a wonderful spa it will be perfect for you and the pool is partly plexiglas you can look down and see the ground forty feet below the view of the burj khalifa is quite impressive i suppose it was then that hydt noticed a new configuration of wrinkles around her eyes as she peered up at the towering floral arrangement he thought too of the body of the woman found in the green way skip yesterday her grave now subtly marked according to the foreman jack dennison and hydt felt that subtle unravelling within him a spring loosening as long as youre happy he said to her softly and brushed her face near the wrinkles with one of his long nails shed stopped recoiling long ago not that her reactions had ever affected him one bit hydt was suddenly aware of dunnes crystalline blue eyes turning his way the younger man stiffened ever so slightly then recovered and looked elsewhere hydt was irritated what business was it of his what hydt found alluring he wondered as he often had if perhaps dunnes distaste for his brands of lust stemmed not from the fact that they were unconventional but from his disdain for anysexuality in the months hed known him the irishman hadnt so much as glanced at a woman or man with bedroom eyes hydt lowered his hand and looked again at jessica at the lines radiating from her resigned eyes he gauged the timing they would fly out tonight and the plane boasted no private suites he couldnt imagine making love to her when dunne was nearby even if the man was asleep he debated was there time now to get to the room lay jessica on the bed pull the curtains wide so that the low sun streamed across the soft flesh illuminating the topography of her body and run his nails over her skin the way he felt at the moment absorbed with her and thinking of the spectacle at seven oclock tonight the liaison wouldnt take long severan dunne said crisply we dont know what alfulan has for us we probably should go hydt appeared to ponder the words but it was not serious consideration he said its been a long flight i feel like a change of clothes he glanced down at jessicas weary eyes and you might like a nap my dear he directed her firmly to the lift at around four fortyfive on tuesday afternoon fouad kharazs private jet eased to a stop james bond unbuckled his seatbelt and collected his luggage he thanked the pilots and the flight attendant gripping her hand warmly and resisting the urge to kiss her cheek they were now in the middle east the immigration officer lethargically stamped his passport slid it back and gestured him into the country bond strode through the nothing to declare lane at customs with a suitcase containing its deadly contraband and was soon outside in the piquant heat feeling as if a huge burden had been lifted he was in his element once more the mission his and his alone to pursue he was on foreign soil his carte blancherestored the short ride from the airport to his destination at festival city took bond through a nondescript part of the town drives to and from airports were similar throughout the world and this route was little different from the a just west of london or the toll road to dulles in washington dc although it was decorated with far more sand and dust and as most of the emirate was immaculately clean on the way bond gazed out over the sprawling city looking north towards the persian gulf in the lateafternoon heatshimmering light the needle of the burj khalifa glowed soaring above the geometrically complex skyline of sheikh zayed road it was presently the tallest building on earth that distinction seemed to change monthly but this tower would surely hold that honour for a long time to come he noted one other ubiquitous characteristic of the city the construction cranes white and yellow and orange they were everywhere and busy once again on his last trip there had been just as many of these looming stalks but most were sitting idle like toys discarded by a child whod lost interest in playing with them the emirate had been hit hard in the recent economic downturn for his official cover bond had to keep up on world finance and he found himself impatient with the criticism ladled upon places like dubai which often originated in london or new york yet werent the city and wall street the more enthusiastic coconspirators in causing the economic woe yes there had been excess here and many ambitious projects might never be finished like the artificial archipelago in the shape of a map of the world composed of small sand islands offshore yet the reputation for swelling luxury was but a small aspect of dubai and in truth no different from singapore california monaco and hundreds of other places where the wealthy worked and played to bond in any event dubai was not about unfettered business or real estate but about its exotic ways a place where new and old blended where many cultures and religions coexisted respectfully he particularly enjoyed the vast empty landscape of red sand populated by camels and range rovers as different from his boyhood vistas of kent as one could imagine he wondered if his mission today would take him to the empty quarter they drove on past small brown white and yellow onestorey buildings whose names and services were disclosed in modest green arabic lettering no gaudy billboards no neon lights except for a few announcements of forthcoming events the minarets of mosques rose above the low residences and businesses persistent spikes of faith throughout the hazy distance the intrusion of the ubiquitous desert was everywhere and date palm neem and eucalyptus trees formed gallant outposts against the encroaching endless sand the taxi driver dropped bond as directed at a shopping centre he handed over some tendirham notes and climbed out the mall was packed with locals it was between asirand maghribprayer times as well as many foreigners all carting carrier bags and crowding the shops which were doing brisk business the country was often referred to as do buy he recalled bond lost himself in the crowd looking around as if he were trying to find a companion hed agreed to meet in fact he was searching for someone else the man whod been following him from the airport probably with hostile intent twice now hed seen a man in sunglasses and a blue shirt or jacket at the airport and then in a dusty black toyota behind bonds taxi for the drive he had donned a plain black cap but from the set of his head and shoulders and the shape of his glasses bond knew he was the man hed seen at the airport the same toyota had just now eased past the shopping centre driving slowly for no apparent reason and vanished behind a nearby hotel this was no coincidence bond had considered sending the taxi on a diversionary route but in truth he wasnt sure he wanted to lose the tail more often than not its better to trap your pursuer and see what he has to say for himself who was he had he been waiting in dubai for bond or somehow followed him from london or did he not even know who bond was but had chosen merely to keep an eye on a stranger in town bond bought a newspaper today it was hot searingly so but he shunned the airconditioned interior of the café he had selected and sat outside where he could observe all the entrances and exits to and from the area he looked around occasionally for the tail but saw nothing specific as he sent and received several text messages a waiter came to him bond glanced at the faded menu on the table and ordered turkish coffee and sparkling water as the man walked away bond looked at his watch five pm only two hours until more than ninety people died somewhere in this elegant city of sand and heat half a block away from the shopping centre a solidly built man in a blue jacket slipped a dubai traffic warden several hundred dirhams and told him in english that hed only be a short while hed certainly be gone before the crowds returned after sunset prayer the warden wandered off as if the conversation about the dusty black toyota parked illegally at the kerb had never occurred the man who went by the name nick lit a cigarette and lifted his backpack over his shoulder he eased into the shadows of the shopping centre where his target was nonchalantly sipping espresso or turkish coffee and reading the paper as if he hadnt a care in the world that was how he thought of the man target not bastard not enemy nick knew that in an operation like this you had to be utterly dispassionate as difficult as that might be this man was no more of a person than the black dot of a bullseye a target he supposed the man was talented but hed been pretty damn careless leaving the airport nick had easily followed him this gave him confidence at what he was about to do face obscured by a baseball cap with a long brim and sunglasses nick moved closer to his target dodging from shadow to shadow unlike in other places the disguise did not draw attention to him in dubai everyone wore head coverings and sunglasses one thing that was a bit different was the longsleeved blue jacket which few local people wore given the heat but there was no other way to hide the pistol that was tucked into his waistband nicks gold earring too might have earned him some curious glances but this area of dubai creek with its shopping malls and amusement park was filled with tourists and as long as people didnt drink alcohol or kiss each other in public the locals forgave unusual dress he inhaled deeply on his cigarette then dropped and crushed it easing closer to his target a hawker appeared suddenly and asked in english if he wanted to buy rugs very cheap very cheap many knots thousands upon thousands of knots one look from nick shut his mouth and he vanished nick considered his plan there would be some logistical problems of course in this country everyone watched everyone else he would have to get his target out of sight into the car park or better the basement of the shopping centre perhaps during prayer time when the crowds thinned probably the simplest approach was the best nick could slip up behind him shove the gun into his back and escort him downstairs then the knife work would begin oh the target all right maybe i will think of him as a bastard would have many things to say when the blade began its leisurely journey across his skin nick reached under his jacket and pushed up the safety lever of his pistol moving smoothly from shadow to shadow james bond had his coffee and water in front of him as he sat with the nationalnewspaper published out of abu dhabi he considered it the best newspaper in the middle east you could find every sort of story imaginable from a scandal about mumbai firemens inefficient uniforms to pieces about womens rights in the arab world to a halfpage exposé on a cypriot gangster stealing the body of the islands former president from his grave excellent formula one coverage too important to bond now however he was paying no attention to the paper but was using it as a prop though not with the cliché of an eyehole torn from the gutter between ads for dubais lulu hypermarkets and the local news the paper sat flat in front of him and his head was down his eyes however were up scanning it was at that moment that he heard a brief rasp of shoe leather behind him and was aware of someone moving quickly towards his table bond remained completely still then a large hand pale and freckled gripped the chair beside him and yanked it back a man dropped heavily into it howdy james the voice was thick with a texas accent welcome to dubai dubah bond turned to his friend with a grin they shook hands warmly a few years older than bond felix leiter was tall and had a lanky frame on which his suit hung loose the pale complexion and mop of strawcoloured hair largely precluded most undercover work in the middle east unless he was playing exactly who he was a brash savvy guyfrom the american south whod ridden into town for business with no small amount of pleasure thrown in his slow manners and easygoing speech were deceptive he could react like a spring knife when the occasion demanded as bond had seen first hand when the pilot of fouad kharazs grumman had reported that they werent going to beat hydts to dubai it was felix leiter whom bond had rung calling in his lehman brothers favour while bond was uneasy using the mi connections here because of osbornesmiths inquiries earlier he had no such reservations about enlisting the cia which had an extensive operation throughout the united arab emirates asking leiter a senior agent in the agencys national clandestine service to help out was risky politically using a sister agency without clearance from the top might result in serious diplomatic repercussions and bond had already done so once with rené mathis he was certainly putting his newly reinstated carte blancheto the test felix leiter was more than willing to meet hydts plane and follow the trio to their destination which had turned out to be the intercontinental hotel it was connected to the shopping centre where the two men now sat bond had briefed him about hydt the irishman and ten minutes ago via text about the man in the toyota leiter had remained in surveillance positions at the shopping centre for a time to literally watch bonds back so do i have a friend hanging about spotted him moving in about forty yards to the south said leiter smiling as if countersurveillance was the last thing on his mind he was by the entrance thataway but the sonofabitch vanished whoever he is hes good you got that right gazing around leiter now asked you believe the shopping here he gestured at the patrons you have malls in england james yes indeed televisions too and running water were hoping to get computers some day ha ill come visit some time soon as you learn how to refrigerate beer leiter flagged down the waiter and ordered coffee he whispered to bond id say americano but then people might guess my nationality whichd blow my cover all to hell he tugged at his ear a signal it seemed for a slightly built arab man dressed like a local appeared bond had no idea where hed been stationed the man looked as if he might have been piloting one of the abra boat taxis that plied dubai creek yusuf nasad leiter introduced him this is mr smith bond assumed that nasad was not the arabs real name either he would be a local asset and because leiter was running him hed be a damn good one too felix leiter was a master handler it was nasad whod helped him track hydt from the airport the american explained nasad sat down leiter asked our friend gone he saw you i am thinking i stand out too damn much leiter laughed dont know why langley sent me here if i was undercover in alabama nobodyd notice me bond said i didnt get much of a view dark hair blue shirt a tough boy nasad said in what bond thought of as american tv english athletic hairs cut very short and he has a gold earring no beard i tried to get a picture but he was gone too fast besides leiter filled in all weve got is crap to take pictures with you still have that fellow giving you folks neat toys whats his name again q somebody quentin quigley qs the branch not a person stands for quartermaster and it was a jacket he was wearing nasad added not a shirt like a windbreaker in this heat bond asked so he was carrying you see what type of weapon no any idea who he might be nasad offered definitely not arab could have been a katsa why the hell would a mossad field officer be interested in me leiter said only you can answer that boy bond shook his head maybe somebody recruited by the secret police here naw doubt it the amn aldawla dont tail you they just invite you to their fourstar accommodations in the deira where you spill everything they want to know and i mean everything nasads quick eyes took in the café and surrounding area and apparently noted no threats bond had observed him doing this since his arrival leiter asked bond you think it was somebody working for hydt possibly but if so i doubt they know who i am bond explained that before hed left london hed been concerned that hydt and the irishman would get too suspicious that he was on their trail especially after the flap in serbia hed had t branch adjust the records of his bentley to link the number plate to a disposal company in manchester with possible underworld ties then bill tanner had sent agents posing as scotland yard officers to the march demolition site with a story about one of midlands disposals security men going missing in the area itll put hydt and the irishman off the scent at least for a few days bond said now have you heard any chatter here the americans otherwise cheerful face tightened no relevant elint or sigint not that i care much about eavesdropping felix leiter a former marine whom bond had met in the service was a humint spy he vastly preferred the role of handler running local assets like yusuf nasad i pulled in a lot of favours and talked to all my key assets whatever hydt and his local contactsre up to theyre keeping the lid on really tight i cant find any leads nobodys been moving any mysterious shipments of nasty stuff into dubai nobodys been telling friends and family to avoid this mosque or that shopping centre around seven tonight no bad actorsre slipping in from across the gulf thats the irishmans doing keeping the wraps on everything i dont know exactly what he does for hydt but hes bloody clever always thinking about security its as if he can anticipate whatever were going to do and think up a way to counter it they fell silent as they casually surveyed the shopping centre no sign of the bluejacketed tail no sign of hydt or the irishman bond asked leiter you still a scribbler sure am the texan confirmed leiters cover was as a freelance journalist and blogger specialising in music particularly the blues r b and afrocaribbean journalism is a commonly used cover for intelligence agents it gives credence to their frequent travelling often to hotspots and the lesssavoury places of the world leiter was fortunate in that the best covers are those that mirror an agents actual interests since an assignment may require the operative to be undercover for weeks or months at a time the filmmaker alexander korda recruited by the famed british spymaster sir claude dansey reportedly used location scouting expeditions as a cover to photograph offlimits areas in the runup to the second world war bonds bland official cover a security and integrity analyst for the overseas development group subjected him to excruciatingly boring stints when he was on assignment on a particularly bad day he would long for an official cover as a skiing or scuba instructor bond sat forward and leiter followed his gaze they watched two men come out of the front door of the intercontinental and walk towards a black lincoln town car its hydt and the irishman leiter sent nasad to fetch his vehicle then pointed to a dusty old alfa romeo in a nearby car park whispering to bond over there my wheels lets go the lincoln carrying severan hydt and niall dunne eased east through the haze and heat paralleling the massive power lines conducting electricity to the outer regions of the citystate nearby was the persian gulf the rich blue muted nearly to beige by the dust in the air and the glare of the low but unrelenting sun they were taking a convoluted route through dubai cruising past the indoor ski complex the striking burj alarab hotel which resembled a sail and was nearly as tall as the eiffel tower and the luxurious palm jumeirah the sculpted development of shops homes and hotels extending far into the gulf and fashioned as the name suggested in the likeness of an indigenous tree these areas of glistening beauty upset severan hydt the new the unblemished he felt much more comfortable when the vehicle slipped into the older satwa neighbourhood densely populated by thousands upon thousands of workingclass folk mostly immigrants the time was nearly five thirty an hour and a half before the event it was also hydt had noted with irony an hour and a half until sunset curious coincidence he reflected a good sign his ancestors his spiritual if not necessarily genetic forebears had believed in omens and portents and he allowed himself to do so as well yes he was a practical hardheaded businessman but he had his otherside he thought again about tonight they continued to cruise along the roads in a complicated fashion the purpose of this dizzying tour wasnt to sightsee no taking the roundabout route to get to a spot merely five miles from the intercontinental had been dunnes idea of security but the driver a mercenary with experience in afghanistan and syria reported i thought we were being followed an alfa and possibly a ford but if so weve lost them im sure dunne looked back then said good go to the works they circled back to the city in ten minutes they were at an industrial complex in the deira the cluttered and colourful area in the centre of town nestled along dubai creek and the gulf this was another place in which hydt felt immediately comfortable to enter the neighbourhood was to take a step back in time its uneven houses traditional markets and the rustic port along the creek whose docks teemed with dhows and other small vessels might have been the backdrop to a s adventure film the ships were piled impossibly high with stacks of cargo lashed into place the driver found the destination a goodsized factory and warehouse with attached offices one storey the shabby beige paint peeling razor wire rare in lowcrime dubai topped the chainlink fence surrounding the place the driver pulled up to an intercom and spoke in arabic the gate slowly swung open the town car eased into the car park and stopped the two men climbed out with an hour and fifteen minutes to sunset the air was cooling even as the ground radiated heat banked during the day hydt heard a voice carried on the dusty wind please my friend please come in the man waving his hand was in a white dishdasharobe in the uniquely emirates style and had no head covering he was in his midfifties hydt knew although like many arab men he looked younger a studious face smart glasses western shoes his longish hair was swept back mahdi alfulan strode over sprays of red sand which drifted along the tarmac and sloped against the kerb the walkways and the sides of buildings the arabs eyes were bright as if he were a schoolboy about to show off a treasured project which wasnt far from the truth hydt reflected a black beard framed his smile hydt had been amused to learn that while hair colouring was not a good product to market in a land where both male and female heads were usually covered beard dye was a bestseller hands were gripped my friend hydt didnt try to offer an arabic greeting he had no talent for languages and believed it a weakness to attempt anything you were not skilled at niall dunne stepped forward his shoulders bouncing as they always did in his gangling walk and also greeted the man but the pale eyes were gazing past the arab for once they were not searching for threats he was staring raptly at the bounty that the warehouse held which could be seen through the open door perhaps fifty or so machines in every shape a geometrician could name made of raw and painted steel iron aluminium carbon fibre who knew what else pipes protruded wires control panels lights switches chutes and belts if robots had pleasant dreams they would be set in this room they entered the warehouse which was devoid of workers dunne paused to study and occasionally even caress some device or other mahdi alfulan was an industrial product designer mit educated he shunned the kind of highprofile entrepreneurship that gets you on the cover of business magazines and often into the bankruptcy court and specialised instead in designing functional industrial equipment and control systems for which there was a consistent market he was one of severan hydts main suppliers hydt had met him at a recyclingequipment conference once hed learnt about certain trips the arab took abroad and about the dangerous men to whom he sold his wares theyd become partners alfulan was a clever scientist an innovative engineer a man with ideas and inventions important to gehenna and with other connections too ninety dead at that thought hydt involuntarily consulted his watch nearly six follow me please severan niall alfulan had caught hydts glance the arab led them through the various rooms dim and still dunne again slowed his step to examine some machinery or a control panel hed nod approvingly or frown perhaps trying to understand how a system worked leaving behind the machines with their scent of oil paint and the unique metallic almost bloodlike odour of highpowered electrical systems they entered the offices at the end of a dim corridor alfulan used a computer key to open an unmarked door and they stepped into a work area which was large and cluttered with thousands of sheets of paper blueprints and other documents on which were words graphs and diagrams many of them incomprehensible to hydt the atmosphere was eerie to say the least both because of the dimness and the clutter and because of what decorated the walls images of eyes eyes of all sorts human fish canine feline and insect photos computerised threedimensional renderings medical drawings from the s particularly unsettling was a fanciful detailed blueprint of a human eye as if a modernday dr frankenstein had used current engineering techniques to construct his monster in front of one of the dozens of large computer monitors sat an attractive woman a brunette in her late twenties she stood up strode to hydt and shook his hand vigorously stella kirkpatrick im mahdis research assistant she greeted dunne too hydt had been to dubai several times but had not met her before the womans accent was american hydt supposed she was clever hardheaded and typical of a common phenomenon in this part of the world one that went back hundreds of years the westerner in love with arab culture alfulan said stella worked up most of the algorithms did you now hydt asked with a smile she blushed the ruddy colour stemming from her affection for her mentor whom she glanced at quickly a supplication for approval which alfulan provided in the form of a seductive smile hydt was not a participant in this exchange as the decorations on the walls suggested alfulans speciality was optics his goal in life was to invent an artificial eye for the blind that would work as well as those allah praise be to him created for us but until that happened he would make a great deal of money designing industrial machinery he had come up with most of the specialised safety control and inspection systems for green ways sorters and documentdestruction devices hydt had recently commissioned him to create yet another device for the company and had come here today with dunne to see the prototype a demonstration the arab said please hydt replied they all walked back into the garden of machines alfulan led them to a complicated device weighing several tons sitting in the loading bay beside two large industrial refuse compactors the arab hit buttons and with a growl the machine slowly warmed up it was about twenty feet long six high and six wide at the front end a metal conveyorbelt led into a mouth about a yard square inside all was blackness although hydt could just make out horizontal cylinders covered with spikes like a combine harvester at the rear half a dozen chutes led to bins each containing a thick grey plastic liner open at the top to catch whatever the machine disgorged hydt studied it carefully he and green way made a lot of money from destroying documents securely but the world was changing most data resided on computer and flash drives nowadays and this would be increasingly the case in the future hydt had decided to expand his empire by offering a new approach to destroying computer data storage devices a number of companies did this as did green way but the new approach would be different thanks to alfulans invention at the moment to destroy data effectively computers had to be dismantled by hand and hard drives had to be wiped of data with magnetic degaussing units then crushed other steps were required to separate the other components of the old computer many of them dangerous ewaste this machine however did everything automatically you simply tossed the old computer on to the belt and the device did the rest breaking it apart while alfulans optical systems identified the components and sent them to appropriate bins hydts sales people could assure his customers that this machine would make certain not only that the sensitive information on the hard drive was destroyed but that all the other components were identified and disposed of according to local environmental regulations at a nod from her boss stella picked up an old laptop and set it on the ribbed conveyorbelt it vanished into the dim recesses of the device they heard a series of sharp cracks and thuds and finally a loud grinding noise alfulan directed his guests to the rear where after five or six minutes they watched the machine spit the various sorted bits of scrap into different bins metal plastic circuit boards and the like in the bin liner marked media storage they saw fine metal and silicon dust all that was left of the hard drive the dangerous ewaste like the batteries and heavy metals was deposited in a receptacle marked with warning labels and the benign components were dropped into recycling bins alfulan then directed hydt and dunne to a monitor on which a report about the machines efforts scrolled past dunnes icy façade had slipped he seemed almost excited hydt too was pleased very pleased he began to ask a question but then he looked at a clock on the wall it was six thirty he could concentrate on the machinery no longer james bond felix leiter and yusuf nasad were fifty feet from the factory crouching beside a large skip observing hydt the irishman an arab in a traditional white robe and an attractive darkhaired woman through a loadingbay window with bond and leiter in the americans alfa and nasad in his ford bringing up the rear theyd started to follow the lincoln town car from the intercontinental but both agents immediately recognised that the arab driver was starting evasion techniques worried that theyd be spotted bond used an app in his mobile to paint the car with a masint profile and took its coordinates with a laser then uploaded the data to the gchq tracking centre leiter eased off the accelerator and let the satellites follow the vehicle beaming the results to bonds mobile damn leiter had drawled looking at the phone in bonds hand i want one of them bond had followed the town cars progress on his map and directed leiter with nasad following in the general direction that hydt was going which was proving to be a very circuitous route finally the lincoln headed back to the deira the old part of town a few minutes later bond leiter and his asset arrived left the cars in an alleyway between two dusty warehouses and sliced their way through the chainlink fence for a closer view of what hydt and the irishman were up to the driver of the lincoln had remained in the car park bond plugged in an earpiece and trained his phones camera eye on the foursome eavesdropping with an app that sanu hirani had developed the vibramike reconstructed conversation observed through windows or transparent doors by reading vibrations on glass or other nearby smooth surfaces it combined what it detected sonically with visual input of lip and cheek movement eye expression and body language in circumstances like this it could reconstruct conversations with about per cent accuracy after listening to the conversation bond told the others theyre talking about equipment for the green way facilities his legitimate company dammit look at the bastard the american whispered he knows that around ninety people are going to die in a halfhour and its like hes talking to a store clerk about pixels on bigscreen tvs nasads phone buzzed he took the call speaking in staccato arabic some of which bond could decipher he was getting information about the factory he disconnected and explained to the agents that the place was owned by a dubai citizen mahdi alfulan a picture confirmed he was the man hydt and the irishman were with he was not suspected of having any terrorist ties had never been to afghanistan and seemed to be merely an engineer and businessman he did however design and sell his products to among others warlords and arms dealers he had recently developed an optical scanner on a land mine that could differentiate between enemies and friendlies uniforms or badges bond recalled notes hed found up in march blast radius as conversation in the warehouse resumed bond cocked his head and listened once more hydt was saying to the irishman i want to leave for the event mahdi and i will go there now he turned to his arab associate with eerie almost hungry eyes its not far is it no we can walk hydt said to his irish partner maybe you and stella could work out some of the technical details the irishman turned to the woman as hydt and the arab vanished into the warehouse bond closed down the app and glanced at leiter hydt and alfulan are going to the site where the attack is to take place theyre walking ill follow them see if you can find out anything more here the woman and the irishman are going to stay get closer if you can ill call you when i find out whats going on you bet the texan said bayat nasad nodded bond checked his walther and slipped it back into the holster wait james leiter said you know saving these people the ninety or whatever well it could tip your hand if he thinks youre on to him hydt could rabbit hell disappear and youll never find him until he comes up with a new incident twenty and hell be a lot more careful about keeping it secret then if you let him go ahead with whatever hes about to do here hell stay in the dark about you sacrifice them you mean the american held bonds eyes its a tough call i dont know that i could do it but its something to think about i already have and no theyre not dying he spotted the two men making their way out of the compound crouching leiter ran to the building and hauled himself through a small window disappearing silently on the other side he reappeared and gestured nasad joined him bond slipped back through the breach in the fence and made his way after his two targets after several blocks of meandering through industrial alleys hydt and alfulan entered the deira covered souk hundreds of outdoor stalls as well as more conventional shops where you could buy gold spices shoes tv sets cds videos mars bars souvenirs toys middle eastern and western clothing virtually anything imaginable only a portion of the population here seemed to be emiratesborn bond heard bits of conversation in tamil malayalam urdu and tagalog but relatively little arabic shoppers were everywhere hundreds of them intense negotiations were going on at every stall and in every shop hands gesticulating feverishly brows furrowed clipped words flying back and forth do buy bond was following at a discreet distance looking for any sign of their target the people who were going to die in twentyfive minutes what could the ragandbone man possibly have in mind a trial run in anticipation of the carnage on friday which would be ten or twenty times as bad or was this unrelated perhaps hydt was using his role as an international businessman as a cover were he and the irishman just hired killers stateoftheart hitmen bond dodged through the logjam of merchants shoppers tourists and dock workers loading the dhows with cargo it was very crowded now just before maghrib the sunset prayer were the markets to be the site of the attack then hydt and alfulan left the souk and continued to walk for half a block they stopped and gazed up at a modern structure three storeys high with large glass windows overlooking dubai creek it was a public building filled with men women and children bond moved closer and saw a sign in arabic and english the museum of the emirates so this was the target and it was a damn good one bond scanned it at least a hundred people meandered through the ground floor alone and there would surely be many more on the floors above the building was close to the creek with only a narrow road in front which meant that emergency vehicles would have a difficult time getting close to the scene of the carnage alfulan looked around uneasily but hydt pushed through the front door they vanished into the crowd im not letting those people die bond plugged his earpiece in and called up the eavesdropping app on his phone he followed the two men inside paid a small admission fee and eased closer to his targets blending with a group of western tourists he couldnt help but think about what felix leiter had said saving these people might indeed alert hydt that someone was on to him what would m do under these circumstances he supposed the old man would sacrifice the ninety to save thousands hed been an activeduty admiral in the royal navy officers at that level had to make hard decisions like this all the time but dammit bond thought i have to do something he saw children scampering around saw men and women gazing at and talking animatedly about the exhibits people laughing people nodding with rapt interest as a tour guide lectured hydt and alfulan moved further into the building what were they doing had they planned to leave an explosive device perhaps it was what had been constructed in the hospital basement in march or perhaps the industrial designer alfulan had made something else for hydt bond circled through the large marble lobby filled with arabic art and antiquities a massive chandelier in gold dominated the room bond casually pointed the microphone towards the men he caught dozens of scraps of conversation from others but none between hydt and alfulan angry with himself he adjusted his aim more carefully and finally heard hydts voice ive been looking forward to this for a long time i must thank you again for making it happen alfulan i am pleased to do what i can it is good we are in business together distracted hydt whispered i would like to take pictures of the bodies yes yes of course anything you want severan how close can i get to the bodies hydt then said its almost seven are we ready what should i do bond thought desperately people are about to die your enemys purpose will dictate your response on the wall he noted a fire alarm he could pull it evacuate the building but he also saw cctvs and security guards hed be identified immediately as the man whod pulled the lever and though hed try to flee the guards and police might stop him find his weapon hydt might see him hed easily deduce what had happened the mission would collapse was there any better response he couldnt think of one and edged close to the firealarm panel six fiftyfive hydt and alfulan were walking quickly to a door at the rear of the lobby bond was at the alarm now he was in full view of three security cameras and a guard was no more than twenty feet away he had noticed bond now and perhaps registered that his behaviour wasnt quite what youd expect of a casual western tourist in an arcane museum of this sort the man bent his head and spoke into a microphone attached to his shoulder in front of bond a family stood before a diorama of a camel race the little boy and his father were laughing at the comical models six fiftysix the squat guard turned towards bond he wore a pistol and the protective flap covering it had been unsnapped six fiftyseven the guard started forward his hand near his gun still with hydt and alfulan merely twenty feet away bond reached for the firealarm lever at that moment an announcement in arabic came over the publicaddress system bond paused to listen he understood most of it the english translation a moment later confirmed his take on the words gentlemen will ticket holders for the seven oclock show now proceed through the north wing door that was the entrance hydt and alfulan were now approaching at the back of the main hall they werent leaving the museum if this was the location where the people would die why werent the two men fleeing bond left the alarm panel and stepped to the door the guard eyed him once more then turned away fixing his holster flap hydt and his colleague stood at the entrance to a special show the museum was hosting bond exhaled slowly as he understood at last the title of the exhibition was death in the sand a notice at the entrance explained that last autumn archaeologists had discovered a mass grave dating back a thousand years located near abu dhabis liwa oasis about a hundred kilometres inland from the persian gulf an entire nomadic arab tribe ninetytwo people had been attacked and slaughtered just after the battle a sandstorm had buried the bodies when the village had been discovered last year the remains were found perfectly preserved in the hot dry sands the exhibition was of the desiccated bodies laid out exactly as they were found in a recreation of the village for the general public it seemed the bodies were modestly covered the special exhibition tonight at seven which included only men was for scientists doctors and professors the corpses were not covered alfulan had apparently managed to get hydt a ticket bond nearly laughed out loud and relief flooded over him misunderstandings and even outright errors are not uncommon in the nuanced business of espionage where operatives have to make plans and execute them with only fragments of information at their disposal often the results of such mistakes are disastrous bond couldnt recall an instance in which the opposite was true as here when a looming tragedy turned into an evenings innocuous cultural excursion his first thought was that hed enjoy telling philly maidenstone the story his amusement dimmed however as he reflected soberly hed almost destroyed the mission for the sake of ninety people who had been dead for nearly a millennium then his mood grew more sombre yet as he looked into the large exhibition room and caught glimpses of the panorama of death the bodies some retaining much of the skin like leather others were mostly skeletons hands reaching out perhaps in a last plea for mercy emaciated forms of mothers cradling their children eye sockets empty fingers mere twigs and more than a few mouths twisted into horrific smiles by the ravages of time and decay bond looked at hydts face as the ragandbone man stared down at the victims he was enraptured an almost sexual lust glowed in his eyes even alfulan seemed troubled at the pleasure his business associate was displaying ive never heard that kind of joy at the prospect of killing hydt was taking picture after picture the repeated flash from his mobile bathing the corpses in brilliant light and making them all the more supernatural and horrific what a bloody waste of time bond reflected all hed learnt from the trip was that hydt had some fancy new machinery for his recycling operations and that he got a sick high from images of dead bodies was incident twenty whatever it might be a similar misreading of the intercept he thought back to the phrasing of the original message and concluded that whatever was planned for friday was a real threat estimated initial casualties in the thousands british interests adversely affected funds transfers as discussed that clearly described an attack hydt and alfulan were moving deeper into the exhibition hall and without a special ticket bond couldnt pursue them further but hydt was speaking again bond lifted the phone i do hope you understand about that girl of yours whats her name again stella alfulan said no we dont have any choice when she finds out im not leaving my wife shell be a risk she knows too much and frankly he added shes been quite a nuisance lately hydt continued my associates handling everything hell take her out to the desert make her disappear whatever he does though will be efficient hes quite amazing at planning well everything thatwas why the irishman had remained at the warehouse if he was going to kill stella there wassomething more to this trip than legitimate business hed have to assume it involved incident twenty bond hurried from the museum calling felix leiter they had to save the woman and learn what she knew leiters mobile however rang four times then stepped into voicemail bond tried again why the hell wasnt the american picking up were he and nasad trying to save stella at this moment perhaps fighting with the irishman or the chauffeur or both of them another call voicemail again bond broke into a run weaving through the souks as haunting voices calling the faithful to prayer filled the sunset sky sweating hard gasping he arrived at alfulans warehouse five minutes later hydts town car was gone bond slipped through the hole theyd cut earlier in the fence the window leiter had climbed through was now closed bond ran to the warehouse and used a lock pick to open a side door he slipped inside drawing the walther the place seemed to be deserted though he could hear the loud whining of machinery from somewhere nearby no sign of the girl and where were leiter and nasad just a few seconds later bond learnt the answer to that question part of it at least in the room leiter had entered he found bloodstains on the floor fresh there were signs of a struggle with several tools lying nearby along with leiters pistol and phone bond summoned a scenario of what might have happened leiter and nasad had separated with the american hiding here he must have been watching the irishman and stella when the arab chauffeur had slipped up behind and hit him with a spanner or pipe had leiter been dragged off thrown into the boot of the town car and taken to the desert with the girl gun in his hand bond headed for the doorway where he heard the sound of the machine he froze at what he saw ahead of him the man in the blue jacket his tail from earlier was rolling the barely conscious form of felix leiter into one of the massive rubbishcompacting machines the cia agent lay sprawled feet first on the conveyorbelt which wasnt moving though the machine itself was running in the centre two huge metal plates on either side of the belt pressed forward nearly meeting then withdrawing to accept a new batch of junk leiters legs were a mere two yards from them the assailant glanced up and scowling stared at the intruder bond steadied his weapons sights on the man and shouted hands out to your sides the man did so but suddenly lunged to his right and slapped a button on the machine then sprinted away vanishing from sight the conveyorbelt began rolling steadily forward with leiter easing towards the thick steel plates which came within six inches of each other then shot back to allow more refuse into their path bond sped to the unit and slapped the red off button then started after the attacker but the heavyduty motor didnt stop immediately the belt continued to carry his friend towards the deadly plates pulsing relentlessly back and forth oh god bond holstered his walther and turned back he grabbed leiter and struggled to pull him out of the machinery but the conveyorbelt was dotted with pointed teeth to improve its grip and leiters clothing was caught head lolling blood streaming into his eyes he continued to be drawn towards the compactor mechanism eighteen inches away sixteen twelve bond leapt on to the belt and jammed a foot against the frame then wound leiters jacket around his hands and gripped furiously hard the momentum slowed but the massive motor continued to drive the belt relentlessly under the faces of the plates shooting back and forth leiter was eight inches then six from the plates that would turn his feet and ankles to pulp his arm and leg muscles in fiery agony bond tugged harder groaning at the effort three inches finally the belt stopped and with a hydraulic gasp so did the plates struggling for breath bond reached in and untangled the americans trousers from the teeth on the belt and pulled him out easing him to the floor he ran to the loading bay drawing his weapon but there was no sign of the man in blue then scanning for other threats bond returned to the cia agent who was coming round he sat up slowly bond helping and oriented himself cant leave you alone for five minutes can i bond asked masking the horror hed felt at his friends near fate as he examined the wound in the mans head and mopped it with a rag hed found nearby leiter gazed at the machine shook his head then his familiar grin spread across his lean face you britsre always barging in at the wrong time i had him just where i wanted him hospital bond asked his heart pounded from the effort of the rescue and relief at the outcome naw the american examined the rag it was bloody but leiter seemed more angry than injured hell james were past the deadline the ninety people bond explained about the exhibition leiter barked a harsh laugh what a screwup brother did we misread that one so hydt gets off on dead bodies and he wanted picturesof them mans got a whole new idea of porn bond collected leiters phone and weapon and returned them to him what happened felix leiters eyes stilled the driver of the town car came into the warehouse right after you left i could see him and that irishman talking looking at the girl i knew something was going down and that meant shed know something i was going to finesse it somehow and save her claim we were safety inspectors or something before i could move they grabbed the girl and taped her up dragged her toward the office i sent yusuf around to the other side and started toward them but that bastard nailed me before i got ten feet the guy from the shopping centre your tail i know i spotted him man the sob knows some martialarts crap ill tell you that he clocked me good and i was down for the count did he say anything grunted a lot when he hit me was he working with the irishman or alfulan couldnt tell i didnt see them together and the girl weve got to find her if we can theyre probably on their way out to the desert if were lucky yusufs following them probably tried to call when i was out with bond helping the agent struggled to his feet he took his phone and hit speed dial and from nearby came the chirp of a ringtone a cheerful electronic tune but muted both men looked around then leiter turned to bond oh no the american whispered closing his eyes briefly they hurried to the back of the compactor the sound was coming from inside a large filled bin liner which the machine had automatically sealed with wire and then disgorged on to the loadingbay platform to be carted off for disposal bond too had realised what had happened ill look he said no leiter said firmly its my job he unwound the wire took a deep breath and looked inside the bag bond joined him the dense jigsaw of sharp metal pieces wires and nuts bolts and screws were entwined with a mass of gore and bloody cloth bits of human organs bone the glazed eyes in yusuf nasads crushed distorted face stared directly between the two men without a word they returned to the alfa and checked the satellite tracking system which reported that hydts limo had returned to the intercontinental it had made two brief stops on the way presumably to transfer the girl to another car for her last trip out to the desert and to collect hydt from the museum fifteen minutes later bond piloted the alfa past the hotel and into the car park do you want to get a room bond asked take care of that he gestured at leiters head naw i need a goddamn drink ill just wash up meet you in the bar they parked and bond opened the boot he collected his laptop bag leaving the suitcase inside leiter pulled his own small bag over his shoulder and found a cap branded so to speak with the logo of the university of texas longhorns gridiron team he pulled it gingerly over his wound and stuffed his strawcoloured hair underneath they took the side entrance into the hotel inside leiter went to wash and bond making sure none of the hydt entourage was in the lobby passed through it and stepped outside he assessed a group of limo drivers standing in a cluster and talking busily bond saw that none of them was hydts driver he gestured to the smallest of the lot and the man walked over eagerly you have a card bond asked indeed yes i do sir and offered one bond glanced at and pocketed it what would like sir a dune bashing trip no i know the gold souk for your lady you will bring her something from dubai and be her hero the man who hired that limo bonds gaze swept quickly over hydts lincoln the drivers eyes went still bond wasnt worried he knew when somebody was for sale he tried once more you know him dont you not especially sir but you drivers always talk among yourselves you know everything that goes on here especially regarding a curious fellow like mr hydt he slipped the man five hundred dirhams yes sir yes sir i may have heard something let me think yes perhaps and what might that have been i believe he and his friends have gone to the restaurant they will be there for two hours or so its a very good restaurant meals are leisurely any idea where theyre going from here a nod but no accompanying words another five hundred dirhams joined their friends the man laughed softly and cynically people are careless around us we are simply people to shepherd folks around we are camels beasts of burden im referring to the fact that people think we dont exist therefore whatever they say in front of us they believe we do not hear however sensitive it might be however valuable bond held up more cash then returned it to his pocket the driver glanced about briefly then said hes flying to cape town tonight a private jet leaving in about three hours as i told you the restaurant downstairs is known for its sumptuous and leisurely dining experience a fake pout but your questions tell me you probably do not want me to have an associate book a table i understand perhaps on your next trip to dubai now bond handed over the rest of the money he then withdrew the mans business card and flicking it with his thumb asked my associate the man who came in with me did you see him tough one very tough i will be leaving dubai soon but he will be staying he most sincerely hopes your information about mr hydt is accurate the smile blew away like sand yes yes sir it is completely accurate i swear to allah praise be to him bond went into the bar and took a table on the outdoor terrace overlooking dubai creek a peaceful mirror dotted with swaying reflections of coloured light which utterly belied the horror he had witnessed at alfulans works the waiter approached and asked what he would like american bourbon was bonds favourite spirit but he believed vodka was medicinal if not curative when served bitingly cold he now ordered a double stolichnaya martini medium dry and asked that it be shaken very well which not only chilled the vodka better than stirring but bruised aerated it too improving the flavour considerably lemon peel only when the drink arrived suitably opaque evidence of a proper shaking he drank half immediately and felt the oxymoronic burning chill flow from throat to face it helped dull the frustration that he hadnt been able to save either the young woman or yusuf nasad it did nothing however to mitigate the memory of hydts eerie expression as he gazed lusting at the petrified bodies he sipped again staring absently at the television above the bar on whose screen the beautiful bahraini singer ahlam was swirling through a video edited in the jerky style fashionable on arab and indian tv her infectious trilling voice floated from the speakers he drained the glass then called bill tanner he explained about the false alarm at the history museum and the deaths and added that hydt would head for cape town that night could t branch arrange a ride for bond he could no longer hitchhike on his friends grumman which had gone back to london ill see what i can do james probably have to be commercial i dont know if i can get you there ahead of hydt though i just need a watcher to meet the flight and see where he goes whats the six situation down there station zs got a covert operator on the cape gregory lamb let me check his status bond heard typing hes up in eritrea at the moment that sabrerattling on the sudanese borders got worse but james we dont want to get lamb involved if we can avoid it he doesnt have an entirely irreproachable record he went native like some character out of a graham greene novel i think six have been meaning to hand him a redundancy package but havent got round to it ill find somebody local for you id recommend saps the police service rather than national intelligence nias been in the news lately and not in a good way ill make some calls and let you know thanks bill can you patch me to q will do good luck a thoughtful voice was soon on the line q branch hirani its sanu im in dubai i need something fast after bond had explained hirani seemed disappointed at the simplicity of the assignment where are you he asked intercontinental festival city bond heard typing all right thirty minutes just remember flowers they rang off as leiter arrived sat down and ordered a jim beam neat that means no ice no water no fruit salad no nothing but it does mean a double and i could live with a triple bond ordered another martini when the waiter left he asked hows the head its nothing leiter murmured he didnt seem badly injured and bond knew that his subdued mood was due to the loss of nasad you find out anything about hydt theyre leaving tonight a couple of hours going to cape town whats down there no idea thats what i have to find out and find out within three days bond reminded himself if he wanted to save those thousands of people they fell silent as the waiter brought their drinks both agents scanned the large room as they sipped there was no sign of the darkhaired man with the earring or of watchers paying too much attention or not enough to the men in the corner neither man raised a toast to the memory of the asset whod just died as tempted as you were you never did that nasad bond asked his body the thought of an ally going to such an ignominious grave was hard leiters lips tightened if hydt and the irishman were involved and i called in a team theyd know we were on to them im not risking our cover at this point yusuf knew what he was getting into bond nodded it was the right way to handle it though that didnt make the decision any easier leiter inhaled the fumes of his whiskey then drank again you know in this business its choices like that thatre the hard ones not pulling out your sixshooter and playing butch cassidy that you just do without thinking bonds mobile buzzed t branch had booked him an overnight flight on air emirates to cape town it left in three hours bond was pleased with the choice of carrier the airline had studiously avoided becoming just another mass market operation and treated its passengers to what he guessed was the quality service that typified the golden age of air travel fifty or sixty years ago he told leiter of his departure arrangements he added lets get some food the american waved over a waiter and asked for a mezzeplatter and then bring us a grilled hammour bone it if yalld be so kind yes sir bond ordered a bottle of a good premier cruchablis which arrived a moment later they sipped from the chilled glasses silently until the first course arrived kofta olives hummus cheese aubergine nuts and the best flatbread bond had ever had both men began to eat after the waiter had cleared away the remnants he brought the main course the simple white fish lay steaming on a bed of green lentils it was very good delicate yet with a faint meatiness bond had eaten only a few mouthfuls when his phone hummed again caller id showed only the code for a british government number thinking philly might be ringing from a different office bond answered he immediately regretted doing so james james james guess who percy here long time no speak bonds heart sank leiter frowned at the glower on bonds face percy yes division threes osbornesmith enquired you well no altercations requiring anything more than a plaster i trust im fine delighted to hear it now things are proceeding apace here your boss has briefed everyone about the gehenna plan you were perhaps too busy fleeing the jurisdiction to be in touch he let that hang for a moment then said aha just winding you up james fact is im calling for several reasons and the first is to apologise really bond asked suspicious the division three mans voice grew serious in london this morning ill admit i had a tac team ready to grab hydt at the airport bring him in for some tea and conversation but it turns out you were right the watchers picked up a scrap and managed to decrypt it hold on i quote from the record here we go something garbled then severan has three main partners any one of them can push the button if hes not available so you see james arresting him wouldhave been a disaster just as you said the others would have scurried down the rabbit hole and wedve lost any chance to find out what gehenna was about and stop it he paused for breath i was a touch whingey when we met and im sorry about that too i want to work with you on this james apologies accepted bygones turned to bygones with a swipe of hermiones magic wand in the intelligence world bond had learnt your allies sought forgiveness for their transgressions against you about as often as your enemies did he supposed that some of osbornesmiths contrition was based on staying in the game for part of the glory but that was all right with bond all he cared about was learning what the gehenna plan was and preventing thousands of deaths i suppose good now your boss sent us a signal about what you found up in march and im following it up the blast radius is pretty obvious an ied so were tracking down any reports of stray explosives and we know that one of the terms of the deal involves five million quid ive called in some favours at the bank of england to check sft activity bond too had thought of calling the bank with a request to flag suspect financial transactions but nowadays five million pounds was such small change that hed believed there would be far too many responses to plough through still it couldnt hurt for osbornesmith to go ahead the division three man added as for the reference to the course being confirmed well until we know more therere no aircraft or ships to monitor but ive put the aviation and port chaps on alert to move fast if we need to good bond said without adding that hed asked bill tanner to do much the same ive just found out that hydt his lady friend and the irishman are on their way to cape town cape town now thats worth chewing over ive been peering into hydts recesses so to speak this was bond supposed what passed for a comradely joke with percy osbornesmith south africa is one of green ways biggest operations his home from home i bet gehenna must have some connection with it lord knows therere plenty of british interests there bond told him about alfulan and the girls death all we learnt specifically is that hydt gets a kick out of pictures of dead bodies and the arabs company probably has something to do with gehenna hes supplied equipment to arms dealers and warlords in the past really interesting which reminds me take a look at the photo im uploading you should have it now bond minimised the activecall screen on his mobile and opened a secure attachment the picture was of the irishman thats him he told osbornesmith thought it might be his names niall dunne he spelt it out how did you find him footage from the cctvs at gatwick hes not in the databases but i had my indefatigable staff compare the pic with street cameras in london there were some close hits of a man with that weird fringe inspecting tunnels that green ways building near the victoria embankment its the latest thing underground rubbish transfer and collection keeps the roads clear and the tourists happy a few of our boys pretended they were from public works flashed his picture and got his real name ive sent his file to five the yard and your chief of staff whats dunnes story bond asked in front of him the fish cooled but hed lost interest in it its curious he was born in belfast studied architecture and engineering came top of his year then he became a sapper in the army sappers were combat engineers the soldiers who built bridges airports and bomb shelters for the troops as well as laid and cleared minefields they were known for their improvisational skills building defensive or offensive machinery and bulwarks with whatever supplies were available and under lessthanideal conditions the odgs lieutenant colonel bill tanner had been a sapper and the softspoken golfloving chief of staff was one of the cleverest and most dangerous men bond had ever met osbornesmith continued after he left the service he became a freelance engineering inspector i didnt know that any such line of work existed but it turns out that in constructing a building ship or plane the project has to be inspected at hundreds of stages dunne would look over the work and say yea or nay he was apparently at the top of his game he could find flaws that nobody else could but suddenly he quit and became a consultant according to inland revenue records hes a damn good one too he makes about two hundred grand a year and doesnt have a company logo or cute mascots like wenlock and mandeville bond found that since the apology he felt less impatient with osbornesmiths wit such as it was thats probably how they met dunne inspected something for green way and hydt hired him osbornesmith continued data minings placed dunne going to and from cape town over the past four years hes got a flat there and one in london which weve been through by the way and found nothing of interest the travel records also show hes been in india indonesia the caribbean and a few other places where troubles brewing working on new outposts for his boss id guess he added whitehalls still looking at afghanistan but i dont give a toss about their theories im sure youre on the money james thanks percy youve been very helpful delighted to be of service the words that bond would have found condescending yesterday now sounded sincere they rang off and bond told felix leiter what osbornesmith had turned up so that scarecrow dunnes an engineer we call em geeks in the states a hawker had entered the restaurant and was moving from table to table selling roses leiter saw the direction of bonds gaze listen up james ive had a wonderful dinner but if youre thinking of sealing the deal with a bouquet it aint gonna happen bond smiled the hawker stepped up to the table next to bonds and extended a flower to a young couple seated there please he said to the wife the lovely lady will have this for free with my compliments he moved on after a moment bond lifted his napkin and opened the envelope hed casually removed from the mans pocket in a perfect brush pass remember flowers discreetly he examined the forgery of a south african firearms permit suitably franked and signed we should go he said noting the time he didnt want to run into hydt dunne and the woman on the way out of the hotel well put this on uncle sam leiter said and settled the bill they left the bar and slipped out by a side door heading for the car park within half an hour they were at the airport the men gripped hands and leiter offered in a low voice yusuf was a great asset sure but more than that he was a friend you run across that sonofabitch in the blue jacket again and you have a shot james take it wednesday killing fields as the air emirates boeing taxied smoothly over the tarmac towards the gate in cape town james bond stretched then slipped his shoes back on he felt refreshed soon after takeoff in dubai hed administered to himself two jim beams with a little water the nightcap had done the trick famously and hed had nearly seven hours of blessedly uninterrupted sleep he was now reviewing texts from bill tanner contact capt jordaan crime combating investigation sa police service jordaan to meet you landside airport surveillance active on hydt a second followed mis gregory lamb reportedly still in eritrea opinion here all around avoid him if possible there was a final one happy to hear you and osbornesmith have kissed and made up whens the stag do bond had to smile the plane eased to a stop at the gate and the purser ran through the liturgy of landing with which bond was all too familiar cabin crew doors to manual and crosscheck ladies and gentlemen please take care when opening the overhead lockers the contents may have shifted during the flight bless you my child for fate has decided to bring you safely back to earth at least for a little longer bond pulled down his laptop bag hed checked in his suitcase which contained his weapon and proceeded to immigration in the busy hall he received a pro forma stamp in his passport then he went into the customs hall to a stocky unsmiling officer he displayed the firearms permit so he could collect his suitcase the man stared at him intently bond tensed and wondered if there was going to be a problem okay okay the man said his broad glistening face inflated with the power of small officialdom now you will tell me the truth the truth bond asked calmly yes how do you get close enough to a kudu or springbok to use a handgun when you hunt thats the challenge bond replied i must say it would be then bond frowned but i never hunt springbok no it makes the best biltong perhaps so but shooting a springbok would be very bad luck for england on the rugby pitch the customs agent laughed hard shook bonds hand and nodded him to the exit the arrivals hall was packed most people were in western clothing though some wore traditional african garb mens dashikis and brocade sets and for the women kentekaftans and head wraps all brightly coloured muslim robes and scarves were present as well and a few saris as bond made his way through the passenger meeting point he detected several distinct languages and many more dialects he had always been fascinated by the clicking in african languages in some words the mouth and tongue create that very sound for consonants khoisan spoken by the original inhabitants of this part of africa made the most use of it although zulus and xhosas also clicked bond had tried and found the sound impossible to replicate when his contact captain jordaan did not immediately appear he went into a café dropped on to a stool at the counter and ordered a double espresso he drank it down paid and stepped outside eyeing a beautiful businesswoman she was in her midthirties he guessed with exotically high cheekbones her thick wavy black hair contained a few strands of premature grey which added to her sensuality her darkred suit over a black shirt was cut close and revealed a figure that was full yet tautly athletic i believe i shall enjoy south africa he thought and smiled as he let her pass in front of him on her way to the exit like most attractive women in transitory worlds like airports she ignored him he stood for several moments in the centre of arrivals then decided that perhaps jordaan was waiting for him to approach he texted tanner to ask for a photograph but just after he hit send he spotted the police officer a large bearded redhead in a lightbrown suit a bear of a man glanced at bond once with a hint of reaction but he turned away rather quickly and went to a kiosk to buy cigarettes tradecraft is all about subtext cover identities masking who you really are dull conversations filled with code words to convey shocking facts innocent objects used for concealment or as weapons jordaans sudden diversion to buy cigarettes was a message he hadnt approached bond because hostiles were present glancing behind him he saw no immediate sign of a threat instinctively he followed prescribed procedure when an agent waves you off you circle casually out of the immediate area as inconspicuously as possible and contact a thirdparty intermediary who coordinates a new rendezvous in a safer location bill tanner would be the cutout bond started to move towards an exit too late as he saw jordaan slipping into the gents pocketing cigarettes he would probably never smoke he heard an ominous voice close to his ear do not turn around the english was coated with a smooth layer of a native accent he sensed that the man was lean and tall from the corner of his eye bond was aware of at least one partner shorter but stockier this man moved in quickly and relieved him of his laptop bag and the suitcase containing his useless walther the first assailant said walk straight out of the hall now there was nothing for it but to comply he turned and went where the man had told him down a deserted corridor bond assessed the situation from the echo of the footsteps bond knew the tall mans partner was far enough away that his initial move could only neutralise one of them instantly the shorter man would have to shed bonds suitcase and laptop bag which would give bond a few seconds to get to him but he would still have a chance to draw his weapon the man could be taken down but not before shots were fired no bond reflected too many innocents it was best to wait until they were outside through the door on your left i said you are not to look back they walked out into stark sunlight here it was autumn the temperature crisp the sky a stunning azure as they approached the kerb in a deserted construction site a battered black range rover sped forward and squealed to a stop more hostiles but no one as yet was getting out of the vehicle purpose response their purpose was to kidnap him his response would be textbook protocol in an attempted rendition disorient and then attack casually working his rolex over his fingers to act as a knuckleduster he turned abruptly to confront the pair with a disdainful smile they were young deadly serious men their skin contrasting sharply with the brilliant white of their starched shirts they wore suits one brown the other navy and narrow dark ties they were probably armed but overconfidence perhaps had led them to keep their weapons holstered as the range rover door swung open behind him bond stepped aside so that he couldnt be attacked from behind and judged angles he decided to break the jaw of the tallest first and use his body as a shield as he pushed forward towards the shorter man he looked calmly into the mans eyes and laughed i think ill report you to the tourist bureau ive heard a lot about the friendliness of south africans i was expecting rather more in the way of hospitality just before he lunged he heard from behind him inside the vehicle a womans flinty voice and we would have offered some if you hadnt made yourself so obvious a target by enjoying a leisurely coffee in plain view with a hostile loose in the airport bond relaxed his fist and turned he looked into the vehicle and tried unsuccessfully to mask his surprise the beautiful woman hed seen just moments ago in arrivals was sitting in the back seat im captain bheka jordaan saps crime combating and investigation division ah bond looked at her full lips untouched by cosmetics and her dark eyes she wasnt smiling his mobile buzzed the screen showed he had a message from bill tanner along with of course an mms picture of the woman in front of him the tall abductor said commander bond i am saps warrant officer kwalene nkosi he reached out his hand and their palms met in the traditional south african way an initial grip as in the west followed by a vertical clasp and back to the original bond knew it was considered impolite to let go too quickly apparently he timed the gesture right nkosi grinned warmly then nodded to the shorter man who was taking bonds suitcase and laptop bag to the rear of the range rover and that is sergeant mbalula the stocky man nodded unsmilingly and after stowing bonds belongings vanished fast presumably to his own vehicle you will please forgive our brusqueness commander nkosi said we thought it best to get you out of the airport as quickly as possible rather than spend the time to explain we should not waste more time on pleasantries warrant officer bheka jordaan muttered impatiently bond eased himself into the back beside her nkosi got into the passenger seat in the front a moment later sergeant mbalulas black saloon also unmarked pulled up behind them lets go jordaan barked quickly the range rover peeled away from the kerb and skidded brazenly into the traffic earning the driver a series of energetic hoots and lethargic curses and accelerated to more than ninety kph in a zone marked forty bond pulled his mobile off his belt he typed into the keyboard read the responses warrant officer jordaan asked nkosi anything he had been staring into the wing mirror and answered in what seemed to be zulu or xhosa bond did not speak either language but it was clear from the tone of the answer and the womans reaction that there was no tail when they were outside the airport grounds and making their way towards a cluster of low but impressive mountains in the distance the vehicle slowed somewhat jordaan thrust her hand forward bond reached out to shake it smiling then stopped she was holding a mobile phone if you dont mind she said sternly you will touch the screen here so much for warming international relations he took the phone pressed his thumb into the centre of the screen and handed it back she read the message that appeared james bond overseas development group foreign and commonwealth office now youll want to confirm my identity she held out her hand fingers splayed you have an app that can take my prints too i assume theres no need why she asked coolly because im what passes for a beautiful woman in your mind and you have no need to check further i could be an assassin i could be an alqaeda terrorist wearing a bomb vest he decided not to mention that his earlier perusal of her figure had revealed no evidence of explosives he answered perhaps a bit glibly i dont need your prints because in addition to the photo of you that my office just sent me my mobile read your iris a few minutes ago and confirmed to me that you are indeed captain bheka jordaan crime combating and investigation division south african police service youve worked for them for eight years you live in leeuwen street in cape town last year you received a gold cross for bravery congratulations he had also learnt her age thirtytwo her salary and that she was divorced warrant officer nkosi twisted round in his seat glanced at the mobile and said with a broad smile commander bond that is a nice toy without doubt jordaan snapped kwalene the young mans smile vanished he turned back to his wing mirror sentry duty she glanced with disdain at bonds phone we will go to my headquarters and consider how to approach the situation with severan hydt i worked with your lieutenant colonel tanner when he was with mi so i agreed to help you he is intelligent and very devoted to his job quite a gentleman too the implication being that bond himself probably was not he was irritated that shed taken such umbrage at what had been an innocent relativelyinnocent smile in the arrivals hall she was attractive and he couldnt have been the first man to lob a flirt her way is hydt in his office he asked thats correct nkosi said he and niall dunne are both in cape town sergeant mbalula and i followed them from the airport there was a woman with them too you have surveillance on them thats right the lean man said we based our cctv plan on londons so there are cameras everywhere downtown he is in his office and being monitored from a central location we can track him anywhere if he leaves we ourselves are not completely free of toys commander bond smiled at him then said to jordaan you mentioned a hostile at the airport we learnt from immigration that a man arrived from abu dhabi around the time you did he was travelling on a fake british passport we discovered this only after he cleared customs and disappeared the bearish man hed mistaken for jordaan or the man in the blue jacket at the shopping centre on dubai creek he described them i dont know jordaan offered curtly as i said our only information was documentary because he was unaccounted for i thought it best not to meet you in person in the arrivals hall i sent my officers instead she leant forward suddenly and asked nkosi anyone now no captain we are not being followed bond said to her you seem concerned about surveillance south africa is like russia she said the old regime has fallen and it is a whole new world here this draws people who wish to make money and involve themselves in politics and all manner of affairs sometimes legally sometimes not nkosi said we have a saying with many opportunities come many operatives we keep that always in mind at the saps and look over our shoulder often you would be wise to do the same commander bond without doubt the central police station in buitenkant street central cape town resembled a pleasant hotel more than a government building two storeys high with walls of scrubbed red brick and a redtiled roof it overlooked the wide clean avenue which was dotted with palms and jacaranda the driver paused at the front to let them out jordaan and nkosi stepped on to the pavement and looked around when they saw no signs of surveillance or threat the warrant officer gestured bond out he went to the back for his laptop bag and suitcase then followed the officers inside as they entered the building bond blinked in surprise at what he saw there was a plaque that read servamus et servimus the motto of the saps he assumed we protect and we serve what gave him pause though was that the two principal words were eerie and ironic echoes of severan hydts first name without waiting for the lift jordaan climbed the stairs to the first floor her modest office was lined with books and professional journals presentday maps of cape town and the western cape and a framed yearold map of the eastern coast of south africa showing the region of natal with the port of durban and the town of ladysmith mysteriously circled in ancient fading ink zululand and swaziland were depicted to the north there were framed photographs on jordaans desk a blond man and a darkskinned woman held hands in one they appeared in several others the woman bore a vague resemblance to jordaan and bond assumed they were her parents prominent also were pictures of an elderly woman in traditional african clothing and several featuring children bond decided that they werent jordaans there were no shots of her with a partner divorced he recalled her desktop was graced with fifty or so case folders the world of policing like espionage involves far more paperwork than firearms and gadgets despite the late autumn season in south africa the weather was temperate and her office warm after a moment of debate jordaan removed her red jacket and hung it up her black blouse was short sleeved and he saw a large swath of makeup along the inside of her right forearm she didnt seem like the tattoo sort but perhaps she was concealing one then he decided that no the cream covered a lengthy and wide scar gold cross for bravery bond sat across from her beside nkosi who unbuttoned his jacket and remained stiffly upright bond asked them both did colonel tanner tell you about my mission here just that you were investigating severan hydt on a matter of national security bond ran through what they knew of incident twenty aka gehenna and the impending deaths on friday nkosi frowned ridges into his high forehead jordaan took in the information with still eyes she pressed her hands together modest rings encircled the middle fingers of both hands i see and the evidence is credible it is does that surprise you she said evenly severan hydt is an unlikely evil we are aware of him of course he opened green way international here two years ago and has contracts for much of the refuse collection and recycling in the major cities in south africa pretoria durban port elizabeth joburg and of course throughout the west here hes done many good things for our nation ours is a country in transition as you know and our past has led to problems with the environment gold and diamond mining poverty and lack of infrastructure have taken their toll refuse collection was a serious problem in the townships and squatters settlements to make up for the displacement caused by the group areas act under apartheid the government built residences lokasies or locations they are called for the people to live in instead of shacks but even there the population was so high that refuse collection could not be performed efficiently or sometimes at all disease was a problem severan hydt has reversed much of that he also donates to aids and hungerrelief charities most serious criminal enterprises have publicrelations specialists on board bond reflected being an unlikely evil did not exempt you from diligent investigation jordaan seemed to note his scepticism she continued im simply saying that he does not much fit the profile of a terrorist or master criminal but if he is my department stands ready to do all it can to help thank you now do you know anything about his associate niall dunne she said i had never heard the name until this morning ive looked into him he comes and goes here on a legitimate british passport and has been doing so for several years weve never had any problem with him hes not on any watchlists what do you know of the woman with them nkosi consulted a file american passport jessica barnes shes a cipher to us id say no police record no criminal activity nothing we have some photos thats not her bond said looking at the images of a young truly beautiful blonde ah i am sorry i should have said these are old shots i got them off the internet nkosi turned the picture over this was from the s she was miss massachusetts and competed in the miss america contest she is now sixtyfour years old bond could see the resemblance now that he knew the truth then he asked where is the green way office there are two nkosi said one nearby and one about twenty miles north of here hydts major refuse disposal and recycling plant i need to get inside them find out what hes up to of course bheka jordaan said there came a lengthy pause but you are speaking of legal means correct legal means you can follow him on the street you can observe him in public but i cannot get a warrant for you to place a bug in his home or office as i said severan hydt has done nothing wrong here bond nearly smiled in my job i dont generally ask for warrants well i do of course captain this man has twice tried to kill me in serbia and the uk and yesterday he engineered the death of a young woman and possibly a cia asset in dubai she frowned sympathy evident in her face thats very unfortunate but those crimes did not happen on south african soil if im presented with extradition orders from those jurisdictions approved by a magistrate here i will be happy to execute them but barring that she lifted her palms we dont want him arrested bond said with exasperation we dont want evidence for trial the point of my coming here is to find out what he has planned for friday and stop it i intend to do that and you may provided you do so legally if youre thinking of breaking into his home or office that would be trespass subjecting youto a criminal complaint she turned her eyes like black granite towards him and bond had absolutely no doubt that she would enjoy ratcheting the shackles on to his wrists he has to die sitting in his office at the green way international building in the centre of cape town severan hydt was holding his phone tightly as he listened to niall dunnes chilly words no he reflected that wasnt accurate there was neither chill nor heat his comment had been completely neutral which was chilling in its own way explain hydt said absently tracing a triangle on the desktop with a long yellowing fingernail dunne told him that a green way worker had very likely learnt something about gehenna he was one of the legitimate workers in the cape town disposal plant to the north of the city who had known nothing of hydts clandestine activities hed accidentally got into a restricted area in the main building and might have seen some emails about the project he wouldnt know what they meant at this point but when the incident makes the news later in the week which its going to of course he might realise we were behind it and tell the police so what do you suggest im looking into it now but if you kill him wont the police ask questions since hes an employee ill take care of him where he lives a squatters camp there wont be many police probably none at all the taxisll look into it most likely and they wont cause us any problems in the townships squatters settlements and even the new lokasies the minibus companies were more than just transport providers they had taken on the role of vigilante judge and jury hearing cases and tracking down and punishing criminals all right lets move fast though tonight after he gets home dunne disconnected and hydt returned to his work hed spent all morning since their arrival making arrangements for the manufacture of mahdi alfulans new harddrive destruction machines and for green ways sales people to start hawking them to clients but his mind wandered and he kept imagining the body of the young woman stella now in a grave somewhere beneath the restless sands of the empty quarter south of dubai while her beauty in life hadnt aroused him the picture in his minds eye of her in a few months or years certainly did and in a thousand shed be just like the bodies hed viewed at the museum last night he rose slipped his suit jacket on to a hanger and returned to his desk he took and placed a string of phone calls all relating to green ways legitimate business none was particularly engaging until the companys head of sales for south africa who was on the floor just below hydts called severan ive got some afrikaner from durban on the line he wants to talk to you about a disposal project send him a brochure and tell him ill be tied up till next week gehenna was the priority and hydt had no interest in taking on new accounts at the moment he doesnt want to hire us hes talking about some arrangement between green way and his company joint venture hydt asked cynically entrepreneurs always emerged when you started to enjoy success and got publicity in your chosen field too much going on now im not interested thank him though all right oh but i was supposed to mention one thing something odd he said to tell you that the problem hes got is the same as at isandlwana in the s hydt looked away from the documents on his desk a moment later he realised he was gripping the phone hard youre sure thats what he said yes the same as at isandlwana no idea what he meant hes in durban his companys headquarters are there hes at his cape town office for the day see if hes free to come in when the sales manager asked a fractional pause then hydt said now in january the war between great britain and the zulu kingdom kicked off in earnest with a stunning defeat for the british at isandlwana overwhelming forces twenty thousand zulus versus fewer than two thousand british and colonial troops and some bad tactical decisions resulted in a complete rout it was there that the zulus broke the british square the famous defensive formation in which one line of soldiers fired while another directly behind reloaded offering the enemy a nearly unremitting volley of bullets in that instance with the deadly martinihenry breechloading rifles but the tactic hadnt worked thirteen hundred british soldiers and allied forces died the disposal problem that the afrikaner had referred to could mean only one thing the battle had occurred in january the fiercely hot dog days of summer in the region of what was now kwazulunatal removing the bodies quickly was a necessity and a major logistical issue the disposal of remains was also one of the major problems that gehenna would present in future projects and hydt and dunne had been discussing it over the past month why on earth would a businessman from durban have a problem along these lines that required hydts assistance ten lengthy minutes later his secretary stepped into his doorway a mr theron is here sir from durban good good show him in please she vanished and returned a moment later with a toughlooking edgy man who glanced around hydts office cautiously yet with an air of challenge he was dressed in the business outfit common to south africa a suit and smart shirt but no tie whatever his line he must have been successful a heavy gold bracelet encircled his right wrist and his watch was a flashy breitling a gold initial ring too which was a touch brash hydt thought morning the man shook hydts hand he noticed the long yellowing fingernails but did not recoil as had happened on more than one occasion gene theron he said severan hydt they exchanged business cards eugene j theron president ejt services ltd durban cape town and kinshasa hydt reflected an office in the capital of congo one of the most dangerous cities in africa this was interesting the man glanced at the door which was open hydt rose and closed it returned to his desk youre from durban mr theron yes and my main office is there but i travel a lot and you the faint accent was melodious london holland and here i get to the far east and india too wherever business takes me now theron the names huguenot isnt it yes we forget afrikaners are not always dutch theron lifted an eyebrow as if hed heard such comments since he was a child and was tired of them hydts phone trilled he looked at the screen it was niall dunne excuse me a moment he said to theron who nodded then yes hydt asked pressing the phone close to his ear therons legit south african passport lives in durban and has a security company with headquarters there with branches here and in kinshasa fathers afrikaner mothers british grew up mostly in kenya dunne continued hes been suspected of supplying troops and arms to conflict regions in africa south east asia and pakistan no active investigations the cambodians detained him in a human trafficking and mercenary investigation because of what hed been up to in shan myanmar but let him go nothing in interpol and hes pretty successful from what i can tell hydt had deduced that himself the mans breitling was worth around five thousand pounds i just texted a picture to you dunne added it appeared on hydts screen and showed the man in front of him dunne went on but whatever hes proposing are you sure you want to think about it now hydt thought he sounded jealous perhaps that the mercenary might have a project that would deflect attention from dunnes plans for gehenna he said those sales figures are better than i thought thank you he disconnected then he asked theron how did you hear about me although they were alone theron lowered his voice as he turned hard knowing eyes on hydt cambodia i was doing some work there some people told me of you ah hydt understood now and the realisation gave him a thrill last year on business in the far east hed stopped to visit several gravesites of the infamous killing fields where the khmer rouge had slaughtered millions of cambodians in the s at the memorial at choeung ek where nearly nine thousand bodies had been buried in mass graves hydt had spoken to several veterans about the slaughter and taken hundreds of pictures for his collection one of the locals must have mentioned his name to theron you had business there you say hydt asked thinking of what dunne had learnt nearby theron replied with a suitable brush of evasion hydt was intensely curious but a businessman first and foremost he tried not to appear too enthusiastic and what do isandlwana and cambodia have to do with me they are places where there was a great loss of life many bodies were interred where they fell in battle choeung ek was genocide not a battle but hydt did not correct him theyve become sacred areas and thats good i suppose except the afrikaner paused ill tell you about a problem i have become aware of and about a solution that has occurred to me then you can tell me if that solution is possible and if you have an interest in helping me achieve it go on theron said i have many connections to governments and companies in various parts of africa he paused darfur congo central african republic mozambique zimbabwe a few others conflict regions hydt observed and these groups are concerned about the consequences that arise after say a terrible natural disaster like drought or famine or storms or frankly anywhere that a major loss of life has occurred and bodies have been buried as in cambodia or isandlwana hydt said innocently such cases have serious health implications water supply contamination disease no theron said bluntly i mean something else superstition superstition say for instance because of a lack of money or resources bodies have been left in mass graves a shame but it happens indeed it does now if a government or a charity wishes to build something for the good of the people a hospital a housing development or a road in that area they would be reluctant to do so the land is perfectly good there is money to build and workers who wish to be employed but many people would fear ghosts or spirits and be afraid to go to that hospital or move into those houses its absurd to me and to you too im sure but thats how many people feel theron shrugged how sad for the citizens of those areas if their health and safety were to suffer because of such foolish ideas hydt was riveted he was tapping his nails on the desk he forced himself to stop so here is my idea i am thinking of offering a service to well those government agencies to remove the human remains his face brightened this will allow more building of factories hospitals roads farms schools and it will help the poor the unfortunate yes hydt said rebury the bodies somewhere else theron laid his hands on the desk the gold initial ring glittered in a shaft of sunlight thats one possibility but it would be very expensive and the problem might arise later at the new location true but are there other alternatives hydt asked your speciality which is in a whisper theron said perhaps recycling hydt saw the scenario clearly gene theron a mercenary and obviously a very successful one had supplied troops and weapons to various armies and warlords throughout africa men whod secretly massacred hundreds or thousands of people and hidden the bodies in mass graves now they were growing worried that legitimate governments peacekeeping forces the press or humanrights groups would discover the corpses theron had made money by providing the means of destruction now he wanted to make money by removing the evidence of their use it seemed to me an interesting solution theron continued but i wouldnt know how to go about it your interests in cambodia and your recycling business here told me that perhaps this is something you had thought of too or would be willing to consider his cold eyes regarded hydt i was thinking maybe concrete or plaster or fertiliser turning the bodies into products that ensured they couldnt be recognised as human remains hydt could hardly contain himself utterly brilliant why there must be hundreds of opportunities like this throughout the world somalia the former yugoslavia latin america and there were killing fields aplenty in africa thousands his chest pounded so thats my idea a fiftyfifty partnership i provide the refuse and you recycle it theron seemed to find this rather amusing i think we may be able to do business hydt offered his hand to the afrikaner the worst risk of james bond assuming the noc nonofficial cover of gene theron was that niall dunne had perhaps got a look at him in serbia or the fens or had been given his description in dubai if the bluejacketed man whod been tailing him was in fact working for hydt in which case when bond walked brazenly into the green way office in cape town and sought to hire hydt to dispose of bodies hidden in secret graves throughout africa dunne would either kill him on the spot or spirit him to their own personal killing field where the job would be done with cold efficiency but now having shaken hands with an intrigued severan hydt bond believed his cover was holding so far hydt had been suspicious at first of course but he had been willing to give theron the benefit of the doubt why because bond had tempted him with a dangle a lure he couldnt resist death and decay that morning at saps headquarters bond had contacted philly maidenstone and osbornesmith his new ally and they had datamined hydts and green ways credit cards theyd learnt that hed not only travelled to the killing fields in cambodia but to krakow poland where hed taken several tours of auschwitz among his purchases at the time were doublea batteries and a second flash chip for a camera mans got a whole new idea about porn bond decided that to work his way into hydts life he would offer a chance to satisfy that lust access to secret killing fields throughout africa and a proposal to recycle human remains for the past three hours bond had struggled under the tutelage of bheka jordaan to become an afrikaner mercenary from durban gene theron would have a slightly unusual background hed had huguenot rather than dutch forebears and his parents favoured english and french in the household of his youth which explained why he didnt speak much afrikaans a british education in kenya would cover his accent she had however made bond learn something of the dialect if leonardo dicaprio and matt damon had mastered the subtle intonation for recent films and they were american for heavens sake he could do so too while shed coached him on facts that a south african mercenary might know sergeant mbalula had gone to the evidence locker and found an incarcerated drug dealers gaudy breitling watch to replace bonds tasteful rolex and gold bracelet for the successful mercenary to wear hed then sped to a jeweller in the gardens shopping centre in mill street where hed bought a gold signet ring and had it engraved with the initials ejt meanwhile warrant officer kwalene nkosi had worked feverishly with the odgs i branch in london to create the fictional gene theron uploading to the internet biographical information about the hardboiled mercenary with photoshopped pictures and details about his fictional company a series of lectures on cover identities at fort monckton could be summarised in the instructors introductory sentence if you dont have a web presence youre not real nkosi had also printed business cards for ejt services ltd and mi in pretoria pulled in some favours to get the company registered in record time the documents backdated jordaan was not happy about this it was to her a breach of the sacred rule of law but since she and saps were not involved she let it go i branch also created a fake criminal investigation in cambodia about therons questionable behaviour in myanmar which mentioned shady activities in other countries too the fauxafrikaner was over the first hurdle the second and most dangerous was close hydt was on the phone summoning niall dunne to meet a businessman from durban after hed hung up hydt said casually one question would you happen to have pictures of the fields the graves that can be arranged bond said good hydt smiled like a schoolboy he rubbed the back of his hand on his beard bond heard the door behind him open ah here is my associate niall dunne niall this is gene theron from durban now for it was he about to be shot bond rose turned and went up to the irishman looking straight into his eyes and offering the stiff smile of one businessman meeting another for the first time as they shook hands dunne stared at him a knife slash from the chill blue eyes there was however no suspicion in the gaze bond was confident he had not been recognised closing the door behind him the irishman shot a quizzical glance at his boss who handed him the ejt services business card the men sat down mr theron has a proposition hydt said enthusiastically he ran through the plan in general terms bond could see that dunne too was intrigued yes he said this could be good some logistics to consider of course hydt continued mr therons going to arrange for us to see pictures of the locations give us a better idea of what would be involved dunne shot him a troubled glance the irishman wasnt suspicious but seemed put off by this he reminded hydt we have to be at the plant by fifteen thirty that meeting he turned his eyes on bond again your office is just round the corner hed memorised the address at a glance bond noted why dont you get them now those pictures well i suppose i could bond said stalling dunne eyed him levelly good as he opened the door for bond his jacket swung open revealing the beretta pistol on his belt probably the one hed used to murder the men in serbia was it a message a warning bond pretended not to see it he nodded to both men ill be back in thirty minutes but gene theron had been gone only five when dunne said lets go where to hydt frowned to therons office now hydt noted that the gangly man had one of thoseexpressions on his face challenging petulant that bizarre jealousy again what went on in dunnes soul why dont you trust him its not a bad idea mind dunne said offhandedly weve been talking about disposal of the bodies but it doesnt matter for friday it just seems a bit dodgy to me that he shows up out of the blue makes me nervous as if such an emotion would ever register with the icy sapper hydt relented he needed somebody to keep his feet on the ground and it was true that hed been seduced by therons proposition youre right of course they picked up their jackets and left the office dunne directed them up the street to the address printed on the mans business card the irishman was right but severan hydt prayed that theron was legitimate the bodies the acres of bones he wanted to see them so badly to breathe in the air surrounding them and he wanted the pictures too they came to the office building where therons cape town branch was located it was typical of the citys business district functional metal and stone this particular structure seemed half deserted there was no guard in the lobby which was curious the men took the lift to the fourth floor and found the office door number theres no company name hydt observed just the number thats odd this doesnt look right dunne said he listened i dont hear anything try it he did so locked hydt was fiercely disappointed wondering if hed given anything away to theron anything incriminating he didnt think so dunne said we should get some of our security people together when theron comes back if he does well take him down to the basement ill find out what hes about they were about to leave when hydt desperate to believe theron was legitimate said knock see if anybodys in there dunne hesitated then drew aside his jacket exposing the berettas grip the mans large knuckles rapped on the wooden door nothing they turned to the lift just then the door swung open gene theron blinked in surprise hydt dunne what are you doing here the afrikaner hesitated for a moment then bluntly gestured the two men inside they entered there had been no sign outside but here on the wall was a modest plaque ejt services ltd durban cape town kinshasa the office was small and staffed with only three employees their desks covered with files and the paperwork that is the mainstay of such entrepreneurial dens throughout the world however noble or dark their products or services dunne said we thought wed save you the trouble did you now theron responded hydt knew that the mercenary understood that they had made their surprise visit because they didnt trust him completely on the other hand theron was in a line of work where trust was as dangerous as unstable explosives so his displeasure was minimal after all theron must have done much the same checking out hydts credentials with the cambodians and elsewhere before coming to him with his proposal that was how business worked scuffed walls and windows offering a bleak view of a courtyard reminded hydt that even illegal activity such as theron plied was not necessarily as lucrative as the movies and news portrayed it the biggest office at the back was therons but even that was modest one employee a tall young african was scrolling through an online catalogue of automatic weapons some were flagged with bold stars indicating a per cent discount another employee was typing urgently on a computer keyboard using only his index fingers both men were in white shirts and narrow ties a secretary sat at a desk outside therons office hydt saw she was attractive but she was young and therefore of no interest to him theron glanced at her my secretary was just printing out some of the files we were talking about a moment later pictures of mass graves began easing from the colour printer yes these are good hydt thought staring down at them very good indeed the first images had been taken not long after the killings men women and children had been gunned down or hacked to death some had suffered earlier amputations hands or arms above the elbow a popular technique used by warlords and dictators in africa to punish and control the people about forty or so lay in a ditch the setting was subsaharan but it was impossible to say exactly where sierra leone liberia ivory coast central african republic there were so many possibilities on this troubled continent other pictures followed showing different stages of decay hydt lingered on those particularly lra dunne asked looking them over clinically it was the tall skinny employee who answered mr theron does not work with the lords resistance army the rebel group operating out of uganda the central african republic and parts of congo and sudan had as its philosophy if you could call it that religious and mystical extremism a violent christian militia of sorts it had committed untallied atrocities and was known among other things for employing child soldiers theres plenty of other work theron said hydt was amused by his sense of morality another halfdozen pictures rolled from the printer the last few showed a large field from which protruded bones and partial bodies with desiccated skin hydt showed the pictures to dunne what do you think he turned to theron niall is an engineer the irishman studied them for a few minutes the graves look shallow its easy to get the bodies out the trick is to cover up the fact that they were there in the first place depending on how long theyve been in the ground once we remove them thered be measurable differences in the soil temperature that lasts for many months its detectable with the right equipment months theron asked frowning i had no idea he glanced at dunne then said to hydt hes good i call him the man who thinks of everything dunne said thoughtfully fastgrowing vegetation could work and there are some sprays that will eliminate dna residue too theres a lot to consider but nothing seems impossible the technical issues fell away and hydt focused again on the images may i keep these of course do you want digital copies too theyd be sharper hydt gave him a smile thank you theron put them on a flash drive and handed it to hydt who looked at his watch id like to discuss this further are you free later i can be but dunne was frowning youre at the meeting this afternoon and theres the fundraiser tonight hydt scowled one of the charities i donate to is having an event i have to be present but if youre free why dont you meet me there do i have to give money theron asked hydt couldnt tell if he was joking not necessarily youll have to listen to a few speeches and drink some wine all right where is it hydt looked at dunne who said at the lodge club nineteen hundred hours hydt added you should wear a jacket but dont bother with a tie see you then theron shook their hands they left his offices and made their way outside hes legitimate hydt said half to himself they were en route to the green way office when dunne took a phone call after a few minutes he rang off and said that was about stephan dlamini who the worker we need to eliminate in the maintenance department hes the one who mightve seen the emails about friday oh right our people found his shanty in primrose gardens east of town how are you going to handle it it seems that his teenage daughter complained about a local drug dealer he threatened to kill her well set it up to make it seem that hes behind dlaminis death hes firebombed people before so dlamini has a family a wife and five children dunne explained well have to kill them too he could have told his wife what he saw and if hes in a shanty town the family will live in only one or two rooms so anybody could have heard well use grenades before the firebomb i think suppertime is best everybody will be in one room together dunne shot a glance toward the tall man theyll die fast hydt replied i wasnt worried about them suffering i wasnt either i just meant that itll be a pretty easy way to kill them all quickly convenient you know after the men had left warrant officer kwalene nkosi rose from the desk where hed been scrolling through price lists for automatic weapons and nodded at the screen it is truly amazing what you can buy online isnt it commander bond i suppose so if we buy nine machine guns we can get one for free he joked to sergeant mbalula the relentless twofinger typist thanks for that fast thinking about the lra warrant officer bond said he hadnt recognised the abbreviation for the lords resistance army a group that any mercenary in africa would have been familiar with the operation might have ended there and then in disaster bonds secretary bheka jordaan peered out of the window theyre heading away i dont see any other security people we fooled them i think said sergeant mbalula the trick indeed seemed to have been successful bond had been convinced that one of the men the quickminded dunne most likely would want to see his branch in cape town he believed that a good solid set a cover location would be critical in seducing hydt into believing he was an afrikaner troubleshooter with a great many bodies to dispose of while bond had telephoned hydt to talk his way into green way jordaan had found a small government office leased by the ministry of culture but presently unused nkosi had printed some business cards with the address and before bond had gone to meet hydt and dunne the saps officers had moved in youll be my partner bond had told jordaan with a smile itll be a good cover for me to have a clever and attractive associate she had bristled to be credible an office like this needs a secretary and she must be a woman if you like i dont she had said stiffly but thats how it must be bond had anticipated the mens visit but not that hydt would want to see pictures of the killing fields though he supposed he should have the minute hed left hydts office hed called jordaan and told her to find photos of mass graves in africa from military and law enforcement archives sadly it had been all too easy and shed downloaded a dozen by the time hed returned from hydts office can you keep some people here for a day or two bond asked in case dunne comes back i can spare one officer she said sergeant mbalula you will stay for the time being yes captain ill brief a patrolman on the situation and he will replace you she turned back to bond do you think dunne will return no but its possible hydts the boss but he gets distracted dunne is more focused and suspicious to my mind that makes him more dangerous commander nkosi opened a battered briefcase this came for you at headquarters he produced a thick envelope bond ripped it open inside he found ten thousand rand in used banknotes a fake south african passport credit cards and a debit card all in the name of eugene j theron i branch had worked its magic once more there was also a note reservation for open stay at table mountain hotel waterfront room bond pocketed everything now the lodge club where im meeting hydt tonight whats it like too expensive for me nkosi said its a restaurant and venue for events jordaan told him ive never been either it used to be a private hunting club white men only then after the elections in ninetyfour when the anc came to power the owners chose to dissolve the club and sell the building rather than open up membership the board wasnt concerned about admitting black or coloured men but they didnt want women im sure you have no clubs like that at home james do you he didnt admit that there were indeed such establishments in the uk at my favourite club in london youll see pure democracy at work anyone at all is free to join and lose money at the gaming tables just like i do with some frequency i might add nkosi laughed if youre ever in london id be delighted to show it to you he added to jordaan she seemed to view this as yet more shameless flirting because she icily ignored the comment i will drive you to your hotel the tall police officers face wore a serious look i think i shall quit the saps and see if you can get me a job in england commander to work for the odg or mi you had to be a british citizen and the child of at least one citizen or someone with substantial ties to the uk there was also a residency requirement after my great undercover work nkosis arm swept around the room i now know i am quite the actor i will come to london and work in the west end thats where the famous theatres are correct well yes though bond had not been to one voluntarily in years the young man said im sure i will be quite successful im partial to shakespeare david mamet is quite good too without doubt bond supposed that working for a boss like bheka jordaan nkosi did not get much of a chance to exercise his sense of humour the hotel was near table bay in the fashionable green point area of cape town it was an older building six storeys in classic cape style and could not quite disguise its colonial roots though it didnt try very hard you could see them clearly in the meticulous landscaping presently being tended by a number of diligent workers the delicate but firm reminder on placards about the diningroom dress code the spotless white uniforms of the demure everpresent staff the rattan furniture on the sweeping veranda overlooking the bay another clue was the enquiry as to whether mr theron would like a personal butler for his stay he politely declined the table mountain hotel referred to everywhere as tm in scrolling letters from the marble floor to embossed napkins was just the place where a wellheeled afrikaner businessman from durban would stay whether a legitimate computer salesman or a mercenary with ten thousand bodies to hide after checking in bond started towards the lift but something outside caught his eye he popped into the gift shop for shaving foam he didnt need then he circled back to reception to help himself to some complimentary fruit juice from a large glass tank surrounded by an arrangement of purple jacaranda and red and white roses he wasnt certain but someone might have been conducting surveillance when hed turned abruptly to get the juice a shadow had vanished equally abruptly with many opportunities come many operatives bond waited for a moment but the apparition didnt reappear of course operational life sows the seeds of paranoia and sometimes a passerby is just a passerby a curious gaze signifies nothing more than a curious mind besides you cant protect yourself from every risk in this business if somebody wants you dead badly enough theyll get their wish mentally bond shrugged off the tail and took the lift to the first floor where the rooms were accessed from an open balcony that overlooked the lobby he stepped inside closed and chained the door he tossed the suitcase on to one of the beds strode to the window and closed the curtains he slipped everything that identified him as james bond into a large carbonfibre envelope with an electronic lock on the flap and sealed it with his shoulder he tipped a chest of drawers and pushed the pouch underneath it might be found and stolen of course but any attempt to open it without his thumbprint on the lock would send an encrypted message to the odgs c branch and bill tanner would send a crash divetext to alert him that his cover had been compromised he rang room service and ordered a club sandwich and a gilroys dark ale then he showered by the time hed dressed in a pair of battleship grey trousers and a black polo shirt the food was at the door he ran a comb through his damp hair checked the peephole and let the waiter in the tray was placed on the small table the bill signed as e j theron in bonds own handwriting that was one thing you never tried to fake however deep your cover the waiter pocketed his tip with overt gratitude when bond stepped back to the door to see the young man out and refix the chain he automatically scanned the balcony and the lobby below he squinted gazing down then shut the door fast damn glancing with regret at the sandwich and even more regretfully at the beer he stepped into his shoes and flung open his suitcase he screwed the gemtech silencer on to the muzzle of his walther and although hed done so recently at saps headquarters eased the slide of the pistol back a few millimetres to verify that a round was in the chamber the gun went into the folds of todays edition of the cape times which bond then set on the tray between his sandwich and the beer he lifted it onehanded over his shoulder and left the room the tray obscuring his face he was not dressed in a waiters uniform but he moved briskly head down and might have been mistaken by a casual observer for a harried member of staff at the end of the corridor he went through the fire doors of the stairwell put the tray down and picked up the newspaper with its deadly contents then he descended a flight of stairs quietly to the ground floor looking out through a porthole in the swing door he spotted his target sitting in an armchair in the shadows of a far corner of the lobby nearly invisible facing away from bond he was scanning from his newspaper to the lobby to the firstfloor balcony apparently he had missed bonds escape bond gauged distances and angles the location and number of guests staff and security guards he waited while a porter wheeled a cart of suitcases past a waiter carried a tray bearing a silver coffee pot to another guest at the far end of the lobby and a cluster of japanese tourists moved en masse out of the door taking with them his targets attention bond thought clinically now he pushed out of the stairwell and walked fast towards the back of an armchair over which the crown of his targets head could just be seen he circled around it and dropped into the chair just opposite smiling as if hed run into an old friend he kept his finger off the trigger of the walther which corporal menzies had finetuned to a featherlight pull the freckled ruddy face glanced up the mans eyes flashed wide in surprise that hed been duped in recognition too the look said no it wasnt a coincidence he hadbeen conducting surveillance on bond he was the man bond had seen at the airport that morning whom hed originally taken for captain jordaan fancy seeing you here bond said cheerfully to allay the suspicions of anybody witnessing the rendezvous he lifted the curled newspaper so that the muzzle of the silencer was focused on the bulky chest but curiously the surprise in the milky green eyes was replaced not by fear or desperation but amusement ah mr theron is it is that who we are at the moment the accent was mancunian his pudgy hands swung up palms out bond cocked his head to one side these rounds are nearly subsonic with this suppressor youll be dead and ill be gone long before anybody notices oh but you dont want to kill me that would go down rather badly bond had heard plenty of monologues at moments like this when hed got the draw on an opponent usually the bons motswere to buy time or for distraction as the target prepared himself for a desperate assault bond knew to ignore what the man was saying and watch his hands and body language still he could hardly dismiss the next lines issuing from the flabby lips after all what would m say if he heard youd gunned down one of the crowns star agents and in sucha beautiful setting his name was gregory lamb confirmed by the iris and fingerprint scan app mis man on the ground in cape town the agent bill tanner had told him to avoid they were in bonds room sansbeer and sandwich to his consternation the tray containing his lunch had been whisked out of the stairwell by an efficient hotel employee by the time he and lamb had returned to the first floor you couldve got yourself killed bond muttered i wasnt in any real danger your outfit doesnt give out those double noughts to triggerhappy fools now now my friend dont get all ruffled some of us know what your overseas development outfit reallydoes how did you know i was in town put it together didnt i heard about some goingson and got in touch with friends at lambeth one of the disadvantages in having to use six or di for intelligence was that more people knew about your affairs than you might prefer why didnt you just contact me through secure channels bond snapped i was going to but just as i got here i saw somebody playing shadow now bond paid attention male slim blue jacket gold earring well now didnt see the earring did i eyes arent what they used to be but youve got the general kit right hovered about for a while then vanished like the tablecloth when the sun comes out you know what i mean the fog on table mountain bond was in no mood for travelogues dammit the man who killed yusuf nasad and who had nearly done the same to felix leiter had learned he was here he was probably the man jordaan had told him about the one whod slipped into the country that morning from abu dhabi on a fake british passport who the hell was he did you get a picture bond asked drat no the man was fast as a waterbug spot anything else about him type of mobile possible weapons vehicle none gone waterbug a shrug of the broad shoulders which bond supposed were as freckled and red as the face bond said you were at the airport when i landed why did you turn away i saw captain jordaan she never took to me for some reason maybe she thinks im the great white hunter colonist here to steal back her country she gave me a bloody tongue lashing a few months ago didnt she my chief of staff said you were in eritrea bond said i was indeed there and across the border in sudan for the past week looks like their heartsre set on war so i tooled on up to make sure my covers would survive the gunplay i got that sorted and heard about an odg operation his eyes dimmed surprised nobody gave me a bell about it the thinking was that you were involved in a rather serious op delicate bond said judiciously ah lamb seemed to believe this well anyway i thought id better race here to help out you see the capes tricky it looks neat and clean and touristy but theres a lot more to it i hate to blow my own trumpet my friend but you need somebody like me to weasel under the surface tell you whats really going on im connected you know any other six agent whos finagled localgovernmentdevelopmentfund money to finance his covers i made the crown a tidy profit last year all went to treasury coffers did it lamb shrugged ive got a role to play havent i to the world im a successful businessman if you dont live your cover for all its worth well a bit of sand gets into the works and the next thing you know theres a big pearl yelling im a spy say you mind if we hit that minibar of yours bond waved at it go ahead lamb helped himself to a miniature of bombay sapphire gin then another he poured them into a glass no ice pity well never mind he sloshed in a bit of tonic what isyour cover mostly i arrange cargo ship charters brilliant idea if i say so myself gives me a chance to hobnob with the bad boys on the docks i also do a spot of gold and aluminium exploration and road and infrastructure construction and you still have time to spy good one my friend for some reason lamb started telling bond his life story he was a british citizen as was his mother and his father was south african hed come down here with his parents and decided he liked it better than life in manchester after training at fort monckton hed asked to be sent back station z was the only one hed ever worked for and the only one hed ever cared to he spent most of his time in the western cape but travelled frequently around africa attending to his noc operations when he noticed bond was not listening he swigged at his drink and said so what exactly are you working on something about this severan hydt now theres a name to conjure with and incident twenty love it sounds rather like something from di fiftyfive you know the characters looking into ufos over the midlands exasperated bond said i was attached to defence intelligence division fiftyfive was about missiles or planes breaching british airspace not ufos ah yes yes im sure it was of course that wouldbe the line theyd give the public wouldnt it bond was close to throwing him out still it might just be worth picking his brain you heard about incident twenty then any thoughts on how it could relate to south africa i did get the signals lamb conceded but i didnt pay much attention since the intercept said the attack was going to be on british soil bond reminded him of the exact wording which gave no location but said merely that british interests would be adversely affected could be anywhere then i didnt think of that or you didnt read it very carefully and now the cyclone has touched down on my pitch odd how fate can strike isnt it the app on bonds mobile that had verified lambs identity had also indicated his security clearance which was higher than bond would have guessed now he felt more or less comfortable in talking about the gehenna plan hydt and dunne he asked again so have you any thoughts on a connection here thousands of people at risk british interests threatened the plan hatched in severan hydts office eyes on his glass lamb said thoughtfully the fact is i dont know what kind of attack here would fit the bill weve got plenty of british expats and tourists and a lot of business interests with connections to london but killing that many people in one fell swoop sounds like itd have to be civil unrest and i dont see that happening in south africa weve got our troubles here theres no denying it zimbabwe asylum seekers trade union unrest corruption aids but were still the most stable country on the continent for once the man had provided bond with some real insight slight though it was this reinforced his idea that while buttons might be pushed in south africa fridays deaths could likely occur elsewhere the man had finished most of his gin youre not drinking when bond didnt answer he added we miss the old days dont we my friend bond didnt know what the old days were and decided it was unlikely he would miss them whatever they had been he also decided too that he quite disliked the phrase my friend you said you didnt get on with bheka jordaan lamb grunted what do you know about her shes damn good at her job ill give her that she was the officer who ran that investigation of the nia the south african national intelligence agency for conducting illegal surveillance on politicians here lamb chuckled darkly not that thatd ever happen in ourcountry would it bond recalled that bill tanner had chosen to use an saps liaison rather than national intelligence lamb continued they gave her the job hoping shed fumble but not captain jordaan oh no that would neverdo his eyes gleamed perversely she started to make headway in the case and everybody at the top got scared her boss at saps told her to lose the evidence against the nia agents so she arrested him and hisboss too lamb roared with laughter and knocked back the last of his drink she earned herself a big commendation the gold cross for bravery did she get roughed up in the investigation roughed up he mentioned her scarred arm in a way afterwards she was promoted had to happen politically you know how thatworks well some of the saps men who were passed over didnt take too kindly to it she got threats women shouldnt be taking mens jobs that sort of thing somebody chucked a molotov cocktail under her squad car shed gone into the station but there was a prisoner in the back seat drunk and sleeping it off none of the attackers saw him she ran outside and saved him but got burnt in the process they never found out who did it the perpetrators were masked but everybody knows it was people she was working with maybe still is god now bond believed he understood jordaans attitude towards him perhaps shed thought his flirtatious glance at the airport had meant he too didnt take a woman seriously as a police officer he explained to lamb his next step meeting hydt tonight oh the lodge club its all right used to be exclusive but now they let in everybody hey i saw that look i didnt mean what you think i just have a low opinion of the general public i do more business with blacks and coloureds than whites theres that look again coloureds bond said sourly it just means mixedrace and its perfectly acceptable here no one would take offence bonds experience however was that people using such terms werent the ones likely to be offended by them but he wasnt going to debate politics with gregory lamb bond looked at the breitling thanks for your thoughts he said without much enthusiasm now ive got work to do before my meeting with hydt jordaan had sent him some material on afrikaners south african culture and conflict regions that gene theron might have been active in lamb rose and hovered awkwardly well i stand ready to assist im at your service really anything you need he seemed painfully sincere thanks bond felt the urge absurdly to slip him twenty rand before he left lamb returned to the minibar and relieved it of two miniatures of vodka you dont mind do you ms got a positively massive budget everyone knows that bond saw him out good riddance he thought as the door closed percy osbornesmith was a charmer by comparison with this fellow bond sat at the expansive desk in the hotel suite booted up his computer logged on via his iris and fingerprint and scrolled through the information bheka jordaan had uploaded he was ploughing through it when an encrypted email arrived james for your eyes only have confirmed steel cartridge was a major active measure by kgbsvr to assassinate clandestine mi and cia agents and local assets so that the extent of russian infiltration would not be learnt in attempt to promote détente during fall of soviet union and improve relations with the west the last steel cartridge targeted killings occurred late s or early s found only one incident so far the victim was a private contractor working for mi deep cover no other details except that the active measures agent made the death appear to be an accident actual steel cartridges were sometimes left at the scenes of the deaths as warning to other agents to keep quiet am continuing investigation your other eyes philly bond slouched back in the chair staring at the ceiling well what do i do with this he asked himself he read the message again then sent a brief email thanking philly he rocked back and in the mirror across the room caught a glimpse of his eyes hard and set like a predators he reflected so the kgb active measures agent killed the mi contract op in the late eighties early nineties james bonds father had died during that period it had happened in december not long after his eleventh birthday andrew and monique bond had dropped young james off with his aunt charmian in pett bottom kent leaving behind the promise that they would return in plenty of time for christmas festivities they had then flown to switzerland and driven to mont blanc for five days of skiing and rock and ice climbing his parents assurance however had been hollow two days later they were dead having fallen from one of the astonishingly beautiful cliff faces of the aiguilles rouges near chamonix beautiful cliffs yes impressive but not excessively dangerous not where they had been climbing as an adult bond had looked into the circumstances of the accident hed learnt that the slope theyd fallen from did not require advanced climbing techniques indeed no one had ever been injured let alone died there but of course mountains are notoriously fickle and bond had taken at face value the story the gendarme had told his aunt that his parents had fallen because a rope frayed at the same time as a large boulder had given way mademoiselle je suis désolé de vous dire when he was young james bond had enjoyed travelling with his parents to the foreign countries where andrew bonds company sent him hed enjoyed living in hotel suites hed enjoyed the local cuisines very different from that served in the pubs and restaurants in england and scotland hed been captivated with the exotic cultures the dress the music the language he also enjoyed spending time with his father his mother would hand james over to carers and friends when one of her freelance photojournalism assignments arose but his father would occasionally take him to business meetings in restaurants or hotel lobbies the boy would perch nearby with a volume of tolkien or an american detective novel while his father talked to unsmiling men named sam or micah or juan james was happy to be included what son doesnt like to tag along with his dad he had always been curious though as to why sometimes andrew insisted that he join him while at others he said no quite firmly bond had thought nothing more of this until the training sessions at fort monckton it was there in the lessons on clandestine operations that one instructor had said something that caught his attention the round bespectacled man from mis tradecraft training section had told the group in most clandestine situations its not advisable for an agent or an asset to be married or have children if they happen to its best to make sure the family is kept far removed from the agents operational life however theres one instance in which its advantageous to have a quote typical life these agents will be operating in deepest cover and handling the most critical assignments where the intelligence to be gathered is vital in these cases a family life is important to remove the enemys suspicions that theyre operatives typically their official cover will be working for a company or organisation that interests enemy agents infrastructure information armaments aerospace or government they will be posted to different locations every few years and take their families with them james bonds father had worked for a major british armaments company he had been posted to a number of international capitals his wife and son had accompanied him the instructor had continued and in certain circumstances on the most critical assignments whether a brush pass or a facetoface meeting its useful for the operative to take his child with him nothing proclaims innocence more than having a youngster with you seeing this the enemy will almost always believe that youre the real deal no parent would want to endanger his or her child he regarded the agents sitting before him in the classroom their faces registering varying reactions at his passionless message combating evil sometimes requires a suspension of accepted values bond had thought his father a spy impossible absurd still after he had left fort monckton he spent some time looking into his fathers past but found no evidence of a clandestine life the only evidence was a series of payments made to his aunt for her and jamess benefit over and above the proceeds from his parents insurance policy these were made annually until james had turned eighteen by a company that must have had some affiliation with andrews employer though he could never find out exactly where it was based or what the nature of the payments had been eventually he convinced himself that whole idea was mad and forgot about it until the russian signal about steel cartridge because one other aspect of his parents death had been largely overlooked in the accident report that the gendarmes had prepared it was mentioned that a steel rifle cartridge mm had been found near his fathers body young james had received it among his parents effects and since andrew had been an executive with an arms company it was assumed that the bullet had been a sample of his wares to show to customers on monday two days ago after he had read the russian report bond had gone into the online archives of his fathers company hed learnt that it did not manufacture ammunition neither had it ever sold any weapons that fired a mm round this was the bullet that sat now in a conspicuous place on the mantelpiece of his london flat had it been dropped accidentally by a hunter or left intentionally as a warning the kgbs reference to operation steel cartridge had solidified within bond the desire to learn whether or not his father had been a secret agent he had to he did not need to reconcile himself to the possibility that his father had lied to him all parents deceive their children in most cases though its for the sake of expedience or through laziness or thoughtlessness if hisfather had lied it was because the official secrets act had compelled him to neither did he need to know the truth so that he could as a tv psychiatrist might suggest revisit his youthful loss and mourn somehow more authentically what nonsense no he wanted to know the truth for a much simpler reason one that fitted him like a savile row bespoke suit the person who had killed his parents might still be at large in the world enjoying the sun sitting down to a pleasant meal or even conspiring to take other lives if such were the case bond knew he would make certain that his parents assassin met the same fate as they had and he would do so efficiently and in accordance with his official remit by any means necessary at close to five pm on wednesday bonds mobile emitted the ringtone reserved for emergency messages he hurried from the bathroom where hed just showered and read the encrypted email it was from gchq reporting that bonds attempt to bug severan hydt had been somewhat successful unknown to captain bheka jordaan the flash drive that bond had given hydt holding digital pictures of the killing fields in africa also contained a small microphone and transmitter what it lacked in audio resolution and battery life it made up for in range the signal was picked up by a satellite amplified and beamed down to one of the massive receiving antennae at menwith hill in the beautiful yorkshire countryside the device had transmitted fragments of a conversation hydt and dunne had had just after theyd left the fictional ejt services office in downtown cape town the words had finally made their way through the decryption queue and been read by an analyst who had flagged them as critical and shot the missive to bond he now read the cx the raw intelligence and the analysed product it seemed that dunne was planning to kill one of hydts workers stephan dlamini and his family because the employee had seen something in a secure part of green way that he shouldnt have perhaps information that related to gehenna bonds goal was clear save him at all costs purpose response the man lived outside cape town the death would be made to look like a gang attack grenades and firebombs would be used and the attack would occur at suppertime after that though the battery died and the device had stopped transmitting at suppertime perhaps any moment now bond hadnt managed to rescue the woman in dubai he wasnt going to let this family die now he needed to find out what dlamini had learnt but he could hardly contact bheka jordaan and tell her what hed found out via illegal surveillance he picked up the phone and called the concierge yes sir i have a question for you bond said casually i had a problem with my car today and a local fellow helped me out i didnt have much cash with me and i wanted to give him something for his trouble how would i go about finding his address i have his name and the town he lives in but nothing more whats the town primrose gardens there was silence then the concierge said its a township a squatters camp bond recalled from the briefing material bheka jordaan had given him the shacks rarely had standard postal addresses well could i go there ask if anyone knew him another pause well sir it might not be very safe im not too worried about that i think it would not be practical either why is that the population of primrose gardens is around fifty thousand at hours as autumn dusk descended niall dunne watched severan hydt leave the green way office in cape town striding tall and with a certain elegance to his limousine hydts feet didnt splay hisposture wasnt hunched hisarms didnt swing from side to side oi lookit the tosser nialls a bleedin giraffe hydt was on his way home where he would change then take jessica to the fundraiser at the lodge club dunne was standing in the green way lobby staring out of the window his eyes lingered on hydt as he vanished down the street accompanied by one of his green way guards watching him leave en route to his home and his companion dunne felt a pang dont be so bloody ridiculous he told himself concentrate on the job all hells going to break loose on friday and itll be your fault if a single cog or gear malfunctions concentrate so he did dunne left green way collected his car and drove out of cape town towards primrose gardens he would meet up with a security man from the company and proceed with the plan which he now ran through his mind the timing the approach the number of grenades the firebomb the escape he reviewed the blueprint with precision and patience the way he did everything this is niall hes brilliant hes my draughtsman but other thoughts intruded and his sloping shoulders slumped even more as he pictured his boss at the fundraising gala later that night the pang stabbed him again dunne supposed people wondered why he was alone why he didnt have a partner they assumed the answer was that he lacked the ability to feel that he was a machine they didnt understand that according to the concept of classical mechanics there were simplemachines like screws and levers and pulleys and complex machines like engines which by definition transferred energy into motion well he reasoned logically calories were turned into energy which moved the human body so yes he wasa machine but so were we all every creature on earth that didnt preclude the capacity for love no the explanation of his solitude was simply that the object of his desire didnt in turn desire him how embarrassingly mundane how common and bloody unfair of course god it was unfair no draughtsman would design a machine in which the two parts necessary to create harmonious movement didnt work perfectly each needing the other and in turn satisfying the reciprocal need but that was exactly the situation in which he found himself he and his boss were mismatched parts besides he thought bitterly the laws of attraction were far riskier than the laws of mechanics relationships were messy dangerous and plagued with waste and while you could keep an engine humming for hundreds of thousands of hours love between human beings often sputtered and seized just after it caught it betrayed you too far more often than machinery did bollocks he told himself with what passed for anger within niall dunne forget all this you have a job to do tonight he ran through his blueprint again and then once more as the traffic thinned he drove quickly east of the city heading towards the township along dark roads gritty and damp as a riverside dock he pulled into a shoppingcentre car park and killed the engine a moment later a battered van stopped behind him dunne climbed from his car and got into the other vehicle nodding to the security man very large wearing military fatigues without saying a word they set off at once and in ten minutes were driving through the unmarked streets of primrose gardens dunne climbed into the back of the van where there were no windows he was of course distinctive here with his height his hair more significant he was white and would be extremely conspicuous in a south african township after dark it was possible that the drug dealer who was threatening dlaminis daughter was white or had whites who worked for him but dunne decided it was better to stay hidden at least until the time to throw the grenades and fire bombs through the windows of the shanty they drove along the endless paths that served as roads in the shanty town past packs of running children skinny dogs men sitting on doorsteps no gps the huge security man said his first words he wasnt smiling and dunne didnt know if he was making a joke the man had spent two hours that afternoon tracking down dlaminis shack there it is they parked across the road the place was tiny one storey as were all the shacks in primrose gardens and the walls were constructed of mismatched panels of plywood and corrugated metal painted bold red blue yellow as if in defiance of the squalor a clothesline hung in the yard to the side festooned with laundry for a family ranging in age it seemed from five or six to adulthood this was an efficient location for a kill the shack was opposite a patch of empty ground so there would be few witnesses not that it mattered the van had no number plate and white vehicles of this sort were as common in the western cape as sea gulls at green way they sat in silence for ten minutes just on the verge of attracting attention then the security man said there he is stephan dlamini was walking down the dusty road a tall thin man with greying hair wearing a faded jacket orange tshirt and brown jeans beside him was one of his sons the boy who was about eleven carried a mudstreaked football and wore a springboks rugby shirt without a jacket despite the autumn chill dlamini and the boy paused outside to kick the ball back and forth for a moment or two then they entered their home dunne nodded to the security man they pulled on ski masks dunne surveyed the shanty it was larger than most but the explosives and incendiary were sufficient the curtains were drawn across the windows the cheap fabric glowing with light from inside for some reason dunne found himself thinking again about his boss at the event that night he put the image away he gave it five minutes more to make sure that dlamini had used the toilet if there was one in the shack and that the family was seated at the dinner table lets go dunne said the security guard nodded they stepped out of the van each holding a powerful grenade filled with deadly copper shot the street was largely deserted seven family members dunne reflected now he whispered they pulled the pins on the grenades and flung them through each of the two windows in the five seconds of silence that followed dunne grabbed the firebomb a petrol can with a small detonator and readied it when stunning explosions shook the ground and blew out the remaining glass he threw the incendiary through the window and the two men leapt into the van the security man started the engine and they sped off exactly five seconds later flames erupted from the windows and spectacularly a stream of fire from the cooking stove chimney rose straight into the air twenty feet reminding dunne of the fireworks displays hed so enjoyed as a boy in belfast hayi hayi the womans wail filled the night as she stared at the fiery shack her home tears lensing her eyes she and her five children were clustered behind the inferno the back door was open providing a wrenching view of the rampaging flames destroying all of the familys possessions she struggled to run inside and rescue what she could but her husband stephan dlamini gripped her hard he spoke to her in a language james bond took to be xhosa a large crowd was gathering and an informal fire brigade had assembled passing buckets of water in a futile attempt to extinguish the raging flames we have to leave bond said to the tall man standing beside him next to an unmarked saps van without doubt said kwalene nkosi bond meant that they should get the family out of the township before dunne realised they were still alive nkosi though had a different concern the warrant officer had been eyeing the growing crowd who were staring at the white man the collective gaze was not friendly display your badge bond told him nkosis eyes widened no no commander that is not a wise idea let us leave now they shepherded stephan dlamini and his family into the van bond got in with them and nkosi climbed behind the wheel gunned the engine and steered them away into the night they left behind the angry confused crowd and the tumultuous flames but not a single injury it had been a true race to the finish line to save the family after hed learned that dlamini was going to be targeted by dunne and that he lived virtually anonymously in a huge township bond had struggled to come up with a way to locate him gchq and mi could find no mobile in his name or any personal records in south african census or tradeunion records he had taken a chance and called kwalene nkosi im going to tell you something warrant officer and i hope i can rely on you to keep it to yourself from everyone thered been a pause and the young man had said cautiously go on bond had laid out the problem including the fact that the surveillance had been illegal your signal is breaking up commander i missed that last part bond had laughed but we have to find where this stephan dlamini lives now nkosi had sighed it is going to be difficult primrose gardens is huge but i have an idea the minibus taxi operations it seemed knew far more about the shanty towns and lokasiesthan the local government did the warrant officer would begin calling them he and bond had met then driven fast to primrose gardens nkosi continuing his search for the familys shack via his mobile at close to six pm theyd been cruising through the township when a taxi driver had reported that he knew where dlamini lived hed directed bond and nkosi there as theyd approached theyd seen another van at the front a white face glancing out dunne nkosi had said he and bond had veered away and parked behind the shanty theyd pushed through the back door and the family had panicked but nkosi had told them in their own language that the men had come to save them they had to get out immediately stephan dlamini was not at home yet but soon would be a few minutes later hed come through the door with his young son and bond knowing the attack was imminent had had no choice but to draw his gun and force them out of the back door nkosi had just finished explaining bonds purpose and the danger when the grenades went off followed by the petrol bomb now they were on the n cruising west dlamini gripped bonds hand and shook it then he leant forward to the front passenger seat and hugged him tears stood in his eyes his wife huddled in the back with her children studying bond suspiciously as the agent told him whod been behind the attack finally after hearing the story dlamini asked in dismay mr hydt but how can that be he is best boss he treat all of us good very good i am not understanding this bond explained it seemed that dlamini had learnt something about illegal activities hydt and dunne were engaged in his eyes flashed i know what you are speaking of his head bobbed up and down he told bond that he was a maintenance man at the green way plant north of town that morning hed found the door to the companys research and development office left open for deliveries the two employees inside were at the back of the room dlamini had seen an overflowing bin inside the rubbish there was supposed to be handled by somebody else but he decided to empty it anyway i just was trying to do good job thats all he shook his head i go inside and start to empty this bin when one of the workers sees me and starts screaming at me what did i see what was i looking at i said nothing he ordered me out and didyou see anything that mightve upset them i dont think so on the computer beside the bin there was a message an email i think i saw serbia in english but i paid no more attention anything else no sir serbia so some of the secrets to gehenna lay beyond the door to research and development bond said to nkosi we have to get the family away if i give them money is there a hotel where they can stay until the weekend i can find some rooms for them bond gave them fifteen hundred rand the man blinked as he stared at the sum nkosi explained to dlamini that he would have to stay in hiding for a short while and have him call other family members and close friends he should tell them that he and his family are all right but that they have to play dead for a few days can you plant a story in the media about their deaths i think so the warrant officer was hesitating but im wondering if his voice faded well keep this between ourselves captain jordaan does not need to know without doubt that is best as the glorious vista of cape town rose before them bond glanced at his watch it was time for the second assignment of the night one that would require him to enlist a very different set of tradecraft skills from dodging grenades and firebombs though he suspected that this job would be no less challenging bond wasnt impressed by the lodge club perhaps back in the day when it was the enclave of hunters in jodhpurs and jackets embellished with loops to hold ammunition for their bigfive game rifles it had been more posh but the atmosphere now was that of a function room hosting simultaneous wedding receptions bond wasnt even sure if the cape buffalo head staring down at him angrily from near the front door was real or had been manufactured in china he gave the name gene theron to one of the attractive young women at the door she happened to be blonde and voluptuous and wearing a tightfitting crimson dress with a lazy neckline the other hostess was of zulu or xhosa ancestry but equally built and clad bond suspected that whoever ran the fundraising organisation knew how to tactically appeal to what was of whatever race predominantly a male donor pool he added guest of mr hydt ah yes the goldenhaired woman said and let him into the lowlit room where fifty or so people milled about still wine champagne and soft drinks were on offer and bond went for the sparkling bond had followed hydts suggestions on dress and the durban mercenary was in light grey trousers a black sports jacket and a light blue shirt no tie holding his champagne flute bond looked around the plush hall the group behind the event was the international organisation against hunger based in cape town pictures on easels showed workers handing out large sacks to happy recipients women mostly hercules planes being unloaded and boats laden with sacks of rice or wheat there were no pictures of starving emaciated children a tasteful compromise all around you wanted donors to feel slightly but not too uneasy bond guessed that the world of altruism had to be as carefully navigated as whitehall politics from speakers in the ceiling the harmonies of ladysmith black mambazo and the inspirational songs of the cape town singer verity provided an appealing soundtrack to the evening the event was a silent auction tables were filled with all sorts of items donated by supporters of the group a football signed by players from bafana bafana the south african national football team a whalewatching cruise a weekend getaway in stellenbosch a zulu sculpture a pair of diamond earrings and much more the guests would circulate and write their bids for each item on a sheet of paper the one whod put down the highest amount when the auction closed would win the article severan hydt had donated a dinner for four worth eight thousand rand about seven hundred pounds bond calculated at a firstclass restaurant the wine flowed generously and waiters circulated with silver trays of elaborate canapés ten minutes after bond had arrived severan hydt appeared with his female companion on his arm niall dunne was nowhere to be seen he nodded to hydt who was in a nicely cut navyblue suit probably american if he read the sloping shoulders right the woman her name he recalled was jessica barnes was in a simple black dress and heavily bejewelled all diamonds and platinum her stockings were pure white not a hint of colour was to be found on her she didnt even wear a touch of lipstick his earlier impression held how gaunt she was despite her attractive figure and face her austerity aged her considerably giving her a ghostly look bond was curious every other woman here of jessicas age had clearly spent hours dolling herself up ah theron hydt boomed and marched forward detaching himself from jessica who followed as bond shook his hand the woman regarded him with a noncommittal smile he turned to her tradecraft requires constant often exhausting effort you must maintain an expression of faint curiosity when meeting a person youre familiar with only through surveillance lives have been lost because of a simple slip ah good to see you again when in fact youve never met face to face bond kept his eyes neutral as hydt introduced her this is jessica he turned to her gene theron were doing business together the woman nodded and though she held his eye took his hand tentatively it was a sign of insecurity bond concluded another indication of this was her handbag which she kept over her shoulder and pinned tight between arm and ribcage smalltalk ensued bond reciting snippets from jordaans lessons about the country taking care to be accurate assuming that jessica might report their conversation to hydt in a low voice he offered that the south african government should busy itself with more important things than renaming pretoria tshwane he was glad the trade union situation was calming yes he enjoyed life on the east coast the beaches near his home in durban were particularly nice especially now that the shark nets were up though hed never had any problems with the great whites which occasionally took bites out of people they talked then about wildlife jessica had visited the famed kruger game reserve again recently and seen two adolescent elephants tear up trees and bushes it had reminded her of the gangs in somerville massachusetts just north of boston teenagers vandalising public parks oh yes hed thought her accent was american have you ever been there mr theron call me gene please bond said scrolling mentally through the biography written by bheka jordaan and i branch no he said but i hope to some day bond looked at hydt his body language had shifted he was giving out signs of impatience a glance at jessica suggested he wished her to leave them bond thought of the abuse bheka jordaan had endured at the hands of her coworkers this was different only in degree a moment later the woman excused herself to powder her nose an expression bond had not heard in years he thought it ironic that she used the term considering that she probably wouldnt be doing so when they were alone hydt said to him ive thought more about your proposal and id like to move forward good they took refills of champagne from an attractive young afrikaner woman bond said dankie and reminded himself not to overdo his act he and hydt retired to a corner of the room the older man waving to and shaking hands with people on the way when the men were alone beneath the mounted head of a gazelle or antelope hydt peppered bond with questions about the number of graves the acreage the countries they were in and how close the authorities were to discovering some of the killing fields as bond adlibbed the answers he couldnt help but be impressed with the mans thoroughness it seemed hed spent all afternoon thinking about the project he was careful to remember what he told hydt and made a mental note to write it down later so that he would be consistent in the future after fifteen minutes bond said now there are things i would like to know first your operation here id like to see it i think you should when he didnt suggest a time bond said how about tomorrow that might be difficult with my big project on friday bond nodded some of my clients are eager to move forward you are my first choice but if therell be delays ill have to no no please tomorrow will be fine bond began to probe more but just then the lights dimmed and a woman ascended the raised platform near where hydt and bond were standing good evening she called out her low voice glazed with a south african accent welcome everyone thank you for coming to our event she was the managing director of the organisation and bond was amused by her name felicity willing she wasnt to bonds eye covergirl beautiful as was philly maidenstone however her face was intense striking expertly made up it exuded a feline quality her eyes were a deep green like late summer leaves caught in the sun and her hair dark blonde pulled back severely and pinned up accentuating the determined angles of her nose and chin she wore a closefitting navyblue cocktail dress that was cut low at the front and lower still at the back her silver shoes sported thin straps and precarious heels faintly pink pearls shone at her throat and she wore one ring also a pearl on her right index finger her nails were short and uncoloured she scanned the audience with a penetrating almost challenging gaze and said i must warn you all tension swelled at university i was known as felicity wilful an appropriate name as youll find out later when i make the rounds i advise you all for your own safety to keep your chequebooks at the ready a smile replaced the fierce visage as the laughter died down felicity began to talk about the problems of hunger africa must import twentyfive per cent of its food while the population has soared crop yields today are no higher than they were in in places like the central african republic nearly a third of all households are food insecure in africa iodine deficiency is the numberone cause of brain damage vitamin a deficiency is the numberone cause of blindness nearly three hundred million people in africa do not have enough to eat that number equals the entire population of the united states africa of course was not alone in the need for food aid she continued and her organisation was attacking the plague on all fronts thanks to the generosity of donors including many here the group had recently expanded its charter from being a purely south african charity to an international one opening offices in jakarta portauprince and mumbai with others planned and she added the biggest shipment of maize sorghum milk powder and other highnutrient staples ever to arrive in africa was soon to be delivered in cape town for distribution across the continent felicity acknowledged the applause then her smile vanished and she gazed at the crowd with piercing eyes once more speaking in a low even menacing voice about the need to make poorer countries independent of western agropolies she railed against the prevailing approach of america and europe to end hunger foreignowned megafarms forcing their way into thirdworld nations and squeezing out the local farmers the people who knew how to get the best yield from the land those enterprises were using africa and other nations as laboratories to test untried methods and products like synthetic fertilisers and genetically engineered seeds the vast majority of international agribusiness cares only about profit not about relieving the suffering of the people and this is simply not acceptable finally having delivered her assault felicity smiled and singled out the donors hydt among them he responded to the applause with a wave he was smiling too but his whisper to bond told a different story if you want adulation just give away money the more desperate they are the more they love you he clearly didnt want to be here felicity stepped off the platform to circulate as the guests continued their silent bidding bond said to hydt i dont know if you have plans but i was thinking we could go for some dinner on me im sorry theron but i have to meet an associate whos just arrived in town for that project i mentioned gehenna bond certainly wanted to meet whoever this man was id be happy to take everyone out your associate too tonights no good im afraid hydt said absently pulling his iphone out and scrolling through messages or missed calls he glanced up and spotted jessica standing by herself awkwardly in front of a table on which items were being offered for auction when she looked at him he beckoned her over impatiently bond tried to think of some other way to conjure an invitation but decided to back off before hydt became suspicious seduction in tradecraft is like seduction in love it works best if you make the object of your desire come to you nothing ruins your efforts faster than desperate pursuit tomorrow then bond said seemingly distracted and glancing at his own phone yes good hydt looked up felicity with a smile the charitys managing director detached herself from a fat balding man in a dusty dinner jacket hed been gripping her hand for far longer than courtesy dictated she joined hydt jessica and bond severan jessica they brushed cheeks and an associate gene theron hes from durban in town for a few days felicity gripped bonds hand he asked obvious questions about her organisation and the shipments of food arriving soon hoping hydt would change his mind about dinner but the man looked once more at his iphone and said im afraid we have to be going severan felicity said i dont think my remarks really conveyed our gratitude youve introduced some important donors to us i really cant thank you enough bond took note of this so she knew the names of some of hydtsassociates he wondered how best to exploit this connection hydt said im delighted to help ive been lucky in life i want to share that good fortune he turned to bond see you tomorrow theron around noon if thats convenient wear old clothes and shoes he brushed his curly beard with an index finger whose nail reflected a streak of jaundiced light youll be taking a tour of hell after hydt and jessica had left bond turned to felicity willing those statistics were disturbing i might be interested in helping standing close he was aware of her perfume a musky scent might be interested she asked he nodded felicity kept a smile on her face but it didnt reach her eyes well mr theron for every donor who actually writes a cheque two others say theyre interested but i never see a rand id rather somebody told me up front they dont want to give anything then i can get on with my business forgive me if im blunt but im fighting a war here and you dont take prisoners no she said smiling sincerely now i dont felicity wilful then ill most certainly help bond said wondering what a branch would say when they encountered a donation on his expense account back in london im not sure im able to rise to severans level of generosity one rand donated is one rand closer to solving the problem she said he paused a judicious moment then said just had a thought severan and jessica couldnt make it for dinner and im alone in town would you care to join me after the auction felicity considered this i dont see why not you look reasonably fit and turned away a lioness preparing to descend on a herd of gazelles at the conclusion of the event which raised the equivalent of including a modest donation on the credit card of gene theron bond and felicity willing walked to the car park behind the lodge club they approached a large van beside which were dozens of large cardboard cartons she tugged up her hem bent down like a stevedore on a dock and muscled a heavy box through the open side door of the vehicle the reference to his physical wellbeing was suddenly clear let me he said well both do it together they began to transfer the cartons which smelt of food leftovers he said didnt you think it was rather ironic that we were serving gourmet finger food at a campaign to raise money for the hungry felicity asked i did yes if id offered tinned biscuits and processed cheese theyd have devoured the lot but with fancier stuff i extorted some threestar restaurants to donate it they didnt dare take more than a bite or two i wanted to make sure there was plenty left over where are we delivering the excess a food bank not far away its one of the outlets my organisation works with when they had finished loading they got into the van felicity climbed into the drivers seat and slipped off her shoes to drive barefoot then they sped into the night bounding assertively over the uneven tarmac as she tormented the clutch and gearbox in fifteen minutes they were at the cape town interdenominational food bank centre her shoes back on felicity opened the side door and together they offloaded the scampi crab cakes and jamaican chicken which the staff carried inside the shelter when the van was empty felicity gestured to a large man in khaki slacks and tshirt he seemed impervious to the may chill he hesitated then joined them eyeing bond curiously then he said yes miss willing thank you miss willing lot of good food for everyone tonight did you see inside the shelter its crowded she ignored his questions which to bond had sounded like diversionary chatter joso last week a shipment disappeared fifty kilos who took it i didnt hear anything i didnt ask whether you heard anything i asked who took it his face was a mask but then it sagged why you asking me miss willing i didnt do nothing joso do you know how many people fifty kilos of rice will feed i tell me how many people he towered over her but felicity held her ground bond wondered if thiswas what she had meant with her assessment of his fitness she had wanted someone to back her up but her eyes revealed that to her bond wasnt even present this was between felicity and a transgressor whod stolen food from those shed pledged to protect and she was entirely capable of taking him on alone her eyes reminded him of his when he confronted an enemy how many people she repeated miserably he lapsed into zulu or xhosa no she corrected it will feed more than that many more it was an accident he protested i forgot to close the door it was late i was working it was no accident someone saw you unlock the door before you left who has the rice no no you must believe me who she persisted coolly he was defeated a man from the flats in a gang oh please miss willing if you tell the saps hell find out it was me hell know i told you he will come for me and he will come for my family her jaw tightened and bond couldnt dislodge the impression hed had earlier of a feline now about to strike there was no sympathy in her voice as she said i wont go to the police not this time but youll tell the director what you did and hell decide whether to keep you on or not this is my only job he protested i have a family my only job which you were happy to endanger she responded now go and tell reverend van groot and if he keeps you on and another theft occurs i willtell the police it will not happen again miss willing he turned and vanished inside bond couldnt help but be impressed with her cool efficient handling of the incident he noted too it made her all the more attractive she caught bonds eye and her face softened the war im fighting sometimes youre never quite sure who the enemy is they might even be on your side how well do i know that thought bond they returned to the van felicity bent down to remove her shoes again but bond said quickly ill drive save you unstrapping she laughed they got in and set off dinner she asked he almost felt guilty after all hed heard about hunger if youre still up for it oh i most certainly am as they drove bond asked would he really have been killed if youd gone to the police the saps would have laughed at the idea of investigating fifty kilos of stolen rice but the cape flats aredangerous thats true and if anyone there thought joso betrayed them he very likely would be killed lets hope hes learnt his lesson her voice grew cool again as she added leniency can win you allies it can also be a cobra felicity guided him back to green point since the restaurant shed suggested was near the table mountain hotel he left the van there and they walked on several times bond noted felicity glanced behind her her face alert shoulders tensed the road was deserted what did she feel threatened by she relaxed once they were in the front lobby of the restaurant which was decorated with tapestry the fixtures dark wood and brass the large windows overlooked the water which danced with lights much of the illumination inside came from hundreds of creamcoloured candles as they were escorted to the table bond noticed that her clinging dress glistened in the light and seemed to change colour with every step from navy to azure to cerulean her skin glowed the waiter greeted her by name then smiled at bond she ordered a cosmopolitan and bond in the mood for a cocktail ordered the drink he had had with philly maidenstone crown royal whisky a double on ice half a measure of triple sec two dashes of angostura twist of orange peel not a slice when the waiter left felicity said ive never heard of that before my own invention have you named it bond smiled to himself recalling that the waiter at antoines in london had wondered about the drink too not yet he had a flash of inspiration from his conversation with m several days earlier though i think i will now ill call it the carte blanche in your honour why she asked her narrow brow furrowed because if your donors drink enough of them theyll give you complete freedom to take their money she laughed and squeezed his arm then picked up the menu sitting closer to her now bond could see how expertly shed applied her makeup accentuating the feline eyes and the thrust of her cheeks and jaw a thought came to him philly maidenstone was perhaps more classically attractive but hers was a passive beauty felicitys was far more assertive forceful he upbraided himself for dwelling on the comparison reached for the menu and began to study it scanning the extensive card he learnt that the restaurant celsius was famed for its special grill which reached degrees centigrade felicity said you order for us anything to start but i must have a steak for my main course theres nothing like the grilled meat at celsius my god gene youre not a vegan are you hardly when the waiter arrived bond ordered fresh grilled sardines to be followed by a large ribeye steak for two he asked if the chef could grill it with the bone in known in america as the cowboy cut the waiter mentioned that the steaks were typically served with exotic sauces argentinian chimichurri indonesian coffee madagascan peppercorn spanish madeira or peruvian anticuchos but bond declined them all he believed that steaks had flavour enough of their own and should be eaten with only salt and pepper felicity nodded that she was in agreement bond then selected a bottle of south african red wine the rustenberg peter barlow cabernet the wine came and was as good as hed expected they clinked glasses and sipped the waiter brought the first course and they ate bond deprived of his lunch by gregory lamb was starving what do you do for a living gene severan didnt say security work ah a faint chill descended felicity was obviously a tough worldly businesswoman and recognised the euphemism she would guess he was in some way involved with the many conflicts in africa war shed said during her speech was one of the main causes for the plague of hunger he said i have companies that install security systems and provide guards she seemed to believe this was at least partly true i was born in south africa and have been living here now for four or five years ive seen it change crime is less of a problem than it used to be but security staff are still needed we have a number of them at the organisation we must charitable work doesnt exempt us from risk she added darkly im happy to give food away i wont have it stolen from me to divert her from asking more questions about him bond enquired about her life shed grown up in the bush in the western cape the only child of english parents her father a mining company executive the family had moved back to london when she was thirteen she was an outsider at boarding school she confessed i might have fitted in a bit better if id kept my mouth shut about how to fielddress gazelles especially in the dining hall then it had been the london business school and a stint at a major city investment bank where shed done all right her dismissive modesty suggested shed done extremely well but the work had proved ultimately unsatisfying it was too easy for me gene there was no challenge i needed a steeper mountain well four or five years ago i decided to reassess my life i took a month off and spent some time back here i saw how pervasive hunger was and i decided to do something about it everybody told me not to bother it was impossible to make a difference well that was like waving a red flag at a bull felicity wilful she smiled so here i am bullying donors to give us money and taking on the american and european megafarms agropoly clever term i coined it she said then burst out theyre destroying the continent im not going to let them get away with it the serious discussion was cut short when the waiter appeared with the steak sizzling on an iron platter it was charred on the outside and succulent within they ate in silence for a time at one point he sliced off a crusty piece of meat but took a sip of wine before he put it into his mouth when he returned to his plate the morsel was gone and felicity was chewing mischievously sorry i tend to go after things that appeal to me bond laughed very clever stealing from under the nose of a security expert he waved to the sommelier and a second bottle of the cabernet appeared bond steered the conversation to severan hydt he was disappointed to find that she didnt seem to know much about the man that might be helpful to his mission she mentioned the names of several of his partners whod donated money to her group and he memorised them she had not met niall dunne but she knew hydt had some brilliant assistant who performed all sorts of technical wizardry she lifted an eyebrow and said i just realised youre the one he uses sorry for his security at the green way operation north of town ive never been but one of my assistants collected a donation from him all those metal detectors and scanners you cant get inside the place with a paperclip let alone a mobile phone you have to check everything at the door like in those old american westerns you leave your guns outside when you go into the bar he awarded that contract to somebody else i do other jobs this intelligence worried bond hed intended to get into the green way building with far more than a paperclip and a mobile phone despite bheka jordaans disdain for illegal surveillance hed have to consider the implications the meal wound down and they finished the wine they were the last patrons in the restaurant bond called for the bill and settled it the second of my donations he said they returned to the entrance where he collected her black cashmere coat and draped it over her shoulders they started down the pavement the narrow heels of her shoes tapping on the concrete again she surveyed the streets then relaxing she took his arm and held it tightly he was keenly aware of her perfume and of the occasional pressure of her breast against his arm they approached his hotel bond fishing the van key from his pocket felicity slowed the night sky was clear above them encrusted with a plenitude of stars a very nice evening felicity said and thank you for your help in delivering the leftovers youre even fitter than i thought bond found himself asking another glass of wine the green eyes were looking up and into his own would youlike one yes he said firmly in ten minutes they were in his room in the table mountain hotel sitting on the sofa which they had turned and slid close to the window glasses of a stellenbosch pinotage were in their hands they looked out over the flickering lights in the bay muted yellow and white like benign insects hovering in anticipation felicity turned to him perhaps to say something perhaps not and he bent forward and pressed his lips gently to hers then he eased back a little gauging her reaction and moved forward and kissed her again harder losing himself in the contact the taste the heat her breath on his cheek felicitys arms snaked around his shoulders as her mouth held his then she kissed his neck and teasingly bit the base where it met his firm shoulder her tongue slid along a scar that arced down to his upper arm bonds fingers slipped up her neck into her hair and pulled her closer he was lost in the pungent musk of her perfume a parallel to this moment is skiing when you pause on the ridge atop a beautiful but perilous downhill run you have a choice to go or not you can always snap free the bindings and walk down the mountain but in fact for bond there never was such a choice once on the edge it was impossible not to give in to the seduction of gravity and speed the only true choice left is how to control the accelerating descent the same now here bond whisked her dress off the insubstantial blue cloth spilling leisurely to the floor felicity then eased back pulling him with her until they were lying on the couch she beneath him she began tugging at his lower lip with her teeth he cupped her neck again and pulled her face to his while her hands rested on the small of his back kneading hard felicity shuddered and inhaled sharply and he understood that for whatever reason she liked touching him there he knew too that she wanted his hands to curl firmly behind her waist such is the way lovers communicate and he would remember that place the delicate bones of her spine for his part bond found rapture throughout her body all its aspects her hungry lips her strong flawless thighs breasts encased in taut black silk her delicate neck and throat from which a whispered moan issued the dense hair framing her face the softer strands elsewhere they kissed endlessly and then she broke away and locked onto his fierce eyes with her own whose lids dusted with faint green luminescence halfway lowered mutual surrender mutual victory bond lifted her easily their lips met once more briefly and he carried her to the bed thursday disappearance row he awoke with a start from a nightmare he could not remember curiously james bonds first thought was of philly maidenstone he felt absurdly that hed been unfaithful yet his most intimate contact with her had been a brief brush of cheeks that had lasted half a second he rolled over the other side of the bed was empty he looked at the clock it was half past seven he could smell felicitys perfume on the sheets and pillows the previous evening had begun as an exercise in learning about his enemy and his enemys purpose but had become something more he had felt a strong empathy with felicity willing a tough woman whod conquered the city and was now turning her resources to a nobler battle he reflected that in their own ways they were both knights errant and he wanted to see her again but first things first he got out of bed and pulled on a towelling dressinggown he hesitated for a moment then told himself has to be done he went to his laptop in the suites living area the device had been modified by q branch to incorporate a motionactivated lowlight camera bond booted up the machine and looked over the replay it had been pointed only at the front door and the chair where bond had tossed his jacket and trousers containing his wallet passport and mobile at around five thirty am according to the time stamp felicity dressed had walked past his clothing showing no interest in his phone pockets or the laptop she paused and looked back towards the bed with a smile he believed so but couldnt be sure she put something on the table by the door and let herself out he stood up and strode to the table her business card lay next to a lamp she had penned a mobile number underneath her organisations main phone line he slipped the card into his wallet he cleaned his teeth showered and shaved then dressed in blue jeans and a loose black lacoste shirt chosen to conceal his walther laughing to himself he donned the gaudy bracelet and watch and slipped on his finger the initial ring ejt checking his texts and emails he found one from percy osbornesmith the man was staying true to his reformed ways and gave a succinct update on the investigation in britain though little headway had been made he concluded our friends in whitehall are positively obsessed with afghanistan i say all the better for us james looking forward to sharing a george cross with you when we see hydt in shackles while he had breakfast in his room he considered his impending trip to hydts green way plant thinking back to last night to all hed seen and heard especially about the supertight security when he finished he called q branch and got through to sanu hirani he could hear childrens voices in the background and supposed he had been patched through to the branch directors mobile at home hirani had six children they all played cricket and his eldest daughter was a star batswoman bond told him of his communications and weapons needs hirani had some ideas but was uncertain that he could come up quickly with a solution whats your time frame james two hours there followed a thoughtful exhalation from down the line seven thousand miles away then ill need a cutout in cape town somebody with knowledge of the area and top clearance oh and a solid noc do you know anybody who fits the bill im afraid i do at ten thirty am bond in a grey windcheater made his way to the central police station and was escorted to the crime combating and investigation division office morning commander kwalene nkosi said smiling warrant officer bond nodded their eyes met conspiratorially you see the news this morning nkosi asked tapping the cape times tragic story a family was killed in a firebombing in primrose gardens township last night he frowned rather obviously how terrible bond said reflecting that despite his west end ambitions nkosi was not a very good actor without doubt he glanced into bheka jordaans office and she waved him inside morning he said spotting a pair of wellworn trainers in the corner of the office he hadnt noticed them yesterday you run much now and then its important to stay in shape for my job when he was in london bond spent at least an hour a day exercising and running using the odgs gym and jogging along the paths in regents park i enjoy it too maybe if time permits you could show me some running trails there must be some beautiful ones in town im sure the hotel will have a map she said dismissively was your meeting at the lodge club successful bond gave her a rundown of what had happened at the fundraiser jordaan then asked and afterwards ms willing proved useful to you bond lifted an eyebrow i thought you didnt believe in unlawful surveillance making certain someone is safe on the public sidewalks and streets is hardly illegal warrant officer nkosi told you of our cctv cameras in the centre of town well in answer to your question yes she washelpful she gave me some information about the enhanced security at green way he added stiffly i was lucky she did no one else seemed to be aware of it otherwise my trip there today might have been disastrous thats fortunate then jordaan said bond told her the names of the three donors felicity had mentioned last night the men hydt had introduced her to jordaan knew of two as successful legitimate businessmen nkosi conducted a search and learnt that neither they nor the third had any criminal record in any event all three were out of town bond assessed they would not be of any immediate help bond was looking at the policewoman you dont like felicity willing you think im jealous her face said just what a man would believe nkosi turned away bond glanced toward him but he was offering no allegiance to britain in this international dispute that idea couldnt have been further from my mind your eyes told me you dont like her why ive never met her shes probably a perfectly nice woman i dont like what she represents which is a foreigner who comes here to pat us on the head and dispense alms its twentyfirstcentury imperialism people used to exploit africa for diamonds and slaves now its exploited for its ability to purge the guilt of wealthy westerners it seems to me bond said evenly that no one can progress when theyre hungry it doesnt matter where the food comes from does it charity undermines you need to fight your way out of oppression and deprivation we can do it ourselves perhaps more slowly but we will do it you have no problem when britain or america imposes arms embargoes on warlords hungers as dangerous as rocketpropelled grenades and land mines why shouldnt we help stop that too its different obviously i dont see how he said coolly besides felicity might be more on your side than you give her credit for shes made some enemies among the big corporations in europe america and asia she thinks theyre meddling in african affairs and that more should be left to the people here he remembered her ill ease on the short walk to the restaurant last night my take is that shes put herself at quite some risk saying so if youre interested but jordaan clearly wasnt how completelyirritating this woman was bond looked at his huge breitling watch i should leave for green way soon i need a car can someone arrange a hire in therons name nkosi nodded enthusiastically without doubt you like to drive commander i do bond said how did you know on the way from the airport yesterday you looked with some interest at a maserati a moto guzzi and a lefthanddrive mustang from america you notice things warrant officer i try to that ford it was a very nice set of wheels some day i will own a jaguar it is my goal then a loud voice was calling a greeting from the corridor hallo hallo bond wasnt surprised it belonged to gregory lamb the mi agent strode into the office waving to everyone it was obvious that bheka jordaan didnt care for him as lamb had admitted yesterday though he and nkosi seemed to get on well they had a brief conversation about a recent football match casting a cautious glance at jordaan the big ruddy man turned to bond came through for you my friend got a signal from vauxhall cross to help you out lamb was the cutout whom bond had reluctantly mentioned to hirani earlier that morning he couldnt think of anybody else to use on such short notice and at least the man had been vetted leapt into the fray even missed breakfast my friend ill have you know talked to that chap in your offices q branch is he always so bloody cheerful that early in the morning actually he is said bond got talking to him im having some navigation problems on my ship charters piratesve been jamming signals whatever happened to the eye patches and peg legs hmm well this hirani says there are devices that will jam the jammers he wouldnt ship me any though any chance you could put in a word you know our outfit doesnt officially exist lamb were all part of the same team he said huffily ive got a huge charter coming up in a day or so massive helping lambs lucrative cover career was the last thing on bonds mind at the moment he asked sternly and your assignment today ah yes lamb handed bond the black satchel he was carrying as if it contained the crown jewels must say in all modesty the mornings been a smashing success positively brilliant ive been running hither and yon had to tip rather heavily youll reimburse me of course im sure itll get sorted bond opened the satchel and regarded the contents he examined one item closely it was a small plastic tube labelled releef for congestion problems caused by asthma hirani was a genius an inhaler you have lung problems nkosi asked my brother too he is a gold miner not really bond pocketed it along with the other items lamb had delivered nkosi took a call when he hung up he said i have a nice car for you commander subaru allwheel drive a subaru thought bond sceptical a suburban estate wagon but nkosi was beaming so he said graciously thank you warrant officer ill look forward to driving it the petrol mileage is very good nkosi said enthusiastically im sure it is he started out of the door gregory lamb stopped him bond he said softly sometimes im not sure the powers that be in london take me all that seriously i was exaggerating a bit yesterday about the cape i mean fact is the worst that happens down here is a warlord coming in from congo to take the waters or a hamas chap in transit at the airport just want to thank you for including me my friend i bond interrupted youre welcome lamb but hows this lets just assume im your friend then you wont have to keep repeating it hows that fair enough my fair enough a grin spread over the fat face then bond was out the door thinking next stop hell james bond enjoyed kwalene nkosis little joke yes the car hed procured for the agents use was a small japanese import it wasnt however a staid family saloon but a metallic blue subaru impreza wrx the sti model which boasted a turbocharged horsepower engine six gears and a high spoiler the jaunty little vehicle would be far more at home on rally courses than in some asda car park and settling into the drivers seat bond couldnt restrain himself he laid twin streaks of rubber as he sped up buitenkant street heading for the motorway for the next halfhour he made his way north of cape town proper guided by satnav and finally skidded the taut little subaru off the n and proceeded east along an increasingly deserted road past a vast bottomless quarry and then into a grubby landscape of low hills some green some brown with autumn tint sporadic stands of trees broke the monotony the may sky was overcast and the air was humid but dust rose from the road churned up by the green way lorries carting their refuse in the direction bond was going in addition to the typical dustcarts there were much larger ones painted with the green way name and distinctive green leaf or dagger logo signs on the sides indicated that they came from company operations throughout south africa bond was surprised to see one lorry was from a branch in pretoria the administrative capital of the country many miles away why would hydt go to the expense of bringing rubbish to cape town when he could open a recycling depot where it was needed bond changed down and blew past a series of the lorries at speed he was enjoying this sprightly vehicle very much hed have to tell philly maidenstone about it a large road sign stark in black and white flashed past gevaar danger privaat eiendom private property hed been off the n for several miles when the road divided with the lorries going to the right bond steered down the left fork with an arrowed sign hoofkantoor main office motoring fast through a dense grove of trees they were tall but looked recently planted he came to a rise and shot over it ignoring the posted limit of forty kph and braked hard as green way international loomed the rapid stop wasnt because of obstruction or a sharp curve but the unnerving sight that greeted him an endless expanse of the waste facility filled his view and disappeared into a smoky dusty haze in the distance the orange fires of some burnoff operation could been seen from at least a mile away hell indeed in front of him beyond a crowded car park was the headquarters building it was eerie too in its own way though not large the structure was stark and bleakly imposing the unpainted concrete bunker one storey high had only a few windows small ones sealed it seemed the entire grounds were enclosed by two tenfoot metal fences both topped with wicked razor wire which glinted even in the muted light the barriers were thirty feet apart reminding bond of a similar perimeter the shoottokill zone surrounding the north korean prison from which hed successfully rescued a local mi asset last year bond scowled at the fences one of his plans was ruined he knew from what felicity had told him that thered be metal detectors and scanners and most likely an imposing security fence but hed assumed a single barrier hed planned to slip some of the equipment hirani had provided a weatherproof miniature communications device and weapon through the fence into grass or bushes on the other side for him to retrieve once he had entered that wasnt going to work with two fences and a great distance between them as he drove forward again he saw that the entrance was barred by a thick steel gate on top of which was a sign r educe r euse r ecycle the green way anthem chilled bond not the words themselves but the configuration a crescent of stark black metal letters it reminded him of the sign over the entrance to the nazi death camp auschwitz the horrifically ironic assurance that work would set the prisoners free arbeit macht frei bond parked he climbed out keeping his walther and mobile with him so that he could find out how effective the security really was he also had in his pocket the asthma inhaler hirani had provided he had hidden under the front seat the other items lamb had delivered that morning the weapon and com device he approached the first guardhouse at the outer fence a large man in uniform greeted him with a reserved nod bond gave his cover name the man made a call and a moment later an equally large equally stern fellow in a dark business suit came up and said mr theron this way please bond followed him through the no mans land between the two fences they entered a room where three armed guards sat about watching a football match they stood up immediately the security man turned to bond now mr theron we have very strict rules here mr hydt and his associates do most of the research and development work for his companies on these premises we must guard our trade secrets carefully we dont allow any mobiles or radios of any kind in with you no cameras or pagers either youll have to hand them in bond was looking at a large rack like the cubbyholes for keys behind the front desk in oldfashioned hotels there were hundreds and most of them had phones in them the guard noticed the rule applies to all our employees too bond recalled that rené mathis had told him the same thing about hydts london operation that there was virtually no sigint going into or coming out of the company well you have landlines i can use i assume ill have to check my messages there are some but all the lines go through a central switchboard in the security department a guard could make the call for you but you wouldnt have any privacy most visitors wait until after they leave the same is true for email and internet access if you wish to keep anything metal on you well have to xray it i should tell you im armed yes as if many people coming to visit green way were of course ill have to hand in my weapon too thats right bond silently thanked felicity willing for filling him in on hydts security otherwise he would have been caught with one of q branchs standardissue video or still surveillance cameras in a pen or jacket button which would have shattered his credibility and probably led to a fullon fight playing the tough mercenary he scoffed at the inconvenience but handed over his gun and phone programmed to reveal only information about his gene theron cover identity should anyone try to crack it then he stripped off his belt and watch placed them and his keys in a tray for the xray he strode through quickly and was reunited with his possessions after the guard had checked that the watch keys and belt held no cameras weapons or recording devices wait here please sir the security man said bond sat where indicated the inhaler was still in his pocket if they had frisked him found and dismantled the device they would have discovered it was in fact a sensitive camera constructed without a single metal part one of sanu hiranis contacts in cape town had managed to find or assemble the device that morning the shutter was carbon fibre as were the springs operating it the imagestorage medium was quite interesting unique nowadays oldfashioned microfilm the sort spies had used during the cold war the camera had a fixedfocus lens and bond could snap a picture by pressing the base then twisting it to advance the film it could take thirty pictures in this digital age the cobwebbed past occasionally offered an advantage bond looked for a sign to research and development which he knew from stephan dlamini contained at least some information about gehenna but there was none he sat for five minutes before severan hydt appeared in silhouette but unmistakable the tall stature the massive head framed with curly hair and beard the welltailored suit he paused looming in the doorway theron his black eyes bored into bonds they shook hands and bond tried to ignore the grotesque sensation he experienced as hydts long nails slid across his palm and wrist come with me hydt said and led him into the main office building which was much less austere than the outside suggested indeed the place was rather nicely appointed with expensive furniture art antiques and comfortable work spaces for the staff it seemed like a typical mediumsized company the front lobby was furnished with the obligatory sofa and chairs a table with trade magazines and a cape town newspaper on the walls there were pictures of forests rolling fields of grain and flowers streams and oceans and everywhere that eerie logo the leaf that looked like a knife as they walked along the corridors bond kept an eye open for the research and development department finally towards the rear of the building he saw a sign pointing to it and he memorised the location but hydt turned the other way come along were going for the fiftyrand tour at the back of the building bond was handed a darkgreen hard hat hydt donned one too they walked to a rear door where bond was surprised to see a second security post curiously workers coming intothe building from the rubbish yard were checked hydt and he stepped outside on to a patio overlooking scores of low buildings lorries and forklift trucks moved in and out of each one like bees at a hive workers in hard hats and uniforms were everywhere the sheds in neat rows like barracks reminded bond again of a prison or concentration camp arbeit macht frei this way hydt called loudly striding through a landscape cluttered with earthmoving equipment skips oil drums pallets holding bales of paper and cardboard low rumblings filled the air and the ground seemed to quiver as if huge underground furnaces or machines were at work a counterpoint to the highpitched shrieks of the seagulls that swooped in to pick up scraps in the wake of the lorries entering through a gate a quartermile to the east ill give you a brief lesson in the business he offered bond nodded please there are four ways to rid ourselves of discard dump it somewhere out of the way in tips or landfill now mostly but the oceans still popular did you know that the pacific has four times as much plastic in it as zooplankton the biggest rubbish tip in the world is the great pacific garbage patch circulating between japan and north america its at least twice the size of texas and could be as big as the entire united states nobody actually knows but one thing iscertain its getting bigger the second way is to burn discard which is very expensive and can produce dangerous ash third you can recycle it thats green ways area of expertise finally theres minimising which means making sure that fewer disposable materials are created and sold youre familiar with plastic water bottles of course theyre a lot thinner now than they used to be bond took his word for it its called lightweighting much easier to compact you see generally the products themselves arent the problem when it comes to discard its packagingthat causes most of the volume discard was easily handled until we shifted to a consumer manufacturing society and started to massproduce goods how to get the products into the hands of the people encase it in polystyrene foam put that in a cardboard box and then for gods sake put thatin a plastic carrier bag to take home with you ah and if its a present lets wrap it up in coloured paper and ribbon christmas is an absolute hurricane of discard standing tall looking over his empire hydt continued most waste plants extend over fifty to seventyfive acres ours here is a hundred i have three others in south africa and dozens of transfer stations where the carters the lorries you see on the streets take all the discard for compacting and shipment to treatment depots i was the first to set up transfer stations in the south african squatters camps in six months the countryside was sixty to seventy per cent cleaner plastic carrier bags used to be called south africas national flower not any more ive dealt with that i saw the lorries bringing rubbish from pretoria and port elizabeth to the yard here why from so far away specialised material hydt said dismissively were those substances particularly dangerous bond wondered his host continued but you must get your vocabulary right theron we call wet discard garbage leftover food for instance trash means dry materials like cardboard and dust and tins what the bin collectors pick up from in front of homes and offices is municipal solid waste or msw thats also called refuse or rubbish c and d is construction and demolition debris institutional commercial and industrial waste is ici the most inclusive term is waste but i prefer discard he pointed east to the rear of the plant everything thats not recyclable goes there to the working face of the landfill where its buried in layers of plastic lining to keep bacteria and pollution from leaching into the ground you can spot it by looking for the birds bond followed his gaze towards the swooping gulls we call the landfill disappearance row hydt led bond to the doorway of a long building unlike the other work sheds here this one had imposing doors which were sealed bond peered through the windows workers were disassembling computers hard drives tvs radios pagers mobile phones and printers there were bins overflowing with batteries light bulbs computer hard drives printed circuit boards wires and chips the staff were wearing more protective clothing than any other employees respirators heavy gloves and goggles or full face masks our ewaste department we call this area silicon row ewaste accounts for more than ten per cent of the deadly substances on earth heavy metals lithium from batteries take computers and mobiles they have a life expectancy of two or three years at most so people just throw them out have you ever read the warning booklet that comes with your laptop or phone dispose of properly not really of course not no one does but pound for pound computers and phones are the most deadly waste on earth in china they just bury or burn them theyre killing their population by doing that im starting a new operation to address this situation separating the components of computers at my clients companies and then disposing of them properly he smiled in a few years that will be my most lucrative operation bond recalled the device hed seen demonstrated at alfulans the one near to the compactor that had taken yusuf nasads life hydt pointed with a long yellow fingernail and at the back of this building there is the dangerousmaterials recovery department one of our biggest moneymaking services we handle everything from paint to motor oil to arsenic to polonium polonium bond gave a cool laugh this was the radioactive material that had been used to kill the russian spy alexander litvinenko an expatriate in london a few years ago it was one of the most toxic substances on earth its just thrown out that has to be illegal ah but thats the thing about discard theron people throw away an innocentlooking antistatic machine that just happens to contain polonium but nobody knows that he led bond past a car park where several lorries stood each about twenty feet long on the side was the company name and logo along with the words secure document destruction services hydt followed bonds gaze and said another of our specialities we lease shredders to companies and government offices but smaller outfits would rather hire us to do it for them did you know that when the iranian students took over the american embassy in the s they were able to reassemble classified cia documents that had been shredded they learnt the identities of most of the covert agents there local weavers did the work everyone in the intelligence community knew this but bond feigned surprise at green way we perform din industrialstandard levelsix shredding basically our machines turn the documents to dust even the most secret government installations hire us he then led bond to the largest building on the plant three storeys high and two hundred yards long a continuous string of lorries rolled in through one door and came out through another the main recycling facility we call thisarea resurrection row they stepped inside three huge devices were being fed an endless stream of paper cardboard plastic bottles polystyrene scrap metal wood and hundreds of other items the sorters hydt shouted the noise was deafening at the far end the separated materials were being packed into lorries for onward shipment tins glass plastic paper and other materials recyclings a curious business hydt yelled only a few products metals and glass mostly can be recycled indefinitely everything else breaks down after a while and has to be burnt or go to landfill aluminiums the only consistently profitable recyclable most products are far cheaper cleaner and easier to make from raw materials than recycled ones the extra lorries for transporting recycling materials and the recycling process itself add to fossil fuel pollution and remanufacturing uses morepower than the initial production which is a drain on resources he laughed but its politically correct to recycle so people come to me bond followed his tour guide outside and noticed niall dunne approaching on his long legs his gait clumsy and feet turned outward the fringe of blond hair hung down above his blue eyes which were as still as pebbles putting aside the memory of dunnes cruel treatment of the men in serbia and his murder of alfulans assistant in dubai bond smiled amiably and shook his wide hand theron dunne nodded his own visage not particularly welcoming he looked at hydt we should go he seemed impatient hydt motioned for bond to get into a nearby range rover he did so sitting in the front passenger seat he was aware of a sense of anticipation in the two men as if some plan had been made and was now about to unfurl his sixth sense told him something had perhaps gone awry had they discovered his identity had he given something away as the other men climbed in with the unsmiling dunne taking the drivers seat bond reflected that if ever there was a place to dispose of a body clandestinely this was it disappearance row the range rover bounded east along a wide dirt road passing squat lorries with massive ribbed wheels carrying bales or containers of refuse it passed a wide chasm at least eighty feet deep bond looked down the lorries were dropping their loads and bulldozers were compacting them against the face of the landfill site the bottom of the pit was lined with thick dark sheets hydt had been right about the seagulls they were everywhere thousands of them the sheer number the screams the frenzy were unsettling and bond felt a shiver trickle up his spine as they drove on hydt pointed to the flames bond had seen earlier here much closer they were giant spheres of fire he could feel their heat the landfill produces methane he said we drill down and extract it to power the generators though theres usually too much gas and we have to burn some off if we didnt the entire landfill site could blow up that happened in america not too long ago hundreds of people were injured after fifteen minutes they passed through a dense row of trees and a gate bond barked an involuntary laugh the wasteland of the rubbish tips had vanished surrounding them now was an astonishingly beautiful scene trees flowers rock formations paths ponds forest the meticulously landscaped grounds extended for several miles we call it elysian fields paradise after our time in hell and yet its a landfill too underneath us there is nearly a hundred feet of discard weve reclaimed the land in a year or so ill open it to the public my gift to south africans decay resurrected into beauty bond was not an aficionado of botany his customary reaction to the chelsea flower show was irritation at the traffic problems it caused around his home but he had to admit that these gardens were impressive he found himself squinting at some tree roots hydt noticed do they seem a little odd they were metal tubes painted to look like roots those pipes transport the methane generated under here to be burnt off or to the power plants he supposed this detail had been thought up by hydts star engineer they drove on into a grove of trees and parked a blue crane the south african national bird stood regally in a pond nearby perfectly balanced on one leg come on theron lets talk business why here bond wondered as he followed hydt down a path along which small signs identified the plants again he wondered if the men had plans for him and he looked futilely for possible weapons and escape routes hydt stopped and looked back bond did too and felt a jolt of alarm dunne was approaching carrying a rifle bond outwardly remained calm you wear your cover to the grave the lecturers at fort monckton would tell their students you shoot long guns dunne displayed the hunting rifle with its black plastic or carbonfibre stock brushed steel receiver and barrel i do yes bond had been captain of the shooting team at fettes and had won competitions in both small and full bore hed won the queens medal for shooting excellence when in the royal naval reserve the only shooting medal that can be worn in uniform he glanced down at what dunne held winchester good gun wouldnt you agree it is i prefer that calibre to the flatter trajectory hydt asked do you shoot game theron never had much opportunity hydt laughed i dont hunt either except for one species the smile faded niall and i have been discussing you have you now bond asked his tone blasé weve decided you might be a valuable addition to certain otherprojects were working on but we need a show of faith money bond was stalling he believed he understood his enemys purpose here and needed a response fast no hydt said softly his huge head tilting bonds way thats not what i mean dunne stepped forward the winchester on his hip muzzle skyward all right bring him out two workers in security uniforms led a skinny man in a tshirt and shabby khaki trousers from behind a thick stand of jacaranda the mans face was a mask of terror hydt regarded him with contempt he said to bond this man broke into our property and was trying to steal mobile phones from the ewaste operation when he was approached he pulled a gun and shot at a guard he missed and was overpowered ive checked his records and hes an escaped convict in prison for rape and murder i could turn him over to the authorities but his appearance here today has given me and you an opportunity what are you talking about you are being given a chance to make your first kill as a hunter if you shoot this man no the captive cried if you kill him thats all the downpayment i need well proceed with your project and ill hire you to help me with others if you choose not to kill him which i would certainly understand niall will drive you back to the front gate and we will part ways as tempting as your offer is to cleanse the killing fields ill have to decline shoot a man in cold blood dunne said the decisions yours dont shoot him leave the brogue seemed harsher but what a chance this was to get into the inner sanctum of severan hydt bond could learn everything about gehenna one life versus thousands and how many more would die if as seemed likely the event on friday was the first of other such projects he stared at the criminals dark face eyes wide hands shaking at his sides bond glanced at dunne he strode forward and took the rifle no please the man cried the guards shoved him on to his knees and stepped away the man stared at bond who realised for the first time that in firing squads the blindfold wasnt for the condemneds benefit it was for the executioners so they didnt have to look into the prisoners eyes please no sir he cried theres a round in the chamber dunne called safetys on had they slipped a blank in to test him or had dunne not loaded the rifle at all the thief clearly wasnt wearing a bulletproof vest under the thin tshirt bond hefted the gun which had open sights only not telescopic he assessed the thief forty feet away and aimed at him the man raised his hands to cover his face no please you want to move closer hydt asked no but i dont want him to suffer bond said matteroffactly does the rifle shoot high or low at this range i couldnt tell you dunne said bond aimed towards the right at a leaf that was about the same distance as the captive he squeezed the trigger there was a sharp crack and a hole appeared in the centre of the leaf just where he was aiming bond worked the bolt ejecting the spent shell and chambering another still he hesitated whats it to be theron hydt whispered bond lifted the gun aiming steadily at the victim once again there was a moments pause he pulled the trigger another stunning crack and a red dot blossomed in the middle of the mans tshirt as he fell backwards into the dust so bond snapped opening the rifles bolt and tossing the weapon to dunne are you satisfied the irishman easily caught the weapon in his large hands he remained as impassive as ever he said nothing hydt however seemed pleased he said good now let us go to the office and have a drink to celebrate our partnership and to allow me to apologise to you for forcing me to kill a man no for forcing you to believeyou were killing a man what william the man bond had shot leapt to his feet with a big grin on his face bond spun towards hydt i wax bullets dunne called police use them in training filmmakers use them in action scenes it was a goddamn test which our friend niall here devised it was a good one and you passed you think im a schoolboy go to hell bond turned and stormed towards the gardens gate wait wait hydt was walking after him frowning were business people this is what we do we must make certain bond spat an obscenity and continued down the path his fists clenching and unclenching urgently hydt said you can keep going but please know theron youre walking away not only from me but from one million dollars which will be yours tomorrow if you stay and there will be much more bond stopped he turned let us go back to the office and talk let us be professional bond looked at the man hed shot who was still grinning happily then he asked hydt a million hydt nodded yours tomorrow bond remained where he was for a moment staring across the gardens which were truly magnificent he walked back to hydt casting a cool glance at niall dunne who was unloading the rifle and cleaning it carefully caressing the metal parts bond tried to keep an indignant look on his face playing the role of offended party and fiction it was for hed figured out about the wax bullets nobody whos fired a gun with a normal load of gunpowder and a lead bullet would be fooled by a wax round which produces far less recoil than a real slug giving a blank round to a soldier in a firing squad is absurd he clearly knows his bullet is not real the minute he shoots a few moments ago bond had been given the clue when the thief covered his eyes people about to be shot dont shield anything with their hands so bond had reflected hes afraid of being blinded not killed that suggested that the bullets were blank or wax hed fired into the foliage to judge the recoil and learnt from the very light kick that these were nonlethal rounds he guessed that the man would earn hazard pay for his efforts hydt seemed to take care of his employees whatever else one could say about him this was confirmed now hydt peeled off some rand and gave them to the man who walked up to bond and pumped his hand hey mister sir you a good shot you got me in a blessed spot look right here he tapped his chest one man shot me down below you know where he was bastard oh that hurt and hurt for days an my lady she complain much in the range rover once more the three men drove in silence back to the plant the beautiful gardens giving way to harrowing disappearance row the cacophony of the gulls the fumes gehenna dunne parked at the main building nodded to bond and told hydt our associates ill meet the flights theyre arriving around nineteen hundred hours ill get them settled and then come back so dunne and hydt would be working into the night did that bode well or badly for any future reconnaissance at green way one thing was clear bond had to get inside research and development now dunne strode away while hydt and bond continued to the building you going to give me a tour here bond asked hydt its warmer and there arent as many seagulls hydt laughed there isnt much to see well just go to my office he didnt however spare his new partner the procedures at the backdoor security post though the guards missed the inhaler again as they stepped into the main corridor bond noted again the sign to research and development he lowered his voice well i wouldnt mind a tour of the toilet that way hydt pointed then pulled out his mobile to make a call bond walked quickly down the corridor he entered the empty mens room grabbed a large handful of paper towels and tossed them into one of the toilets when he flushed the paper jammed in the drain he went to the door and looked towards where hydt was waiting the mans head was down and he was concentrating on his call there was no cctv bond saw so he walked away from hydt planning his cover story oh one cubicle was occupied and the other was jammed so i went for another one didnt want to bother you when you were on the phone plausible deniability bond remembered where hed seen the sign when hed entered he now hurried down a deserted hallway research and development restricted the metal security door was operated by a number pad in conjunction with a key card reader bond palmed the inhaler and took several pictures including closeups of the pad come on he urged an unsuspecting confederate inside the room someone must be thinking about a visit to the loo or fetching some coffee from the canteen but no one cooperated the door remained shut and bond decided he had to get back to hydt he turned on his heel and hurried down the corridor again thank god hydt was still on his mobile he looked up when bond was past the bathroom door to hydts mind he had just exited he disconnected come this way theron he led bond down a corridor and into a large room that seemed to serve as both an office and living quarters a huge desk faced a picture window with a view of hydts wasteland empire a bedroom curiously was off to the side bond noticed that the bed was unmade hydt diverted him away from it and closed the door he gestured bond to a sofa and coffeetable in a corner drink whisky scotch not a blend auchentoshan bond knew the distillery outside glasgow good a drop of water hydt tipped a generous quantity into a glass added the water and handed it to him he poured himself a glass of south african constantia bond knew the honeysweet wine a recently revived version of napoleons favourite drink the deposed emperor had had hundreds of gallons shipped to st helena where he spent his last years in exile he had sipped it on his deathbed the gloomy room was filled with antiques mary goodnight was forever reporting excitedly on bargains shed found in londons portobello road market but none of the items in hydts office looked as if theyd fetch much money there they were scuffed battered lopsided old photographs paintings and basreliefs hung on the walls slabs of stone showed fading images of greek and roman gods and goddesses though bond couldnt tell who they were supposed to be hydt sat and they tipped their glasses towards one another hydt gazed affectionately at the walls most of these have come from buildings my companies demolished to me theyre like relics from the bodies of saints which also interest me by the way i own several though that is a fact no one in rome is aware of he caressed the wineglass whatever is old or discarded gives me comfort i couldnt tell you why nor do i care to know i think theron most people waste far too much time wondering why they are as they are accept your nature and satisfy it i love decay decline the things others shun he paused then asked would you like to know how i got started in this business its an informative story yes please i had some difficult times in my youth ah who didnt of course but i was forced to start work young it happened to be at a rubbish collection company i was a london binman one day my mates and i were having tea taking a break when the driver pointed to a flat over the road he said thats where one of those blokes with the clerkenwell crowd lives clerkenwell perhaps the biggest and most successful organisedcrime syndicate in british history it was now largely dismantled but for twenty years its members had brutally ruled their turf around islington they were reportedly responsible for twentyfive murders hydt continued his dark eyes sparkling i was intrigued after tea we continued on our rounds but without the others knowing i hid the rubbish from thatflat nearby i went back at night and collected the bag brought it home and went through it i did that for weeks i examined every letter every tin every bill every condom wrapper most of it was useless but i found one thing that was interesting a note with an address in east london here was all it said but i had an idea what it meant now in those days i was supplementing my income as a detectorist you know about them those folks who walk along the beach at brighton or eastbourne and find coins and rings in the sand after the tourists have gone for the day i had a good metal detector and so the next weekend i went to the property mentioned in the note as id expected it was a vacant lot hydt was animated enjoying himself it took me ten minutes to find the buried gun i bought a fingerprint kit and though i was no expert it seemed that the prints on the gun and the note matched i didnt know exactly what the gun had been used for but but why bury it if it hadnt been used to murder somebody exactly i went to see the clerkenwell man i told him that my solicitor had the gun and the note there was no solicitor of course but i bluffed well i said if i didnt call him in an hour he would send everything to scotland yard was it a gamble of course but a calculated one the man blanched and immediately asked me what i wanted i named a figure he paid in cash i was on my way to opening a small collection company of my own it eventually became green way that gives a whole new meaning to the word recycling doesnt it indeed hydt seemed amused by the comment he sipped his wine and gazed out at the grounds the spheres of the burnoff flames glowing in the distance did you know that there were three manmade phenomena you could see from outer space the great wall of china the pyramids and the old fresh kills landfill in new jersey bond did not to me discard is more than a business hydt said its a window on to our society and into our souls he sat forward you see we may acquiresomething in life unintentionally through a gift neglect inheritance fate error greed laziness but when we discard something its almost always with cold intent he took a judicious sip of wine theron do you know what entropy is no i dont entropy said hydt clicking his long yellow nails is the essential truth of nature its the tendency towards decay and disorder in physics in society in art in living creatures in everything its the path to anarchy he smiled that sounds pessimistic but it isnt its the most wonderful thing in the world you can never go wrong by embracing the truth and truth it is his eyes settled on a basrelief i changed my name you know i didnt bond said thinking maarten holt i changed it because my surname was my fathers and my given name was selected by him i wished to have no more connection with him a cool smile that childhood i mentioned i chose hydt because it echoed the dark side of the protagonist in dr jekyll and mr hyde which id read at school and enjoyed you see i believe we all have a public side and a dark side the book confirmed that and severan its unusual you wouldnt think so if youd lived in rome in the second and third centuries ad no i read history and archaeology at university mention ancient rome theron and most people think of what the julioclaudian line of emperors augustus tiberius caligula claudius and nero at least they think so if they read i claudiusor saw derek jacobi in brilliant form on the bbc but that whole line lasted a pathetically short time slightly over a hundred years yes yes mare nostrum praetorian guards films staring russell crowe all very decadent and dramatic my god caligula thats your sister but for me the truth of rome was revealed much later in a different family line the severan emperors founded by septimius severus many years after nero killed himself you see they presided over the decayof the empire their reign culminated in what historians called the period of anarchy entropy bond said exactly hydt beamed id seen a statue of septimius severus and i look a bit like him so i took his family name he focused on bond are you feeling uneasy theron dont worry you havent signed on with ahab im not mad bond laughed i wasnt thinking you were honestly i was thinking about the million dollars you mentioned of course he studied bond closely tomorrow the first of a number of projects im engaged in will come to fruition my main partners will be here you will come too then youll see what were about for a million what do you want me to do he frowned shoot somebody with realbullets hydt fondled his beard again he did indeed resemble a roman emperor you dont need to do anything tomorrow that project is finished well just be watching the results and celebrating i hope well call your million a signature bonus after that youll be very busy bond forced himself to smile im pleased to be included just then hydts mobile rang he looked at the screen rose and turned away bond guessed there was some difficulty hydt didnt get angry but his stillness indicated he wasnt happy he disconnected im sorry a problem in paris inspectors trade unions its a green way issue nothing to do with tomorrows project bond didnt want to make the man suspicious so he backed off all right what time do you want me ten am recalling the original intercept that gchq had decrypted and the clues hed found up in march about the time the attack would take place bond understood he would have about twelve hours to find out what gehenna was about and stop it a figure appeared in the doorway it was jessica barnes she wore what seemed to be her typical garb a black skirt and modest white shirt bond had never liked women to wear excessive makeup but he wondered again why she didnt use even the minimum jessica this is gene theron hydt said absently hed forgotten theyd met last night the woman didnt remind him bond took her hand she returned a timid nod then she said to hydt the ad proofs didnt come in they wont be here till tomorrow you can review them then cant you yes but theres nothing more to do here i was thinking id like to go back to cape town somethings come up ill be a few hours maybe more you can wait his eyes strayed to the door behind which bond had seen the bed she hesitated all right a sigh bond said im going back into town i can drive you if you like really its not too much trouble her question however was not directed towards bond but to hydt the man was scrolling through his mobile he looked up good of you theron ill see you tomorrow they shook hands totsiens bond gave the afrikaans farewell which he knew courtesy of the captain bheka jordaan school of language what time will you be home severan jessica asked hydt when i get there he responded absently punching a number into his phone five minutes later jessica and bond were at the front security post where he again passed through the metal detector but before he was reunited with his gun and mobile a guard walked up and said what is that sir i see something in your pocket the inhaler how the hell had he spotted the slight bulge in the windcheater its nothing ill see it please im not stealing anything from a junkyard he snapped if thats what youre thinking patiently the man said our rules are very clear sir ill see it or i have to call mr dunne or mr hydt follow your cover to the grave with a steady hand bond withdrew the black plastic tube and displayed it its medicine is it now the man took the device and examined it closely the camera lens was recessed but to bond seemed all too obvious the guard was about to hand it back but then changed his mind he lifted the hinged cap exposed the plunger and put his thumb on it bond eyed his walther sitting in one of the cubbyholes it was ten feet away and separated from him by the two other guards both armed the guard pressed the plunger and released a fine mist of denatured alcohol into the air near his face sanu hirani of course had created the toy with typical forethought the spray mechanism was real even if the chemical inside was not the camera was located in the lowerpart of the base the smell of the alcohol was strong the guard wrinkled his nose and his eyes were watering as he handed back the device thank you sir i hope you need not take that medicine often it seems quite unpleasant without replying bond pocketed the inhaler and received his weapon and phone he headed towards the front door which opened on to the no mans land between the two fences he was almost outside when an alarm klaxon blared fiercely and lights began to flash bond was a split second away from spinning around dropping into a combat shooting stance and drawing down on priority targets but instinct told him to hold back it was a good thing he did the guards werent even looking at him they had gone back to watching the tv bond glanced casually around the alarm had gone off because jessica exempt from security procedures had come through the metal detector with her handbag and jewellery a guard casually flicked a switch to reset the unit his heartbeat returning to normal bond and jessica continued outside through the next security post and out into the car park filled with curled brown leaves blowing in the light wind bond opened the passenger door of the subaru for her then got into the drivers seat and started the engine they drove along the dusty road towards the n amid the everpresent green way lorries for a while bond said nothing but then subtly he went to work he started with innocuous questions easing her into talking to him did she like to travel which were her favourite restaurants here what was her job at green way then he asked im curious how did you two meet you really want to know tell me i was a beauty queen when i was young really ive never met one before he smiled i didnt do too badly i was in the miss america pageant once but what really she blushed no its silly please go on well once i was competing in new york at the waldorfastoria it was before the pageant and a lot of us girls were in the lobby jackie kennedy saw me and she came up to me and said how pretty she thought i was she glowed with a pride he had not seen in her face that was one of the high points of my life she was my idol when i was a little girl the smile tempered you dont really want to know this do you i asked well you can only go on for so long of course in the pageant world after i stopped the circuit i did some commercials and then infomercials then well those jobs dried up too a few years later my mother passed away i was very close to her and i went through a rough time i got a job as a hostess in a restaurant in new york severan was doing some business nearby and hed come in to meet clients we got to talking he was so fascinating he loves history and hes travelled everywhere we talked about a thousand different things we had such a connection it was very refreshing in the pageants i used to joke that life isnt even skin deep its makeup deep thats all people see makeup and clothes severan saw some depth in me i guess we hit it off he asked for my number and kept calling well i wasnt a stupid woman i was fiftyseven years old no family very little money and here was a handsome man a vital man bond wondered if that meant what he suspected it might satnav instructed him to leave the highway he drove carefully along a congested road the minibus taxis were everywhere tow trucks waited at intersections apparently to be the first at the site of an accident people sold drinks by the roadside impromptu businesses operated from the backs of lorries and vans several were doing a booming trade selling batteries and performing alternator repairs why did that malady plague south african vehicles in particular now that he had broken yet more ice bond asked casually about the meeting tomorrow but she said she knew nothing about it and he believed her frustratingly to bond it seemed that hydt kept her in the dark about gehenna and any other illegal activities he dunne or the company were involved in they were five minutes from their destination the satnav reported when bond said i have to be honest its odd what is just how he surrounds himself with it all all of what jessica asked her eyes on him closely decay destruction well its his business i dont mean his work with green way that i understand im speaking of his personalinterest with the old the used the discarded jessica said nothing for a moment she pointed ahead to a large wooden private residence surrounded by an imposing stone fence thats it the house thats her voice choked and she began to cry bond pulled to the kerb jessica whats the matter i her breathing was coming fast are you all right he reached down and pulled the adjustment lever moving the seat back so he could turn to face her its nothing oh nothing how embarrassing is this bond took her handbag and dug around inside for a tissue he found one and handed it to her thank you she tried to speak then surrendered to her sobs when she had calmed she tilted the rearview mirror towards herself he doesnt let me wear makeup so at least my mascara hasnt run and turned me into a clown doesnt let you what do you mean the confession died on her lips nothing jessica whispered was it something i said im sorry if ive upset you i was just making conversation no no its nothing youve done gene tell me whats wrong his eyes locked with hers she debated a moment i wasnt being honest with you i put on a good show but its all a façade we dont have a connection we never have he wants me she raised her hand oh you dont want to hear this bond touched her arm please im responsible in some way i was just blundering along i feel the fool tell me yes he loves the old the used the discarded me my god no i didnt mean i know you didnt but that iswhat severan wants me for because im part of the downward spiral too im his laboratory for fading for ageing for decay thats all i mean to him he hardly talks to me ever ive got almost no idea what goes on in that mind of his and he has no interest in finding out who i am he gives me credit cards takes me nice places provides for me in return he well he watches me age ill catch him staring at me a new wrinkle here an agespot there thats why i cant wear makeup he leaves the lights on when you know what i mean do you know how humiliating that is for me he knows it too because humiliation is another form of decay she laughed bitterly dabbing her eyes with the tissue and the irony gene the goddamn irony when i was young i lived for beauty pageants nobody cared about who i was inside the judges my fellow contestants even my mother now im old and severan doesnt care about who i am inside either there are times when i hate being with him but what can i do im powerless bond applied a bit more pressure to her arm thats not true youre not powerless at all being older is strength its experience judgement discernment knowing your resources youth is mistake and impulse believe me i know that quite well but without him what could i do where would i go anywhere you could do whatever you wanted youre obviously clever you must have some money some but its not about money its about finding someone at my age why do you need someone spoken like a young man and thats spoken like someone who believes what shes been told rather than thinking for herself jessica gave a faint smile touché gene she patted his hand youve been very kind and i cant believe i had a meltdown with a total stranger please ive got to get inside hell be calling to check up on me she gestured at the house bond drove forward and pulled up to the gate under the watchful eye of a security guard which put to rest his plan to get inside the house and see what secrets lay there jessica gripped his hand in both of hers then climbed out i will see you tomorrow he asked at the plant a faint smile yes ill be there my leash is pretty short she turned and walked quickly through the opening gate then bond shoved the car into first and skidded away jessica barnes vanishing instantly from his thoughts his attention was on his next destination and what would greet him there friend or foe in his chosen profession though james bond had learnt that those two categories were not mutually exclusive all thursday morning all afternoon there had been talk of threats threats from the north koreans threats from the taliban threats from alqaeda the chechnyans the islamic jihad brotherhood eastern malaysia sudan indonesia thered been a brief discussion about the iranians despite the surreal rhetoric issuing from their presidential palace nobody took them too seriously m almost felt sorry for the poor regime in tehran persia had once been such a great empire threats but the actual assault he thought wryly was occurring only now during a tea break at the security conference m disconnected from moneypenny and sat back stiffly in the wellworn gilt drawing room of a building in richmond terrace between whitehall and the victoria embankment it was one of those utterly unremarkable fading structures of indeterminate age in which the sweat work of governing the country was done the impending assault involved two ministers who sat on the joint intelligence committee their heads were now poking through the door side by side bespectacled faces scanning the room until they spotted their target once an image of televisions two ronnies had sidled into his head m could not dislodge it as they strode forward however there was nothing comedic about their expressions miles the older one greeted him sir andrew prefaced the mans surname and those two words were in perfect harmony with his distinguished face and silver mane the other bixton tipped his head whose fleshy dome reflected light from the dusty chandelier he was breathing hard in fact they both were m didnt invite them to do so but they sat anyway upon the edwardian sofa across from the tea tray he longed to remove a cheroot from his attaché case and chew on it but decided against the prop well come straight to the point sir andrew said we know you have to get back to the security conference bixton interjected weve just been with the foreign secretary hes in the chamber at the moment that explained their heaving chests they couldnt have driven up from the house of commons since whitehall from horse guards avenue to just past king charles street had been sealed like a submarine about to dive so that the security conference might meet well securely incident twenty m asked just so bixton said were trying to track down the dg of six as well but this bloody conference he was new to joint intelligence and appeared suddenly to realise perhaps he shouldnt be quite so bluntly birching the rears of those who paid him is bloody disruptive m grumbled filling in he had no problem whipping anyone or anything when it was deserved sir andrew took over he said defence intelligence and gchq are reporting a swell of sigint in afghanistan over the past six hours general consensus is that its to do with incident twenty m asked anything specific to hydt noah or thousands of deaths niall dunne army bases in march improvised explosive devices engineers in dubai rubbish and recycling facilities in cape town m read every signal that crossed his desk or arrived in his mobile phone we cant tell can we bixton answered the doughnut hasnt broken the codes yet gchqs headquarters in cheltenham was built in the shape of a fat ring the encryption packages are brand spanking new which has stymied everyone sigint is cyclical over there m muttered dismissively he had been very very senior at mi and had earned a reputation for unparalleled skill at mining intelligence and more important refiningit into something useful true sir andrew agreed rather too coincidental though that all these calls and emails have popped up just now the day before incident twenty wouldnt you think not necessarily he continued and nobodys turned up anythingthat specifically links hydt to the threat nobody translated to m looked at his wristwatch which had been his sons a soldier with the royal regiment of fusiliers the security meeting was set to resume in a half hour he was exhausted and friday tomorrow would be an even longer session culminating in a tiresome dinner followed by a speech by the home secretary sir andrew noted the lessthansubtle glance at the battered timepiece long story short miles the jic is of the opinion that this severan hydt fellow in south africas a diversion maybe hes involved but hes not a key player in incident twenty five and sixs people think the real actors are in afghanistan and thats where the attack will happen military or aid workers contractors of course that was what they would say whatever they actually thought the adventure in kabul had cost billions of pounds and far too many lives the more evil that could be found there to justify the incursion the better m had been aware of this from the beginning of the incident twenty operation now bond hes good we know that bixton interrupted eyeing the chocolate biscuits m had asked not to be brought with the tea but had arrived anyway sir andrew frowned its just that he hasnt actually found much bixton went on unless thereve been details that havent yet circulated m said nothing merely regarding both men with equal frost sir andrew said bond isa star of course so the thinking is that it would be good for everybody if he deployed to kabul post haste tonight if you could make that work put him in a hot zone along with a couple of dozen of sixs premierleague lads well tap the cia too we dont mind spreading the glory and the blame thought m if they get it wrong bixton said makes sense bond was stationed in afghanistan m said incident twentys supposed to happen tomorrow itll take him all night to get to kabul how can he stop anything happening the thinking is sir andrew fell silent realising m supposed that hed repeated his own irritating verbal filler we arent sure it canbe stopped silence washed in unpleasantly like a tide polluted with hospital waste our approach would be for your man and the others to head up a postmortem analysis team try to find out for certain who was behind it put together a response proposal bond could even head it up m knew of course what was happening here the two ronnies were offering the odg a facesaving measure your organisation could be a star ninetyfive per cent of the time but if you erred even once with a big loss you might appear at the office on monday morning and find your whole outfit disbanded or worse turned into a vetting agency and the overseas development group was on thin ice to start with hosting as it did the section to which many people objected to stumble on incident twenty would be a big stumble indeed by getting bond to afghanistan forthwith at least the odg would have a player in the game even if he arrived on the pitch a bit late m said evenly your point is noted gentlemen let me make some phone calls bixton beamed but sir andrew hadnt quite finished his persistence infused with shrewdness was one of the reasons m believed that future audiences with him might take place at downing street bond will be allhandsondeck the threat implicit in the question was that if remained in south africa in defiance of ms orders sir andrews protection of bond m and the odg would cease the irony in giving an agent like carte blanchewas that he was supposed to exercise it and act as he saw fit which sometimes meant he would notbe on deck with all of the other hands you cant have it both ways m reflected as i said ill make some calls good wed better be off as they departed m stood up and went through the french doors on to the balcony where he noted a metropolitan police specialist protection officer armed with a machine gun after an examination of and a nod to the new arrival on his turf the man returned to looking down over the street thirty feet below all quiet m asked yes sir m walked to the far end of the balcony and lit a cheroot sucking the smoke in deep the streets were eerily quiet the barricades were not just the tubular metal fences you saw outside parliament they were cement blocks four feet high solid enough to stop a speeding car the pavements were patrolled by armed guards and m noted several snipers on the roofs of nearby buildings he gazed absently down richmond terrace towards victoria embankment he took out his mobile and called moneypenny only a single ring before she answered yes sir i need to talk to the chief of staff hes popped down to the canteen ill connect you as he waited m squinted and gave a gruff laugh at the intersection near the barricade there was a large lorry and a few men were dragging bins to and from it they were employees of severan hydts company green way international he realised hed been watching them for the past few minutes yet not actually noticing them theyd been invisible tanner here sir the dustmen vanished from ms thoughts he plucked the cheroot from between his teeth and said evenly bill i need to talk to you about guided by satnav bond made his way through central cape town past businesses and residences he found himself in an area of small brightly coloured houses blue pink red and yellow tucked under signal hill the narrow streets were largely cobbled it reminded him of villages in the caribbean with the difference that here careful arabic designs patterned many homes he passed a quiet mosque it was six thirty on this cool thursday evening and he was en route to bheka jordaans house friend or foe he wound the car through the uneven streets and parked nearby she met him at the door and greeted him with an unsmiling nod she had shed her work clothing and wore blue jeans and a closefitting dark red cardigan her shiny black hair hung loose and he was taken by the rich aura of lilac scent from a recent shampooing this is an interesting area he said nice its called bokaap it used to be very poor mostly muslim immigrants from malaysia i moved here with well with someone years ago it was poorer then now the place is becoming very chic there used to be only bicycles parked outside now its toyotas but soon itll be mercedes i dont like that id rather it was as it used to be but its my home besides my sisters and i take turns to have ugogo living with us and theyre close so its convenient ugogo bond asked it means grandmother our mothers mother my parents live in pietermaritzburg in kwazulunatal some way east of here bond recalled the antique map in her office so we look after ugogo thats the zulu way she didnt invite him in so on the porch bond gave her an account of his trip to green way i need the film in this developed he handed her the inhaler its eightmillimetre iso is twelve hundred can you sort it me not your mi associate she asked acerbically bond felt no need to defend gregory lamb i trust him but he raided my minibar of two hundred rands worth of drink id like somebody with a clear head to handle it developing film can be tricky ill take care of it now hydt has some associates coming into town tonight theres a meeting at the green way plant tomorrow morning he thought back to what dunne had said theyre arriving at about seven can you find out their names do you know the airlines no but dunnes meeting them well put a stakeout in place kwalene is good at that he jokes but hes very good he certainly is discreet too bond reflected a womans voice called from inside jordaan turned her head ize balulekile some more zulu words were exchanged jordaans face was still will you come in so ugogo can see youre not someone in a gang ive told her its no one but she worries no one bond followed her into the small flat which was tidy and nicely furnished prints hangings and photos decorated the walls the elderly woman whod spoken to jordaan was sitting at a large dining table set with two places the meal had largely concluded she was very frail bond recognised her as the woman in many of the pictures in jordaans office she wore a loose orange and brown frock and slippers her grey hair was short she started to rise no please bond said she stood anyway and hunched shuffled forward to shake his hand with a firm dry grip you are the englishman bheka spoke of you dont look so bad to me jordaan glared at her the older woman introduced herself im mbali james i am going to rest bheka give him some food hes too thin no i must be going you are hungry i saw how you looked at the bobotie it tastes even better than it looks bond smiled he hadbeen looking at the pot on the stove my granddaughter is a very good cook you will like it and you will have some zulu beer have you ever had any ive had birkenhead and gilroys no zulu beer is the best mbali shot a look at her granddaughter give him some beer and he will have some food too bring him a plate of bobotie and sambalsauce she looked critically at bond you like spice i do yes good exasperated jordaan said ugogo he said he has to be going he said that because of you give him some beer and some food look how thin he is honestly ugogo thats my granddaughter a mind of her own the old woman picked up a ceramic crock of beer and walked into a bedroom the door closed is she well bond asked cancer im sorry shes doing better than expected shes ninetyseven bond was surprised i would have thought she was in her seventies as if afraid of the silence that might engender the need for conversation jordaan strode to a battered cd player and loaded a disc a womans low voice buoyed by hiphop rhythms burst from the speakers bond saw the cd cover thandiswa mazwai sit down jordaan said gesturing at the table no its all right what do you mean no its all right you dont have to feed me jordaan said shortly if ugogo learns i havent offered you any beer or bobotie she wont be happy she produced a clay pot with a rattan lid and poured some frothy pinkish liquid into a glass so thats zulu beer yes homemade zulu beer is always homemade it takes three days to brew and you drink it while its still fermenting bond sipped it was sour yet sweet and seemed low in alcohol jordaan then served him a plate of bobotieand spooned on some reddish sauce it was a bit like shepherds pie with egg instead of potato on top but better than any pie bond had ever had in england the thick sauce was well flavoured and indeed spicy youre not joining me bond nodded towards an empty chair jordaan was standing leaning against the sink arms folded across her voluptuous chest ive finished eating she said the words clipped she remained where she was friend or foe he finished the food i must say youre quite talented a clever policewoman who also makes marvellous beer and a nod at the cooking pot bobotie if im pronouncing that right he received no response did he insult her with every remark he made bond tamped down his irritation and found himself regarding the many photographs of the family on the walls and mantelpiece your grandmother must have seen a great deal of history in the making glancing affectionately at the bedroom door she said ugogo issouth africa her uncle was wounded at the battle of kambula fighting the british a few months after the battle i told you about isandlwana she was born just a few years after the union of south africa was formed from the cape and natal provinces she was relocated under apartheids group areas act in the fifties and she was wounded in a protest in what happened the sharpeville massacre she was among those protesting against the dompas the dumb pass it was called under apartheid people were legally classified as white black coloured or indian bond recalled gregory lambs comments blacks had to carry a passbook signed by their employer allowing them to be in a white area it was humiliating it was horrible there was a peaceful protest but the police fired on the demonstrators nearly seventy people were killed ugogo was shot her leg thats why she limps jordaan hesitated and at last poured herself some beer then sipped ugogo gave me my name that is she told my parents what they would call me and they did one usually does what ugogo says bheka bond said in zulu it means one who watches over people a protector so you were destined to become a policewoman bond was quite enjoying the music ugogo is the old south africa im the new a mix of zulu and afrikaner they call us a rainbow country yes but look at a rainbow and you still see different colours all separate we need to become like me blended together it will be a long time before that happens but it will she glanced coolly at bond then well be able to dislike people for who they really are not for the colour of their skin bond returned her gaze evenly and said thank you for the food and the beer i should be going she walked with him to the door he stepped outside which was when he caught his first clear glimpse of the man whod pursued him from dubai the man in the blue jacket and the gold earring the man who had killed yusuf nasad and had very nearly killed felix leiter he was standing across the road in the shadows of an old building covered with arabic scrolls and mosaics what is it jordaan asked a hostile the man had a mobile but wasnt making a call he was taking a picture of bond with jordaan proof that bond was working with the police bond snapped get your weapon and stay inside with your grandmother he sprinted hard across the street as the man fled up a narrow alley leading towards signal hill through the deepening dusk the man had a tenyard lead but bond began closing the distance as they pounded up the alley angry cats and scrawny dogs fled a child with round malaysian features stepped out of a door into bonds path and was instantly jerked back by a parental hand he was nearly fifteen feet from the assailant when operational instinct kicked in bond realised that the man might have prepared a trap to aid his escape he glanced down yes the attacker had strung a piece of wire across the alley a foot off the ground nearly invisible in the darkness the man himself had known where it was a shard of broken crockery marked the spot and had stepped over it smoothly bond wasnt able to stop in time but he could prepare himself for the fall he twisted his shoulder forward and when his own momentum swept his legs out from under him he half somersaulted on to the ground he landed hard and lay dazed for a moment cursing himself for letting the man get away except that he wasnt escaping the wire hadnt been intended to hinder pursuit but to render bond vulnerable in an instant the man was on him exuding the stench of beer stale cigarette smoke and unwashed flesh and ripping bonds walther from the holster bond launched himself upwards gripping the mans right arm in a lock and twisting his wrist until the weapon fell to the ground the attacker kicked the gun which flew far from bonds reach gasping bond kept hold of the mans right arm and dodged vicious blows from his other fist he glanced back wondering if bheka jordaan had ignored his advice and come after him armed with her own weapon the empty alley gaped at him now his assailant eased back to deliver a forehead blow but as bond twisted to avoid it the man rolled away in a virtual backward somersault like a gymnast it was a brilliant feint bond recalled felix leiters words man the sob knows some martial arts crap then bond was on his feet facing the man who stood in a fighters stance a knife in his hand blade protruding downwards sharp edge facing out his left hand open and palm down floated distractingly ready to grab bonds clothing and pull him in to be stabbed to death on the balls of his feet bond circled ever since his days at fettes in edinburgh he had practised various types of close combat but the odg taught its agents a rare style of unarmed fighting borrowed from a former or not so former enemy the russians an ancient martial art of the cossacks systemahad been updated by the spetsnaz the special forces branch of gru military intelligence systemapractitioners rarely use their fists open palms elbows and knees are the main weapons the goal though is to strike as infrequently as possible rather you tire out your adversary then catch him in a comeon or takedown hold on the shoulder wrist arm or ankle the best systemafighters never come into contact with their opponent at all until the final moment when the exhausted attacker is largely defenceless then the victor takes him to the ground and drops a knee into his chest or throat instinctively falling into systemachoreography bond now dodged the mans assault evade evade evade use his energy against him bond was largely successful but twice the knife blade swept inches from his face the man moved in fast swinging his massive hands testing bond who stepped aside sizing up his opponents strengths he was very muscular and experienced in handtohand combat and was psychologically prepared to kill and his weaknesses alcohol and smoking seemed to be taking their toll the man grew frustrated at bonds defence now he gripped the knife for thrusting and began to move in almost desperate he was grinning demonically sweating despite the chill in the air presenting a vulnerable target his lower back bond stepped towards his walther but the move was a feint and even before the man lunged bond reared back pushed the knife blade away with his forearm and delivered a fierce openpalm slap to the mans left ear he cupped his hand as he made contact and felt the pressure that would damage if not burst the attackers ear drum the man howled in pain infuriated and lunged carelessly bond easily lifted the knife arm away and up then stepped in gripping the wrist in both hands a solid compliance hold and bent backwards until the knife fell to the ground he assessed the assailants strength and his mad determination he made a decision and he twisted further until the wrist cracked the man cried out and sank to his knees then dropped into a sitting position face pale his head lolled to the side and bond kicked the knife away he frisked the man carefully and took a small automatic pistol from his pocket along with a roll of duct tape a pistol why didnt he just shoot me bond wondered he slipped the gun into his pocket and collected his walther he grabbed the mans phone to whom had he texted the photo of him and jordaan if it had been to dunne alone could bond find and incapacitate the irishman before he reported to hydt he scrolled through the call and text logs thank god he had sent nothing hed simply been videoing bond what was the point of that then he had his answer jebi ti his attacker spat the balkan obscenity explained everything bond went through the mans papers and confirmed he was with the jso the serbian paramilitary group his name was nicholas rathko he was moaning now cradling his arm you let my brother die you abandoned him he was your partner on that assignment you neverabandon your partner rathkos brother had been the younger of the bia agents with bond on sunday night near novi sad my brother he smokes all time he is out on operations looks more normal thannot smoking in serbia bond knew now how the man had found him in dubai to secure the bias cooperation in serbia the odg and six had given the senior security people in belgrade bonds real name and mission after his brother had died rathko and his comrades at the jso would have put together a fullscale operation to find bond using contacts through nato and six theyd learnt bond was bound for dubai of course bond now realised it had been rathko not osbornesmith whod been making those subtle inquiries at mi about bonds plans earlier in the week among rathkos papers he now found authorisation for a flight by military jet from belgrade to dubai which explained how hed beaten bond to the emirate a local mercenary the documents revealed had put an untraceable car the black toyota at the jso agents disposal and the purpose probably not arrest and rendition rathko had most likely been planning to video bond confessing or apologising or perhaps to record his torture and death you call yourself nicholas or nick bond asked crouching yebie se was the only response listen to me im sorry your brother lost his life but he had no business being in the bia he was careless and he wouldnt follow orders he was the reason we lost the target he was young thats no excuse it wouldnt be an excuse for me and it wasnt an excuse for you when you were with arkans tigers he was only a boy tears glistened in the mans eyes whether from the pain of the broken wrist or the sorrow he felt for his dead brother bond couldnt tell bond looked down the alleyway and saw bheka jordaan and some saps officers sprinting towards him he bent down picked up the mans knife and sliced through the trip wire he squatted beside the serb well get you to a doctor then he heard a womans voice call sharply stop he glanced at bheka jordaan its all right i have his weapons but then he realised that her pistol was aimed at himself he frowned and stood up leave him alone she snapped two saps officers stepped between bond and rathko one hesitated then carefully took the knife from his hand hes a serbian intelligence agent he was trying to kill me hes the one who murdered that cia asset in dubai the other day that doesnt mean you can cut his throat her dark eyes were narrow with anger what are you talking about you are in my country you will obey the law the other officers were staring at him bond saw some angrily he glanced at jordaan and stepped away gesturing to her to follow jordaan did so and when they were out of earshot she continued harshly you won he was down he wasnt a threat why were you going to kill him i wasnt he said i dont believe you you told me to stay in the house with my grandmother you didnt ask me to call my officers because you didnt want witnesses while you tortured and killed him i assumed youd call for backup i didnt want you to leave your grandmother in case he wasnt working alone but jordaan wasnt listening she raged you come here to our country with that double number of yours oh i know all about what you do finally bond understood the source of her anger with him it had nothing to do with any attempted flirtation nothing to do with the fact that he represented the oppressive male she despised his shameless disregard for the law the level missions assassinations for the odg he stepped forward and said in a low murmur barely able to control his anger in a few instances when theres been no other way to protect my country yes ive taken a life and only if ive been ordered to i dont do it because i want to i dont enjoy it i do it to save people who deserve to be saved you may call it a sin but its a necessary sin there was no need to kill him she spat back i wasnt going to the knife i saw he left a trap the trip wire he gestured i cut it so nobody would fall as for him he nodded towards the serb i was just telling him wed get him to a doctor ask him i rarely take someone to hospital when im about to murder them he turned and pushed past the two police officers blocking his way his eyes defied them to try and stop him without looking back he called ill need that film developed as soon as possible and the ids of everyone coming to hydts tomorrow he strode away from them down the alley soon he was in the subaru streaking past the colourful houses of bokaap driving far faster than was safe through the winding picturesque streets a restaurant featuring local cuisine beckoned and james bond still angry from his runin with bheka jordaan decided he needed a strong drink hed enjoyed the stew at jordaans house but the portion was rather small as if doled out with the intent that the diner finish quickly and depart bond now ordered a hearty meal of sosaties grilled meat skewers with yellow rice and marogspinach having politely declined an offer to try the house speciality of mopaneworms he downed two vodka martinis with the food then returned to the table mountain hotel bond had a shower dried himself and dressed there was a knock on the door a porter delivered a large envelope whatever else jordaan had not let her personal view that he was a coldblooded serial killer interfere with the job inside he found blackandwhite prints of the images hed taken with the inhaler camera some were blurred and others had missed their mark but he had managed a clear series of what he was most interested in the door to research and development at green way and its alarm and locking mechanisms jordaan had also been professional enough to provide a flash drive of the scanned pictures and his anger diminished further he loaded them on to his laptop encrypted them and sent them to sanu hirani with a set of instructions thirty seconds after hed hit send he received a message back we never sleep he smiled and texted an acknowledgement a few minutes later he took a call from bill tanner in london i was just about to ring you bond said james tanner sounded grave there was a problem go ahead theres a bit of a flap on here whitehalls come round to thinking that incident twenty doesnt have much of a connection with south africa what they think hydts a diversion the killings in incident twenty are going to be in afghanistan aid workers or contractors they reckon the intelligence committee voted to pull you out and send you to kabul since frankly you havent found much of anything concrete where you are bonds heart was pounding bill im convinced the key hold on tanner interrupted im just telling you what they wanted but m dug his heels in and insisted you stay it turned into trafalgar big and loud we all went to the foreign secretary and pitched the case theres some talk the pm was involved though i cant confirm that anyway m won youre to stay in place and youll be interested to know there was a witness for the defence in your support who your new friend percy osbornesmith bond nearly laughed he said if you had a lead you ought to be allowed to follow it up did he now ill buy him a pint when all this is over you too well things arent as rosy as they seem tanner said glumly the old man put the odgs reputation on the line to keep you there yourreputation too if it turns out hydt isa diversion therell be repercussions serious ones was the very future of the odg riding on his success politics bond reflected cynically he said im sure hydts behind it and ms going with that judgement tanner asked what his next steps would be ill be at hydts plant tomorrow morning depending on what i find im going to have to move fast and communications could be a problem if i cant learn anything by late afternoon ill get bheka jordaan to raid the place interrogate the hell out of hydt and dunne and find out whats planned for tomorrow night all right james keep me informed ill brief m hell be in that security meeting all day night bill and thank him for me after they had rung off he poured a generous amount of crown royal into a crystal glass added two ice cubes and turned off the lights he flung wide the curtains sat on the sofa and gazed out over the snowflake lights on the harbour a massive britishflag cruise ship was easing up to the dock his phone trilled and he glanced at the screen philly he took another sip of the fragrant whisky are you in the middle of dinner its aprèscocktail cocktail hour here you area man after my own heart as she said this bonds eyes happened to be on the bed hed shared last night with felicity willing philly continued i didnt know if you wanted more updates on the steel cartridge operation he sat forward yes please whatve you found something interesting i think seems the whole point of the operation wasnt to kill just anyof our agents and contractors the russians were killing their moles within mi and the cia bond felt something detonate inside him he put his glass down with the fall of the soviet union the kremlin wanted to solidify ties with the west it wouldve been awkward politically if their doubles were exposed so active kgb agents killed the most successful moles in six and the cia and made the murders look like accidents but left a steel cartridge at the scene as a warning to the others to keep quiet thats all i know at this point my god bond thought his father his father had been a double a traitor are you still there yes just a bit distracted by whats going on here but thats good work philly ill be incommunicado for most of tomorrow but text me or email what you find i will take care of yourself james i worry they rang off bond lifted the cold crystal glass wet with condensation and pressed it against his forehead he now scrolled mentally through his familys past trying to find clues about andrew bond that might shed light on this appalling theory bond had been quite fond of his father who was a collector of stamps and photographs of cars hed owned several vehicles but took more pleasure in repairing and cleaning them than in fast driving when older bond had asked his aunt about the man charmian had thought for a moment and said he was a good man of course solid dependable a rock but quiet andrew was never one to stand out qualities of the best covert intelligence agents could he have been a mole for the russians another jarring thought his fathers duplicity if the story were true had resulted in the death of his wife bonds mother too not just the russians but his fathers betrayal had orphaned young bond he started as his phone buzzed with an incoming text late night getting ready for food shipments just left office interested in some company felicity james bond hesitated a moment then he typed yes ten minutes later after slipping his walther under the bed beneath a towel he heard a soft knock he opened the door and let in felicity willing any doubt he might have had about whether or not they would pick up where they left off yesterday was dashed when she flung her arms around him and kissed him hard he smelt her perfume radiating from behind her ear and she tasted of mint im a mess she said laughing she wore a blue cotton shirt tucked into designer jeans which were crumpled and dusty i wont hear of it he said and kissed her again youre sitting in the dark gene she said and for the first time in the operation he was jarred by the reminder of his afrikaner cover i like the view they stepped apart and in the dim light from outside bond took in her face and thought it as intensely sensual as last night but she was clearly tired he supposed the logistics of marshalling the largest shipment of food ever to arrive on the african continent were daunting to say the least here a wine bottle appeared from her shoulder bag vintage three cape ladies a red blend from muldersvlei on the cape bond knew its reputation he took out the cork and poured they sat on the sofa and sipped wonderful he said she worked her boots off bond slipped his arm around her shoulders and struggled to put aside thoughts of his father felicity slumped and rested her head against him on the horizon there were even more ships than there had been last night our food ships look at them all she said you hear so many bad things about people but thats not the complete truth theres a lot of good out there you cant always count on it its never certain but at least bond interrupted at least someones willingto help she laughed you nearly made me spill my wine gene i couldve ruined my shirt i have a solution stop drinking the wine she pouted playfully but its so nice another solution a better one he kissed her and slowly began to undo the buttons of the garment an hour later they lay in bed on their sides bond behind felicity his arm was curled around her and his hand cupped her breast her fingers were entwined in his unlike last night however in the aftermoment bond was wholly awake his mind was racing furiously past all assortment of topics exactly how much was the future of the odg resting on him what secrets did the research and development department of green way hold what exactly was hydts goal with gehenna and how could bond craft a suitable countermeasure purpose response and what of his father youre thinking about something serious felicity said drowsily what makes you say that women know im thinking how beautiful you are she lifted his hand to her face and gently bit his finger the first lie youve told me my job he said then ill forgive you its the same with me coordinating the help on the docks paying the pilots fees working on the ship charters and lorry leases the trade unions her voice took on the edge hed heard before as she said and then yourspeciality weve already had two attempted breakins at the dock and no food has even been offloaded yet odd silence for a moment then gene bond knew something significant was coming he grew alert and receptive the intimacy of bodies comes prepacked with an intimacy of mind and spirit and you ought not seek the first if youre unwilling to take delivery of the second yes she said evenly i have a feeling theres more to your work than youve told me no dont say anything i dont know how you feel but if it turns out we can keep seeing each other if she trailed off go on he whispered if it turns out we see each other again do you think that maybe you could change just a bit i mean if you do go to some dark places could you promise me not to go to the worst he felt the tension that rippled through her oh i dont know what im saying ignore me gene although she was speaking to a security expertcummercenary soldier from durban in a way she was also talking to him james bond a section agent and ironically he took her acknowledgement that she could live with a certain degree of darkness in theron as indication that she might accept bond as he was he whispered i think thats very possible she kissed his hand dont say any more thats all i wanted to hear now i have an idea i dont know what your plans are for this weekend neither do i bond thought sourly but well have finished the food shipments tomorrow night theres an inn i know in franschhoek have you been to that area no its the most beautiful spot on the western cape a wine district the restaurant has a michelin star and the most romantic deck in the world overlooking the hills come with me on saturday id love to he said and kissed her hair you really mean that the tough warrior who seemed so at ease fighting the worlds agropolies now sounded vulnerable and unsure yes i do in five minutes she was asleep bond however remained awake staring out at the lights of the harbour his thoughts were no longer on his fathers possible betrayal nor on his promise to felicity willing to consider changing his darkest nature nor on the anticipation of the time they might spend together this weekend no james bond was focusing on one thing only the indistinct faces of those somewhere in the world whose lives despite whitehalls belief he knew that he alone could save friday down to gehenna at eight forty am bond steered his dusty mudspattered subaru into the cape town saps headquarters car park he killed the engine climbed out and entered the building where he found bheka jordaan gregory lamb and kwalene nkosi in her office bond greeted them with a nod lamb responded with a look that bespoke intrigue nkosi with an energetic smile jordaan said regarding hydts newly arrived associates weve identified them she spun her laptop and clicked on a slideshow the first photos depicted a large man with a round ebony face he wore a brash gold and silver shirt designer sunglasses and voluminous brown slacks charles mathebula hes a black diamond from joburg lamb explained from the new wealthy class in south africa some of them become rich overnight in ways that arent quite transparent if you get my drift and some jordaan added frostily became wealthy by hard work mathebula owns businesses that seem to be legitimate shipping and transport he was on the borderline with some arms deliveries a few years ago true but there was no evidence of wrongdoing a tap of a key and another picture appeared now this is david huang he was slim and smiled at the camera his daughter posted the snapshot on her facebook page stupid girl though good for us a known mobster nkosi qualified a suspected mobster singapore mostly moneylaundering possibly human trafficking another face appeared jordaan tapped her computer screen the german hans eberhard he came in on wednesday mining interests diamonds primarily industrial grade but some jewellery a goodlooking blond man was pictured leaving the airport he was wearing a wellcut light suit a shirt without a tie hes been suspected of various crimes but hes technically clean bond studied the photos of the men eberhard huang mathebula he memorised the names frowning jordaan said i dont understand why hydt needs partners though hes got money enough to fund gehenna himself i should think bond had already considered this two reasons most likely gehenna must be expensive hed want outside money so that if hes ever audited he doesnt have to explain huge liabilities on the books but more important he doesnt have a criminal background or network whatever gehennas about hell need the contacts that people like these three can offer yes jordaan allowed that makes sense bond looked at lamb sanu hirani in q branch texted me this morning he said you had something for me ah yes sorry the six agent handed him an envelope bond peered inside and then pocketed it im going out to the plant now once im inside ill try to find out what incident twenty is whos at risk and where ill get word out as soon as i can but we need a fallback plan if they hadnt heard from him by four pm jordaan should order tactical officers to raid the plant detain hydt dunne and the partners and seize the contents of the research and development department this will give us or you if im no longer in the game five or six hours to interrogate them and find out what incident twentys all about a raid jordaan was frowning i cant do that why not ive told you unless i have reasonable belief that a crime is occurring at green way or a magistrates order theres nothing i can do damn the woman this isnt about preserving his rights for a fair trial this is about saving thousands of people possibly many south africans i can do nothing without a warrant and theres no evidence to present to the court to get one no justification to act if i dont turn up by four you can assume hes killed me obviously i hope that doesnt happen commander but your absence doesnt equal cause ive told you hes willing to dig up the graves of massacre victims and turn them into building materials what more do you want evidence of a crime somewhere in the plant her jaw was set and her eyes black granite it was clear she wouldnt yield bond said sharply then lets hope to god i can find the answer for the sake of several thousand innocent people he nodded to nkosi and lamb and ignoring jordaan left the office he strode downstairs to his car dropped into the drivers seat and fired up the engine james wait turning he saw bheka jordaan walking towards him please wait bond thought about speeding away but instead he rolled the window down yesterday she said bending down close to him the serbian yes i spoke to him he told me what youd said that you were going to get him to a doctor bond nodded after a breath the policewoman added i was making assumptions i sometimes i do that i judge first i try not to but its hard for me to stop i wanted to apologise accepted he said about a raid at green way though you must understand under apartheid the old police the sap and their criminal investigation department did terrible things now everyone watches us the new police to make sure we dont do the same an illegal raid arbitrary arrests and interrogations thats what the old regime did we cannot do the same we must be betterthan the people who came before us her face taut with determination she said ill fight side by side with you if the law permits but without cause without a warrant theres nothing i can do im sorry much of the training of section agents in the group was psychological and part of that arduous instruction was to instil within them the belief that they were different that they were allowed to no requiredto operate outside the law a level project order authorising assassination had to be to james bond just another aspect of his job no different from taking pictures of secret installations or planting misinformation in the press as m had put it bond had to have carte blancheto do whatever was required to fulfil his mission we protect the realm by any means necessary that was part of bonds fabric indeed he couldnt do his job without it and he had to remind himself continually that bheka jordaan and the other hardworking law enforcers of the world were one hundred per cent right in respecting the rules it was hewho was the outlier he said not unkindly i do understand captain and whatever happens its been quite an experience working with you her response was a smile faint and fleeting but bond judged honest the first time that such an expression had warmed her beautiful face in his presence bond skidded the subaru into the car park outside the fortress of green way international and braked to a stop several limousines were lined up close to the gate reduce reuse recycle a few people were milling about bond recognised the german businessman hans eberhard in a beige suit and white shoes he was talking to niall dunne who stood still as a japanese fighting fish the breeze ruffled his blond fringe eberhard was finishing a cigarette perhaps hydt didnt allow anyone to smoke inside the plant which seemed ironic the outside air was bleached with haze and vapours from the power plant and the methane that was being burnt bond waved to dunne who acknowledged him with a blank nod and continued his conversation with the german then dunne pulled his phone off his belt and read a text or email he whispered something to eberhard then stepped away to make a call on the pretence of using his own phone bond loaded the eavesdropping app and lifted it to his ear rolling down the passenger window of his car and aiming it in the direction of the irishman he stared ahead and mouthed to himself so that dunne would not guess a microphone was pointed his way the irishmans conversation was onesided but bond heard him say outside with hans he wanted a smoke i know he was probably speaking to hydt dunne continued were on schedule i just had an email the lorry left march for york should be there any minute the device is already armed so this was incident twenty the attack would take place in york the targets confirmed detonations still scheduled for ten thirty their time dismayed bond noted the time of the attack theyd assumed ten thirty at night but every time dunne had referred to a time hed used the twentyfourhour clock had it been half past ten in the evening he would have said twentytwo thirty dunne looked at bonds car and said into the phone therons here right then he disconnected and called to eberhard that the meeting would start soon then he turned to bond he seemed impatient bond dialled a number please he whispered silently answer then osbornesmith thank god percy its james bond listen carefully i have about sixty seconds ive got the answer to incident twenty youll have to move fast mobilise a team soca five local police the bombs in york york hydts peoplere driving the device in a lorry from march to york its going to detonate later this morning i dont know where theyll plant it maybe a sporting event there was that reference to course so try the racecourse or somewhere theres a big crowd check all the cctvs in and around march get the number plates of as many lorries as you can then compare them to the plates of any lorries arriving in york about now you need to hold on there bond osbornesmith said coolly it has nothing to do with march or yorkshire bond noted the use of his last name and the imperious tone in osbornesmiths voice what are you talking about dunne gestured to him bond nodded struggling to smile amiably did you know hydts companies reclaim dangerous materials well yes but remember i told you he was digging tunnels for some fancy new rubbish collection system under london including around whitehall osbornesmith sounded like a barrister before a witness bond was sweating now but thats not what this is about dunne was acting increasingly impatient his eyes focusing on bond i beg to differ osbornesmith said prissily one of the tunnels isnt far from the security meeting today in richmond terrace your boss mine senior cia six joint intelligence committee its a veritable whos whoof the security world hydt was going to release something nasty that his hazardousmaterials operation had recovered kill everybody his people have been hauling bins in and out of the tunnels and buildings near whitehall for the past several days nobodys thought to check them out bond said evenly percy thats not whats going on hes not going to use green way people directly for the attack its too obvious hed be implicated himself then how do you explain our little find in the tunnels radiation how much bond asked bluntly a pause osbornesmith replied in his petulant lisp about four millirems thats nothing percy all o branch agents were well versed in nuclear exposure statistics every human being on earth gets hit with sixty millirems from cosmic rays alone each year add an xray or two and youre up to two hundred a dirty bombs going to leave more trace than four ignoring him osbornesmith said brightly now about york you misheard it must be the duke of york pub or the theatre in london could be a staging area well check it in the event i cancelled the security meeting moved everyone to secure locations bond ive been thinking about what makes hydt tick ever since i saw he was living in canning town and you told me all about his obsession with thousandyearold dead bodies he revels in decay cities crumbling dunne was now walking slowly forward making directly for the subaru bond said i know percy but what better way to promote social decay than to take down the security apparatus of half the western powers dammit fine do what you want in london but have soca or some teams from five follow up in york we dont have the manpower do we cant spare a soul maybe this afternoon but for now afraid not nothings going to happen till tonight anyway bond explained that the time of the operation had been moved forward a chuckle your irishman prefers the twentyfourhour clock does he bit finetuned that no well stick with my plan this was why osbornesmith had backed ms stand to have bond remain in south africa he hadnt in fact believed bond was on to anything he had simply wanted to steal the thunder bond disconnected and started to dial bill tanner but dunne was at the door yanking it open come on theron youre keeping your new boss waiting you know the drill leave the phone and the gun in the car i thought id check them in with your smiling concierge if it came down to a fight he hoped to be able to pick up his weapon and to communicate with the outside world but dunne said not today bond didnt argue he secured his phone and the walther in the cars glove box joined dunne and locked the car with the key fob as he once again endured the rituals at the security post bond happened to glance at a clock on the wall it was nearly eight am in york he had just over two and a half hours to find out where the bomb was planted the green way lobby was deserted bond supposed hydt or more likely dunne had arranged for the staff to have the day off so that the meeting and the gehenna plans maiden voyage could go forward without interruption severan hydt strode up the hall greeting bond warmly he was in good spirits ebullient even his dark eyes shone theron bond shook his hand ill want you to make a presentation to my associates about the killingfields project itll be their money too thatll fund it now you dont need to do anything formal just outline on a map where the major graves are how many corpses roughly are in each one how long theyve been in the ground and what you think your clients will be willing to pay oh by the way one or two of my partners are in lines of work similar to yours you might know each other the alarming thought now occurred to bond that these men might wonder the opposite why they had notheard of the ruthless durbanbased mercenary gene theron whod seeded the african earth with so many bodies as they walked through the green way building bond asked where he could work hoping that hydt might take him to research and development now that he was a trusted partner we have an office for you but the man led him past the r d department to a large windowless room inside were a few chairs a work table and a desk hed been provided with office supplies like yellow pads and pens dozens of detailed maps of africa and an intercom but no phone corkboards on the walls displayed copies of the pictures that bond had delivered of the decaying bodies he wondered where the originals were in hydts bedroom the ragandbone man asked pleasantly will this do fine a computer would be helpful i could arrange that for word processing and printing no internet access of course no were concerned about hacking and security but for now dont worry about writing anything up formally handwritten notes are enough bond maintained a calm façade as he noted the clock it was now eight twenty in york just over two hours to go well id better get down to it well be up the hall in the main conference room go to the end and turn left number nine hundred join us whenever you like but make sure youre there before half twelve well have something on television i think youll find interesting ten thirty york time after hydt had gone bond bent over the map and drew circles around some of the areas hed arbitrarily picked as battle zones when he and hydt had met at the lodge club he jotted a few numbers signifying the body counts then bundled up the maps a yellow pad and some pens he stepped into the corridor which was empty orienting himself bond went back to research and development tradecraft dictates that simpler is usually the best approach even in a black bag operation like this accordingly bond knocked on the door mr hydt asked me to find some papers for him sorry to bother you ill just be a moment he was prepared to rush the person who opened the door and use a takedown hold on wrist or arm to overpower them prepared for an armed guard too indeed hoping for one so he could relieve the man of his weapon but there was no answer these staff had apparently been given the day off too bond fell back on plan two which was somewhat less simple last night he had uploaded to sanu hirani the digital pictures hed taken of the security door to research and development the head of q branch had reported that the lock was virtually impregnable it would take hours to hack he and his team would try to think up another solution shortly thereafter bond had received word that hirani had sent gregory lamb to scrounge another tool of the trade hed be delivering it that morning along with written instructions on how to open the door this was what the mi agent had handed to bond in bheka jordaans office bond now checked behind him once more then went to work from his inside jacket pocket he took out what lamb had provided a length of poundtest fishing line nylon that wouldnt be picked up by the green way metal detector bond now fed one end through the small gap at the top of the door and continued until it had reached the floor on the other side he ripped a strip of the cardboard backing from the pad of yellow paper and tore it fashioning a j shape a rudimentary hook this he slipped through the bottom gap until he managed to snag the fishing line and pull it out he executed a triple surgeons knot to fix the ends together he now had a loop that encircled the door from top to bottom using a pen he made this into a huge tourniquet and began to tighten it the nylon strand grew increasingly taut compressing the exit bar on the other side of the door finally as hirani had said would most likely happen the door clicked open as if an employee on the inside had pushed the bar to let himself out for the sake of fire safety there could be no number pad lock release on the inside bond stepped into the dim room unwound the tourniquet and pocketed the evidence of his intrusion closing the door till it latched he swept the lights on and glanced around the laboratory looking for phones radios or weapons none there were a dozen computers desk and laptop models but the three he booted up were password protected he didnt waste time on the others discouragingly the desks and work tables were covered with thousands of documents and file folders and none was conveniently labelled gehenna he ploughed through reams of blueprints technical diagrams specification sheets schematic drawings some had to do with weapons and security systems others with vehicles none answered the vital questions of who was in danger in york and where exactly was the bomb then at last he found a folder marked serbia and ripped it open scanning the documents bond froze hardly able to believe what he was seeing in front of him there were photographs of the tables in the morgue at the old british army hospital in march sitting on one was a weapon that theoretically didnt exist the explosive device was unofficially dubbed the cutter mi and the cia suspected the serbian government was developing it but local assets hadnt found any proof that it had actually been built the cutter was a hypervelocity antipersonnel weapon that used regular explosives enhanced with solid rocket fuel to fire hundreds of small titanium blades at close to three thousand miles an hour the cutter was so horrific that even though it was only rumoured to be in development it had already been condemned by the un and human rights organisations serbia adamantly denied that it was building one and nobody even the bestconnected arms dealers had ever seen such a device how the hell had hydt come by it bond continued through the files finding elaborate engineering diagrams and blueprints along with instructions on machining the blades that were the weapons shrapnel and on programming the arming system all written in serbian with english translations this explained it hydt had madeone he had somehow come into possession of these plans and had ordered his engineers to build one of the damn things the bits of titanium bond had found in the fens army base were shavings from the deadly blades and the train in serbia this explained the mystery of the dangerous chemical it had had nothing to do with dunnes mission there he probably hadnt even known about the poison the purpose of his trip to novi sad had been to steal some of the titanium on the train to use it in the device there had been two wagons of scrap metal behind the locomotive thosehad been his target dunnes rucksack hadnt contained weapons or bombs to blow open the chemical drums on rail car three the bag had been emptywhen dunne arrived hed filled it with unique titanium scraps and taken them back to march to make the cutter the irishman had arranged the derailment to make it look like an accident so no one would realise the metal had been stolen but how had dunne and hydt got hold of the plans the serbs would have done all they could to keep the blueprints and specifications secret bond found the answer a moment later in a memo from the dubai engineer mahdi alfulan dated a year ago severan i have looked into your request to see if it is possible to fabricate a system that will reconstruct shredded classified documents im afraid with modern shredders the answer is no but i would propose this i can create an electric eye system that serves as a safety device to prevent injuries when someone tries to reach into a document shredder in fact though it would double as a hyperspeed optical scanner when the documents are fed into the system the scanner reads all the information on them before they are shredded the data can be stored on a or terabyte hard drive hidden somewhere in the shredder and uploaded via a secure mobile or satellite link or even physically retrieved when your employees replace the blades or clean the units i further recommend that you make and offer to your clients shredders that are so efficient they literally turn their documents to dust so that you will instil confidence in them to hire you to destroy even the most sensitive materials in addition i have a plan for a similar device that would extract data from hard drives before they are destroyed i believe its possible to create a machine that would break apart laptop or desktop computers optically identify the hard drive and route it to a special station where the drive would be temporarily connected to a processor in the destruction machine classified information could be copied before the drives were wiped and crushed he recalled his tour of green way and hydts excitement about the automated computer destruction devices in a few years that will be my most lucrative operation bond read on the documentshredder scanners were already in use in every city where green way had a base including at topsecret serbian military facilities and weapons contractors outside belgrade other memos detailed plans to capture less classified but still valuable documents using special teams of green way refuse collectors to gather the rubbish of targeted individuals bring it to special locations and sort through it for personal and sensitive information bond noted the value of this he found copies of creditcard receipts some intact others reconstructed from simple document shredders one bill for instance was from a hotel outside pretoria the card holder had the title right honourable notes attached to it warned that the mans extramarital affair would be made public if he didnt agree to a list of demands an opposing politician was making so such items would be the special materials bond had seen being shipped here in green way lorries there were also pages upon pages of what seemed to be phone numbers along with many other digits screen names pass codes and excerpts of emails and text messages ewaste of course workers in silicon row were looking through phones and computers extracting electronic serial numbers for mobiles passwords banking information texts records of instant messages and who knew what else but the immediate question of course where exactly was the cutter going to be detonated he flipped through the notes again none of the information hed found gave him a clue as to the location of the york bomb which would explode in a little over an hour leaning forward over a work table staring at the diagram of the device his temples throbbed think he told himself furiously think for some minutes nothing occurred to him then he had an idea what was severan hydt doing assembling valuable information from scraps and fragments do the same bond told himself put the pieces of the puzzle together and what scraps do i have the target is in york one message contained the words term and million hydt is willing to cause mass destruction to divert attention from the real crime he intends to commit as with the derailment in serbia the cutter was hidden somewhere near march and has just been driven to york hes being paid for the attack not acting out of ideology he could have used any explosive device but hes gone to great trouble to build a cutter with actual serbian military designations a weapon not available on the general arms market thousands of people will die the blast must have a radius of feet minimum the cutter is to be detonated at a specific time ten thirty am the attack has something to do with a course a road or other route but rearrange these ragged bits as he might bond saw only unrelated scraps well keep at it he raged he focused again on each shred he picked it up mentally and placed it somewhere else one possibility became clear if hydt and dunne had recreated a cutter the forensic teams doing postblast analysis would find the military designations and believe the serbian government or army was behind it since the devices werent yet available on the black market hydt had done this to shift attention away from the real perpetrators himself and whoever had paid him millions of pounds it would be a misdirection just like the planned train crash that meant there were twotargets the apparent one would have some connection to serbia and to the public and police would be the purpose of the attack but the real victim would be someone else caught in the blast an apparent bystander no one would ever know that he or she was the person hydt and his client really wanted to die and thatdeath would be the one that harmed british interests who a government official in york a scientist and goddamn it where specifically would the attack take place bond played with the confetti of information once more nothing but then in his mind he heard a resounding tap term had ended up next to course what if the former didnt refer to a clause in a contract but a period in the academic year and course was just that a course of study that made some sense a large institution thousands of students but where the best bond could come up with was an institution at which there was a course a lecture a rally a museum exhibit or the like involving serbia at half past ten this morning this suggested a university did his reassembled theory hold up there was no time left for speculation he glanced at the digital clock on the wall which advanced another minute in york it was nine forty carrying the killingfields map bond walked casually down a corridor a guard with a massive bulletshaped head eyed him suspiciously the man was unarmed bond saw to his disappointment neither did he have a radio he asked the guard for directions to hydts conference room the man pointed it out bond started to walk away then turned back as if hed just remembered something oh i need to ask ms barnes about lunch do you know where she is the guard hesitated then pointed to another corridor her office is down there the double doors on the left number one oh eight you will knock first bond moved off in the direction indicated in a few minutes he arrived and glanced back no one was in the corridor he knocked on the door jessica its gene i need to talk to you there was a pause shed said shed be here but she might be ill or have felt too tired to come in notwithstanding her short leash then the click of a lock the door opened and he stepped inside jessica barnes alone blinked in surprise gene whats the matter he swung the door shut and his eyes fell on her mobile phone lying on her desk she sensed immediately what was happening her dark eyes wide she went to the desk grabbed the mobile and backed away from him you she shook her head youre a policeman youre after him i shouldve known listen to me oh i get it now yesterday in the car you were what do the brits say chatting me up to get on my good side bond said in fortyfive minutes severans going to kill a lot of people impossible its true thousands are at risk hes going to blow up a university in england i dont believe you hed never do that but she hadnt sounded convinced shed probably seen too many of hydts pictures to deny her partners obsession with death and decay bond said hes selling secrets and blackmailing and killing people because of what he reconstructs from their rubbish he stepped forward his hand out for the phone please she backed further away shaking her head just outside the open window there was a puddle from a recent storm she thrust her hand out and held the mobile over it stop bond did im running out of time please help me interminable seconds passed finally her narrow shoulders slumped she said he has a dark side i used to think it involved just pictures of well terrible pictures his sick love of decay but ive always suspected there was more something worse in his heart he doesnt want to be just a witness to destruction he wants to causeit she stepped away from the window and handed him the phone he took it thank you just then the door flew open the guard whod given bond directions stood there what is this there are no phones for visitors here bond said i have an emergency at home theres an illness in my family i wanted to see about it i asked to borrow ms barness mobile and she was kind enough to say yes thats right she confirmed well i think i will take it i think you wont bond replied there was a heavy pause the man launched himself at bond who tossed the phone on to the desk and went into a systemadefence position the fight began the man had three or four stones on bond and he was talented very talented hed studied kickboxing and aikido bond could counter his moves but it took a lot of effort and manoeuvring was difficult because the office though large was cluttered with furniture at one point the massive guard backed up fast slamming into jessica who screamed and fell to the floor she lay stunned for sixty seconds or so they sparred fiercely bond realising that systemas evasive moves would not be enough his opponent was strong and showed no sign of tiring his eyes focused and fierce the man judged angles and distances and came in with a kick or so it seemed the move was a feint bond had anticipated this though and when the huge man twisted away bond delivered a powerful thrust of his elbow into his kidney a blow that would not only be excruciatingly painful but could permanently damage the organ but bond realised too late the guard had feinted again hed taken the hit intentionally so that now he could do as hed planned and launch himself sideways towards the table where the phone lay he grabbed the nokia snapped it in half and flung the pieces out of the window one skipped across the surface of the water before it sank by the time the man righted himself however bond was on him he dropped systema and went into a classic boxers stance swung a left fist into his opponents solar plexus doubling him over then drew back his right and brought it arching down to a spot below and behind the mans ear the strike was perfectly aimed the guard shivered and went down unconscious he wouldnt be out for long though even with a solid hit like that bond quickly trussed him with lamp cord and gagged him with napkins from a breakfast tray as he did so he turned to jessica who was getting to her feet are you all right he asked yes she whispered breathlessly she ran to the window the phone is gone what are we going to do there arent any others only severan and niall have one and hes closed the switchboard today because the employees are off bond said turn round im going to tie you up itll be tight we have to make them believe you didnt try to help me she held her hands behind her back and he bound her wrists im sorry i tried sssh bond whispered i know you did if someone comes in tell them you dont know where i went just act scared i wont have to act she said then gene he glanced at her my mother and i prayed before every one of my beauty contests i won a lot we mustve prayed pretty well ill pray for you now bond was hurrying down the dim corridor passing photographs of the reclaimed land that hydts workers had turned into elysian fields the beautiful gardens covering green ways landfills to the east it was nine fiftyfive in york the detonation would take place in thirtyfive minutes he had to get out of the plant immediately he was sure thered be an armoury of some kind probably near the front security post that was where he was headed now walking steadily head down carrying the maps and the yellow pad he was about fifty yards from the entrance thinking tactically three men at the security post in front was the rear door guarded too presumably it was although there were no employees in the business office bond had seen workers throughout the grounds three guards had been there yesterday how many other security personnel would be present had any of the visitors handed weapons in or had they all been told to leave them in their cars maybe there you are sir the voice startled him two beefy guards appeared and walked in front of him barring his way their faces revealed no emotion bond wondered if theyd discovered jessica and the man hed trussed up apparently not mr theron mr hydt is looking for you you were not in your office so he sent us to bring you to the conference room the smaller one regarded him with eyes as hard as a black beetles carapace there was nothing for it but to go with them they arrived at the conference room a few minutes later the larger guard knocked on the door dunne opened it examined bond with a neutral face and beckoned the men inside hydts three partners sat around a table the huge darksuited security man whod escorted bond into the plant yesterday stood near the door arms crossed hydt called with the excitement hed exhibited earlier theron how have you been getting on very well but ive not quite finished id say i need another fifteen or twenty minutes he glanced at the door but hydt was like a child yes yes but first let me introduce you to the people youll be working with ive told them about you and theyre eager to meet you i have about ten investors altogether but these are the three main ones as introductions were made bond wondered if anyone of the three would be suspicious that they had not heard of mr theron but mathebula eberhard and huang were distracted by the days business and contrary to hydts comment apart from brief nods they ignored him it was five past ten in york bond tried to leave but hydt said no stay he nodded at the tv which dunne had turned on to sky news in london he lowered the volume youll want to see this our first project let me tell you whats going on here hydt sat down and explained to bond what he already knew that gehenna was about the reconstruction or scanning of classified material for sale extortion and blackmail bond lifted an eyebrow pretending to be impressed another glance at the exits he decided he could hardly bolt for the door the huge security man in the black suit was inches from it so you see theron i was not quite honest with you the other day when i described the green way documentshredding operation but that was before we had our little test with the winchester rifle i apologise bond shrugged it off and measured distances and assessed the strength of the enemy his conclusions were not good with his long yellowing nails hydt raked at his beard im sure youre curious about whats happening today i started gehenna merely to steal and sell classified information but then i grasped there was a more lucrative and for me more satisfyinguse for resurrected secrets they could be used as weapons to kill to destroy some months ago i met with the head of a drug company id been selling reconstructed trade secrets to r and k pharmaceuticals in raleigh north carolina he was pleased with that but he had another proposition for me something a bit more extreme he told me of a brilliant researcher a professor in york who was developing a new cancer drug when it came to market my clients company would go out of business he was willing to pay millions to make sure that the researcher died and his office was destroyed that was when gehenna truly blossomed hydt then confirmed bonds other deductions about using a prototype of a serbian bomb theyd constructed from reassembled plans and blueprints that people in hydts belgrade subsidiary had managed to piece together this would make it appear that the intended target was another professor at the same university in york a man whod testified at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia he was teaching a course in balkan history in the room next to the cancer researchers everyone would think that the slav was the intended target bond glanced at the time on the tv programme crawl it was ten fifteen in england he had to get out now brilliant absolutely brilliant he said but let me get my notes so i can tell you all about my idea stay and watch the festivities a nod towards the television dunne turned the volume up hydt said to bond we were originally going to detonate the device at ten thirty in england but since weve got confirmation that both classes are in session i think we can do it now besides hydt confessed im rather eager to see if our device works before bond could react hydt had dialled a number on his phone he looked at the screen well the signals gone through we shall see silent everyone turned to stare at the television a recorded item about the royal family was in progress a few minutes later the screen went blank then flashed to a stark redandblack logo breaking news the screen went to a smartly dressed southasian woman sitting at a desk in the newsroom her voice was shaking as she read the story were interrupting this programme to report that there has been an explosion in york apparently a car bomb the authorities are saying a car bomb has detonated and destroyed a large part of a university building were just learning yes the building is on the grounds of yorkshirebradford university we have a report that lectures were in progress at the time of the explosion and the rooms nearest the bomb were thought to be full no one has yet claimed responsibility bonds breath hissed through his set teeth as he stared at the screen but severan hydts eyes shone in triumph and everyone else in the room applauded as heartily as if their favourite striker had just scored a goal at the world cup five minutes later a local news crew had arrived and was beaming pictures of the tragedy to the world the video footage showed a halfdestroyed building smoke glass and wreckage covering the ground rescue workers running dozens of police cars and fire engines pulling up the crawler said massive explosion at university in york in this era weve become inured to terrible images on television scenes appalling to an eyewitness are somehow tame when observed in two dimensions on the medium that brings us dr whoand advertisements for ford mondeos and m s fashions but this picture of tragedy a university building in ruins enveloped by smoke and dust and people standing about confused helpless was gripping beyond words it would have been impossible for anybody in the rooms closest to the bomb to survive bond could only stare at the screen hydt did too but he of course was enraptured his three partners were chatting among themselves boisterous as one might expect of people who had made millions of pounds in a thousandth of a second the presenter now reported that the bomb had been loaded with metal shards like razor blades which had shot out at thousands of miles per hour the explosive had ripped apart most of the lecture theatres and the teaching staffs offices on the ground and first floors the presenter reported that a newspaper in hungary had just found a letter left in its reception area from a group of serbian military officers claiming responsibility the university the note stated was harbouring and giving succour to a professor described as a traitor to the serbian people and his race hydt said that was our doing too we collected some serbian army letterhead from a rubbish bin thats what the statements printed on he glanced at dunne and bond understood that the irishman had incorporated this fillip into the master blueprint the man who thinks of everything hydt said now we need to plan a celebratory lunch bond glanced once more at the screen and started to make for the door just then though the presenter cocked her head and said we have a new development in york she sounded confused she was touching her earpiece listening yorkshire police chief superintendent phil pelham is about to make a statement well go live to him now the camera showed a harried middleaged man in police uniform but without hat or jacket standing in front of a fire engine a dozen microphones were being thrust towards him he cleared his throat at approximately ten fifteen am today an explosive device detonated on the grounds of yorkshirebradford university although property damage was extensive it appears that there were no fatalities and only half a dozen minor injuries the three partners had fallen silent niall dunnes blue eyes twitched with uncharacteristic emotion frowning deeply hydt inhaled a rasping breath about ten minutes before the explosion authorities received word that a bomb had been planted in or around a university in york certain additional facts suggested that yorkshirebradford might be the target but as a precaution all educational institutions in the city were evacuated according to plans put into effect by officials after the sevenseven attacks in london the injuries and again i stress they were minor were sustained mostly by staff who remained after the students had gone to make certain the evacuation was complete in addition one professor a medical researcher who was lecturing in the hall nearest the bomb was slightly injured retrieving files from his office just before the explosion we are aware that a serbian group is claiming credit for the attack and i can assure you that police here in yorkshire the metropolitan police in london and security service investigators are giving this attack the highest priority with the silent tap of a button hydt blackened the screen one of your people there huang snapped he had a change of heart and warned them you said we could trust everyone the german observed coldly glaring at hydt the partnership was fraying hydts eyes slipped to dunne on whose face the fractional emotion was gone the irishman was concentrating an engineer calmly analysing a malfunction as the partners argued heatedly among themselves bond took the chance to move to the door he was halfway to freedom when it burst open a security guard squinted at him and pointed a finger him hes the one what hydt demanded we found chenzira and miss barnes tied up in her room hed been knocked unconscious but as he came to he saw that man reach into miss barness purse and take something out a small radio he thought that man spoke to someone on it hydt frowned trying to make sense of this yet the look on dunnes face revealed that hed almost been expecting a betrayal from gene theron at a glance from the engineer the massive security man in the black suit drew his gun and pointed it directly at bonds chest so the guard in jessicas office had woken sooner than bond had anticipated and had seen what had happened after hed tied her up he had retrieved from her handbag the other items gregory lamb had delivered along with the inhaler yesterday morning the reason bond had asked jessica such insensitive questions when they were parked near her house yesterday was to upset distract and ideally to make her cry so that he could take her handbag to find a tissue and to slip into a side pocket the items sanu hirani had provided yesterday via lamb among them was the miniature satellite phone the size of a thick pen since the double fence around green way made it impossible to hide the instrument in the grass or bushes just inside the perimeter and since bond knew jessica was coming back today hed decided to hide it in her bag knowing shed walk through the metal detector undisturbed give it to me hydt ordered bond reached into his pocket and dug it out hydt examined it then dropped and crushed it beneath his heel who are you who are you working for bond shook his head no longer calm hydt gazed at the angry faces of his partners who were asking furiously what steps had been taken to shield their identities they wanted their mobile phones mathebula demanded his gun dunne studied bond in the way he might a misfiring engine he spoke softly as if to himself you had to be the one in serbia and at the army base in march his brow beneath the blond fringe furrowed how did you escape how he didnt seem to want an answer he wasnt speaking to anyone but himself and midlands disposal wasnt involved that was a cover for your surveillance there then here the killing fields his voice ebbed a look approaching admiration tinted his face as perhaps he decided bond was an engineer in his own right a man who also drafted clever blueprints he said to hydt he has contacts in the uk its the only way they could have evacuated the university in time hes with some british security agency but he wouldve been working with somebody here london will have to call pretoria though and weve got enough people in our pocket to stall for a time he said to one of the guards get the remaining workers out of the plant keep only security hit the toxicspill alarm marshal everyone into the car park thatll jam things up nicely if saps or nia decides to pay us a visit the guard walked to an intercom and gave the instructions an alarm blared and an announcement rattled from the publicaddress system in various languages and him huang asked nodding to bond oh dunne said matter of factly as if it were understood he looked at the security man kill him and get the body into a furnace the huge man was equally blasé as he stepped forward aiming his glock pistol with care please no bond cried and lifted a hand imploringly a natural gesture under the circumstances so the guard was surprised by the swirling black razor knife that bond had pitched towards his face this was the final item in hiranis care package hidden in jessicas bag bond had not been able to adjust his distance for knife throwing at which he was not particularly proficient anyway but hed flung it more as a distraction the security man though swatted away the spiralling weapon and the honed edge cut his hand deeply before he recovered or anyone else could react bond moved in twisted his wrist back and relieved him of his gun which he fired into the guards fat leg to make sure that the weapon was ready to shoot and to disable him further as dunne and the other armed guard drew their weapons and began firing bond rolled through the door the corridor was empty slamming the door shut he sprinted twenty yards and took cover behind ironically a green recycling bin the door to the conference room opened cautiously the second armed guard eased out narrow eyes scanning bond saw no reason to kill the young man so he shot him near the elbow he dropped to the floor screaming bond knew they would have called for backup so he stood up and continued his flight as he ran he dropped out the magazine and glanced at it ten rounds left nine millimetre grain fullmetal jacket light rounds and with the copper jacketing theyd have less stopping power than a hollow point but theyd shoot flat and fast he shoved the magazine back in ten rounds always count but before he got far there was a huge snap near his head and the nearly simultaneous boom of a rifle from a side corridor he saw two men in securityguard khaki approaching holding bushmaster assault rifles bond fired twice missing but giving himself enough cover to kick in the door to the office beside him and run into the cluttered workspace no one was inside a fusillade from the slugs tore up the jamb wall and door eight rounds left the two guards seemed to know what they were about exarmy he guessed deafened by the shots he couldnt hear voices but from the shadows in the corridor he got the impression that the men had joined up with others perhaps dunne among them he sensed too they were about to make a dynamic entry all of them at once fanning out going high and low right and left bond would have no chance against a formation like that the shadows moved closer only one move was possible and not a very clever or subtle one bond flung a chair through the window and leapt after it sprawling on the ground six feet below he landed hard but with nothing sprained or broken and sprinted into the green way facility now deserted of workers again he turned towards his pursuers and dropped to the ground under cover of a detached bulldozer blade sitting near resurrection row he aimed back at the window and a nearby door eight rounds left eight rounds eight he put a bit of pressure on the sensitive trigger waiting waiting controlling his breathing as best he could but the guards werent going to fall for a trap the shattered window remained empty that meant they were heading outside by other exits their intention of course was to flank him which they now did and very effectively too at the south end of the building dunne and two green way guards sprinted to cover behind some lorries instinctively bond glanced the other way and saw the two guards whod fired on him in the corridor they were moving in from the north they too went to cover behind a yellowandgreen digger the bulldozer blade protected him from assault only from the west and the hostiles werent coming from that direction but from the poles bond rolled away just as one of the men started to fire from the north the bushmaster was a short but frighteningly accurate weapon the bullets thudded into the ground and clanged loudly against the bulldozers yoke and bond was pelted with searing shards of lead and copper from the fracturing slugs with bond pinned down by the two in the north the other team dunne leading moved in closer from the opposite direction bond lifted his head slightly to scan for a target but before he could paint one of his attackers they moved on finding cover among the many piles of rubbish oil drums and equipment bond scanned again but couldnt spot them suddenly earth exploded all around him as both groups caught him in a crossfire the slugs finding homes closer and closer to where he huddled in a dip in the ground the men to the north vanished behind a low hill presumably intending to crest it where theyd have a perfect vantagepoint from which to snipe at him bond had to leave his position immediately he turned and crawled as quickly as he could through grass and weeds east deeper into the grounds feeling the chill of absolute vulnerability the hill was behind him and to the left and he knew the two shooters would soon be at the top targeting him he tried to picture their progress fifteen feet from the top ten five bond imagined them easing slowly up to the hillock then aiming at him now he told himself but he waited five harrowing seconds more just to be sure it seemed like hours he then rolled on to his back and lifted his pistol over his feet one guard was indeed standing on top of the rise painting a target his partner crouching beside him bond squeezed the trigger once then shifted his aim to the right and fired again the standing man gripped his chest and went down hard tumbling to the base of the hill the bushmaster slid after him the other guard had rolled away unhurt six rounds left six four hostiles remaining as dunne and the others peppered his location with rounds bond rolled between oil drums in a tall stand of grass studying his surroundings his only chance of escape was through the front entrance a hundred feet away the pedestrian walkway was open but a lot of unprotected ground separated him from it dunne and his two guards would have a good shooting position as would the remaining guard still at the top of the hill to the north he could a rapid barrage erupted bond kept his face pressed into the dusty ground until there was a pause surveying the scene and the positions of the shooters he rose fast and started to sprint to an anaemic tree at its foot there was some decent cover oil drums and the carcasses of engines and transmissions he ran flat out but halfway to his destination he stopped abruptly and spun round one of the guards with dunne assumed he was going to continue running and had stood tall leading with his rifle to fire in front of bond so the bullets would meet him a few yards further on it hadnt occurred to him that bond was running solely to force a target to present the double tap of bonds millimetre rounds took the guard down as the others ducked he kept running and made it to the tree then beyond that to a small mound of rubbish fifty feet from the gate a series of shots from dunnes position forced him to roll into a patch of low vegetation four rounds three hostiles he could make it to the gate in ten seconds but that would mean five of full exposure he didnt have much choice though he would soon be flanked but then looking for the enemy he saw movement through a gap in two tall piles of construction debris low on the ground barely visible through stands of grass three heads were close together the surviving guard from the north had joined dunne and the man with him they didnt notice they were exposed to bond and seemed to be whispering urgently as if planning their strategy all three men were in his field of fire it wasnt an impossible shot by any means though with the light rounds and an unfamiliar gun bond was at a disadvantage still he couldnt let the opportunity pass he had to act now at any moment theyd realise they were vulnerable and go to cover lying prone bond aimed the boxy pistol in competitive shooting youre never conscious of pulling the trigger accuracy is about controlling your breathing and keeping your arm and body completely still with the sights of your weapon resting steadily on the target your trigger finger slowly tightens until the gun discharges seemingly of its own accord the most talented shooters are always somewhat surprised when their weapons fire under these circumstances the second and third shots would have to come more quickly of course but the first was meant for dunne and bond was going to be sure he didnt miss and he didnt one powerful crack then two others in succession in shooting as in golf you usually know the instant the missile leaves your control whether youve aimed well or badly and the fast shiny rounds struck exactly where they were aimed as bond had known they would except he now realised to his dismay accuracy wasnt the issue hed hit what hed aimed at which turned out not to be his enemies at all but a large piece of shiny chrome that one of the men the irishman of course must have found in a nearby skip and set up at an angle to reflect their images and draw bonds fire the reflective metal tumbled to the ground dammit the man who thinks of everything instantly the men split up as dunne would have instructed and moved into position now that bond had helpfully revealed his exact location two ran to bonds right to secure the gate and dunne to the left one round left one round they didnt know he was nearly out of ammunition though they soon would he was trapped his only cover a low pile of cardboard and books they were moving in a circle round him dunne in one direction the other two guards together in another soon hed be in a crossfire again with no effective protection he decided his only chance was to give them a reason not to kill him hed tell them he had information to help them get away or offer them a huge sum of money anything to stall he called im out then stood flinging the gun away lifting his hands the two guards to the right peered out seeing that he was unarmed they cautiously came closer crouching dont move one called keep your hands in the air their muzzles were aimed directly at him then from nearby a voice said what the hell are you doing we dont need a bloody prisoner kill him the intonation was of course irish the guards looked at each other and apparently decided to share the glory of murdering the man who had brought down gehenna and killed several of their fellow workers they both raised their black weapons to their shoulders but just as bond was about to dive to the ground in a hopeless bid to avoid the slugs there was a crash behind him a white van had ploughed through the gate sending chainlink and razor wire flying now the vehicle skidded to a stop and the doors opened a tall man in a suit wearing body armour under his jacket leapt out and began firing at the two guards it was kwalene nkosi nervous and tense but standing his ground the guards returned fire though only to cover their retreat east deeper into the green way facility they disappeared into the brush bond glimpsed dunne who was surveying the situation calmly he turned and sprinted in the same direction as the guards bond picked up the weapon hed been using and ran to the police vehicle bheka jordaan climbed out and stood beside nkosi who was looking around for more targets gregory lamb peered out and stepped cautiously to the ground he carried a large colt you decided to come to the party after all bond said to her i thought it wouldnt hurt to drive here with some other officers while we were waiting nearby up the road i heard gunshots i suspected poaching which is a crime that was sufficient cause to enter the premises she didnt seem to be joking he wondered if she had prepared the lines for her superiors if so she needed to work on her delivery bond decided jordaan said i brought a small team with me sergeant mbalula and some other officers are securing the main building bond told her hydts in there or was his three partners too id assume theyre armed by now therell be other guards he explained where the hostiles had been and gave a rough geography of the headquarters jessicas office too he added that the older woman had helped him she would not be a threat at a nod from the captain nkosi keeping low started for the building jordaan sighed we had trouble getting backup hydts being protected by somebody in pretoria but i called a friend in the recces our specialforces brigade a team is on its way they arent so much concerned about politics they look for any excuse to fight but itll be twenty or thirty minutes before they arrive suddenly gregory lamb stiffened crouching low he lumbered south towards a stand of trees ill flank them flank them flank who wait bond shouted theres nobody there go with kwalene secure hydt but the big man seemed not to have heard and plodded over the ground like an elderly cape buffalo disappearing into the brush what the hell was he doing just then a few rounds peppered the ground near them bond and jordaan dropped to the ground he forgot about lamb and looked for a target several hundred yards away dunne and the two men with him had regrouped and paused in their retreat firing back at their pursuers bullets hit near the van but caused no damage or injury the three men vanished behind piles of rubbish on the edge of disappearance row the seagull population thinning as the birds fled from the gunfire bond jumped into the drivers seat of the van in the back he was pleased to see half a dozen large containers of ammunition he started the engine jordaan ran to the passenger side im coming with you she said better if i do this myself he suddenly recalled philly maidenstones recitation of kiplings verse which hed decided was not a bad battle cry down to gehenna or up to the throne he travels the fastest who travels alone but jordaan jumped into the seat beside him and slammed the door i said id fight by your side if it was legal to do so now it is so go theyre getting away bond hesitated only a moment then slammed the van into first and they bounded off down the dirt roads that gridded the huge complex past silicon row resurrection row the power plants and rubbish of course millions of tons of it paper carrier bags bits of dull and shiny metal fragments of ceramic and food scraps over which the eerie canopy of frantic seagulls was reassembling it was hard driving as they swerved around earthmoving equipment skips and bales of refuse awaiting burial but at least the winding route gave dunne and the two guards no easy target the three men turned and fired sporadically but were concentrating mostly on escaping on her radio jordaan called in and reported where they were and whom they were pursuing the specialforces team would not arrive for at least another thirty minutes bond heard the dispatcher tell her just as dunne and the other men reached the fence separating the filthy sprawl of the plant from the reclaimed area one guard spun around and fired an entire magazine their way the rounds pounded the front grille and tyres the van jerked sideways out of control and ploughed head first into a pile of paper bales the air bags deployed and bond and jordaan sat stunned seeing that their enemy was down dunne and the other guards began firing in earnest amid the sound of bullets slamming into sheet metal bond and jordaan rolled out of the shuddering vehicle and into a ditch you injured he asked no i its so loud her voice quivered but her eyes told bond she was successfully fighting down her fear from beneath the wing of the van bond had a good shot at one of their adversaries and lying prone he aimed with the automatic one round left he squeezed the trigger but the instant the firing pin hit primer the man ducked he was gone when the bullet arrived bond grabbed an ammunition box and ripped off the lid it contained only rounds for rifles the second held the same in fact they all did there were no mm pistol rounds he sighed and looked through the van do you have anything thatll shoot these he gestured at the wealth of useless bullets no assault rifles all i have is this she drew her own weapon here you take it the pistol was a colt python acalibre magnum powerful and boasting a tight cylinder lockup and superb pull a good weapon but it was a revolver holding only six rounds no he corrected when he checked jordaan was a conservative gun owner and kept the chamber under the hammer empty speedloader loose rounds no so they had five bullets against three adversaries with semiautomatic weapons youve never heard of glocks he muttered slipping the empty one into his back waistband and weighing the colt in his palm i investigate crimes she replied coolly i dont have much occasion to shoot people though when those rare instances doarise he thought angrily it would be helpful to have the right tool he said you go back just keep to cover she was looking steadily into his eyes sweat beading at her temples where her luxurious black hair frothed if youre going after them im coming with you without a weapon theres nothing you can do jordaan glanced to where dunne and the others had disappeared they have a number of guns and we only have one thats not fair we must take one away from them well maybe captain bheka jordaan had a sense of humour after all they shared a smile and in her fierce eyes bond saw the reflection of orange flames from the burning methane it was a striking image crouching they slipped into elysian fields using a dense garden of fineneedled fynbos varieties watsonias grasses jacaranda and king protea as cover there were kigelia trees too and some young baobabs even in the late autumn much of the foliage was in full colour thanks to the western cape climate a brace of guinea fowl observed them with some irritation and continued on their awkward way their gait reminded bond of niall dunnes he and jordaan were seventyfive yards into the park when the assault began the trio had been moving away but it seemed that they had done so merely to lure bond and the saps officer further into the wilderness and a trap the men had split up one of the guards dropped on to a hillock of soft green ground cover and laid down suppressing fire while the other dunne too possibly though bond couldnt see him crashed through the tall grasses towards them bond had a good shot and took it but the guard went to cover the instant bond fired he missed again slow down he told himself four rounds left four jordaan and bond scrabbled into a dip near a small field filled with succulents and a pond that would probably be home to stately koi come the spring they looked up over the grass veld scanning for targets then what seemed to be a thousand shots though it was probably more like forty or fifty rained down on them striking close shattering rock and spraying water the two men in khaki probably desperate and frustrated at their delayed escape tried a bold assault charging bond and jordaan from different directions bond fired twice at the man coming at them from the left hitting the mans rifle and left arm the guard cried out in pain and dropped the weapon which tumbled to the bottom of the hill bond saw that though the mans forearm was injured hed drawn a pistol with his right hand and was otherwise capable of fighting the second guard made a run to cover and bond fired fast tapping him somewhere on his thigh but that wound too seemed superficial he vanished into the brush one round one round where was dunne sneaking up behind them then silence again though silence filled with ringing in their ears and the internal bass of heartbeats jordaan was shivering bond eyed the bushmaster the rifle that the injured guard had dropped it lay around ten yards away he studied the scene around them carefully the landscape the plants the trees then he noted tall grasses swaying fifty or sixty yards distant the two guards invisible in the thick foliage were moving in keeping some distance between them in a minute or two theyd be on top of bond and jordaan he might take one out with his last bullet but the other guard would be successful james jordaan whispered squeezing his arm ill lead them off ill go that way she pointed to a plain covered with low grass if you fire you can hit one and the other may take cover thatll give you a chance to get to the rifle its suicide he whispered back youd be completely exposed you really muststop your incessant flirting james he smiled listen if anybodys going to be a hero its me im going to head towards them when i tell you go for the bushmaster he pointed to the black rifle lying in the dust youre qualified to use it she nodded the guards moved closer thirty yards now bond whispered stay low until i tell you get ready the guards were making their way cautiously through the tall grass bond surveyed the landscape again took a deep breath then rose calmly and walked towards them his pistol pointed down at his side he raised his left hand james no jordaan whispered bond did not respond he called to the men i want to talk to you if you help me get the names of the other people involved youll receive a reward therell be no charges against you you understand the two guards about ten paces apart stopped they were confused they saw that he couldnt hit them both before the other shot him yet he was walking slowly in their direction calm not lifting his pistol do you understand the reward is fifty thousand rand they stared at each other nodding a little too enthusiastically bond knew they were not seriously considering his offer they were thinking they might draw him closer before they fired they faced him and as they did so the powerful gun in bonds hand barked once still pointed downward letting go its final bullet into the ground as the guards crouched startled bond sprinted to his left putting a row of trees between him and the guards they glanced at each other then ran forward to where they had a better view of bond who dived behind a hill as their bushmasters began to clatter it was then that the entire world exploded the muzzle flashes from the mens rifles ignited the methane spewing from the fake tree root transporting the gas from the landfill beneath them to green ways burn off facilities bond had ruptured it with his last bullet the men now vanished in a tidal wave of flame a roiling thunderhead the guards and the ground theyd stood on were simply gone the fire widening as panicked birds fled into the air the trees and brush bursting into flames as if they were soaked in incendiary accelerant twenty feet away jordaan rose unsteadily she started towards the bushmaster but bond ran to her shouting change of plan forget it what should we do they were thrown to the ground as another mushroom cloud of flame erupted not far away the roar was so loud bond had to press his lips against her sumptuous hair to make himself heard might be a good idea to leave you are making a terrible mistake severan hydts voice was low with threat but a very different state of mind was revealed in the expression on his long bearded face horror at the destruction of his empire both physical from the fires in the distance and legal from the specialforces troops and police descending on the grounds and office there was nothing imperious about him now hydt in handcuffs and jordaan nkosi and bond were standing amid a cluster of bulldozers and lorries in the open area between the office and resurrection row they were near the spot where bond would have been killed if not for bheka jordaans dramatic arrival to arrest the poachers sergeant mbalula handed bond his walther extra clips and mobile phone from the subaru thank you sergeant saps officers and south african special forces roamed through the facility looking for more suspects and collecting evidence in the distance fire crews were struggling and it was a struggle to put out the methane fires as the western edge of elysian fields became just another outpost of hell apparently the corrupt politicians in pretoria the ones in hydts pocket had not been so very high up after all senior officials stepped in quickly and ordered their arrest and full backup for jordaans operation in cape town additional officers were sent to seize green ways offices in all south african cities medics scurried about here too attending to the wounded which included only hydts security staff hydts three partners were in custody huang eberhard and mathebula it was not clear yet what their crimes were but that would be established soon at the very least they had all smuggled firearms into the country justifying their arrest four of the surviving guards were in custody and most of the hundred or so green way employees whod been milling about in the car park had been detained pending questioning dunne had escaped specialforces officers had found evidence of a motorcycle which had apparently been hidden under a tarp covered with straw of course the irishman would have kept his lifeboat ready severan hydt persisted im innocent youre persecuting me because im british and white youre prejudiced jordaan could not ignore this prejudiced ive arrested six black men four whites and an asian if thats not a rainbow i dont know what is the reality of the disaster kept coming home to him his eyes swivelled away from the fires and began taking in the rest of the grounds he was probably looking for dunne he would be lost without his engineer he glanced at bond then said to jordaan his voice laced with desperation what sort of arrangement could we work out im very wealthy thats fortunate she said your legal bills will be quite high im not trying to bribe you i should hope not thats a very serious offence she then said matteroffactly i want to know where niall dunne has gone if you tell me ill let the prosecution know that you helped me find him i can give you the address of his flat here ive already sent officers there tell me some other places he might go to yes im sure i can think of something bond noticed gregory lamb approaching from a deserted part of the grounds carrying his large pistol as if hed never fired a weapon bond left jordaan and hydt standing together between rows of pallets containing empty oil drums and joined lamb near a battered skip ah bond the six agent said breathing heavily and sweating despite the chilly autumn air his face was streaked with dirt and there was a tear in the sleeve of his jacket you caught one bond nodded at the slash caused it seemed by a bullet the assailant had been close powder burns surrounded the rent didnt do any damage thankfully except to my favourite gabardine he was lucky an inch to the left and the slug would have shattered his upper arm what happened to the guys you went after bond asked i never saw them got away sorry to say they split up i knew they were trying to circle back on me but i went after one of them anyway thats how i got my lord nelson here he touched his sleeve but dammit they knew the lie of the land and i didnt i got a piece of one of them though do you want to follow the blood trail he blinked oh i did but it vanished bond lost interest in the adventurers excursion into the bush and moved aside to call london he was just punching in the number when a few yards away he heard a series of loud cracks he recognised instantly as powerful bullets finding a target followed by the booms of a distant rifles report bond spun round his hand going for his walther as he scanned the grounds but he saw no sign of the shooter only his victim bheka jordaan her chest and face a mass of blood clawed at the air as she stumbled backwards and rolled into a muddy ditch no bond cried his inclination was to run to her aid but the amount of blood bone and tissue hed seen told him she could not have survived the devastating shots no bond thought of ugogo of the fiery orange gleam in jordaans eye as theyd taken on the two guards in elysian fields the faint smile they have a number of guns and we only have one thats not fair we must take one away from them captain nkosi cried from his position behind a skip nearby other saps officers were firing randomly now hold your fire bond shouted no blind shooting guard the visible perimeter look for muzzle flashes the special forces were more restrained watching for targets from good cover positions so the engineer didhave an escape plan for his beloved boss thats what hydt had been looking for dunne would keep the officers pinned down while hydt fled probably to where the other security guards were waiting in the woods nearby with a car or perhaps even a helicopter hidden on the grounds hydt had not started his sprint to freedom yet though hed still be hiding between the rows of pallets where jordaan had been questioning him hed be waiting for more covering fire crouching bond began to make his way there any minute now the man would make a run for the brush protected by dunne and perhaps other loyal guards and james bond was not going to let that happen he heard gregory lamb whisper is it safe but couldnt see him he realised the man had dived into a full skip bond had to move even if it meant exposing himself to dunnes fine marksmanship he wouldnt let hydt escape bheka jordaan would not have died in vain he sprinted into the shadowy space between the tall pallets of oil drums to secure hydt his gun raised and froze severan hydt was not about to escape anywhere the ragandbone man the visionary king of decay the lord of entropy lay on his back two bullet wounds in his chest a third in his forehead a significant part of the back of his skull was missing bond slipped his gun away around him the tactical forces began to rise one called that the sniper had left his shooting position and vanished into the bush then a harsh sound behind him a womans voice sihlama bond spun around to see bheka jordaan crawling from the ditch wiping her face and spitting blood she was unharmed either dunne had missed completely or his boss had been his intended target the gore on jordaan was hydts it had spattered her as she stood beside him bond pulled her to cover behind the oil drums smelling the sickly copper scent of blood dunnes still out there somewhere nkosi called you are okay captain yes yes she said dismissively what about hydt hes dead bond said masende she snapped this brought a smile to nkosis face jordaan tugged her shirt off underneath she wore body armour over a black cotton vest and wiped her face neck and hair with it a call came in from officers on the ridge that the perimeter was clear dunne of course would have had no interest in staying hed accomplished what he needed to bond regarded the body once more he decided that the tight grouping of the shots meant that hydt had indeed been the intended target of course this made sense dunne had had to kill the man to make sure he told the police nothing about him now he recalled several glances that dunne had cast towards hydt over the past few days dark looks hinting at what irritation resentment almost jealousy it seemed perhaps there was something else behind the murder of the ragandbone man something personal whatever the reason hed certainly done a typically proficient job jordaan hurried into the office building ten minutes later she emerged shed found a shower or tap somewhere her face and hair were damp but more or less bloodfree she was furious at herself i lost my prisoner i should have guarded him better i never thought a ghastly wail interrupted her someone was speeding forward no no no jessica barnes was running towards hydts body she flung herself to the ground oblivious to the grotesque wounds and cradled her dead lover bond stepped forward gripped her narrow quivering shoulders and helped her up no jessica come over here with me bond led her to cover behind a bulldozer bheka jordaan joined them hes dead hes dead jessica pressed her head against bonds shoulder bheka jordaan lifted her handcuffs out of their holster she tried to help me bond reminded her she didnt know what hydt was doing im sure of it jordaan put the cuffs away well drive her down to the station take a statement i dont think well have to pursue it beyond that bond detached himself from jessica he took her by the shoulders thank you for helping me i know it was hard she breathed in deeply then calmer she asked who did it who shot him dunne she didnt seem surprised i never liked him severan was passionate impulsive he never thought things through niall realised that and seduced him with all his planning and his intelligence i didnt think he could be trusted but i never had the courage to say anything she closed her eyes momentarily you did a good job with the praying bond told her too good she whispered on jessicas cheek and neck were stark patches of hydts blood it was the first time bond realised that hed seen any colour on her he looked her in the eye i know some people who can help you when you get back to london theyll be in touch ill see to it thank you jessica murmured a policewoman led her away bond was startled by a mans voice nearby is it clear he frowned unable to see the speaker then he understood gregory lamb was still in the skip its clear the agent scrambled out of his hidingplace mind the blood bond told lamb as he nearly stepped in some oh my god he muttered and looked as if he was going to be sick ignoring him bond said to jordaan i need to know how extensive gehenna is can you get your officers to collect all the files and computers in research and development and ill need your computercrimes outfit to crack the passwords yes of course well have them brought to the saps office you can review them there nkosi said ill do it commander bond thanked him the mans round face seemed less wry and irrepressible than earlier bond supposed this had been his first firefight hed be changed forever by the incident but from what bond was seeing the change would not diminish but rather would enhance the young officer nkosi gestured toward some saps forensic science service officers and led them inside the building bond glanced at jordaan can i ask you a question she turned to him what did you say after you climbed out of the ditch you said something with her particular complexion she might or might not have been blushing dont tell ugogo i wont the first was zulu for i guess youd say in english crap i have some variations on that myself and the other word she squinted that i think i will not tell you james why not because it refers to a certain part of the male anatomy and i do not think it wise to encourage you in that regard late afternoon the sun beginning to dip in the northwest james bond drove from the table mountain hotel where hed showered and changed to cape towns central police station as he entered and made for jordaans office he noticed several pairs of eyes staring at him the expressions were no longer curious he sensed as had been the case upon his first visit here several days ago but admiring perhaps the story of his role in foiling severan hydts plan had circulated or the tale of how hed taken out two adversaries and blown up a landfill with a single bullet no mean accomplishment the fire bond had learnt was largely extinguished to his immense relief he would not have wanted to be known as the man who had burnt a sizeable area of cape town to its sandstone foundation he was met by bheka jordaan in the hall shed taken another shower to clean off the remnants of severan hydt and had changed into dark trousers and a yellow shirt bright and cheerful perhaps an antidote to the horror of the events at green way she gestured him into her office they sat together in chairs before her desk dunnes managed to get to mozambique government security spotted him there but he got lost in some unsavoury part of maputo which frankly is most of the city i called some colleagues in pretoria in financial intelligence the special investigations unit and the banking risk information centre they checked his accounts under a warrant of course yesterday afternoon two hundred thousand pounds were wired into a swiss account of dunnes half an hour ago he transferred it to dozens of anonymous online accounts he can access it from anywhere so we have no idea where he intends to go bonds expression of disgust closely matched hers if he surfaces or leaves mozambique their security people will let me know but until then hes out of our reach it was then that nkosi appeared pushing a large cart filled with boxes the documents and laptop computers from the green way research and development department the warrant officer and bond followed jordaan to an empty office where nkosi put the boxes on the floor around the desk bond started to lift off a lid but jordaan said quickly put these on i wont have you ruining evidence she handed him blue latex gloves bond gave a wry laugh but took them jordaan and nkosi left him to the job before he opened the boxes though he placed a call to bill tanner james the chief of staff said weve got the signals sounds like all hells broken loose down there bond laughed at his choice of words and explained in detail about the shootout at green way hydts fate and dunnes escape he explained too about the drug company president who had hired hydt tanner would ask the fbi in washington to open an investigation of their own and arrest the man bond said i need a rendition team to capture dunne if we can find out where he is any of our doubleone agents nearby tanner sighed ill see what i can do james but i dont have a lot of people to spare not with the situation in eastern sudan were helping the fco and the marines with security i might be able to get you some special forces sas or sbs would that suit fine im going to look through everything weve collected from hydts headquarters ill call back when ive finished and brief m they rang off and bond started to lay out the gehenna documents on the large desk in the office jordaan had provided he hesitated then feeling ridiculous he slipped on the blue gloves deciding that at least they would provide an amusing story for his friend ronnie vallance of the yard vallance often said that bond would make a terrible detectiveinspector given his preference for beating up or shooting perpetrators rather than marshalling evidence to see them in the dock he leafed through the documents for almost an hour finally when he felt well enough informed to discuss the situation he telephoned london again m said gruffly its a nightmare here that fool in division three pushed a very big button got all of whitehall closed up downing street too if theres anything that plays badly with the tabloids its an international security meeting being cancelled because of a bloody security alert was it groundless bond had been convinced that york was the site of the attack but that didnt mean london wasnt at some risk as hed told tanner during his satellite call from jessica barness office nothing green way had its legitimate side of course the companys engineers were working with the police to make sure the refuseremoval tunnels around whitehall were safe no dangerous radiation no explosives no guy fawkes there was a spike in afghan sigint traffic but that was because we and the cia descended on the place last monday and everybody was wondering what the hell we were doing there and osbornesmith inconsequential bond didnt know whether the word referred to the man himself or meant that his fate was not worth discussing now whats been going on down there i want details bond explained first about hydts death and the arrest of his three main partners he also described dunnes escape and bonds plan to execute the level project order from sunday which was still valid for the irishmans rendition when they found him then bond detailed gehenna hydts stealing and assembling classified information the blackmail and extortion adding the cities where most of his efforts had taken place london moscow paris tokyo new york and mumbai and there are smaller operations in belgrade washington taipei and sydney there was silence for a moment and bond imagined m chomping on his cheroot as he took it all in the man said damn clever putting all that together from rubbish hydt said nobody ever sees dustmen and its true theyre invisible theyre everywhere and yet you look right through them m gave a rare chuckle i happened to be thinking much the same myself yesterday then he grew serious whatre your recommendations id get our embassy people and six to roll up all the green way operations as fast as they can before the actors start disappearing freeze their assets and trace all incoming monies thatll lead us to the rest of the gehenna clients hmm m said his voice uncharacteristically light i suppose we could what was the old man thinking though im not sure we should be too hasty lets arrest the principals in all the locations yes but what do you think about getting some doubleone agents into their offices and keeping gehenna going a bit longer in some places id love to see what grs aerospace outside moscow throws away and i wonder what the pakistani consulate in mumbai is shredding be interesting to find out wed have to pull in some favours with the press to stop them reporting what hydt was really up to ill have the misinformation chaps at six leak word that he was mixed up with organised crime or some such well keep it vague word will get out at some point but by then well have scooped up some valuable finds the old fox bond laughed to himself so the odg was going into the recycling business brilliant sir get all the details to bill tanner and well go from there m paused then barked osbornebloodysmith has brought traffic in london to a complete standstill itll take me ages to get home ive neverunderstood why they couldnt run the m all the way in to earls court the line went dead james bond found felicity willings business card and called her at her office to break the news that one of her donors was a criminal and had died in an operation to arrest him but shed heard already reporters had been on to her and asked for a statement in light of the fact that green way was heavily involved with the mafia and the camorra bond reflected that the grass did not grow beneath the feet of the misinformation chaps at six felicity was furious that some journalists were suggesting shed known there was something disreputable about him but that shed been happy to take his donations anyway how the bloody hell could they ask that gene for heavens sake hydt gave us fifty or sixty thousand pounds a year which was generous but nothing compared to what a lot of people donate id drop anyone in an instant if i thought they were up to something illegal her voice softened but youre all right arent you i wasnt even there when they raided the place the police rang me and asked a few questions thats all hell of a shock though im sure it was bond asked how the deliveries were going she told him that the tonnage was even higher than had been pledged distribution was already under way to ten different countries in subsaharan africa there was enough food to keep hundreds of thousands of people fed for months bond congratulated her then said youre not too busy for franschhoek if you think youre getting out of our weekend in the country gene youd better think again they made plans to meet in the morning he reminded himself to find someone to wash and polish the subaru for which hed formed some affection despite the flashy colour and the largely cosmetic spoiler on the boot after theyd disconnected he sat back relishing the cheer in her voice relishing too the memory of the time theyd spent together and thinking of the future if you do go to some dark places could you promise me not to go to the worst smiling he flicked her card then put it away and pulled on the gloves once more to continue ploughing through the documents and computers jotting notes about green ways offices and the gehenna operation for m and bill tanner he laboured for an hour or so until he decided it was time for a drink he stretched luxuriously he then paused and slowly lowered his arms at that moment he had felt a jolt deep within him he knew the sensation it arose occasionally in the world of espionage that great landscape of subtext where so little is as it seems often the source for such an unsettling stab was a suspicion that a basic assumption had been wrong perhaps disastrously so staring at his notes he heard himself breathing fast his lips dry his heartbeat quickened bond flipped through hundreds of documents again then grabbed his mobile and emailed philly maidenstone a priority request as he waited for her reply he rose and paced in the small office his mind inundated with thoughts hovering and swooping like the frantic seagulls over disappearance row at green way when philly responded he snatched up his mobile and read the message sitting back slowly in the uncomfortable chair a shadow fell over him he looked up and found bheka jordaan standing there she was saying james i brought you some coffee in a proper mug it was decorated with the smiling faces of the players from bafana bafana in all their football finest when he said nothing and didnt take it she set it down james bond knew his face betrayed the alarm burning within him after a moment he whispered i think i got it wrong what do you mean everything about gehenna about incident twenty tell me bond sat forward the original intelligence we had was that someone named noah was involved in the event today the event that would result in all those deaths yes she sat next to him severan hydt bond shook his head he waved at the boxes of documents from green way but ive been through nearly every damn piece of paper and most of the mobiles and computers there isnt a single reference to noah in any of it and in all my meetings with hydt and dunne there was no reference to the name if that washis nickname why didnt it turn up in something an idea occurred to me so i contacted an associate at mi she knows computers rather well are you familiar with metadata jordaan said information embedded in computer files we convicted a government minister of corruption because of it he nodded at his phone my colleague looked at the halfdozen internet references we found that mentioned hydts nickname was noah the metadata in every one of them showed they were written and uploaded this week just like weuploaded data about gene theron to create your cover exactly the real noah did that to keep us focused on hydt which means incident twenty the thousands of deaths wasntthe bombing in york gehenna and incident twenty are two entirely different plans something else is going to happen and soon tonight thats what the original email said those people whoever they are are still at risk despite the success at green way he was back to the vital questions once more who was his enemy and what was his purpose until he answered those enquiries he couldnt form a response yet he had to there was little time left confirm incident friday night th estimated initial casualties in the thousands james fragments of facts memories and theories spiralled through his mind once again as hed done in the bowels of green ways research facility he began to assemble all the bits of information he possessed trying to put back together the shredded blueprint of incident twenty he rose and hands clasped behind his back bent forward as he looked over the papers and notes covering the desk jordaan had fallen silent finally he whispered gregory lamb she frowned what about him bond didnt answer immediately he sat down again ill need your help of course whats the matter gene you said it was urgent they were alone in felicity willings office at the charity in downtown cape town not far from the club where theyd met at the auction on wednesday night bond had interrupted a meeting involving a dozen men and women aid workers instrumental in the food deliveries and asked to see her alone he now swung her door closed im hoping you can help me there arent many people in cape town i can trust of course they sat on her cheap sofa in black jeans and a white shirt felicity moved closer to bond their knees touched she seemed even more tired than yesterday he recalled shed left his room before dawn first i have to confess something to you and well it may affect our plans for franschhoek it may affect a lot of plans frowning she nodded and i have to ask you to keep this to yourself thats very important her keen eyes probed his face of course but tell me please youre making me nervous im not who i said i was from time to time i do some work for the british government a whisper youre a spy he laughed no nothing as grand as that the title is security and integrity analyst usually its as boring as can be but youre one of the good guys you could put it like that felicity lowered her head to his shoulder when you said you were a security consultant in africa that usually means a mercenary you said you werent but i didnt quite believe it it was a cover i was investigating hydt her face flooded with relief and i was asking if you could change a little bit and now youve changed completelyfrom who i thought you were a hundred and eighty degrees bond said wryly how often does a man do that she smiled briefly that means youre not gene and youre not from durban no i live in london and discarding the faint afrikaans accent he extended his hand my names james its good to meet you miss willing are you going to throw me out she hesitated only briefly then flung her arms around him laughing she sat back but you said you needed my help i wouldnt involve you if there was any other way but ive run out of time thousands of lives are at stake my god what can i do do you know anything about gregory lamb lamb felicitys sharp eyebrows drew together he comes over as a rather high roller so ive approached him for donations several times he always said hed give us something but he never did hes rather a queer man a boor she laughed boor not afrikaner i have to tell you hes a bit more than that we heard rumours that he was in the pay of somebody though i cant imagine anybody taking him seriously as a spy i think thats an act he plays the fool to put people at ease around him so they dont suspect hes up to some pretty rough business now youve been down at the docks for the past few days right yes quite a bit did you hear anything about a big ship charter that lambs putting together tonight i did but i dont know any details bond was silent for a moment then have you ever heard anyone refer to lamb as noah felicity thought about it i cant say for certain but wait yes i think so a nickname somebody once used for him because of the shipping business but what did you mean when you said thousands of lives are at stake im not sure exactly what he has in mind my guess is hes going to use the cargo ship to sink a cruise liner a british one my god no but why on earth would he do that with lamb it has to be money hired by islamists warlords or pirates ill know more soon weve tapped his phone hes meeting somebody in an hour or so at a deserted hotel south of town the sixth apostle inn ill be there to find out what hes up to felicity said but james why do you have to go why not call the police and have him arrested bond hesitated i cant really use the police for this because of your job she asked evenly as a security analyst he paused yes i see felicity willing nodded then she leant forward fast and kissed him full on the lips in answer to your question whatever you do james whatever youre goingto do it wont affect our plans for franschhoek one bit or our plans for anything else as far as im concerned in may the sun sets in cape town around half past five as bond sped south on victoria road the scenery grew surreal bathed in a glorious sunset then dusk descended streaked by slashes of purple cloud over the turbulent atlantic hed left table mountain behind lions head too and was now motoring parallel to the solemn craggy rock formations of the twelve apostles mountain chain to his left dotted with grasses fynbos and splashes of protea defiant cluster pines sprouted in incongruous places half an hour after leaving felicity willings office he spotted the turning to the sixth apostle inn to the left east two signs marked the drive the name of the place in peeling faded paint and below that brighter and newer a warning about construction in progress prohibiting trespass bond skidded the subaru into the entrance doused the lights and proceeded slowly along a lengthy winding drive gravel grinding under the tyres it led directly towards the imposing face of the apostle ridge which rose a hundred or more feet behind the building before him was the inn shabby and desperately in need of the promised reconstruction though he supposed it had once been theplace for a holiday or to romance your mistress from london or hong kong the rambling onestorey structure was set amid extensive gardens now overgrown and gone to seed bond drove round to the back and into the weedfilled car park he hid the subaru in a stand of brush and tall grass climbed out and looked towards the darkened caravan used by the construction crews he swept his torch over it there were no signs of occupation then drawing his walther he made his way silently to the inn the front door was unlocked and he walked inside smelling mould new concrete and paint at the end of the lobby the front desk had no counter to the right he found sitting rooms and a library to the left a large breakfast room and lounge with french windows facing north offering a view of the gardens and above them the twelve apostles still faintly visible in the dusk inside this room the construction workers had left their drill presses table saws and various other tools all chained and padlocked behind that area there was a passage to the kitchen bond noticed switches for both work and overhead lights but he kept the place dark tiny animal feet skittered beneath the floorboards and in the walls bond sat down in a corner of the breakfast room on a workmans tool kit there was nothing to do but wait until the enemy appeared bond thought of lieutenant colonel bill tanner who had said to him not long after he joined odg listen most of your job is going to involve waiting i hope youre a patient man he wasnt but if his mission called for waiting he waited sooner than he had expected a fragment of light hit the wall and he rose to look out of one of the front windows a car bounded towards the inn then stopped in the undergrowth near the front door someone emerged from the vehicle bonds eyes narrowed it was felicity willing she was clutching her belly holstering his gun bond pushed through the front door and ran towards her felicity she struggled forward but fell to the gravel james help me im help me im hurt as he approached he saw a red stain on the front of her shirt her fingers too were bloodied he dropped to his knees and cradled her what happened i went to i went to check on a shipment at the docks there was a man there she gasped he pulled out a gun and shot me he didnt say anything just shot me and ran i made it back into the car and drove here you have to help me the police why didnt you he wasa policeman james what i saw a badge on his belt bond lifted her and carried her into the breakfast room laying her gently on some dust sheets that were stacked against the wall ill find a bandage he murmured then he said angrily this is my fault i should have worked it out youre the target of incident twenty lambs not after a cruise liner its the food ships he was hired by one of those agribusiness companies in america and europe you were telling me about to kill you and destroy the food he mustve paid someone in the police to help him dont let me die youll be fine ill get some bandages and call bheka we can trust her he started towards the kitchen no felicity said her voice was eerily calm and steady bond stopped he turned throw your mobile away james he was staring at her sharp green eyes focused on him like a predators in her hand was his own weapon the walther pps he slapped his holster from which shed slipped the gun as hed whisked her inside the phone she repeated dont touch the screen just hold it by the side and toss it into the corner of the room he did as she instructed im sorry she said im so sorry and james bond believed that in some very tiny part of her heart she was whats that james asked gesturing at her blouse it was blood of course real blood hers felicity still felt the sting in the back of her hand where shed pricked a vein with a safetypin it had bled sufficiently to stain her shirt and make a credible appearance of a bullet wound she didnt answer him but the agents eyes noted her bruised hand and revealed that hed deduced as much there was no cop on the dock i lied didnt i sit down on the floor when he had done so felicity worked the slide of the walther which ejected one round but made sure one was in the chamber ready to fire i know youre trained to disarm people ive killed before and it has no effect on me its not essential that you stay alive so im happy to shoot you now if you make any move her voice though almost caught on happy what the hell is the matter with you she asked herself angrily put them on she tossed handcuffs towards his lap he caught them good reflexes she noted she stepped back three feet or so felicity smelt the pleasant scent from where hed gripped her a moment ago it would be soap or shampoo from the hotel he was not an aftershave sort of man the anger again damn him the cuffs she repeated a hesitation then he ratcheted them on to his wrists so explain tighter he squeezed the mechanism she was satisfied who exactly do you work for she asked an outfit in london well have to leave it at that so youre working with lamb she gave a laugh with that fat sweaty fool no whatever hes coming here for it has nothing to do with my project tonight its probably some ridiculous business venture he has in mind maybe buying this place i was lying when i told you id heard him referred to as noah then what are you doing here im here because im sure youve briefed your bosses in london that lambs your main suspect a flicker in his eyes confirmed this what captain jordaan and her moderately competent officers will find in the morning here is a fight to the death you and the traitor who was going to bomb a cruise liner gregory lamb and anybody he was meeting here you found them and there was a gun fight everybody died therell be loose ends but on the whole the matter will go away or at least go away from me leaving you free to do whatever it is youre doing but i dont understand who the hell is noah its not a who james its a what noah confusion in his handsome face then understanding dawned my god your group is the international organisation against hunger ioah at the fundraiser you said youd recently expanded to make it international in scope which meant that it used to be national organisation against hunger noah she nodded frowning he mused in the text we intercepted last weekend noah was typed all lower case everything else in the message was too i just assumed it was a name we were careless there it hasnt been noah for a while but it was the original name and we still refer to it like that we who sent that message niall dunne hes myassociate not hydts hes just on loan yours been working together for a few years now and how did you get with hydt niall and i work with a lot of warlords and dictators in subsaharan africa nine ten months ago niall heard about hydts plan this gehenna through some of them it was pretty farfetched but there was a good chance of a decent return on investment i gave dunne ten million to put into the pot he told hydt it was from an anonymous businessman a condition for the money was that dunne himself worked with hydt to oversee how it was spent yes bond said he mentioned other investors so hydt knew nothing about you nothing at all and it turned out that severan was delighted to use dunne as a tactical planner gehenna wouldnt have got nearly so far without him the man who thinks of everything yes he was rather proud that hydt described him like that james said there was another reason dunne stayed close to hydt though right he was your escape plan a possible diversion felicity said if somebody got suspicious just as you did wed sacrifice hydt make him the fallguy so nobody would look any further that was why dunne convinced hydt that the bombing in york should happen today youd just sacrifice ten million dollars good insurance is expensive i always wondered why hydt kept going with his plan after i turned up in serbia and in march i was careful to cover my tracks but he accepted me a lot more readily here as gene theron than i would have that was because dunne kept telling him i was safe she nodded severan always listened to niall dunne so it was dunne who planted the reference on the internet to hydts nickname being noah and that he used to build his own boats in bristol thats right her anger and disappointment blossomed again but dammit why didnt you let it go when you should have after hydt was dead he was looking at her coldly and then what youd wait for me to fall asleep next to you and cut my throat she snapped i hoped you were who you claimed to be a mercenary from durban that was why i kept on at you last night asking if you could change giving you the chance to confess you really were a killer i thought things might her voice trickled to silence work out between us his lips tightened if it matters i thought so too ironic felicity thought she was bitterly disappointed that he had turned out to be one of the good guys he must be equally disappointed to discover that she was not at all what hed thought so what are you doing tonight what is the project weve been calling incident twenty he asked shifting on the floor the cuffs jingled keeping the gun trained on him she said you know about world conflict i listen to the bbc he responded drily when i was a banker in the city my clients sometimes invested in companies in trouble spots of the world i got to know those regions the one thing i noticed was that in every single conflict zone hunger was a critical factor those who were hungry were desperate you could get them to do anything if you promised them food switch political loyalties fight kill civilians overthrow dictatorships or democracies anything it occurred to me that hunger could be used as a weapon so thats what i became an arms dealer you could say youre a hunger broker well put felicity thought smiling coolly she continued the ioah controls thirtytwo per cent of the food aid coming into the country well soon be doing the same in various latinamerican countries india south east asia if say a warlord in the central african republic wants to get into power and he pays me what i ask ill make sure his soldiers and the people supporting him get all the food they need and his opponents followers get nothing he blinked in surprise sudan thats whats happening tonight war in sudan exactly ive been working with the central authority in khartoum the president doesnt want the eastern alliance to break away and form a secular state the regime in the east plans to solidify their ties to the uk and shift their oil sales there rather than to china but khartoums not strong enough to subdue the east without assistance so its paying me to supply food to eritrea uganda and ethiopia their troops will invade simultaneously with the central forces the eastern alliance wont stand a chance so the thousands of deaths in the message we intercepted thats the body count of the initial invasion tonight thats right i had to guarantee a certain loss of life of eastern alliance troops if the number is more than two thousand i get a bonus the adverse impact on britain that the oils going to beijing not to us a nod the chinese helped khartoum pay my bill when does the fighting start in about an hour and a half as soon as the food planes are in the air and the ships are in international waters the invasion of eastern sudan begins felicity looked at her demure baume mercier watch she supposed gregory lamb would arrive soon now i need to broker something else your cooperation he laughed coldly if you dont your friend bheka jordaan will die simple as that i have many friends throughout africa who are quite skilled at killing and happy to put those talents to work she was pleased to see how this troubled him felicity willing always enjoyed finding peoples weaknesses what do you want he asked you send a message to your superiors that youve confirmed gregory lamb is behind an attempted cruiseship bombing youve managed to stop the plot and youll be meeting with him soon you know i cant do that were negotiating for the life of your friend come on james be a proper hero youre going to die anyway he turned his eyes to her and repeated i really thought it might work out between us a shiver ran down felicity willings spine but then bonds eyes grew stony and he snapped okay thats enough we have to move fast she frowned what was he talking about he added try to use nonlethal force on her if you can oh christ no felicity whispered a tidal wave of light the overheads came on and as she started to turn towards the sound of running feet the walther was ripped out of her hand she was slammed on to her belly by two people one of whom knelt hard in the small of her back and secured her hands expertly behind her with handcuffs felicity heard a crisp voice a womans in accordance with section thirtyfive of the constitution of south africa you have the right to remain silent and to be advised that any statements made to your arresting officers can be used as evidence in trial against you no felicity willing gasped her face a mask of disbelief then the word was repeated in rage nearly a scream james bond looked down at the petite woman sitting on the floor in about the same place that he had been a moment before she shouted you knew you son of a bitch you knew you never suspected lamb at all i lied didnt i he said coldly throwing the words back at her bheka jordaan was also gazing down unemotionally assessing her prisoner bond was rubbing his wrists from which the cuffs had been removed gregory lamb was nearby on his mobile lamb and jordaan had arrived before bond to plant microphones and monitor the conversation in case felicity took the bait theyd hidden in the workers caravan bonds flash of the torch earlier had verified they were invisible and alerted them that he was going inside he hadnt wanted to use radio transmissions jordaans phone rang and she answered it she listened jotting information in her notebook then said my people have raided ms willings office weve got the landing locations of all the planes and the routes of the ships delivering the food gregory lamb looked over her notes and relayed the information into his phone while the man did not instil confidence as an intelligence agent apparently he indeed had his contacts and he was using them now you cant do this felicity wailed you dont understand bond and jordaan ignored her and stared at lamb finally he disconnected theres an american carrier off the coast theyve launched fighters to intercept the food planes and raf and south african attack helicopters are on their way to turn the ships bond thanked the big sweating man for his efforts hed never suspected lamb whose odd behaviour stemmed from the fact that he was essentially a coward he admitted that hed disappeared during the action at the green way plant to hide in the bushes though stopped short of confessing hed shot through his own sleeve but bond had thought him the perfect bait to lay before his suspect felicity willing bheka jordaan took a call too backups going to be a little delayed bad accident on victoria road but kwalene says they should be here in twenty or thirty minutes bond looked down at felicity even now sitting on the filthy floor of this decrepit construction site she radiated defiance a caged angry lioness how how did you know she asked they could hear the soothing yet powerful sound of the atlantic crashing on the rocks birds calling a faroff car horn bleating this place wasnt far from the centre of cape town but the city seemed a universe away a number of things made me wonder bond told her the first was dunne himself why the mysterious funds transfer to his account yesterday beforegehenna that suggested dunne had another partner and so did another intercept we caught mentioning that if hydt was out of the picture there were other partners who could proceed with the project who had that been sent to one explanation was that it was somebody entirely independent of gehenna then i remembered dunne travelled to india indonesia and the caribbean at the fundraiser you said your charity had opened offices in mumbai jakarta and portauprince bit of a coincidence that both you and dunne had connections in london and cape town and youd both had a presence in south africa beforehydt opened the green way office here and i made the noah connection on my own bond continued when he was in saps headquarters hed found himself staring at her card ioah hed suddenly realised there was merely one letter difference i checked company records in pretoria and found the groups original name so when you told me youd heard lamb referred to as noah i knew you were lying that confirmed your guilt but we still needed to trick you into telling us what you knew and what incident twenty was he regarded her coldly i didnt have time for aggressive interrogation purpose response not knowing felicitys goal this deception had been the best response he could put together felicity eased herself towards the wall the movement was accompanied by a glance out of the window suddenly several thoughts coalesced in bonds mind the shift of her eyes the accident blocking victoria road dunnes genius for planning and the car horn which had sounded about three minutes earlier it had been a signal of course and felicity had been counting down since it had blared in the distance incoming bond cried and launched himself into bheka jordaan the two of them and lamb tumbled to the floor as bullets crashed through the windows filling the room with shards of glistening confetti bond lamb and jordaan took cover as best they could which wasnt easy because the entire north wall of the room was exposed table saws and the rest of the construction equipment provided some protection but they were still vulnerable since the work lights and overheads gave the sniper a perfect view of the rooms felicity hunkered down further how many men does dunne have with him bond snapped to her she didnt answer he aimed close to her leg and fired a deafening shot which spat splinters of wood into her face and chest she screamed just him for now she whispered quickly hes got some other people on the way listen just let me go and shut up so bond reflected dunne had used part of his money to bribe security forces in mozambique to lie that hed been spotted in the country while he had remained here to back up felicity and to hire mercenaries to extract them if necessary bond glanced round the breakfast room and the nearby lobby there was simply no way to get to cover aiming carefully he shot out the work lights but the overheads were still bright and too numerous to take out they gave dunne a perfect view of the interior bond rose but was rewarded with two close shots hed seen no target there was some moonlight but the glare inside rendered outdoors black he could tell dunne was shooting from high ground on the apostles range yet the irishman could be anywhere up there a moment or two passed then more bullets crashed into the room striking bags of plaster the dust rose and bond and jordaan coughed bond noted that the angle of those shots had been different dunne was working his way into a position from which he could begin to pick them off the lights lamb called weve got to get them out the switch however was in the passage to the kitchen and to get to it one of them would have to run past a series of glass doors and windows presenting a perfect target to dunne bond tried but he was in the most vulnerable position and the instant he rose slugs slammed into a pillar and the tools beside him he fell back to the floor ill go said bheka jordaan she was gauging distances to the light switch bond saw im closest i think i can make it did i tell you james i was a star rugby player at university i moved very quickly no bond said firmly its suicide well wait for your officers they wont be here in time hell be in position to kill us all in a few minutes james rugby is a wonderful game have you ever played she laughed no of course not i cant see you on a team his smile matched hers youre better placed to give covering fire bond said that big colt of yoursll scare the hell out of him im going on three one two suddenly a voice called oh please bond looked toward lamb who continued those countdown scenes in movies are such dreadful clichés nonsense in real life nobody counts you just stand up and go which was exactly what lamb now did he leapt to his meaty legs and lumbered towards the light switch bond and jordaan both aimed into the blackness and fired covering rounds they had no idea where dunne was and it was unlikely that their slugs went anywhere near him yet whether they did or not the rounds didnt deter the irishman from firing a spoton burst when lamb was ten feet from the switch the bullets shattered the windows beside him and found their target a spray of the agents blood painted the floor and wall and he lurched forward collapsed and lay still no jordaan cried oh no the casualty must have given dunne some confidence because the next shots were even closer to their mark finally bond had to abandon his position he crawled back to where jordaan crouched behind a table saw its blade dented by dunnes rounds bond and the policewoman now pressed against each other the black slits of windows glared at them there was nowhere else to go a bullet snapped over bonds head it broke the sound barrier inches from his ear he felt but couldnt see dunne moving in for the kill felicity said i can stop this just let me go ill call him give me a phone a muzzle flash and bond shoved jordaans head down as the wall beside them exploded the slug actually tugged at the strands beside her ear she gasped and pressed against him shivering the smell of burning hair wafted around them felicity said nobodyll know you let me escape give me a phone ill call dunne oh go to hell bitch came a voice from across the room and staggering to his feet gripping his bloody chest lamb rose and charged to the far wall he swept his hand down on the light switch as he dropped once more to the floor the inn went dark instantly bond was on his feet kicking out one of the side doors he plunged into the brush to pursue his prey thinking four rounds left one more magazine bond was sprinting through the brush that led to the base of the steep cliff the twelve apostles ridge he ran in an s pattern as dunne fired towards him the moon wasnt full but there was light to shoot by yet none of the slugs hit closer than three or four feet from him finally the irishman stopped targeting bond he must have assumed hed hit him or that hed fled to find help dunnes goal of course wasnt necessarily to kill his victims but simply to keep them contained until his associates arrived how soon would that be bond huddled against a large rock the night was now freezing cold and a wind had come up dunne would be about a hundred feet directly above him his snipers eyrie was an outcrop of rock with a perfect view of the inn the approaches to it and of bond himself in the moonlight had dunne simply leant over and looked then a powerful torch was signalling from the rocks above bond turned to where it was pointed offshore a boat churned towards the beach the mercenaries of course he wondered how many were on board and what they were armed with in ten minutes the vessel would land and he and bheka jordaan would be overrun dunne would have made sure that victoria road remained impassable for longer than that still he pulled out his phone and texted kwalene nkosi about the impending beach landing bond looked back up the mountain face only two approaches would lead him to dunne to the right the south there was a series of steep but smooth traverses narrow footpaths for hikers that led from the back of the sixth apostle inn past the outcrop where dunne lay but if bond went that way hed be exposed to dunnes gunfire along much of the path there was no cover the other option was to assault the castle directly to climb straight up a craggy but steep rock face one hundred vertical feet he studied this possible route four years nearly to the day after his parents had died fifteenyearold james bond had decided hed had enough of the nightmares and fears that reared up when he looked at mountains or rock walls even say the impressive but tame foundation of edinburgh castle as seen from the castle terrace car park hed talked a master at fettes into setting up a climbing club which made regular trips to the highlands for the members to learn the sport it took two weeks but the dragon of fear had died and bond added rock climbing to his repertoire of outdoor activities he now holstered the walther and looked up reiterating to himself the basic rules use only enough strength for a sufficient grip no more use your legs to support your body your arms for balance and shifting weight keep your body close to the rock face use momentum to peak at the dead point and so with no ropes no gloves no chalk and in leather shoes quite stylish but a fools footwear on a damp face like this bond began his ascent niall dunne was making his way down the face of the twelve apostles ridge along the hiking trails that led to the inn his beretta pistol in hand he carefully stayed out of sight of the man whod masqueraded so cleverly as gene theron the man felicity had told him an hour or so ago was a british agent first name james although he couldnt see him any longer dunne had spotted the man a few minutes ago ascending the rock cliff james had taken the bait and was assaulting the citadel while dunne had slipped out of the back door so to speak and was moving carefully down the traverses in five minutes hed be at the inn while the british agent would be fully occupied on the cliff face all according to the blueprint well the revisedblueprint now there was nothing for it but to get out of the country fast and forever though not alone of course he would leave with the person he admired most in the world the person he loved the person who was the engine of all his fantasies his boss felicity willing this is niall hes brilliant hes my draughtsman shed described him thus several years ago his face had warmed with pleasure when hed heard the words and now he carried them in his memory like a lock of her hair just as he carried the memory of their first job together when she was a city investment banker and had hired him to inspect some works installations her client was lending money to complete dunne had rejected the shoddy job saving her and the client millions shed taken him to dinner and hed had too much wine and prattled on about how morality had no place in combat or business or bloody hell in anything the beautiful woman had agreed my god hed thought heres somebody who doesnt care that my feet go in different directions that im built out of spare parts that i cant tell a joke or turn on the charm to save my life felicity was his perfect match at detachment her passion for making money was identical to his for creating efficient machines theyd ended up in her luxurious flat in knightsbridge and made love it had been without question the best night of his life they had begun to work together more frequently making the transition into jobs that were well not to put too fine a point on it a bit more profitable and a lot less legitimate than taking a percentage of a revolving credit construction loan the jobs had become bolder darker and more lucrative but the other thing between them well that had changed as hed supposed all along it would she didnt she finally confessed think of him in thatway the night they were together yes it had been wonderful and she was sorely tempted but she was worried that it would ruin their astonishing intellectual no spiritual connection besides shed been hurt before very badly she was a bird with a broken wing that hadnt yet mended could they simply remain partners and friends oh please you can be my draughtsman the story rang a bit hollow but he had chosen to believe her as one will do when a lover spins a tale less painful than the truth but their business soared with success an embezzlement here some extortion there and dunne bided his time because he believed that felicity would come round he made it seem that he too was over the romance he managed to keep his obsession for her buried as hidden and as explosive as a vs land mine now though everything had changed they were soon to be together niall dunne believed this in his soul because he was going to win her love by saving her against all the odds hed save her hed spirit her away to safety on madagascar where hed created an enclave for them to live very comfortably as he approached the inn dunne was recalling that james had caught out hydt with his comment about isandlwana the zulu massacre in the s now he was thinking of the secondbattle that day in january the one at rorkes drift there a force of four thousand zulus had attacked a small outpost and hospital manned by about british soldiers as impossible as it seemed the british had successfully defended it suffering minimal casualties what was significant about the battle to niall dunne though was the commander of the british troops lieutenant john chard he was with the corps of royal engineers a sapper like dunne chard had come up with a blueprint for the defence against overwhelming odds and executed it brilliantly hed earned the victoria cross niall dunne was now about to win a decoration of his own the heart of felicity willing moving slowly through the autumn evening he now arrived at the inn staying well out of sight of the rock face and the british spy he considered his plan he knew the fat agent was dead or dying he remembered what hed seen of the breakfast or dining room through the rifle scope before the man irritatingly had turned off the lights the only other officer in the inn seemed to be the saps woman he could easily take her he would fling something through the window to distract her then kill her and get felicity out the two of them would sprint to the beach for the extraction then speed to the helicopter that would take them to freedom in madagascar together he stepped silently to a window of the sixth apostle inn looking in carefully dunne saw the british agent hed shot lying on the floor his eyes were open glazed in death felicity sat on the floor nearby her hands cuffed behind her breathing hard dunne was shaken by the sight of his love being so illtreated more anger this time it did not go away then he heard the policewoman in the kitchen make a call on her radio and ask about backup well how long is it going to be she snapped probably some time dunne reflected his associates had overturned a large lorry and set it on fire victoria road was completely blocked dunne slipped round the back of the hotel into the car park overgrown and filled with weeds and rubbish and went to the kitchen door his gun before him he eased it open without a sound he heard the clatter of the radio a transmission about a fire engine good he thought the saps officer was concentrating on the radio call hed take her from behind he stepped further inside and moved down a narrow corridor to the kitchen he could but the kitchen was empty on a counter sat the radio the staticky voice rambling on and on he realised that these were just random transmissions from sapss central emergency dispatch about fires robberies noise complaints the radio was set to scan mode not communications why had she done that this couldnt be a trap to lure him inside james wouldnt possibly know that hed left the snipers nest and was here he stepped to the window and gazed up at the rock face where he could see the man climbing slowly his heart stuttered no the vague form was exactly where it had been ten minutes ago and dunne realised that what hed glanced at earlier on the rock face might not have been the spy at all but perhaps his jacket draped over a rock and moving in the breeze no no then a mans voice said in a smooth british accent drop your weapon dont turn round or youll be shot dunnes shoulders slumped he remained staring out at the twelve apostles ridge he gave a brief laugh logic told me youd climb to the snipers nest i was so certain the spy replied and logic told me youd bluff and come here i just climbed high enough to leave my jacket in case you looked dunne glanced over his shoulder the saps officer was standing beside the spy both were armed dunne could see the mans cold eyes the south african officer was just as determined through the doorway in the lobby dunne could also see felicity willing his boss his love straining to look into the kitchen felicity called whats going on in there somebody answer me my draughtsman the british agent said harshly i wont tell you again in five seconds ill shoot into your arms there was no blueprint for this and for once the inarguable logic of engineering and the science of mechanics failed niall dunne he was suddenly amused thinking that this would be perhaps the first wholly irrational decision hed ever made but did that mean it wouldnt succeed pure faith sometimes worked hed been told he leapt sideways on his long legs dropping into a crouch spinning about and aiming toward the woman officer first his pistol rising shattering the stillness several guns sang voices similar but differently pitched in harmonies low and high the ambulances and saps cars were arriving a recces specialforces helicopter was hovering over the vessel containing the mercenaries whod come to collect dunne and felicity glaring spotlights pointed downwards as did the barrels of two mm cannon one short burst over the bow was enough to force the occupants to surrender an unmarked police car screeched up amid a cloud of dust directly in front of the hotel kwalene nkosi leapt out and nodded to bond other officers joined them bond recognised some from the raid earlier today at the green way plant bheka jordaan assisted felicity willing to her feet she asked is dunne dead he was bond and jordaan had fired simultaneously before the muzzle of his beretta could rise to the threat position hed died a moment later blue eyes as flat in death as they had been in life though his last glance had been towards the room where felicity sat not at the pair who had shot him yes jordaan said im sorry she spoke this with some sympathy apparently having assumed a personal as well as professional connection between the two youre sorry felicity responded cynically what good is he to me dead bond understood that she wasnt mourning the loss of a partner but of a bargaining chip felicity wilful listen to me you have no idea what youre up against she muttered to jordaan im the queen of food aid im the one saving the starving babies you may as well give up your badge right now if you try to arrest me and if thatdoesnt impress you remember my partners youve cost some very dangerous people millions and millions of dollars today heres my offer ill close down my operation here ill move elsewhere youll be safe i guarantee it if you dont agree you wont live out the month neither will your family and dont think youre going to throw me into a secret prison somewhere if theres even a hint that the saps treated a suspect illegally the press and the courtsll crucify you youre not going to be arrested bond told her good the story everybody will hear is that youre fleeing the country after embezzling five million dollars from the ioah treasury your partners arent going to be interested in revenge on captain jordaan or anybody else theyll be interested in finding you and their money in reality shed be whisked off to a black site for extensive discussions you cant do that she raged her green eyes fiery at that moment a black van pulled up two uniformed men got out and walked up to bond he recognised on their sleeves the chevron of the british special boat service depicting a sword over a motto bond had always liked by strength and guile this was the rendition team bill tanner had arranged one saluted commander the civilian bond nodded heres the package a glance at felicity willing what the lioness cried no he said to the soldiers im authorising you to execute an odg level two project order dated sunday last yes sir we have the paperwork well handle it from here they led her away struggling she disappeared into their van which sped down the gravel drive bond turned back to bheka jordaan but she was walking briskly to her car without looking back she climbed in started the engine and drove away he walked up to kwalene nkosi and handed over dunnes beretta and theres a rifle up there warrant officer youll want to get it down he pointed out the general area where dunne had been sniping yes indeed my family and i hike here many weekends i know the apostles well ill collect it bonds eyes were on jordaans car the tail lights receding she left rather quickly she wasnt upset about the rendition was she our embassy contacted your government a magistrate in bloemfontein approved the plan no no the officer said tonight captain jordaan has to take her ugogoto her sisters house she is never late not when it involves her grandmother nkosi was watching closely as bond stared after jordaans car he laughed that woman is something is she not she is indeed well goodnight warrant officer you must get in touch if youre ever in london i will do that commander bond i am not i think such a great actor after all but i do love my theatre perhaps we could go to the west end and attend a play perhaps we could a traditional handshake followed bond pressing firmly keeping the threepart rhythm smooth and most important making sure that he did not release his grip too soon james bond was sitting outside in a corner of the terrace restaurant at the table mountain hotel calor gas heaters glowed overhead sending down a cascade of warmth the scent of propane was curiously appealing in the cool night air he held a heavy crystal glass containing bakers bourbon on ice the spirit had the same dna as the basil haydens but was of higher proof accordingly he swirled it to allow the cubes to mellow the impact though he wasnt sure he wanted much mellowing not after this evening finally he took a long sip and glanced at the tables nearby all of them occupied by couples hands caressed hands knees pressed against knees while secrets and promises were whispered on winescented breath veils of silky hair swirled as women tilted their heads to hear their companions soft words bond thought of franschhoek and felicity willing what would saturdays agenda have been was she planning to tell gene theron ruthless mercenary about her career as a hunger broker and recruit him to join her and if she had been the woman hehad at first believed the saviour of africa would he have confessed to her that he was an operational agent for the british government but speculation irritated james bond it was a waste of time and he was relieved when his mobile buzzed bill so heres the overall position james tanner said the troops in the countries surrounding eastern sudan have stood down khartoum issued a statement that the west has once again interfered with the democratic process of a sovereign nation in an attempt to spread feudalism throughout the region feudalism bond asked chuckling i suspect the writer meant to say imperialism but got muddled dont see why khartoum cant just use google to find a decent press agent like everyone else and the chinese theyve been deprived of quite a lot of discount petrol theyre hardly in a position to complain since they were partly responsible for what would have been a very unpleasant war but the regional government in the eastern alliance are over the moon their governor let slip to the pm that theyre voting to separate from khartoum next year and hold democratic elections they want longterm economic connections with us and america and they have a lot of oil tanner said gushers james positive gushers now nearly all the food that felicity willing was doling out is on its way back to cape town the world food programme is going to oversee distribution its a good outfit theyll send it to places that need it he then said sorry to hear about lamb walked into the line of fire to save us he ought to get a posthumous commendation for it ill give vauxhall cross a bell and let them know now sorry james but i need you back by monday somethings heating up in malaysia theres a tokyo connection odd combination indeed ill be in at nine tenll do youve had a rather busy week they rang off and bond had enough time for one sip of whiskey before the phone vibrated once more he peered at the screen on the third buzz he hit answer philly james ive been reading the signals my god are you all right yes a bit of a rough day but it looks like we got everything sorted you arethe master of the understatement so gehenna and incident twenty were entirely different i wouldnt have thought it how did you suss it all out correlation of analysis and of course you need to think threedimensionally bond said gravely a pause then philly maidenstone asked youre winding me up arent you james i suppose i am a faint trickle of laughter now im sure youre knackered and need to get some rest but i found one more piece of the steel cartridge puzzle if youre interested relax he told himself but he couldnt had his father been a traitor or not ive got the identity of the kgb mole inside six the one who was murdered i see he inhaled slowly who was he hold on a second where is it now i didhave it agony he struggled to stay calm then she said ah here we go his cover name was robert witherspoon recruited by a kgb handler when he was at cambridge he was shoved in front of a tube train at piccadilly circus by a kgb activemeasures agent in bond closed his eyes andrew bond had not been at cambridge and he and his wife had died in on a mountain in france his father had been no traitor neither had he been a spy philly continued but i also found that anothermi freelance operator was killed as part of steel cartridge not a double considered quite a superstar agent apparently working counterintelligence tracking down moles in six and the cia bond swirled this around in his mind like the whiskey in his glass he said do you know anything about his death pretty hushhush but i do know it occurred around somewhere in france or italy it was disguised as an accident too and a steel cartridge was left at the scene as a warning to other agents a wry smile crossed bonds lips so maybe his father hadbeen a spy after all though not a traitor at least not to his country but bond reflected had he been a traitor to his family and to his son hadnt andrew been foolhardy in taking young james along when he was meeting enemy agents he was trying to trick but one thing james you said his death hows that the six counterintelligence op who was killed in you said his a signal in the archives suggested the agent was a woman my god bond thought no his mothera spy monique delacroix bond impossible but she wasa freelance photojournalist which was a frequently used nonofficial cover for agents and she was by far the more adventurous of his parents it was she who had encouraged her husband to take up rock climbing and skiing bond also recalled her polite but firm refusal to let young james accompany her on photographic assignments a mother of course would never endanger her child whatever tradecraft recommended bond didnt know the recruitment requirements back then but presumably the fact that she was swissborn would not have been an obstacle to her working as a contract op there was more research to do of course to confirm the suspicion and if it was true he would find out who had ordered the killing and who had carried it out but that was for bond alone to pursue he said thanks philly i think thats all i need youve been a star you deserve an obe a selfridges gift voucher will do ill stock up when they have bollywood week in the food hall ah another instance of their similar interests in that case better yet ill take you to a curry house i know in brick lane the best in london theyre not fully licensed but we can bring a bottle of one of those bordeaux you were talking about a week on saturday hows that she paused consulting her diary bond guessed yes james thatll be great he imagined her again the abundant red hair the sparkling goldengreen eyes the rustling as she crossed her legs then she added and youll have to bring a date the whiskey stopped halfway to his lips of course bond said automatically you and yours tim and me itll be such great fun tim your fiancé you mightve heard we went through a bad patch but he turned down a chance of a big job overseas to stay in london good man came to his senses its hardly his fault for considering it im not easy to live with but we decided to see if we could make it work we have history together oh do lets try for saturday you and tim can talk cars and motorbikes he knows quite a lot about them more than i do even she was talking quickly too quickly ophelia maidenstone was savvy in addition to being clever of course and she was fully aware of what had happened between them at the restaurant last monday shed sensed the very real connection theyd had and would be thinking even now that something might have developed had the past not intruded the past bond reflected wryly severan hydts passion and his nemesis he said sincerely im very glad for you philly thank you james she said a dash of emotion in her voice but listen i wont have you spending your life wheeling babies around clapham in a pram youre the best liaison officer weve ever had and im insisting on using you on every assignment i possibly can ill be there for you james whenever and wherever you want me under the circumstances probably not the best choice of words he reflected smiling to himself i have to go philly ill ring you next week for the postmortem on incident twenty they disconnected bond ordered another drink when it arrived he drank half as he looked out over the harbour though he was not seeing much of its spectacular beauty and his distraction had nothing well little to do with ophelia maidenstones repaired engagement no his thoughts dealt with a more primal theme his mother a spy suddenly a voice intruded on his turbulent musings im late im sorry james bond turned to bheka jordaan sitting down across from him shes well ugogo oh yes but at my sisters she made us all watch a sgudi snaysirerun bond lifted an eyebrow a zululanguage sitcom from some years ago it was warm under the terraces heater and jordaan slipped off her navyblue jacket her red shirt had short sleeves and he could see that she had not used makeup on her arm the scar inflicted by her former coworkers was quite prominent he wondered why she was not concealing it tonight jordaan regarded him carefully i was surprised you accepted my invitation to dinner i am paying by the way thats not necessary frowning she said i didnt assume it was bond said thank you then i wasnt sure id ask you i actually debated for some time im not a person who debates much i usually decide rather quickly as i think ive told you she paused and looked away im sorry your date in the wine country didnt work out well all things considered id rather be here with you than in franschhoek i should think so im a difficult woman but not a mass murderer she added ominously but you should not flirt with me ah dont deny it i remember very well your look in the airport the day you arrived i flirt a lot less than you think i do psychologists have a term for that its called projecting you project your feelings on to me that remark in itself is flirtatious bond laughed and gestured the sommelier forward he displayed the bottle of the south african sparkling wine bond had ordered to be brought when his companion arrived the man opened it bond tasted it and nodded approval then he said to jordaan youll like this a graham beck cuvée clive chardonnay and pinot noir the vintage its from robertson the western cape jordaan gave one of her rare laughs here ive been lecturing you about south africa but it seems you know a few things yourself this wines as good as anything youll get in reims where is that france where champagne is made east of paris a beautiful place youd enjoy it im sure its lovely but apparently theres no need to go there if our wine is as good as theirs her logic was unassailable they tilted their glasses towards each other khotso she said peace khotso they sipped and sat for some moments in silence he was surprisingly comfortable in the company of this difficult woman she set her glass down may i ask please bond responded when gregory lamb and i were in the caravan at the sixth apostle recording your conversation with felicity willing you said to her that youd hoped it might work out between you two was that true yes then im sorry ive had some bad luck too when it comes to relationships i know what its like when the heart turns against you but were resilient creatures we are indeed against all odds her eyes slipped away and she stared at the harbour for a time bond said it was my bullet that killed him you know niall dunne i mean startled she began how did you know i was her voice faded was that the first time youd shot someone yes it was but how can you be sure it was your bullet id decided at that range to make my target vector a head shot dunne had one wound in his forehead and one in the torso the head shot was mine it was fatal the lower wound yours was superficial youre sure it was your shot in his head yes why in that shooting scenario i wouldntve missed bond said simply jordaan was silent for a moment then she said i suppose ill have to believe you anyone who uses the phrases target vector and shooting scenario surely would know where his bullets went earlier bond thought she might have said this with derision a reference to his violent nature and flagrant disregard for the rule of law but now she was simply making an observation they sat back and chatted for a time about her family and his life in london his travels night was cloaking the city now a kind autumn evening of the sort that graces this part of the southern hemisphere and the vista sparkled with fixed lights on land and floating lights on vessels stars too except in the black voids nearby where the king and prince of cape towns rock formations blocked out the sky table mountain and lions head the plaintive baritone call of a horn reached up to them from the harbour bond wondered if its source was one of the ships delivering food or perhaps it was from a tour boat bringing people back from the prison museum on nearby robben island where people like nelson mandela kgalema motlanthe and jacob zuma all of whom had become presidents of south africa had been locked away for so many hard years during apartheid or maybe the horn was from a cruise ship preparing to depart for other ports of call summoning tired passengers carrying bags of clingfilmwrapped biltong pinotage wine and anc black green and yellow tea towels along with their tourist impressions of this complicated country bond gestured to the waiter who proffered menus as the policewoman took one her wounded arm brushed his elbow briefly and they shared a smile which was slightly less brief yet despite the personal truthandreconciliation occurring between them at the moment bond knew that when dinner concluded he would put her into a taxi to take her to bokaap and return to his room to pack for his flight to london tomorrow morning he knew this as kwalene nkosi would say without doubt oh the idea of a woman who was perfectly attuned to him with whom he could share all secrets could share his life appealed to james bond and had proved comforting and sustaining in the past but in the end he now realised such a woman indeed anywoman could occupy but a small role in the peculiar reality in which he lived after all he was a man whose purpose found him constantly on the move from place to place and his survival and peace of mind required that this transit be fast relentlessly fast so that he might overtake prey and outpace pursuer and if he correctly recalled the poem philly maidenstone had so elegantly quoted travelling fast meant travelling forever alone

thriller writer jeffery deaver won the crime writers association ian fleming steel dagger award for his book garden of beasts and spoke in his acceptance speech about his lifelong admiration of flemings writing and the influence that the bond books had had on his own career corinne turner managing director of ian fleming publications ltd was in the audience and explained it was at that point that i first thought that james bond could have an interesting adventure in jeffery deavers hands deaver said i cant describe the thrill i felt when first approached by ian flemings estate to ask if id be interested in writing the next book in the james bond series my history with bond goes back fifty years i was about eight or nine when i picked up my first bond novel i was a bit precocious when it came to reading but i have my parents to thank for that they had a rule that i was not allowed to watch certain movies but i could read anything that i could get my hands on this was ironic since in the s and early s youd never see sex or violence on the screen so i was allowed to read every bond book my father brought home or that i could afford with my allowance i felt flemings influence early my first narrative fiction written when i was eleven was based on bond it was about a spy who stole a topsecret airplane from the russians the agent was american but had a british connection having been stationed like my father in east anglia during wwii i can still recall the moment when i heard on the news that fleming had died i was in my midteens it was as if i had lost a good friend or uncle nearly as troubling was the tv anchorman who reported that bond too would die in the final pages of the last book the man with the golden gun i was in agony until i could buy it the moment it was released i read it in one sitting and learned the truth at least id only have to mourn the loss of one of my heroes not two i have won or been nominated for a number of awards for my thriller writing but the one that im the most proud of is the ian fleming steel dagger the award is in the shape of a commando knife that fleming is said to have carried in his days working for the naval intelligence division during the second world war the imposing award sits in the middle of my mantelpiece at home as far as any parallels between bonds life and mine there are a few ill admit i enjoy fast cars ive owned a maserati and a jaguar and i now take my porsche carrera s or infiniti g to the track occasionally im a downhill skier and scuba diver i enjoy singlemalt scotch and american
