a dance of blades david dalglish haern watched the ropes fly over the wall heavy weights on their ends they clacked against the stone then settled on the street the ropes looked like snakes in the pale moonlight appropriate enough given how the serpent guild controlled them for several minutes nothing haern shifted under his worn cloak his exposed hand shivering in the cold while holding an empty bottle he kept his hood low and he bobbed his head as if sleeping when the first of the serpents entered the alley haern spotted him with ease the serpent looked young for such a task but then two older men arrived their hands and faces scarred from the brutal life they led green cloaks fluttered behind them as they rushed past the houses and to the wall where the ropes hung like vines they tugged each rope twice giving their signal then the older ones grabbed a rope while the younger tied the two weighted ends together and looped them about a carved inset in the wall quick and quiet he heard one of them whisper to the younger dont let the crate make a sound when it lands and the gods help you if you drop it haern let his head bob lower the three were to his right little more than twenty feet away already he knew their skill was laughable if they had not yet noticed his presence his right eye peeked from under his hood his neck twisting slightly to give him a better view another serpent appeared from outside the city climbing atop the wall and motioning down to the others their arm muscles bulging the older two began pulling on the ropes meanwhile the younger steadily took in the slack so it wouldnt get in their way haern coughed as the crate reached the top of the wall this time the younger heard and he tensed as if expecting to be shot with an arrow someones watching he whispered to the others haern leaned back the cloak hiding his grin about damn time he let the bottle roll limp from his hand the sound of glass on stone grating in the silence just a drunk said one of them go chase him off haern heard the soft sound of a blade scraping against leather most likely the young ones belt get out of here said the serpent haern let out a loud obnoxious snore a boot kicked his side but it was weak hesitant he shuddered as if waking from a dream whywhy you kick me he asked his hood still low he had to time it just right at the exact moment the crate touched ground beat it hissed the young thief now or ill gut you haern looked up and stared into his eyes his lips curled into a smirk he knew shadows danced across his face but his eyesthe man clearly saw his eyes his dagger dipped in his hand and he took a step back death was in haerns smirk and steel in his gaze as he heard the sound of the crate softly thumping to the ground he stood his ratty gray cloak falling aside to reveal the two swords sheathed at his hips shit its him the thief screamed turning to run haern felt contempt ripple through him such poor trainingdid the guilds let anyone in now he took the young man down making sure no hit was lethal he needed a message delivered who asked one turning at the cry haern cut his throat before he could draw his blade the other yelped and stepped back his dagger parried the first of haerns stabs but he had no concept of positioning haern smacked the dagger twice to the right then slipped his left sword into his belly and twisted as the thief bled out haern looked to the serpent atop the wall care to join the fun he asked yanking out his blade and letting the blood drip to the street im out of players two daggers whirled down at him he sidestepped one and smacked away the other hoping to provoke him further haern kicked the crate with no other option the thief turned and fled back down the wall disappointed haern sheathed a sword and used the other to pry open the crate with a loud creak the top came off revealing three burlap sacks within he dipped a hand in one and it came out dripping with gold coins each one clearly marked by the sigil of the gemcroft family interesting please he heard the young thief beg he bled from cuts on his arms and legs most certainly painful but nothing lifethreatening the worst hed done was hamstring him to prevent him from fleeing please dont kill me i cant i cant haern slung all three bags over his shoulder with his free hand he pressed the tip of his sword against the young mans throat theyll want to know why you lived he said the man had no response to that only a pathetic sniffle haern shook his head how far the serpent guild had fallenbut all the guilds had fallen since that bloody night five years ago thren felhorn the legend had failed in his coup bringing doom upon the underworld threnhis father tell them you have a message haern said tell them im watching who in response haern took his sword and dipped it in the mans blood theyll know who he said before vanishing leaving only a single eye drawn in the dirt as his message blood for its ink a sword its quill he didnt go far he had to lug the bags to the rooftops one at a time but once up high he slowed the rooftops were his home had been for years following the main road west he reached the inner markets still silent and empty plunking down the bags he laid with his eyes closed and waited he woke to the sounds of trade hunger stirred in his belly but he ignored it hunger like loneliness and pain had become a constant companion he wouldnt call it friend though may you go to better hands haern said to the first sack of gold before stabbing its side coins spilled and he hurled them like rain to the packed streets without pause he cut the second and third flinging them to the suddenly ravenous crowd they dove and fought as the gold rolled along bouncing off bodies and plinking into various wooden stalls only a few bothered to look up those who were lame or old and dared not fight the crowd the watcher someone cried the watcher is here the cry put a smile to his lips as haern fled south having not kept a single coin it had taken five years but at last alyssa gemcroft understood her late fathers paranoia the meal prepared before her spiced pork intermixed with baked apples smelled delicious but her appetite remained dormant i can have one of the servants taste it if youd like said her closest family advisor a man named bertram who had loyally served her father ill even do so myself no she said brushing her red bangs back and tucking them behind her left ear thats not necessary i can afford to skip a meal bertram frowned and she hated the way he looked at herlike a doting grandfather or a worried teacher just the night before two servants had died eating their daily rations though theyd replaced much of the mansions food as well as executed those they thought responsible the memory lingered in alyssas mind the way the two had retched their faces turning a horrific shade of purple she snapped her fingers and the many waiting servants rushed to clear the trays away despite the rumble in her belly she felt better with the food gone at least now she could think without fear of choking or convulsing to death on some strange toxin bertram motioned to a chair beside her and she gave him permission to sit i know these are not peaceful times he said but we cannot allow fear to control our lives that is a victory you know the thief guilds have longed for were approaching the fifth anniversary of the bloody kensgold alyssa said referring to a gathering of the trifect the three wealthiest families of merchants nobles and power brokers in all of dezrel on that night thren felhorn had led an uprising of thief guilds against the trifect burning down one of their mansions and attempting to annihilate every last one of their leaders hed failed and his guild had broken to a fraction of its former size on that night alyssa had assumed control after the death of her father victim to an arrow as theyd fought to protect their home i know bertram said is that what distracts you so leon and james have both agreed to delay another kensgold until this dangerous business is over with and when will that be she asked as another servant arrived with a silver cup of wine i hide here in my mansion fearful of my food and scared of every shadow in my bedroom we cannot defeat the guilds bertram weve broken them fractured many to pieces but its like smashing a puddle with a club they all come back together under new names new leaders the end is approaching bertram said this is threns war and he champions it with every bit of his strength but he is not so strong not so young his spider guild is far from the force it used to be in time the other guilds will see reason and turn against him until then we have only one choice left before us and that is to endure alyssa closed her eyes and inhaled the scent of the wine for a moment she wondered if it was poisoned but she fought the paranoia down she would not sacrifice such a simple pleasure she couldnt give the rogues that much of a victory still when she drank it was a small sip you told me much the same after the kensgold she said setting down the cup as you have every year for the past five the mercenaries have bled us dry our mines to the north no longer produce the yields they were renowned for the king is too frightened to help us how long until we eat in rags without coin for servants and wood for fires we are on the defensive bertram said accepting his own cup of wine such is our fate for being a large target but the bloodshed has slowed you know that as well as i be patient let us bleed them as they bleed us the last thing we want is to inflame their passions while we still appear weak and leaderless alyssa felt anger flare in her chest not only at the insult but also its damning familiarity leaderless she asked i have protected the gemcroft name for five years of shadow war brokered trade agreements organized mercenaries bribed nobles and done everything as well as my father ever did yet we are leaderless why is that bertram bertram endured the rant without a shred of emotion on his face and that only infuriated alyssa further again she felt like a schoolchild before her teacher and part of her wondered if that was exactly how her advisor thought of her i say this only because the rest of dezrel believes it he said when she was finished you have no husband and the only heir to the gemcroft name is a bastard of unknown heritage dont talk about nathaniel that way she said her voice turning cold dont you dare speak ill against my son bertram raised his hands and spread his palms i meant no offense milady nathaniel is a good child smart too but a lady of your station should be partnered with someone equally influential youve had many suitors surely youve taken a liking to one of them alyssa took another sip of wine her eyes glancing up at the shadowy corners of the dining hall leave me she said all of you well speak of this another time bertram stood bowed and followed the servants out come down zusa she told the ceiling you know youre always welcome at my table there is no need for you to skulk and hide clinging like a spider to the wall zusa smiled down at her with deceptive ease she let go falling headfirst toward the carpet a deft twist of her arms a tuck of her knees and she landed gracefully on her feet her long cloak billowing behind her instead of any normal outfit she wore long strips of cloth wrapped around her body hiding every inch of skin except for above her neck alyssa was still pleased to see zusa had once belonged to a strict order of karak the dark god upon her willful exile zusa had cast aside the cloth from her face revealing her stunning looks and her beautiful black hair which she kept cropped short around her neck two daggers hung from her belt wickedly sharp let me be the one in the shadows zusa said smiling that way you are safe for no assassin can hide there beside me alyssa gestured for her friend to sit zusa refused but alyssa took no offense it was just one of the skilled ladys many quirks the woman had rescued her from rape and torture years before and then helped protect her estate from threns plans she owed her life to zusa so if she wanted to stand instead of sit she was more than welcome did you hear everything alyssa asked everything of worth the old man is scared he tries to be the rock in a storm to survive by doing nothing until it passes sometimes a sound strategy zusa smirked this storm will not pass not without action not with his cowardly action you know what bertram wants he wants you bedded and yoked to another man then your womanly passions may be safely ignored and he can rule through your husband bertram has no desire for power zusa lifted an eyebrow can you know for sure he is old but not dead alyssa sighed and drained the rest of her glass what should i do she asked she felt tired lost she badly missed her son shed sent nathaniel north to felwood castle to foster with lord gandrem at least there he was safe from the thief guilds and the training he received would help him later in life bertrams questionare there any you have taken a fancy to zusa asked alyssa shrugged mark tullen was attractive though his station is probably lower than bertram would prefer at least he was willing to talk to me instead of staring down my blouse also that noble who runs our mines arthur something hadfield zusa said thats right hes pleasant enough and not uglylittle distant though guess thats just a product of being older the older the less likely to cavort with other women hes more than welcome to alyssa said she stood and turned away trying to voice a silent fear shed held onto for years a fear that had strangled her relationships and kept her unmarried but any child we havethat will become the gemcroft heir too many will shove nathaniel aside deem him unfit unworthy i cant do that to him zusa i cant deny him his right hes my firstborn she felt zusas arms slip around her startled by the uncommon display of emotion she accepted the hug if your son is strong he will claim what is his no matter what the world tries she said do not be afraid thank you alyssa said pulling back and smiling what would i do without you may we never find out zusa said bowing low alyssa waved her off then retreated to her private chambers she stared out the thick glass window beyond her mansions great walls to the city of veldaren she found herself hating the city hating every dark corner and crevice always it conspired against her waiting with poison and dagger to no she had to stop thinking like that she had to stop letting the thief guilds control every aspect of her life through force and fear so she sat at her desk pulled out an inkwell and piece of parchment and paused shed sent nathaniel away to protect him to be fostered with a good family not so long ago her father had done the same and she remembered her anger her loneliness and her feelings of betrayal once more she understood her father in a way she never had before he really had hidden her because he loved her not to get her out of the way like she once thought still how angry shed been when she returned her decision made she dipped the quill in the ink and began writing my dear lord tullen she began i have a request for you involving my son nathaniel biggs kept watch at the door while the rest of the hawk guild cleared away the bodies how many will be with him asked one as he wrapped one in its dark gray cloak depends said biggs on what biggs rolled his eyes on who is coming if its veliana only a handful if its garrick thoughmaybe twenty the other thiefs face twitched at that there were only ten of them weaving through the empty tables and quiet furnaces of the smiths workplace so what do we do if its him biggs turned grabbed his shirt and yanked him close i didnt betray my guild and execute my friends so you can turn tail and run he said his knife was in his hand and he pressed it against the shaking thiefs belly we hide and we kill you know how to do that right biggs shoved him away and turned back to the door they still had ten minutes until the expected rendezvous but it wouldnt surprise him if either showed up early hed worked the deal himself a supposed trade between the hawks and the ash involving a powder hallucinogen that many nobles had taken a fancy to the money was absurd by far the best score for the ailing ash guild in over a year and now his former guildmates lay dead and once their leaders fell biggs knew he would take control the hawks guildleader kadish vel had promised it into position said the present highest ranking member of the hawks a thin man named kenny whose nasally voice annoyed biggs to no end and for the love of the gods keep it quiet kenny slid beside biggs and glanced up and down the dark streets you sure theyre coming he asked i know what im doing biggs said glaring a deal this big needs one of the two leaders to show i hope its garrick but itll probably be veliana not a bad thing though shes the scary one could kill garrick in a clean fight and even easier in a dirty one not sure why she hasnt taken control yet but i aint giving her time to change her mind if shes the one you make sure you get her first kenny lifted his small custom crossbow and winked ive shot the nipple off a whore at twenty yards he said bastard whatd she do to you kenny laughed after that she did everything i asked of course biggs chuckled despite himself and their need for quiet remind me to never he stopped for he heard a scream from the other side of the building what the fuck asked kenny spinning about the ash send more scouts doubt it said briggs watch the door ill take care of this he tightened his grip on his dagger and ran through a maze of anvils and firepits while the full moon kept the streets bright inside the smithy was dark and confusing he heard a second scream and when he turned toward it he smacked his knee into the edge of an anvil he sucked his breath in through his teeth and tried to ignore the pain whats going on he asked deciding stealth and silence were pointless with the hawks howling bloody murder he heard the sound of scuffling then rattling of weaponry when he reached where the shop opened up into various displays of blades hilts and machinery he stopped there was another door in the back and it was open moonlight shone through falling upon bodies that lay crumpled about at first biggs thought them ash guildmembers but then he saw their cloaks and knew otherwise standing over them was a man who the fuck are you asked biggs the man looked up and smiled his skin was dark and his long hair darker he wore the red robes of a wizard though he held a dagger in hand instead of a staff blood dripped from its edge covering his features was a mask of gray cloth pulled tight across his face with two large slits to allow sight his brown eyes sparkled with amusement i have no name said the intruder with blood on his hands but if karak asks who sent you to his abyss tell him the councils reaper the outcast or the dark man in red he was chuckling and the sound raised the hairs on the back of biggss neck youre crazy he said you know who you just killed youll have the fury of the hawk guild come down on you he was blustering of course hed made a quick count of the bodies and knew that besides him and kenny only two others remained alive in the smithy still he couldnt act weak it took all his concentration to keep the dagger from shaking in his hand the stranger made a flicking motion flinging tiny globs of blood biggs swore as they flecked across his shirt and pants they have to know i exist first he said snapping his fingers the blood caught fire burning as if it were lamp oil the heat came sudden and intense biggs fought an impulse to drop and roll magic fire would not snuff out so easily as he felt his flesh burn he lunged his dagger aiming for the strangers chest before he could reach the man fled still laughing still mocking instead of chasing biggs turned and ran for the other entrance kenny he shouted get your ass back it seemed his own shadow tripped him there was no other way to describe the strange sight and sensation his head cracked against an anvil on the way down and the sudden pain disorientated him beyond all measure his stomach heaved and he thought he would vomit when he got to his feet he bolted not knowing if it was the right way or not he didnt care he had to move he had to escape that terrible man who could burn blood with a snap of his fingers gods biggs cried kenny as he plowed right into him biggs clutched him to remain standing and this time he did vomit the mess splattered across kennys shoes but to kennys credit he didnt bat an eye kill him biggs said turning and pointing the stranger approached his dagger still in hand you have but a few left he said as the blood upon his blade burned like embers fresh from a hearth the light danced across his masked face casting an orange haze over the gray biggs stepped back doing his best to ignore the pain of his burns and the throbbing of his head what to kill you asked kenny all we need is me he lifted his crossbow and fired the bolt bounced off as if the strangers skin were made of stone a spellcaster said kenny damn it biggs what shit did you get us in to the mans grin spread but he didnt laugh it seemed the time for laughter was over a gleam shone in his eye like a predator ready to pounce upon its prey from either side two more thieves rushed from their hiding places kenny laughed and biggs realized it had been a trap all along prepared while he ran headlong like a fool to see the reason for the commotion the two thieves stabbed but their daggers struck only cloth the stranger twisted and fell avoiding both blows when he hit the ground his hands became a blur of strange motions an explosion of fire blinded biggss vision in the darkness and then he heard the screams dont worry kenny said as biggs took a step forward doing his best to ignore the charred corpses before him i keep this baby for special occasions like this biggs saw him pull a bolt out from one of his many pockets its tip glistening with silver the stranger rolled along the floor until safely hidden behind a giant hearth kenny took a wide step around trying to get a clear shot what are they paying you for kenny asked wizards arent supposed to get involved with mundane affairs and they sure as shit arent supposed to hire out as assassins whats your game no game biggs kept close to kenny standing opposite his triggerarm and keeping his dagger ready in case the stranger charged and i am no wizard a necromancer then kenny asked whats this to you another sidestep each one slow and careful just as kenny prepared his crossbow so too could he be preparing a spell not a necromancer how are you so blind you the lowest rung of the worlds ladder cannot see what i am enough riddles whats your name and your price out of everything you ask name and price the stranger said suddenly stepping from the shadows and into their line of sight the bolt fired biggs saw kenny shift the crossbow to the side just the slightest amount as if anticipating a dodge none came the stranger let the bolt hit him and it pierced into his shoulder just below his collarbone he gasped at the pain leaned forward and then to biggss horror steadied himself and stood erect namepricei have neither reload biggs shouted stepping between them and holding his dagger out fire danced in the strangers eyes then to his hands knowing he had to buy his ally time biggs let out a curse and dashed in swinging for the mans neck he never made it the fire consumed his clothes its heat beyond anything hed ever felt his legs refused to obey as he collapsed he looked back hoping kenny would at least kill the bastard whod done him in but of course the rogue was long gone running like the intelligent coward he was you died for nothing he heard the stranger say as the pain vanished amid a wave of darkness his voice echoed in the chambers of his mind slowly fading slowly dying nothing v eliana led them down the alleyway her daggers sheathed at her hip still her hands never strayed far from their hilts something about this meeting felt worrisome perhaps it was the great amount of coin about to change hands ever since james berens death things had gone poorly for the ash guild james had been more than their leader hed been a sign of stability during the chaos and bloodshed hed died defying thren felhorn and while in a nobler world that might have meant something in theirs it brought about the near dissolution of the guild hurry she whispered ushering the rest of her guildmates along they were at the very edge of their pitifully small territory the last thing she needed was an ambush even if they fought if off the delay might be enough to disrupt their sale they were supposed to meet a wealthy and eccentric merchant from ker all itd take was a few minutes of fret and worry before he took his things and left assuming the men shed sent in advance let the merchant leave they curved through the streets which narrowed because of the stalls that sprang up along the sides they were passing many leatherworks and metal smiths almost there she stopped at an intersection with a main road leading toward the castle looked about for patrols and then continued on when she saw none the sky was clear and bright but still the chill seeped through her clothes and into her skin she hated winter it made her hurry made her spend only four seconds checking a turn when she should spend five if she were to make any prediction itd be that when she was buried itd be when the ground was cold and hard assuming she was buried at all given her life even that was far from a given were here she said a quick set of instructions sent two around to the other side and then the remaining six followed her through the main door she let one of her guildmembers pryor go first just in case there was a trap when she heard him gasp she thought it so and she drew her daggers but instead she heard her name vel she followed pryor in and surveyed the area a man waited for them he sat atop a large crate presumably their red powder for the deal his body bent over as if greatly burdened he wore red robes stained with ash and blood his skin was dark and his hair darker in one hand he held a dagger the other a long piece of gray cloth when he lifted his head she stared into his brown eyes and saw a combination of fury and hopelessness that frightened her he was handsome but she felt no attraction how could she seeing a gaze like that all around him burned to ash and bone were bodies what is going on she asked stunned by the sight you were betrayed said the strange man one of your own helped kill the others so they might prepare an ambush who veliana asked the man slowly shook his headthis is my time to speak he said ask your questions when i am done for i need your ears listening and your mind open i do not know who prepared your betrayal but i am sure they are one of the dead at my feet they are ash now a fitting end given the name of your guild think now on what you see i handled what seven men of yours could not where they died betrayed i came and killed the betrayers i am alone woman now ask yourself what use might i be to you surely i am worth the seven that died hes lying said pryor he killed them all greg brendanhe killed them the man shook his head and his shoulders sagged further dont make a fool of yourself fools die around me as is fitting veliana cried out for her pryor to stop but it was too late he flung a dagger at the stranger who avoided the hasty throw by a simple tilt of his head his retaliation came swift his dagger piercing a lung as it embedded into the thiefs chest the rest of the ash guild prepared to attack but veliana snapped at them to remain back who are you she asked what is your name for a moment his look shifted and she saw an incredible sadness lurking behind those eyes he lifted the gray cloth and let it unfurl from his hand revealing the eyeholes my real name is lost he said for it was banished from me by a power i cannot challenge i have only the name they left me i am death and this is my mask and then he smiled and she found that just maybe she could find him attractive youll start as the lowest rank she told him youll receive no special treatment no favors that acceptable he nodded a quick word from her and the ash members hurried forward to grab the crate death stepped aside and he watched with disinterest veliana chewed her lip as she thought of what exactly she would tell garrick lowe their new guildmaster he wouldnt be too thrilled with the loss of men but at least they still had their merchandise as for this death and his mask she slipped closer she wanted to understand him his motives he might be a trap or a disaster she was blindly bringing in to their guild the blame would all fall on her dont betray me she whispered to him as the rest hauled off the crate i dont care how strong you think you are ive fought stronger ive survived better you walk into this willingly but the only way you walk out is dead do you understand me he tied the cloth over his face and through the holes in the mask winked at her the only way i leave will be as your guildmaster he said because of the mask she could not see if he smiled or search his features for tells in the end she decided it didnt matter come with me she said youre bound to make waves so i think it best garrick meet with you nowassuming he trusts you enough to be in the same room he moved faster than she thought possible his left hand wrapped around her waist his right grabbed her wrist and he pulled her close she tried to draw her dagger but he held her tight their eyes locked on one another you were brave enough to come this close he said his voice nearly a whisper and even in my arms you do not tremble i will remember that tell me woman what is your name veliana she said he let her go she slapped him and he straightened his mask deserved and well worth it he said lead on veliana i wish to see your guildmaster s he waited until theyd secured the powder in a separate safe house before taking the strange man with her to meet garrick theyd moved around many times a result of their weak status and constant war with the rest of the guilds only recently had they made peace with most though the hawk guild still preyed heavily upon them if not for thisdeaththen veliana knew there was a good chance shed be a corpse assuming he wasnt part of the trap their current base was in the confines of a small merchant guild one desperate enough for coin that theyd accepted garricks bribes as lairs went it wasnt the most secretive but at least it was warm in the winter months and moderately well furnished veliana led them through a side door four steps down they stopped at a basement door with small lamps burning for light at either side she frowned at the lack of guards no doubt they were on the inside garrick liked having his protectors there with him at all times even if it wasnt safer they should have been out in the cold keeping watch so they could lock and bar the door if something went awry but of course the door was locked and barred anyway when she tried to open it rolling her eyes she knocked twice then once she heard the scraping of metal and then a slit opened to reveal a bloodshot pair of eyes say the pass said the guard veliana now open the damn door there was a password of course three even in case she needed to alert them to a hidden threat but she was in no mood and she knew the guard on the other side was too spineless to refuse her entrance the slit closed and as they heard a loud thumping death chuckled behind her your professionalism is astounding he said i know i came with few expectations but still i feel them failing to be met quiet she said and stay here ill need to introduce you to garrick first she paused and gave him a glance the mask hid his face but she couldnt fight off the feeling he was smirking at her just how should i introduce you anyway she asked i told you i have no name that makes for a poor introduction should i call you death its a little over the top but ive heard worse death might be too great a mantle for me to wear said the man but i can bear no name for the curse given me all i have is my mask perhaps you can call me that the door opened and she stepped inside a guard stood at either side their daggers drawn the room was well lit with many lanterns at one end were tables of maps documents and a locked chest for guild funds at the other were blankets pillows and illegal measures of comfort amid the meager luxury sat garrick his eyes glazed from the substance he smoked through a short pipe several other men lay scattered about him their senses just as dull from the smoke and liquor veliana garrick said standing did the trade go through as he stopped as velianas guest shoved his way inside so fast that he was beside her before the guards reacted he made no threatening motion only stayed at her side with an elaborate bow he greeted the guildmaster mighty garrick how the shadows tremble when i mention your name he said and veliana felt anger burn inside her at the obvious sarcasm garrick however seemed oblivious to it instead he appeared worried by the newcomers strange attire and sudden entrance he stepped back and ran a hand through his long brown hair a sign veliana knew meant he was nervous and who are you he asked a friend of velianas this isdeaths mask she said he helped us tonight may have saved many lives weve been betrayed garrick when we do you still have the powder garrick interrupted iyes we do good good said garrick he sat back down on the cushions drew his dagger and held it in hand while he listened now what is this betrayal you speak of and tell me again he made a sound like a cross of a laugh and a cough who this deathdeathmask is one of your men betrayed you killed the rest and hoped to have the hawks destroy your guild as you came to make the trade said deathmask accepting the name without pause i killed them as a way of showing you my worth i wished to join your ash guild and veliana has accepted me veliana opened her mouth to correct him then shut it it was pointless to argue now and garricks eyes flared at what hed heard he set his pipe aside and gently touched the tip of his dagger and how did you know this ambush was to take place he asked deathmask smiled but did not answer no matter garrick said i take it our betrayer was killed painfully said deathmask good the more pressing question then is why the hawks are so eager to come down on us i must think about this think asked veliana we need to counter and quickly before they know their ambush failed surely theres a few of theirs scouting our streets if we can mark our borders with their blood we can send a message we will do no such thing garrick said he winced as he pierced his skin with the daggers tip but instead of cleaning it he watched the blood trickle down the blade i will handle this in my own manner kadish vel is no real threat to us with all due respect said deathmask hed have killed either of you today if it werent for me the room turned silent and the rest of the thieves lounging about watched as if awaiting an execution is that so asked garrick veliana tensed wondering what he would do then it is a good thing we have you now isnt it patrick take him upstairs and get him fitted for a cloak wouldnt want him showing the wrong colors would we deathmask bowed shot veliana a wink and then followed his escort out of the basement garrick stood and looked to the others out he told them youve smoked enough of my wealth get out they all jumped to leave all but veliana she could see the way he stared at her and knew herself exempt from the command as the last shut the door garrick strode over and grabbed her by the throat have you lost your damn mind he asked she kept her breathing calm as his fingers tightened he wouldnt leave a bruise not yet but if he did and have you lost yours she asked he raised an eyebrow the veins in his eyes pulsed their edges yellow in answer to his question she drew one of her daggers and pressed its edge against his wrists tighter she said i dare you he let her go and stepped back blood dripped from his finger and he glared at the stains on the floor i am your guildmaster he said as if that should have meant everything i could replace you in a heartbeat but theyll never follow you garrick said gesturing toward the door them out theretheyre savages theyre pigs if they thought the only thing standing between them and ruling this guild waswas a woman theyd strip you naked and take turns owning you theyd die if they tried veliana said she knew garrick thought himself worth far more than he really was but this was the most brazen hed ever been something had changed given him confidencebut what some yes said garrick and a gleam shone in his drugmaddened eyes but not all you need me vel they listen to me they trust me i kept this guild together after jamess death i kept our dealings going i kept our coffers from emptying and our territory from becoming nothing more than a single penniless street that was me veliana shouted not caring if others might hear from behind the door im the one who bloodied her hands im the one who gave them stability but do they know that he asked he stepped closer to her a smile growing on his face it was the drugs she thought it had to be the drugs ignoring the daggers he gently ran a hand along the wicked scar across her beautiful face cutting from forehead to chin discoloring her right eye from a dazzling violet to a red orb of blood they wont follow you he said again youre damaged beauty youre dangerous and they respect that but they wont submit to it they listen now only because the specter of my authority hangs over you just like it did with james you need me just as i need you more even never forget that she bit her tongue and fought down a thousand fantasies of plunging her daggers deep into his throat garrick walked back to his cushion retrieved his pipe and began the laborious process of filling it anew i dont care how powerful that freak is he said meaning deathmask i want him killed by tomorrow night no matter how you do it hes clearly trouble and in someones pocket cut his throat before he can accomplish whatever task he was sent here for deathmask what a stupid name if you say so she said nodding her head ill be in my quarters i trust youll handle the matter of the hawk guild in an appropriate manner garrick smiled as she headed for the door dear veliana there are a thousand promises and lies between us all you arent aware of half of them trust me well be fine she left without giving him the dignity of a response h aern slept beside the shop of a baker hed befriended besides gaining an occasional scrap of bread it let him take in the warm smells while he slept he kept himself wrapped in blankets never bothering to hide his face his blond hair was matted to the sides of his head much of his skin covered with dirt hed always been a clean meticulous child more than anything since his selfimposed exile from the spider guild that bothered him the most he knew there were ways he could wash up obtain cleaner clothes but itd never work what homeless coinless man lived on the side of the street yet kept a clean face and hands he had a small bowl before him not expecting any alms but feeling his heart warm when he received them it was mainly there for looks every guild in the city of veldaren wanted him dead and he wouldnt draw needless attention to himself by neglecting the minor details just before nightfall he stirred the baker had gone home for the day so he picked the familiar lock and slipped inside he stole two slices of bread dumped his bowls coins across the counter to pay for the meal and then left he ate as he walked south along the main road turning off after half a mile and heading directly into the territory of the serpent guild he added a limp and ran through his persona for dealing with the serpents he let his lower jaw hang a little and muttered a few random words practicing his lisp his name was berg he was often drunk like all his personae he worked odd jobs whatever paid him coin and that gave him excuse to know things he shouldnt know like how the watcher had intercepted a shipment of gold from the serpent guild bearing the gemcroft sigil his contact was a oneeyed ruffian originally from the far west nation of mordan he leaned beside the entrance of an inn smoking a long pipe his name was mensk what you want berg mensk asked he looked him over with his one eye and he didnt hide his shudder at haerns stink i overheard something haern said with a lisp something worth at least a silver mensks eyes narrowed nothing you could have heard is worth that much five coppers if i decide its useful one otherwise and none if ive heard it already six coppers haern said knowing he wouldnt get it but also knowing that his persona would at least make the attempt five mensk said frowning now spit it out before i lower it i was drinking by the east wall last night and i saw something something strange there were some of your guild you serpents by the wall they were lifting something overa crate valuable yes by now he had mensks attention the thief had drawn his dagger and held it behind his back so on edgeclearly the shipments secrecy was beyond important it might be mensk said that all you saw haern shook his head no oh no i wouldnt have come here for just that why tell you your own business no what i saw was the watcher he killed them all but a few we know who killed them mensk said he shifted a little placing his right foot a few inches back he was preparing for a stab haern kept his breathing steady not letting a shred of fear show in his eyes oblivioushe had to act oblivious but did you know the one who killed them was a hawk he asked there he saw the momentary pause in mensks eyes and knew he had him what he asked oh no haern said stepping out of stabbing range he exaggerated his lisp further to pretend excitement this gets me seven coppers or i go to someone else wholl pay heres six mensk said tossing them to the dirt now tell me what you know haern flung himself to the ground and began scooping up the coins all the while rambling i saw him skulking along the rooftop i wanted to shout warning i did but it was too fast you know one moment i see him and im wondering what some damn fool is doing on the roof and then hes whirling and cutting gods never seen so much blood the hawks mensk asked prodding him along oh well i saw him pull out a pendant just before he attacked now it was dark and far away but i swear the moon was bright enough it had a feather on it just one feather plus i think an eye thats their new symbol right symbol for the hawks thanks for the coppers mensk he stood and stepped back with the added distance he knew mensk wouldnt come after him not when he could just turn and run a bit of disappointment came over the thiefs face which pleased him immensely hed told such lies before always to various guilds with the distance and the dark his proof was meager but that was the point a thousand tiny lies and misdirections would add up to a far greater proof than a single disprovable accusation he wanted the guilds at each others throats always convinced the watcher was one of their own mensk would pass along what hed heard storing it away with all the other tales hed whispered over the years get out of here mensk said and i should only pay you three for something that worthless if im right you know i should get a hundred silver haern said as he limped along but i like you serpents always treated me fair helped find me roofs to put over my head i sure hope that watcher didnt disrupt anything important would hate for him to put you in a bad bind i said get out mensk said revealing his dagger those shipmentsll continue no matter what that bastard does now get your ass out of my sight before i decide to take back my coin haern fled and once he reached the main merchant road he abandoned the limp and started trudging north in the light of the stars he pondered over what hed learned every time he sold information he always managed to sneak out with a little bit more that shipment of gold hadnt been a onetime deal obviously they were important and the serpent guild wanted them to continue originally hed thought them just lucky robbers of the gemcroft mines but now now he was intrigued but of course he still had plenty of misinformation to spread this time he wound his way to the territory of the hawks putting a scowl over his face and adopting a new persona just another hardworking peasant hoping to eke out enough copper for a few extra drinks he went to their headquarters a tavern where their leader kadish vel no doubt played cards in a private room in the back again his contact waited by the door a big man whose name he didnt know only his nickname fists in working his way into the mans trust haern had had to endure a few beatings that showed where that nickname came from its late for someone weak as you said fists as haern approached never too late for a good drink he said fists smirked at that good drink you wont find that here what you have to tell me i saw a shipment coming in over the wall and i think the serpents were he saw the attack coming long before fists did haern dove to the side as arrows thudded into the tavern he heard fists groan and a glance back showed two arrows in his belly haern raced around the building out of reach of the taverns torchlight as he turned the corner he slammed into a cloaked man with daggers at ready haern rolled along separating their bodies he leapt to his feet his swords in hand with the greater reach he had the advantage and his opponent knew it the thief lunged in hoping for a strike before haern could prepare but the lunge was too slow haern twisted so the dagger brushed his side without drawing blood then slashed around with his swords one cut deep into his opponents extended arm the other kept the other dagger out of position as the thief cried out in pain haern pulled his swords back and then stabbed the man tried to block but he was unbalanced his arms poorly placed haern yanked out his blades and kicked the body he frowned at the color of the cloak hed first thought the serpents had followed him for knowing about the gold but instead this man wore the gray of the spider guild he heard the sound of a bowstring drawing tight and he dove on instinct the arrow plinked the stone beside him poking a hole in his cloak but doing no damage his attacker was on the roof readying another arrow haern spun flinging his cloaks into a confusing display and then leaping the opposite direction again the arrow missed by now hed raced around the corner cursing his bad luck why had the spider guild come now what reason did they have to war with the hawks his flight took him back to front of the tavern several serpents had come out to fight but nearly all bore crimson stains on their green cloaks the spiders moved in outnumbering them two to one haern took in the combat as quick as he could searching for a safe route underneath the awning over the tavern entrance he was safe from the archer but in plain view of the rest of the thieves theyd set up a perimeter but he trusted himself to break through he was the spider guilds champion after all their greatest creation and most disappointing failure that and they all thought he was dead a belief he didnt want to change hed grown much over the past five years but still someone might recognize him underneath the dirt one of the spiders saw him there saw the blood on his swords when he started to attack haern met his charge with a vicious assault of his own surprising his opponent with sudden overwhelming fury he batted away a pair of daggers cut open his throat and then bolted to the street two more moved to stop him but haern slidekicked between them scraping his leg along the hard ground he cut the thigh of one and curled his sword around to hamstring the other as they fell screaming he ran hoping they would not chase none did but he didnt go far knowing he was being stupid didnt stop haern from doing it he hurried back to the hawk headquarters the perimeter had closed in and it seemed most of the fighting had stopped various members of the spider guild stood near the entrance most keeping watch while a few rifled through the bodies and then he saw him thren felhorn leader of the spider guild his father why haern asked as he watched the man walk into the tavern as if it were his own accompanied by four of his men what did they do to you he resolved to find out but not now he turned and headed back toward the citys center realizing for the first time he was limping after stealing a bottle from a man laying face down in the ditch whether dead or unconscious he didnt know he took a momentary reprieve to clean his scraped leg and splash some alcohol across it after the pain subsided he continued on he had two possible avenues to pursue he could discover the reason for the hawks and spiders squabble or he could look into the mystery of the serpents gold doing his best to convince himself it had nothing to do with any fear of his father he resolved to look into the gold guilds fought all the time he had no proof this was any different shipments from the gemcroft mines however after breaking into another shop and stealing a few supplies he found one of the quieter stretches along the great wall surrounding the city of veldaren climbed the steps and then scaled down the wall with a rope he tied at the top once out he trekked northeast following the main path around the kings forest toward felwood castle beyond that were the crestwall mountains and the many villages around the gemcroft mines out there he might find some information if he could hurt one of the guilds really hurt their wealth perhaps he could end their war with the trifect he laughed as he walked end the war it seemed nothing would it had continued for ten years and seemed ready for another ten but at least he might make things uncomfortable for a while hed done his part to weaken and bleed the guilds to punish them for the bloodshed hed witnessed firsthand senke his friend robert haern his mentor kayla his first crush and delysia his father had shot her with an arrow for daring to love him he still relived that moment in his nightmares sitting on a rooftop with her bleeding over his hands hed thought her dead but kayla had later told him she lived with the priests of ashhur and then thren had killed kayla as for senke hed heard he died in the fire at conningtons estate during the bloody kensgold maybe i am afraid he whispered to the stars as he pulled his cloaks tighter about him to keep in his warmth gods forgive me but maybe i really am afraid he continued along the path part of him hoping he might be ambushed along the way the adrenaline bloodshed and excitement would have felt a thousand times better than the dread the memories of his childhood brought m ark tullen rode toward the gates of felwood castle as always in awe of the fortress made of dark stone covered with ivy among his other provisions stashed in his pack was alyssas letter requesting him to retrieve her son and bring him back to veldaren hed been in riverrun when the letter arrived not far south of felwood hed written his response in a hurry for he could sense alyssas unease whatever the reason he didnt want to lose any favor in her eyes because he tarried i seek audience with lord gandrem he called at the gate i am mark tullen lord of riverrun and i come at lady gemcrofts request the gates opened and guards escorted him in after he cleaned his boots he followed them along the emerald carpet to the throne the seat of power for all the northern plains john gandrem stood as they entered a smile on his wrinkled face he wore robes of green and gold and a thin crown of silver atop his gray hair welcome said john clasping hands with mark its been too long since you visited the distance here to riverrun is not so great that you should visit only once a year i was here in spring mark said do not tell me you forgot i wouldnt be surprised if i did john said sitting back down and trying to laugh off the error sadly i cannot count this as much of a visit mark continued ive come for alyssas boy nathaniel im to give him safe passage back to veldaren a shadow passed over johns face and he took a sip from a goblet beside him before responding nathaniel is not here he said setting the goblet down lord hadfield came a few months back and brought him north to tyneham i assumed this was at alyssas request and he certainly implied as much mark felt his gut tighten im sure arthurs done the boy no harm the old man continued said he wanted to show him the ways of the business if you know what i mean if hes to take over the gemcroft fortune a bit of experience with their mines would do him good thank you mark said bowing will you not stay john asked my apologies mark said glancing over his shoulder but alyssa seemed eager to see her son and this delay will add at least two weeks of travel i dare not spend even a single night here when i might be riding instead very well said john safe travels and pleasant nights said mark he left felwood and immediately followed the road north thankfully hed packed enough rations for both him and the boy so hed have enough to make it to tyneham alone while there hed need to resupply at least enough to get them back to felwood castle he let his mind wander as he rode itd take a week to arrive so he had more than enough time to think mark knew he and arthur were rivals for alyssas affection they were rarely together but he knew alyssa found him more interesting more handsome but arthur had wealth and influence something alyssa could not ignore nearly every town along the mountainside belonged to arthur one way or another while mark controlled just riverrun and that only recently due to the kulls execution at alyssas hand no less by the whispers he heard and the cold stares from alyssas advisor bertram he knew he was not the favorite in the rest of veldarens eyes but he wouldnt let that stop him hed been told the same about challenging theo kull who had his fingers in everything but theo had died and amusingly enough because his son yoren had tried for alyssas hand alyssa had kept an eye on marks takeover of riverrun in the wake of the kulls demise and that was how he had first met her ride on mark whispered to his horse i know youre tired but give me just a few more miles nathaniel alone with arthurthe lord was an older man calm in all things calculating every potential outcome of a choice it was as if they played a game moving pieces and exchanging tokens all for the sake of alyssas heart so far mark was losing and now arthur held a potential game ender if the boy favored arthur then his mothers heart might easily follow he slept close to the path keeping his sword beside him as he tucked into his bedroll his hard rations were bland and salty but they kept him going the next morning he found a stream to fill both his waterskins as well as give his horse a welldeserved rest he kept up his pace though not quick enough that it might endanger his mount the whole while he pondered arthurs reaction clearly he wouldnt know of alyssas request to have her son returned would he refuse come with ask for proof mark had alyssas letter of course but what if arthur challenged its authenticity mark pushed the thoughts aside it wouldnt matter trying to outthink arthur would be pointless hed make the best decision available at the time without fear or doubt that was how hed risen to his stature that was how he planned on rising even higher on the sixth day out from felwood he arrived at the mining village of tyneham the lone inn was small with only two rooms and a post out back to tie his horse he had a bite to eat drank a cup of their awful ale and then asked for arthur hadfields location he dont come to town often said the innkeeper a portly old woman but when he does you can find him overlooking the mines he keeps an eye on things and hes caught quite a few thieves who thought themselves bright mark smiled at her obvious hint i come in the right he told her but if i were a thief id share at least a token of my haul with you if only for your beauty she laughed and waved him off he received a few odd stares as he worked his way toward the mountains hed seen the crestwall mountains only once before and he stopped beside a well to take in the view they rose toward the sky like bony fingers cracked and weatherbeaten he wondered at how vicious the storms might get so far north something he hoped to not find out still the mountains possessed a majestic beauty towering above them reaching into the clouds until their tips turned white with snow winter was halfway over but he wondered if it ever ended here the past several days hed ridden through snow and he thanked ashhur there was an abundance of trees for firewood realizing he was stalling mark forced himself onward as he neared the bustle of activity at the mines a foreman spotted his approach and yelled for him to halt not from around here said the foreman as he neared he wore furs that were hopelessly dirty and giant calluses covered his hands you dress too well and too lightly im warm enough said mark he offered a hand mark tullen lord of riverrun im here to speak with your lord the foreman grunted youre in luck arthur and the boy are further in we might have hit a new vein and he wants to take a look mark tried to hide his reaction at hearing about the boy but felt like he did a miserable job the foreman raised an eyebrow but refused to comment mark mentally cursed himself if he couldnt hide his emotions from a lowly foreman what hope did he have with someone as observant as arthur please he said deciding to get it over with can you take me to him i come with urgent business from alyssa gemcroft the foreman snapped to attention if there was anyone more powerful than arthur in the village it was alyssa it was her mines that gave them work wealth and means to survive the harsh land without them tyneham would become a ghost town follow me said the foreman they walked along a path pounded flat by half a century of carts feet and wheelbarrows a few of the men glanced up but most ignored them or did their best to look busy mark saw several women wandering about with food and water for the men a few carried needles and cloth to wrap stitch and bandage the days toll of blisters and cuts he saw at least four main entrances to the lower slopes of the mountain the foreman took him to the largest where a crowd had gathered the two stopped and listened for a man had come from inside the mine a young boy stood at his side his red hair covered with dirt mark knew them both ive looked it over said arthur as he pulled off a pair of gloves and tossed them aside its a new vein all right the richest weve found in ten years well shift men from mines three and four to help drain the rest of the water and ill send word for more oxen hard work is ahead but tonight well share a glass to celebrate they cheered and smiled and even the foreman beside mark clapped in excitement mark kept his arms crossed and watched nathaniel he stood beside arthur keeping his face passive and his eyes to the ground such good behavior from someone barely fiveit struck mark as worrisome even when the cheering began nathaniel only looked around once and after a few seconds delay clapped twice mark waited as the rest of the men resumed their duties cheerfully delving back into the mines or pushing their carts for the smelters and their mills arthur saw mark through the crowd nodded once and then approached lord tullen i was not expecting such a pleasant surprise he said but the tone in his voice never matched the honeyed words mark withdrew the letter and handed it over ive come for nathaniel he said alyssa wishes his safe return for she misses him terribly i must say i was surprised to find him here instead of with lord gandrem a smile pulled at the sides of arthurs lips he had a long oval face and gray hair trimmed extremely short mark had never seen a worse shiteating grin i often talked with alyssa about bringing nathaniel here to learn the duties involved in running the mines at my last visit i mentioned doing so should the weather break her letter doesnt say that given how great her duties are i am not surprised such a casual comment by myself went unremembered mark didnt believe it for a second but he tried to act like he did either way she wishes him back he insisted so come nathaniel let us return to your mother you cant take him said arthur when marks eyes flared the grin on arthurs face only grew not by yourself you would bring the son of the trifect along the northern road unprotected he is far too precious a target for ransom let me send you some of my men as escort mark looked away and muttered arthur was testing him his reactions and hed given away his thoughts plain as day as he looked about he saw two wagons loading up not far to the south where are they headed he asked they asked arthur he followed his gaze and then answered far too quickly im not sure but they are of no matter to you let me get my men veldaren said nathaniel before arthur could leave every week they bring gold for veldaren mark shot the boy a wink not caring that arthur saw then i will ride with them he said surely we will be safe amid a wellguarded caravan arthurs grin faded very well they will slow you down so make sure alyssa knows the reason for your delay falls upon you and not me ill tell the men youll be joining them nathaniel go to the castle and pack your things hurry now do not keep lord tullen waiting nathaniel bowed to both and then ran off mark watched him go not a smart child but at least he is obedient arthur said walking away n athaniel rode in one of the two wagons while mark trotted beside them on his horse hed purchased supplies from the tavern not wishing to be a burden on the caravan though hed stayed out of their way best he could he made sure to sneak a glance at the cargocrates of gold coins all bearing the symbol of the gemcroft family each wagon had a single crate why just one crate per wagon he asked the leader of the caravan a fat man named dave each wagon has its own driver own guards own cargo dave answered makes it harder for someone to get to plotting that and well fill both wagons on the way back with supplies you should see how many tools we run through i swear for every pound of gold we dig we break two pounds of iron come nightfall they set up camp several of the guards had slept during their day ride and so they wandered about eating drinking and watching the roads mark took the time to find nathaniel the boy ate by himself huddled in a blanket with his back to a fire cold mark asked as he sat down beside him nathaniel shook his head no he said i cant be arthur says that makes me look weak mark chuckled even the greatest of leaders needs to wear boots in the snow nathaniel youre allowed to be human the boy pulled the blanket tighter about him he looked so similar to his mother the same soft features stubby nose and startling red hair he glanced back at mark and then a smile crept across his trembling lips maybe im a little cold mark laughed here then he said wrapping his own blanket around the boy this should help from here on out anything arthur told you you doublecheck with me all right why nathaniel asked suddenly looking worried you saying he lies no no mark said quicker than he meant he justhas a peculiar way of looking at the world he doesnt think people get cold remember id love to see him wander in his skivvies during a snowstorm i bet hed look like a blue ogre when he came back inside what do you think or maybe a blue orc nah hes too skinny to be an orc he yammered on telling jokes both humorous and terrible it didnt matter he watched nathaniel slowly warm to him and it relieved mark tremendously hed worried arthurs words had wrapped a spell about the boy turning him into some mindless stooge believing his every word but nathaniel was still a five year old boy and given the chance he wanted to laugh and joke as much as any other kid his age mark knew he might not be the most charming dinner guest but at least he knew how to make a kid laugh mark let him keep his blanket instead borrowing another from the wagons they slept beside the fire come the next morning mark awoke with a chill seeped deep into his bones when he stirred he saw a thin layer of snow atop the world including his blanket about time said dave who was busy untethering their oxen you sleep like the dead mark better to sleep like them than to be them he said shaking off his blanket and looking for a fire no fire said dave we need to save the wood in case the snow picks up move about help us pack youll warm up soon enough he found nathaniel sitting in one of the wagons halfburied in blankets i hate winter he said when he saw mark i hear you mark said slapping him on the shoulder just try to endure well be home with your mother soon enough the snowflakes were light as they traveled just a slight nuisance that wet their skin and occasionally stung their eyes by midday it had thickened until at last dave called a halt the wagons might get stuck if it continues mark told him better stuck on the road than in a ditch dave shot back they used the wagons to block the wind shoveled snow until they found cold dry ground and then built a fire they gathered around it their own bodies sheltering the fire from the wind that sneaked in come morning well dig out and then continue dave said as they huddled there run this route plenty of times and i have a feeling for how the weather works well have clear sky tomorrow assuming we dont break a wheel we should reach felwood in a he stopped for amid the howling of the wind he heard something strange horses said dave who would ride in this weather asked one of the guards mark drew his sword and stood and the rest did likewise there were only four guards per wagon and the eight hurried to the openings between them it might be a messenger meant to reach us said dave just before a crossbow bolt pierced his arm shit he cried snapping the shaft in half and tossing it stay down all of you horses thundered by either side and as they passed the gap many fired crossbows mark dove into one of the wagons as the bolts flew dragging nathaniel with him the horses turned around and at their return charge he heard the sound of steel hitting steel stay down mark said to nathaniel the boy sat huddled in blankets beside the crate of gold his eyes were wide rimmed with tears that refused to fall in the chill air im scared nathaniel said and his whole body shook i am too mark said as bolts tore through the fabric of the wagon thankfully missing he kept his sword facing the back of the wagon and listened he heard screams plus dave hollering like a madman from where he stood he could only see a small portion of the combat the guards had cut down two of the riders but the rest continued their charge hacking as they passed or firing more crossbow bolts then he heard dave cry something that made no sense but at the same time was certain to be true lord hadfield but why he died soon after or at least his orders stopped the cries of pain lessened swords struck rarely then stopped altogether mark pushed nathaniel further into the wagon and tried to shrink down he might be able to surprise one or two of them if they didnt realize he was inside a man rode up before the wagon a crossbow in hand mark lunged at him extending his arm as far as it could go his sword pierced the mans breast punching through his leather armor as he bled out the crossbow fired harmlessly into the air mark retreated into the wagon his blood running cold he recognized the symbol on that armor it was hadfields men all right but why why would he ambush his own wagons he glanced back at nathaniel and decided he already knew the reason mark he heard arthur call out is that you in there mark just keeping warm mark shouted back whatd your men do to deserve this deserve nothing they died in my service as all men should for their masters where is the child i dont want him to witness your execution mark clutched his sword tighter behind him he heard nathaniel whimper youd protect him mark asked as if he were my own son or at least until you have a son of your own thought mark at least until youve consummated your marriage to alyssa you heartless bastard listen to me he whispered to nathaniel hes lying i know it you need to run you understand i know you dont want to but you have to try hes cruel ive always known it now just mark arthur shouted come out and face this with honor that way mark said pointing to the opposite exit beside the drivers seat nathaniel nodded despite his fear he was holding together though they lacked any blood connection mark felt proud of the boy a child worthy to raise to claim the gemcroft wealth a child whod probably freeze to death in the next twelve hours he almost thought to change his mind to carry nathaniel out and see what arthur would do but he couldnt if nathaniel was somehow part of his plans mark wanted to ruin them it was petty perhaps but by the gods he had to do something to avenge his death he stepped out from the wagon his sword still drawn h aern kept his cloaks wrapped tight about him as he trudged along the road he felt foolish not preparing for such weather his feet were numb from the cold and hed have givenanything for a thick coat hed dressed for stealth when he should have dressed like a bear he lacked tools to build a fire especially given how heavy the snow came down movement kept him warm so thats what he did itd been two days since he saw houses in the distance farms both large and small before that hed stayed a night in the comforts of felwood castle stocking up on food and like a fool refusing to steal anything warmer to wear that was before the snow before he realized just how pathetic he was compared to natures forces his hood pulled low he stared at the white ground and kept his feet moving night was approaching and he pondered what hed do surely he could find a tree for shelter and should probably start looking but he didnt want to just yet he didnt want to admit it but part of him feared the moment he stopped moving he would curl up fall asleep and never wake again the first time he heard the noise he thought it a hallucination then it struck again and many times after it was the sound of steel hitting steel coupled with the neighs of horses he felt some of his drowsiness leave him hed headed north in hopes of discovering the source of the serpents gold could they be raiding the caravans he urged himself on and despite the snow that blew in his face he forced himself to stare straight ahead the snow was thick and it seemed as if a white fog had enclosed the land so many yards away from where he stood when he saw the first rider it was if he had emerged from another world haern dove for the cover of trees then glanced back to see if hed been spotted he hadnt the rider turned back and charged into the unseen combat not willing to risk such foolishness again haern weaved through the trees making sure to stay close to the road if the weather remained foul it might be days before he found the path he was no woodsman the city streets were his home out among the trees in the snow he felt like a bumbling idiot the sound of combat faded after a few moments of silence he heard someone yelling his numb ears at first refused to make words out of the noise as he followed the sound he started to understand where is the child he heard a man ask i dont want him to witness your execution haern surveyed the area from his position amid the trees two wagons were pulled close together the oxen tethered behind them eight men on horses mingled about all with swords or crossbows the speaker seemed older than the rest and he wore no armor just a thick coat of bear skin that haern felt ready to kill for all around them lay bodies their warm blood melting the snow beneath them it didnt make sense all of the horsed ambushers wore the same insignia a sickle held before a mountain this wasnt the serpent guild they didnt wear green cloaks what then should he interfere meanwhile the older man continued talking evidently with someone inside a wagon given how muffled his voice sounded mark cried the older man come out and face this with honor and then it seemed mark obeyed stepping from the back of the wagon he looked young his armor dark and expensive the riders circled about him as the older man smiled hiding during a battle he said such shameful behavior perhaps mark said he lunged at the nearest rider he never got close enough to swing two crossbow bolts pierced his back and he stumbled his weapon falling from his hand haern winced at least the man died bravely even if he hadnt accomplished but then he saw the child leap out the wagons front and bolt for the forest haerns eyes flared wide the kid was heading straight for him get him the riders shouted one took off dismounted at the forests edge and then rushed on his sword drawn haern flung his back against a tree should he interfere would they kill him or merely keep him captive was this for ransom too much he didnt know too much the boy rushed by followed by the soldier haern stared paralyzed by indecision if he acted now hed reveal himself eight riderswhat chance would he have hed be throwing his life away and why for all he knew the boy belonged to the ambushers the soldier quickly gained ground for he could make longer strides in the snow he kept his sword drawn and haern recognized the way he held the blade in preparation for a thrust this was no capture this was no ransom he ran feeling slow and clumsy in the snow the boy glanced behind saw his pursuer and then stumbled haern wanted to cry out but didnt dare reveal his location the soldier thrust blood spilled across the snow haern slammed into the soldier with his shoulder flinging him back before he could stand he drew a sword slapped aside a weak defense and buried it in the soldiers throat the man gargled blood quivered and then lay still you get him a man shouted from the road haern ignored him and instead looked to the boy he lay on his back his whole body shaking the thrust had cut deep into his arm right to the bone the blade had continued on piercing his chest he still breathed and it didnt sound wet the tip hadnt gone deep enough to pierce a lung with proper care he might live but at the moment he was wideeyed with shock hed need time which at the moment haern sorely lacked he sliced off a strip of his cloak and tied it around the boys arm then took the boys hands and pressed them firmly against the wound on his chest stay still and quiet haern whispered propping him against the nearest tree ill come back for you i promise no matter what you do dont let go he stood drew his swords and looked to the road through the snow and trees he saw the thinnest glimpse of the riders amid the forest the horses would be useless there he had his advantage and hed need every single one so long as they didnt know he was there he had a chance he stepped gingerly across the snow crouched low and hidden behind the trunks the forest was quiet and he heard their discussions with ease as they grew steadily heated terrance one shouted where are you did the brat lose you somehow jerek thomas go look for him and hurry i dont want to be out in this weather any longer than i have to haern smiled at the lucky break he stayed to the side and watched two more men walk right past him he started creeping after them but they stopped halfway see that jerek asked thomas as he pointed something aint right they drew their swords and looked about as haern realized what he pointed at the footprints hed left in the snow when chasing after the soldier and the boy damn wilderness thought haern give me a city any day they followed the footprints but they were no longer hurrying his surprise advantage was nearly blown he continued following using the trees to hide in case they glanced back but they were getting too close to where the soldiers body lay found them said jerek shit his throats cut haern gave up stealth knowing he couldnt muffle his running the crunching of the snow turned them about but he was too close too fast he gutted thomas ducked under a dying slash and then turned to jerek instead of the desperate lunge he expected jerek pulled back and held his sword with both hands in a defensive position haern felt respect for the man as well as agitation he didnt need a drawn out duel against a worthy opponent he needed the man killed before any others arrived ambush jerek screamed its a fucking ambush one against five haern said some ambush theres six of us wretch youll be dead soon enough he feinted stepped to the left and then lunged for real jerek bit on the feint but not enough he parried both blades aside but he extended to do so haern closed the distance between them slamming an elbow into the mans chest while they both shoved their weapons together jerek tried to separate but haern shifted again positioning his right foot in the way when jerek stepped back he tripped and that was all the opening haern needed jerek thomas asked another soldier as he approached the bloody mess haern watched from his perch doing his best to keep his breathing calm only three had come not five which meant one had stayed behind to protect the older man presumably their leader they were only a handful of paces from where the boy lay but they stopped at the bodies of their comrades two held swords while the third held a crossbow they looked and it took them only a second to realize haern had climbed the tree but that second was enough he fell upon them leaving one bleeding from a gash in the neck and another holding a crossbow with a broken string haern kicked him in the chest to force him back needing the space the last swordsman hacked at him but haern spun his cloak using it to appear further to the right than he was the strike hit nothing but air and cloth haern continued his spin slashing his arm reversing the spin and burying his sword into the henchmans stomach just below his armor pain spiked up his arm he struck on reflex which ended up cutting the crossbowman across the mouth the man dropped the dagger hed drawn and clutched his jaw as blood ran across his hands the man tried to say something but it came out as an unintelligible sob haern glanced at his arm the cut would scar but assuming it didnt get infected hed be fine frustrated at his mistake he leapt at the lone survivor who turned to flee a kick took out his knee and he fell haerns swords pierced his lungs and then he sobbed no more cursing at the pain haern approached the road he kept the blood on his blades wanting the fear it would bring when he stepped from between the trees he saw both riders on the far side the younger raised his crossbow and fired it tore a hole in his cloak as he flung himself to the side he spun around a tree and emerged but the soldier had not even begun to reload who are you stranger asked the older man what are you hoping for is it coin you want too many questions haern said watching the other fighter his hand kept inching toward his hip but for what then answer me just one is the boy alive i dont know or care he was a distraction if he lives hell freeze by morning their leader seemed pleased by the answer haern made sure he didnt blink didnt twitch didnt reveal the lie good said the older man then what is it you want now you cannot kill us and you cannot make off with my gold youd need to tether the oxen and drive it many days to town so please accept my offer take your gold as much as you can carry and i will allow you to leave youd buy your safety with what i could freely take haern asked freely nothing is free thief everything is bought with sweat and blood come spill it if youd dare haern chuckled whoever the man was he reminded him of his father not a good comparison leave he said i have no use he rolled behind the tree as the throwing dagger pierced the bark hurled with frightening precision from the soldiers hip from behind it he laughed ride off or die he shouted to them even if you have a hundred of those daggers to throw it wont matter flee or die he listened and waited the men muttered quietly and when done they rode north haern sighed and looked to his arm still bleeding and its pain was now a deep ache itd have to wait he trudged off for the boy who looked horribly pale im sorry i couldnt bandage these sooner he said as he knelt before him he pulled the boys hands away and looked at the stab you can thank ashhur this wasnt an inch deeper or youd be like the rest of them he used more cloth from his cloak to tie a bandage around his waist then turned his attention to the arm so far the boy hadnt spoken a word only watched with a glazed look in his eyes fearing he might pass out any moment haern slapped him a couple times across the face stay with me he said i bled for you least you could do is survive the earlier bandage hed applied had soaked through so he removed it cut another strip and retied it part of him thought he should just cut the whole arm off but hed let someone wiser in healing arts decide that so long as it didnt turn green and rot off the boy had a chance of regaining its use whats your name he asked him as he tore the shirt off the dead soldier beside them when the boy didnt answer haern snapped his fingers in front of his eyes a few times still nothing sighing he cut up the shirt and used it to form a sling come on whats your name were friends now the best of pals youre not cold are you after a few seconds the boy shook his head good at least he was somewhat alert he tore free the cloak of another dead soldier wrapped it around the boy and then lifted him into his arms his wounded arm shrieked in protest so he shifted a bit of the weight onto his shoulder name he said id really love a name but the boy slumped and passed out haern sighed again he returned to the road and surveyed the carnage laying the boy beside the fire while he searched it didnt make any sense the men were well armed and equipped and they bore the symbol of a lord when he looked into the wagons he saw the crates and they bore the exact same symbol the oxens harnesses had the same as well a sickle raised before a mountain if hed had time he might have scattered the gold about or hidden it but he didnt furious at his confusion and helplessness he used his sword to draw an eye into the dirt beside the fire where no snow lay beneath it he scrawled his mark the watcher at least he might accomplish something out of all this let the thieves know that even outside veldaren they were not safe from him well boy he said returning to the fire im sure its nice and warm but we have to move i cant remember the last farm i passed but its our only chance can you walk no response haern bandaged his own arm tore open one of the crates and grabbed a handful of coins they bore a symbol he easily recognized that of the gemcroft family what do you have to do with the serpents he wondered aloud no matter he pocketed them hauled the boy into his arms and started walking south there was another reason he needed space the two whod fled would certainly return and he had a feeling itd be with far more than eight men step after step he cursed the snow the wind the cold and his clumsy mistake that had cost him a cut all the while the boy slept in his arms b y nightfall haern felt ready to collapse he walked off the road kicked aside the snow before a tree and set the boy down he wrapped him tighter in his cloaks and did his best to keep hope the boys lips were blue his skin a deathly white hed lost so much blood right when he needed its warmth the most still standing haern pulled an emblem hanging by a silver chain from beneath his shirt it was of a golden mountain and as he held it he prayed over the boy just keep him warm and alive ashhur and dont forget me too i could use the damn help he put away the emblem sat down beside his nameless boy and pulled him close so they could share their warmth itll get better he said not sure if the boy could hear him or not he was so thoroughly wrapped haern couldnt see his eyes dont worry about any pain as my father once said pain is a tool that should always be under our control it teaches us when we err it distracts and weakens our opponents and for you itll help you for the rest of your life who cares about a silly scratch from a sword when youve been struck to the bone yeah he felt like a moron yammering on but he did so anyway at last he heard the boy snore and he leaned his head back against the bark his eyes looked to the clouded heavens couldnt you at least stop the snow he asked ashhur ashhur didnt bother to respond h aern slept through the night waking only once at the sound of hoofbeats he curled his body tighter against the tree and kept perfectly still from the corner of his eye he saw the light of torches unable to see his tracks veer off the road because of the fresh snow the horsemen rode right on by never mind haern whispered once they were gone go ahead and let it snow he closed his eyes leaned his head against the boys and slept until morning h aern had little food and water certainly not enough for two he ate the food deciding he needed the strength for carrying the boy he did his best to get the child to drink though other than a few quick sips he was unsuccessful his back ached and his arm throbbed but he forced the pain far away as hed been trained to do by his many mentors he carried the boy stopping every hour to rest and catch his breath any time he let him go the boy collapsed to the ground so much for making the brat walk haern thought he shook his head and immediately felt guilty of course the boy couldnt walk he was sitting at the reapers door that he had his eyes open was a miracle they walked along the road encountering no other travelers evidently no one else was dumb enough to make their way north in such weather the snow had stopped in the morning and as he followed the road he observed the chaos of hoofprints none crossed over or appeared to be heading back either they would continue on to veldaren or at some point turn around and meet them haern stayed alert just in case he was in no shape to fight a group of horsemen keep walking he told himself keep walking keep going the son of thren felhorn would not die unknown in the wilderness he couldnt he wouldnt near the end of the third day he finally found a farm he crossed the fields every bone in his body aching the boy hadnt had a drink the entire day and his skin was hot with fever part of him wondered if the cold was the only thing keeping him from burning alive at the door to the home he stopped hid his swords with his cloak and knocked i come in time of need he shouted surprised by how hoarse his voice sounded please i have a wounded child with me the door crept open in the yellow light of lamps he saw the glint of an old shortsword a man looked through the crack saw him holding the boy winters nearing its end said the man we have little to spare ill pay haern said please ive walked without rest for days the man glanced inside whispered something and then nodded come on in said the farmer and by ashhurs grace i pray you mean no trouble haern found what appeared to be the entire family gathered in the front room under blankets and around a stove whose heat felt glorious on haerns skin he saw two girls huddled beside each other their hair a pretty brown the farmer had two boys one of them of age and they held knives as if to help their father should it come to bloodshed his wife sat beside the fire tending it he has a fever haern said setting the boy down beside the stove and he hasnt had food or drink for days ill get some water the wife said as she stood she cast a worried glance at her husband then vanished into the next room my name is matthew pensfield said the farmer extending his hand haern accepted it and was shocked at how much his own hand shook he hadnt eaten much he knew but had it really affected him so greatly haern he said as he pulled his cloaks tight about him and surveyed the house it seemed cozy enough and not a hint of draft the man had done well in building it i know some of the haerns said matthew as his wife returned he had a hard look his square jaw covered with stubble but he spoke plain and seemed more at ease now that haern showed no inclination to violence good men own several fields west of here whats your full name i might have heard them speak of you just haern he replied nodding to the boy and i have no name for him i found him wounded why does not concern you that room beyond there is that your kitchen might we speak in private some of the farmers worry returned but he nodded anyway i reckon we can once in the other room haern dropped his voice to a whisper i have a difficult request for you he said i need you to take care of that boy until hes regained his health i cannot stay we dont have enough food to he stopped as haern drew out a handful of coins and dropped them upon the table his eyes stretched wide the gold shone in the dim light people will be hunting for him haern said no matter what you treat him like your own child when he regains his health hell tell you his name and where his family might be assuming theyre still alive until then give him up to no one what if they threaten violence matthew asked his eyes lingering on the gold would you give up one of your daughters the farmer shook his head no i wouldnt haern let his cloak fall away from his left side exposing one of his swords i hope you understand he said ill return and if i find him abused or dead i will repay you tenfold in blood hes sick and wounded what if he dies of fever haern smiled and he let the coldness he felt in his bones creep into his eyes how well do you trust your children your wife to tell the truth i will know one way or the other what happened to him do not give me cause to wonder matthew swallowed i understand this land is harsh and weve taken in children before once he heals up and the weather breaks ill take him where he needs to go if he doesnt know well theres always a need for more hands on a farm haern slapped him on the shoulder nearly laughed at his terrified jump good man he said now how about a warm meal he ate some soup while he watched the wife tend to the boy she put a wet cloth across his forehead dressed his wounds far better than he had and then used a spoon to slowly get him to drink haern was impressed seemed these pensfields knew how to take care of themselves whoever the boy was he could do far worse for a temporary home the soup did wonders for his mood its warmth seeped deep into his chest and then spread to the rest of his limbs combined with the heat of the wood stove he felt warmed within and without he could feel his muscles tightening from lack of motion after so much exertion and he did his best to stretch in the cramped quarters you can spend the night here if you wish matthew said as the day neared its end id be a sad man to banish a guest just as the sun sets thank you haern said he shifted further away from the fire so the children could take a turn he wrapped his blankets around his body and closed his eyes for the first time in his entire life he found himself in a true home with a real family the children bickered but there was a harmless familiarity to it he thought of his own childhood never spent with someone his own age only the parade of tutors and mentors training him to read to write to move to kill had he ever curled up on the floor beside a fire surrounded by a family that would never wish him harm had he ever been inside a house that felt at peace had he ever he slept and his dreams were dull calm and he did not remember them when he woke i t was velianas third attempt at killing deathmask and the first she was personally involved in she lay atop the roof to their headquarters a crossbow in hand what if you miss asked garrick who stood behind her so he couldnt be seen from the street then rick will take him down veliana said she pointed to the building on the opposite side of the street a man in gray lay atop it a crossbow beside him i cant believe hes not dead yet said garrick as he took a chunk of crimleaf from his pocket and began chewing are our men truly so incompetent veliana rolled her eyes the first attempt to kill deathmask had been a simple stabbing in the night shed selected one of their lower ranking thugs for the deed theyd found the thugs body rotting beside deathmasks bed in the morning how hed died no one knew deathmask hadnt shown the slightest irritation at the attempt either veliana held in a chuckle shit the guy had tossed her a wink on the way to breakfast their second attempt was actually three separate instances of poisoning his food he hadnt eaten any of it during the third veliana caught him casting a spell over his meal no doubt detecting the poison that same day both their cooks died vomiting blood garrick ranted and assumed they had mishandled the poison veliana knew differently weve given him a simple task veliana said sighting the crossbow for their door hes to collect protection money from a handful of vendors a few blocks over when he exits the door he should see rick preparing to fire in fact im counting on it hes too damn clever not to notice maybe hell run or cast a spell or pretend he doesnt see it wont matter thats when i put an arrow through his back so confident garrick said remember if this fails i make the next plan this was your last shot to get things done safe and clean i figured youd like things safe she muttered what he asked i said we should reconsider hes clearly skilled what if he isnt here on someone elses payroll what if he really wants a position in our guild garrick chuckled if hes that good why choose ours were far from the most powerful others would have made more sense or why not become a mercenary the pay would be better and then he could kill our kind all he wants im sure the trifect would love to have him on their quiet veliana hissed the door opened and out stepped deathmask he wore his red robes and the dark gray cloak of their guild as always when he went out in public hed tied a gray cloth around his face hiding all but his eyes and hair his back was to her she glanced at rick who shot her a thumbs up when she looked back down deathmask was staring up at her slowly he shook his head as if berating a child fuck veliana whispered she pulled back from the ledge as garrick asked her what was going on hes spotted me then rick should he stopped as they both watched rick tumble over the edge of the building blood gushing from his mouth and ears when his body hit the ground veliana let out an involuntary gasp rick hadnt even fired his crossbow lying useless atop the flat roof deathmask laughed and he called out from the quiet street im disappointed vel only the one he walked west and both remained silent as they watched him veliana hadnt seen what hed done to rick but she knew now that he was far beyond any normal thief or trickster only a spell could have done what shed just seen a dark and powerful one she was playing a game against an opponent she knew nothing about such was a sure path toward losing that son of a bitch garrick said hes toying with us he knows we want him dead and he doesnt care if we dont do something soon ill be a mockery to the rest of the guild of course you will veliana said as she stood youre trying to kill someone you accepted into our guild all without any proof or reason that is what will upset them not that you cant kill him she thought garrick would explode but instead he gave her an amused grin you failed vel so now i choose the attempt enough of poison and cowardly arrows its time you bloodied your hands so long as you dont have to bloody yours she said offering him a mock bow her sarcasm hid her fear she couldnt back down not when garrick was starting to develop a spine but did she really want to mess with deathmask she hung from the edge of the roof dropped down to a windowsill and then used it to fall to the street a closer look confirmed what shed already realized deathmask was equal to her in skill if not superior she found a thin razor embedded deep in ricks neck no doubt deathmasks spell had required some sort of physical contact and hed thrown the razor as a way of carrying that spell a simple but foolproof ambush but it was her man that lay dead laughter floated down she flipped garrick the finger knowing he stood at the roofs edge watching her so be it no matter what garrick thought the ash guild was hers and she would remind him of that fact no doubt he viewed her coming attempt as a winwin for either she or deathmask would die there had to be another way more importantly she had to think of a replacement for him and soon bury him somewhere she said to her guards at the door as she marched inside to think a ny deviation from deathmasks normal routine would immediately alert him so veliana played it patient two days after the third failed attempt she had one of her lower ranked members tell him he was to stay up late working as a guard she hoped the tedium might dull his senses for when she struck despite him spotting her before she took to the rooftop and waited four hours before dawn when her own eyes started to droop she decided it was time she drank a mixture shed prepared earlier in the day a combination of strong tea and herbs a few minutes later she felt the mixture kick in her head ached but her drowsiness was gone she drew her daggers and crept to the rooftops edge no arrows or crossbows this time if he really was a skilled spellcaster her only chance was at close range where she could disrupt the intricate movements needed to cast she looked down saw him standing several feet away from the building damn it she thought wont be a straight drop he cant possibly know im coming can he but of course he could he might be able to read her mind for all she knew now was the time he was mortal he was fallible she was the better she had to prove that not just to garrick but to herself she leapt from the roof silent as a ghost her daggers aimed for his neck her knees bent and ready to absorb the impact of their collision she felt exhilaration soar through her the wind blowing her hair as she fell in that halfsecond she saw him turn saw him step aside she twisted suddenly panicking hed known somehow hed known rolling with the landing helped reduce the pain but not by much her legs throbbed though most of her weight slammed against her shoulder she heard a pop and felt her right hand go numb it no longer held her dagger she tumbled along then forced herself out of the roll turning around she expected her death some sort of spell to sap her breath or explode her blood out her nostrils instead deathmask stood there shaking his head not good enough he said i need you stronger faster otherwise you are useless to me she clutched her numb hand to her chest and glared no matter what it is i wont help you she said ive worked too hard to let you destroy everything destroy deathmask said as he looped his arms in a circle ive come to perfect not destroy she lunged at him as shadows pooled around his feet bursting upward to form a wall that her dagger could not penetrate she stabbed again then spun about looking for an opening there was none unsure she closed her eyes and focused shed be vulnerable but so long as the shadow wall remained she might have the time purple fire surrounded the blade of her dagger and with a cry she thrust it forward it broke through the wall which shattered and vanished as if it were made of fine glass she had the briefest moment to enjoy the look of panic on deathmasks face before her dagger cut flesh it wasnt fatal and she cursed her foul luck shed guessed wrong where he stood and her dagger only slashed his side and cut his robe warm blood spilled across her hand they were so close it seemed time froze as they eyed one another preparing the next move for their dance he drew a blade as he shifted away from her her kick sent it flying and she stabbed again wishing she had her other dagger deathmask fell back his palms open a light flashed from them except it was black instead of white it dazed her all the same and her next two swings cut only air what is wrong she asked as she took two steps and jumped her heel smashed into his stomach and he gasped as he crumpled to the ground where is the brutal killer that bested all my plans veliana dropped to one knee and thrust for his throat not caring for his answer he caught her wrist just as the tip entered his flesh a single drop of blood ran down his neck as they struggled by the gods he was strong still here he said all trace of amusement gone his voice was cold merciless she felt a shiver run up her spine she jerked her arm back but still he held her his brown eyes met hers if only she could tear off that damn mask of his if only she could see his face remind herself he was human for his strength was unreal she swept her left leg around taking out his feet he never let go even as he fell together they hit the ground the collision bumped her injured hand and her fingers throbbed in agony they had to be dislocated if not broken still her dagger hovered inches from his flesh unable to either attack or pull away he landed on his back and instead of rolling over he reached up and held her good arm with both hands i could burn your flesh until i clung to bone he said his tone told her he spoke truth are you ready to listen or must i find another no others she said as she prepared you wont have the chance she dropped the dagger her powerful legs kicked and she somersaulted on her palm her knees landed on his chest blasting the air from his lungs he still clutched her but she rammed an elbow into his throat sapping his next few words she pressed her body against his keeping the elbow tight their foreheads touched still he held her other hand what do you want what is your game who are you she released the pressure on his throat just enough for him to speak her nerves remained on edge the second he flinched or said a syllable that sounded remotely like a spell shed crush his larynx and leave him to gag on the street i told you before i have no name he stared at her eyes unflinching bullshit everyone has a name and mine was taken from me the anger seemed to warm his very body her arm where he held it flared with whitehot pain by who she asked her voice low she wanted him calm she wanted answers before she ended his life the council of mages they banished me and declared that i had no name for i was death and so that is what i am banished for what she heard him chuckle everyone has their secrets and i must have mine what will you do veliana will you kill me or will you listen i am your last hope your guild is crumbling and youve lost control of garrick havent you her hesitation was answer enough so she didnt bother to lie how do you know that she asked he shook his head i will answer nothing with an elbow on my throat let me up i promise no harm will come to you tonight her mind whirled as she thought he was clever and dangerous she could kill him but what would that gain garrick would get what he wanted his paranoia fed clearly this deathmask had a plan but whose could it be the councils did he lie about the banishment no his anger was too sincere despite the mask she felt he spoke truth then what what should she do she thought of garricks mockery of him telling her how she needed him stand then she said letting him go as he released her wrist and let me hear you speak i will not tell you everything he said as he stood and rubbed his throat not until i can trust you and perhaps not even afterward for now just know that my assignment from the council was towatch over the guilds i know of your true skill and control veliana i know that garrick was but a puppet and you were pulling the strings but that isnt the case anymore is it somethings changed he retrieved her dagger and tossed it to her she caught it in her good hand and sheathed both blades instead of continuing he walked over and eyed her other hand if i wanted to hurt you id have done so already he said when she tensed his fingers brushed hers feeling along the bone dislocated he said bite the hilt of your dagger if you must just do it one after the other he yanked them back into place the pain was immense and after the third finger she leaned against him unable to stand he held her steady and when he finished he removed his mask and tied it around her hand as a bandage through the tears in her eyes she looked upon his face the anger was gone it was never directed at her just those who had banished him she felt her curiosity grow just what did he plan for her guild listen to me he whispered as if suddenly worried others were listening he leaned close his cheek almost touching hers i cannot do this alone i desire to create something special something veldaren has never before seen you wont be the new guildmaster i wont lie about that but you will always be there at my right hand why would i trade garrick for you if my place shall stay the same he smiled a bit of his amusement returning to twinkle in his eye because i respect you garrick only knows fear which would you prefer and i will not replace garrick not entirely my aim is greater we will be legends in the underworld vel all you must do is accept my wisdom she looked to her bandaged hand then to his eyes i must think on it time is against me right now but you may have a day and a night to decide garrick will soon stop his tricks and try to kill me outright regardless of the fallout i must have you at my side when that happens she pulled away resume your post she said of course milady before she could go he put an arm in her way that trick with your dagger he said the violet flamewhere did you learn to do something like that this time it was her turn to smile everyone has their secrets he seemed amused and he stepped aside so she could pass she went into the headquarters found her bunk and lay down not to sleep but to think she felt lost and confused there wasnt anyone she could trust within the ash guild for advice but there was one woman outside the guild who would die to protect her secrets dawn was still a few hours away so perhaps she had time veliana left her bed changed into a darker outfight and donned her gray cloak she used a different door than the one deathmask guarded and then took to the rooftops once in relative freedom she removed the cloak signifying her allegiance to the ash guild and then set out to meet zusa at the gemcroft mansion i t was past midnight when arthur hadfield arrived at the gates of the gemcroft mansion escorted by nine of his soldiers one of the guards immediately recognized him and opened the gate our lady sleeps said the guard but we would not turn away such an esteemed visitor in the cold of night i pray no ill news brings you here at such an hour pray all you want arthur said but it wont change the news i bring inside the main foyer they stopped and forfeited their weapons even arthurs he gave the guard a stern look as he handed over his beautiful longsword a family heirloom of five generations a lash for every scratch he said unless you think alyssa will not listen to me understood sir said the guard please wait here our lady will be down shortly we have already sent a servant to wake her warm some food for my men arthur said and find me something stiff to drink id rather not meet alyssa looking pale as a corpse fresh from the grave right away several servants rushed from one room to the next haggardeyed and clothes unkempt most of the guards looked a little better but they were probably used to the odd hours and constant threat of thieves sneaking in at night most of them likely slept during the day an elderly lady appeared and ushered the soldiers to follow her coming one asked arthur he shook his head ill wait here all i need is a drink enjoy yourselves and dont forget he glanced at the servant to find yourselves lodging for the night we wont go traipsing for an inn at this hour it seemed the servant got the message and even if she didnt he knew his men would hammer the point home standing in the foyer he removed his bearskin coat and set it aside a large fireplace burned at the intersection before him so he stood beside it and let its heat sink into his skin when a servant arrived with a glass he took it and gave it a taste thank you he said doing his best to hold in a denigrating remark the lady had brought him a recent vintage of wine no doubt the cheapest bottle in the mansion other than what was reserved for the hired help probably thought they were keeping alyssas interests in mind since she had not asked it for him but they should have known better he swallowed the rest of it anyway it might taste like piss but at least itd still warm his bones he watched the fire burn as he waited his thoughts racing through the recent events alyssa needed to marry soon and with mark tullen dead arthur had removed all serious competition only two wrinkles remained one was alyssas child heir to the gemcroft wealth as well as a potential danger should he describe the ambush accurately enough to blame him the other was that strange man who had attacked them he dressed like a thief yet none of his colors marked him with any guild plus there was that symbol carved in blood beside the fire the watcher arthur didnt visit veldaren often but it seemed things had gotten far stranger in his absence not for the first time he felt thankful he lived in the north where men had to survive by the plow the sword or the pick and not by the deftness of their hand lord hadfield alyssa said pulling him from his thoughts he turned to her and smiled as she approached through the doorway her hair was immaculate her cheeks warmed with rouge the dark circles under her eyes were hidden with powder now he knew why shed taken so long to come down at least her clothing was appropriate for the late hour a crimson robe tied with a yellow sash she wrapped her arms in his and gave him a chaste kiss on the cheek forgive me for ruining your sleep he said its a cruelty waking someone at this hour but i feared itd be crueler risking someone other than myself bringing the news enough alyssa said stepping back and holding her arms against her chest as if she were cold please whatever it is tell me or my mind will assume the worst arthur frowned and looked away for a moment just long enough for her to interpret it as doubt you could assume nothing worse than the truth he said at last im sorry alyssa your son is dead shed been expecting it he could tell but it didnt matter she took a step back as if hed slapped her her mouth dropped open and her hands quivered as she pressed them to her lips no she whispered tears swelled in her eyes then fell smearing the powder no no please youre wrong you have to be wrong he shook his head this was by far the easiest part none of it was a lie mark tullen came and took nathaniel from tyneham where id brought him for tutoring they joined one of my caravans traveling to the city i thought theyd be safe but someone ambushed them several days ago no doubt hoping for the gold mark alyssa asked as she tried in vain to compose herself was he arthur wrapped his arms around her waist and pulled her close there were no survivors he whispered they piled the bodies together and burned them she fell against him and sobbed a bit of rouge rubbed onto his vest and he wondered whether it would come off as her cries escalated he tightened his grip holding her against him he gently rocked her side to side his cheek resting on the top of her head he felt unprepared for her grief and he mentally delayed his plans of marriage shed need time to get over this at least three months perhaps if he could bring her closure he could progress things sooner but how she asked a question but it muffled against his chest what my love he asked tilting her face with her chin it was the first time hed call her that and he knew it would carry far more impact now given the circumstances who she asked she sniffed and pulled free of his grip i want to know who i told you someone wishing for our gold ruffians most likely come from only the gods know where alyssa shook her head it seemed as if her skin were darkening to red her whole body suddenly given over to rage when she spoke again her voice was held together by such fierce concentration he worried she had pierced his lies thats not good enough she said there has to be something some clue some mistake they made they cant make off with that much gold without others noticing no one is that perfect that calculated if you know something tell me arthur felt his opening and it took all his willpower to keep from smiling there was asymbol he said as if hesitant i didnt wish to bother you with it not when you should be grieving i have the rest of my life to grieve she said wiping her makeup with her hands what was the symbol it was an open eye drawn in blood below it was written a name a strange name the watcher i believe he is tied to the local thief guilds in some manner the way she startled he knew hed hit his mark how dare he she said he kills my son and myand mark and then dares leave his name ill see him flayed before me that heartless bastard allow me to help in the search arthur offered no she said shaking her head this is my loss and my fault i sent mark for him when i should have left him in safety it was my caravan dont forget she looked at him and he forced a mask of anger across his face he had to seem guilty not eager he had to seem furious at the loss of his men not just his gold he did his best and it seemed like she bought it very well she said kill him if you must though id prefer him alive torture and vengeance shouldnt belong to a woman so beautiful as you then blame the world for giving me this sorrow if the gods are kind ill be the one to cut this watchers throat and feel the blood spill across my hands after a long pause she asked did you bringthe body no arthur said shaking his head as i said it was a great pyre and we left it alone my son will not spend eternity in some common grave his ashes trodden on by horses and oxen you should have brought me his bones she walked to the fireplace and retrieved a bell from its mantle when she shook it two servants came running please find quarters for lord hadfield she told them then turned to arthur i need time to rest and i feel i would be poor company for you good night he bowed and followed the servants when he arrived at his room he asked for them to fetch one of his soldiers a man named oric given such haste there were no logs or coals in the fireplace and the room felt only marginally warmer than the outside he put his coat back on and sat atop the bed his joints creaked and he lay upon the mattress trying to will his muscles to relax he didnt bother to get up when the door opened and oric stepped inside you needed something oric asked he was an ugly man thick cheeks round jaw and flat nose that made him look like his mother had mated with a pig he was skilled with a blade though and meaner than any soldier hed ever employed not a brilliant man but he could follow events as they happened and every now and then hed have an insight that left arthur pleased you were a mercenary before working for me yes yeah mostly for the conningtons past year or so they got shy when it comes to killing thieves so i went looking for more enjoyable work everyone told me to talk to you and they were right he said do you have any friends that might still be here in veldaren a mercenary never has friends not if he wants to live long enough to get his pay and sure i have some contacts that should still be around what you thinking that man in gray who attacked us at the caravan the one calling himself the watcherwe need to bring his corpse to alyssa so she might move on from her sons death that and who knows where his loyalties lie he could do me great harm by telling the right pair of ears what actually happened it wont be easy oric said i never met him when working for leon but we all heard about him the thieves cant stand him but they cant find him either i dont care arthur said whoever you hire make sure theyre good enough to handle the job cost is no object oric nodded what about the boy i must stay here with alyssa in her time of need take half my soldiers and ride north i trust you to handle the matter in a manner most fitting orics grin was ear to ear if he aint frozen in the woods somewhere well find him dont worry arthur might not be how we wanted it but when it all boils down youre in control just keep whispering them sweet words in that pretty ear of hers ill take care of any blood spilling not long after he left someone else knocked on the door come in arthur said wishing he still had his sword bertram the old advisor who had worked for the gemcroft family for at least fifty years stepped inside you spoke with alyssa arthur asked not yet but i know her well enough to anticipate her response she will put me in charge of the boys funeral did you bring nathaniels body with you the question stung just as deep as when alyssa had first asked he had no body burned he said back with the caravan alyssa didnt take too kindly to that i take it shell want the remains brought to her bertram nodded it would be greatly distressing if we didnt have something to bury for the funeral not that it matters of course bones are bones after a fire reaches them yes arthur stared at the old man trying to understand what was going on was he helping him or fishing for information i doubt alyssa would agree he said erring on the side of caution she cannot judge what she does not know bertram turned for the door put his hand on the handle and then stopped i will be very busy over the next few days and will have no time to venture into the wild perhaps you or some of your men might retrieve the body for me i would greatly appreciate it anything i can do to help bertram glanced back and smiled claim her hand and youll have done all that i could ask good night lord hadfield arthur waited another thirty minutes before venturing from his room this was not his first time staying at the mansion so he knew the way to the soldiers quarters once there he found most of them asleep but when he knocked oric came to the door still armed and awake something the matter he asked alyssa wants nathaniels body he said oric raised an eyebrow thats an interesting request to fill given the circumstances and i expect you and you alone to handle it consider the problem solved oric said ushering arthur out the door we never talked and you know nothing of this watch your tongue were sleeping in the den of lions now were the lions in this den arthur said flashing oric a grin instead of going back to his room though he headed to the eastern half of the complex to where alyssa no doubt lay alone tired and in desperate need of his comfort a lyssa waited until her servants escorted arthur to his room before she fled to her own she was only halfway there when she stumbled and fell and sobbed in the carpeted hallway in the quiet of the night she felt alone and if any servants or guards were nearby they allowed her privacy for her grief she thought of nathaniel her son her wonderful handsome son a thousand memories flashed before her mind all of them tainted with sorrow his smile shed never see again his laugh shed never hear again the way hed cried at night the way hed nuzzled her breast when only a newborn the way hethe way he more sobs she felt close to breaking as if her sanity would pour out with her tears shed lost many over the years friends her father but why nathaniel why him why now how could she have made such a foolish mistake over and over she slammed a fist against the floor not her fault not her fault damn it all not her fault it was them the thieves and their greed and lust it was that watcher a monster unleashed against her by the thieves theyd pay all of them im sorry she heard zusa say she looked up wiped her nose with her robe and then nodded at the woman she sat opposite her in the hall her knees pulled up to her chest she still wore the strange wrappings of her former sect he was supposed to be safe alyssa said trying to regain control her voice quivered but a little safe and now hes dead did you talk to any of arthurs soldiers they all say the same they came with arthur along the road and found the caravan attacked with the bodies gathered together in a great pyre their only clue was a symbol of an eye that of the watcher who is he alyssa asked what is he i dont know then find out zusa whatever it costs whatever it takes find him i have never ached for something like i do for this i want nathaniels killer brought to me i want him to die by my hand can you do this can you find him zusa stood and then bowed low the dark of the streets have always been my home she said nothing can hide from me i will find him i swear it alyssa accepted her offered hand and stood she kissed zusas fingers then bowed herself thank you send bertram to my room after a few minutes wake him if he isnt already alyssa hurried to her room wishing to wash her face of the garish rouge and powder shed put on for arthur once there she dipped a cloth into a basin of cold water left there from when she first went to bed off came her painted face she was still washing when she heard the door knock come in she said bertram entered and he looked about half as bad as she felt dark circles rimmed his eyes and his face was covered with uneven gray stubble my dear child he said taking her into his arms she set the cloth down and leaned against him she felt so tired so lost its like a terrible dream she said softly one i cant seem to wake from what did i do to deserve this bertram nothing he said no woman should endure this but endure you must the gemcroft legacy must survive no matter the hardships and we shall alyssa we shall whatever help you need i am here for you thank you she said it would help me greatly if you would prepare thethe services he nodded he will have a fine funeral one worthy of his bloodline she bit back a bitter comment while her son was alive hed seemed unpleased with nathaniels bloodline now he was dead and his threat of succession was ended he seemed ready to forget all that no she scolded herself she was overreacting bertram had never said a harsh word about nathaniel at least not undeserved there is something else she said dipping her cloth in the basin and wiping underneath her eyes call in every loan we have whatever stored grain minerals property i want it all sold we need gold lots of it find every mercenary that needs work no matter how expensive hire them outfit them if need be you wish to declare war against the guilds asked betram who allowed a tiny bit of doubt creep into his voice were already at war or have you forgotten come the night of nathaniels funeral i want the streets to run red with the blood of thieves i dont care what cloak they wear i want them dead youll only reignite their anger and ruin whatever progress weve made in the last i dont care weve suffered and played the coward no more peace no more hope red bertram i want the streets of this city red bertram muttered and waved his hands as if he could not decide what to say despite her grim mood she took pleasure in his distress but what will the king think when we flood his streets with chaos the king is a coward he wont dare refuse me and neither will you so be it he said well have the funeral three days from now come that night you will have your folly you run the risk of bankrupting a century of wealth alyssa is your vengeance truly worth so much that and more she said go you have work to do he bowed and left looking far from pleased both matters settled her revenge in motion she finished washing and collapsed onto her bed she tried but sleep remained a distant hope and nothing more after half an hour she heard another knock on her door just one but it was firm she ignored it thirty seconds later she heard it again come in she said removing her arm from over her eyes so she could see in stepped arthur and he paused at the door i dont mean to intrude he started but she shook her head he crossed the room and climbed into the bed beside her his clothes were on and for that she was thankful his arms wrapped around her and in their comfort she broke down once more he was something steady dependable amid the chaos overwhelming her he said nothing as she cried only gently stroked her hair and held her against him his body was warm and it felt pleasant after awhile he spoke if there is anything you need i am here it doesnt matter the hour nor the reason i want you to know that she clutched his hand in hers and squeezed her whole body ached and her temples throbbed her tears still ran down her face but they were silent she closed her eyes pressing her face against his chest and focusing on the sound of his breathing as long as she thought about that only that maybe she could fall asleep maybe she could forget the whole damned night and come the morning the nightmare would be over maybe just maybe she slept i n searching for the watcher there was one person zusa knew would be best to meet with first behind the fenced estate was a small empty building zusas home she intended to gather a few things for her task but when she stepped into her combination bedroom and training room she was instead surprised to find veliana already waiting for her you she said i know im a day early veliana said shed taken off her cloak and wore only skintight clothing of blacks and grays ive come not just for training but for advice zusa removed her own cloak and set it atop her bed other than the bed the room was completely empty the floor was padded but still firm a gift from alyssa celebrating her first year of living with and protecting her velianas boots lay beside the door and she padded barefoot to the center of the room tell me while we spar zusa said i still feel sleeps allure so i need the awakening they both drew a pair of daggers no training weaponry for them zusa had insisted on real blades she trusted her skill to make sure she caused no serious injury as well as to prevent veliana from doing the same over the past five years veliana had closed much of the gap so now if either scored a hit they counted it a wellearned rarity have you heard of a sorcerer named deathmask or perhaps deaths mask she asked as she stretched zusa shook her head veliana didnt seem surprised thought id ask anyway he appeared about a week ago a dangerous man he has plans to kill garrick though how i dont know i think he has a chance will you kill him veliana feinted then slashed low fully expecting zusa to block their daggers connected and as the steel rang out they thrust and parried resuming a skilled dance they had perfected over the years a perfect give and take of cuts and dodges parries and thrusts they talked as they fought albeit a little out of breath im not sure if i still can nor if i want to garrick has turned against me thinks he can survive without me he may be right though he was a lying coward when i first thrust him into his role zusa upped the pace forcing veliana on the defensive as she spun and slashed men change over time as do women but not like this its too sudden i feel like im missing something obvious perhaps you are and that is why you miss it what is it you wish from me veliana leapt away but instead of gaining a moments breather zusa rushed in her daggers leading after she parried both veliana struck zusa in the chest with an elbow and then pushed her back i must make a choice but i dont know which is the right one you know me best zusa what should i do zusa pulled back from her attack and rubbed her chest veliana was terribly distracted to have thrown so much strength into the elbow i see many choices she said find what suddenly gave garrick testicles and then cut them off join this deathmask and solidify your position as second in command weave your own plans to remove garrick accept your diminished role and wait for the inevitable dagger to remove you completely im tired of the games veliana said i have no time to investigate garrick hell move against me soon i know it i promised deathmask an answer by tomorrow night will he kill you if you say no veliana laughed he might i know nothing of him then how can you trust him because ive fought him he didnt kill me when he had the chance he never showed fear even when i had the chance to end his life hes brutal terrible and driven whatever his goal is hell succeedi guess im scared ill be in his way zusa twirled her daggers and motioned for another spar then join him and do so without pause or regret garrick has turned against you inviting this betrayal hear deathmasks plan but always watch and listen every plan can be turned to your favor it was velianas turn to be on the offensive and she took to it with a wild fury that worried zusa normally the woman was more controlled this deathmask must have upset her greatly did she feel guilt for betraying garrick or was she too proud to agree to anything that left her second in the ash guild whatever the reason her daggers lacked their normal grace and she had to leap away several times to prevent blood from staining the floor restrain yourself girl zusa said at last after a desperate thrust nearly opened her throat if this choice disturbs you so much i will choose for you so you can concentrate and not kill me through your carelessness im sorry veliana said sheathing her daggers and leaning against the wall she sounded terribly out of breath i should go no zusa said i have a question for you as well someone murdered alyssas child i must discover who someone killed nathaniel she asked i thought youd persuaded her to move him up north and out of the city i had she called him back he died on the northern road it wasnt the ash guild i promise id never let garrick do something that low and hes not yet reached a point where he can plan something so large behind my back are you sure she paused a moment thinking and then sighed no im not his control might be greater than ive realized my opinion of him was far too low and it has blinded me to his ambitions hes not content to be a puppet still i cant think of a reason why hed have killed nathaniel nor how hed even know the boy was on his way is there anything else zusa took her dagger and scrawled the symbol found at the caravan exactly as the soldiers had shown her that zusa said tell me all you know of him thiswatcher we first heard of him about three years ago but honestly he might have been killing us for longer given the amount of infighting and the trifects war against us we probably blamed others for his early murders but then we started finding these runes an eye here or the letter w perhaps he thought us dense or his confidence hadnt grown yet either way he started killing more and leaving his marker larger clearer and often in blood he kills thieves of all guilds with seemingly no preference every guild has accused the others of secretly harboring him but weve never had an ounce of proof whoever he is he has a profound hatred of all thief guilds and hes also incredibly good far too many have died by his hand and those who survive can only speak of a face shrouded in shadow and hidden by a hood and many cloaks has he ever attacked the trifect zusa asked veliana shrugged if he has we dont know about it not that any would tell us but if this is the first youre hearing of him then i doubt hes struck at the gemcrofts before zusa frowned for this didnt match up with the surrounding events why would this watcher turn on them if his enemy was the thieves i must find him zusa said is there anything you know that can help me find him what for he killed alyssas son i must give my lady her vengeance if the watcher killed him something else is going on perhaps he thinks youve secretly colluded with one of the thief guilds maybe he was confused or maybe hes just insane and out for blood we know nothing of him regardless the difficulty he is my prey and must be found my honor is sworn upon it then i wish you luck veliana said as she sheathed her daggers and swung her cloak over her shoulders many have tried and no lead weve ever found has panned out he might as well be a ghost if you wish to find him your best bet is to scour the streets at night and listen for the sound of combat if you dont catch him in the act i doubt you ever will will you not stay practice your spells i should be going deathmask seeks his answer and i must prepare until then good luck zusa said bowing may you make the right decision and in time find peace with my lady and her family veliana pushed open the door and as the chill wind blew in she sadly shook her head long as thren felhorn lives this war will continue too many fear him and many more live in the palm of his hand without ever knowing hes a bitter angry man sometimes i think all of veldaren will burn before the end perhaps it is not garrick you should plot against but thren zusa said velianas smile turned bitter we did once she said ill see you next week safe travels to you as well zusa had hoped discussing with veliana would illuminate matters but instead it made things worse an assassin killing thieves for several years and not once had any of the guilds discovered his real identity who could be that skilled and what had drawn that skill against her lady what would happen if she did find him did she have the ability to take him down only one way to find out of course dawn was fast approaching less than an hour away still in that last twilight moment perhaps she might find word of the watcher she scoured the rooftops an eye always kept on the streets she saw several deals a whore earning her pay and two men dying so their killers might make off with their gold no watcher up on the rooftops she was alone you must have left people alive zusa whispered to herself as she watched the sun rise youve hurt many opponents though none will work together but i am not one of them i will piece it together i will discover who you are perhaps in time i will be the one leaving my mark for you she returned to the gemcroft mansion and in her room she slept through the day come nightfall she had an underworld to interrogate h aern woke to the sounds of the door banging open against the snow a sliver of light lanced across his eyes dawn was fast approaching but the snow magnified what little light crept over the horizon he rubbed his eyes then looked again matthew was dressed in many layers of coats and furs and his two older sons were dressed similarly a glance around showed the daughters still slept need to break the ice so our cattle can drink matthew explained keeping his voice low so not to wake the others forgive me but its an early morning here on the farm forgiven haern said rising he pulled his cloak tight about himself he needed to piss and he wasnt looking forward to the excursion in what little clothing he had here said matthew tossing him a coat its an extra and with what you paid me you certainly deserve it i have a feeling you wont be staying round much longer your feeling is right haern said inspecting the coat it was old the fur too faded for him to accurately guess what animal it had been made from still the lining remained intact and wellcared for he slipped it on and nodded his thanks come on matthew said to his boys lets go my wifes in the kitchen cooking if youd like a bite to eat haern i would but let me take care of other things first when he came back inside after finishing his business he passed through the curtain into the kitchen sure enough the lady had cooked him a bowl of oatmeal and flavored it with honey thank you haern said accepting the bowl and using his fingers to scoop it into his mouth what is your name she kept busy scrubbing and tending to the rest of breakfast all so she could avoid looking him in the eye evelyn she said thank you for the meal evelyn how fares the boy i looked in on him while you slept his fever still burns and dont think hell get to keep that right arm dont worry though if it comes to that ive done it before and not just on animals for most my neighbors im the closest to a healer we got your husband explained my request haern asked she finally looked at him and he liked the strength he saw in her he told me enough and i have a brain to figure out the rest wed have taken him in without the coin or need for threats i pity the life youve led if you thought either was necessary the comment stung far deeper than she probably meant it to thank you for your hospitality he said i must be going take care of the boy we will safe travels to you haern that bag on the table is yours it should last you until you reach felwood assuming thats the direction youre headed inside was a small selection of salted meats he took it and left without checking on the boy fully trusting evelyn and her husband to know what was best he wanted to get back to veldaren to the world he understood hed watched the farmer talk to his boys matthew was raising them to be like him just like his own father had but there was no malice no underlying threat of violence to ensure perfection and obedience the obedience was expected sure but hed felt the love within it in that household living under threns roof hed felt only paranoia expectations and disappointment hed loved senke loved kayla loved delysia none of their fates had been kind because of it at least delysia had lived though hed lost her to the temple of ashhur the pond was not far from the road and he saw matthew in the distance haern waved and matthew waved back he promised himself to return not just to check the fate of the boy but to have another night of sleep like hed had so many nights and days hed slumbered on the side of the street and hed forgotten the comforts of a warm bed perhaps it was time to consider paying for lodgings at one of the inns his various personae be damned the snow had stopped and the coat did wonders to keep him warm he nibbled on the meat evelyn had given him and despite its salt he found he enjoyed the flavor he walked along the road and tried to decide how far he was from veldaren much of his walk carrying the boy had been in a frozen delirium he couldnt even guess how many miles hed travelled and like a fool he hadnt asked either matthew or evelyn before hed left oh well shed given him enough to reach felwood castle and guessing by the food it should be four days three if she assumed him a heavy eater from there itd be a week or so back to veldaren near midday he heard the sound of hoofbeats he felt his spirits brighten if he could beg a ride he might reach the castle far sooner but the sound was coming from the wrong way just a trick of the woods he walked through horsemen appeared in the distance and his pulse quickened at the sight they wore the same symbol as the horsemen whod attacked the caravan were they still searching for him he hurried off the road wishing hed had time to hide his footprints itd be an easy trail to follow damn the snow they rode right on by if they saw his tracks they didnt care about them in the slightest haern let out a breath hed been holding and returned to the road tightening his coat he hurried on determined to gain as much distance as possible before nightfall evelyn had given him a small piece of flint and steel in his bag of food which he found immeasurably kind off the road he built a fire and slept by it through the night waking every few hours or so to toss a log upon it and poke the embers with a stick to reignite the flame he ate the bulk of his food in the morning saving a little bit for a snack should it take him longer than expected to reach the felwood he kept his eye out for more riders but none came he passed another caravan moving north loaded with salt and farming equipment they offered him a ride but he smiled and gestured south heading the wrong way he said before continuing on not long after hed wolfed down the rest of his food he reached the forest of felwood from there he continued until he reached the castle he still had a few coins from the caravan and he used them to pay for lodgings food and a warm room he left come morning feeling worlds better than he had before the days passed and he continued his travel fires at night kept him comfortable and steadily the weather warmed a front of southern air coming along and mocking the snow at last he reached the kings forest heartened haern jogged at a steady pace once he curled around the woods hed arrive in no time at veldaren he couldnt wait never before had he realized how much he considered the city home twenty minutes later he saw smoke rising from further ahead wary of the cause he upped his pace while slipping closer to the forest so he might hide at a moments notice he rounded a bend and then stumbled upon a terribly familiar sight a single wagon was under attack but instead of horsemen he recognized them as members of the serpent guild he counted eight of them circling the wagon most holding bows or crossbows from where he stood he couldnt see any of the defenders but by the way the serpents stayed low refusing to approach he knew them still alive i leave for a spell and you grow brave enough to assault travelers in daylight haern whispered as he peered around a tree i think its time the watcher left a message no guild can ignore he stayed close to the tree line and once within fifty yards of the wagon he vanished into the woods completely three of the serpents hid at the edge of the forest using trees as cover while they fired their crossbows haern swung wide so he could approach them directly from behind he heard them muttering as he neared offering each other advice where to shoot or where they thought the defenders were hiding haern cursed the vegetation as he neared hed heard of men so accustomed to the wild that they could pass across dry leaves without making a sound yet he crushed twigs and brushed at leaves no matter how stealthy he tried to be what hed give for a paved road and the shadows of a building the three were too focused on the wagon though to notice what little noise he made he thanked ashhur for small favors watch for a hand the rightmost serpent said he looked older than the others and haern wondered if he was their leader dont let that yellow bastard have even a moment or were all dead haern was less than five feet behind him with his swords drawn he took another step amused that they were so afraid of those in the wagon had they bitten off more than they could chew and who might this yellow bastard be it didnt matter he was out of time already the serpents on the other side were closing in either more confident in their abilities or having killed some of those inside he didnt know deciding the one on the right was the most dangerous he rushed in his swords leading his first attack sliced through the serpents back and into his lung haern didnt bother muffling his scream or holding him steady for the other two were too near he slashed with his left arm hoping for an easy cut but the thief fell just out of reach twisting his blade free he kicked away the dying man and turned his attention to the other two the closest tossed his bow and drew a dagger but the other haern dropped to his belly the crossbow bolt screaming over his head the serpent dove after him and he rolled deflecting the thrusts with his swords as he tried to gain distance he rolled his knees underneath him and then kicked leaping backward and to his feet instead of pressing the advantage his opponent remained back a grin on his face idiot said the serpent as his comrade fired another bolt twisting his cloaks haern hoped to confuse him but as the pain bit deep into his shoulder he knew hed only partially succeeded he continued his spin using his cloaks to obstruct their view of him itd only gain him a moment an extra step closer but if they were staying defensive hoping to down him with arrows instead of blades he pulled out of the spin putting every bit of his strength into his jump he crashed into the closest pure luck keeping the thiefs dagger from impaling him as they hit the ground haern twisted so his elbow slammed against the mans throat the serpent spewed blood before the other could respond he lashed out knocking the crossbow off aim the third bolt struck a tree its dull thud music to haerns ears without a melee weapon his opponent had no chance haerns assault was wild and brutal with no hint of defense two slashes took out the mans throat and a third across his hamstring brought him down to the dirt to die finally given a chance to breathe he cursed and grabbed the bolt in his shoulder it was deep in his flesh and a quick glance at the mans quiver showed barbed heads he couldnt dare pull out gritting his teeth he recited a mantra hed been trained as a child one to help him ignore the effects of pain he clutched the shaft tighter another recital followed by a deep exhalation he pushed the bolt through and out the other side he screamed tossing the bolt he leaned against a tree and struggled to catch his breath it didnt look like the bolt was poisonedanother lucky break evidently the serpents hadnt thought their upcoming ambush dangerous enough to spend the time and coin applying some he looked to the wagon curious to the state of affairs he couldnt see those on the other side but he saw one serpent lying dead upon the road his body curiously aflame that left four alive at the most so far none appeared to have detected his ambush which was all the best he needed another moment to recover but then that moment vanished for the wagon caught fire shit he muttered one of the serpents must have tossed oil and a torch black smoke billowed to the air blocking nearly all his view of the events knowing the thieves would be rushing to cut down the survivors he charged pain spiked up his entire left arm and the sword hung limp in his hand as he ran hed block with it if necessary but it seemed the killing would be restricted to his right a figure crawled out of the smoke toward him a redhaired woman in white run to the trees he shouted to her not stopping he swerved about her and leapt straight into the smoke the heat was tremendous but so far the fire was restricted to the outer covering no survivors remained within he saw a gap in the tarpaulin and leapt just before he landed and rolled he had a splitsecond to survey the fight and react four serpents formed a halfcircle around the wagon easily identifiable with their green cloaks three men faced them one in yellow robes wielding a staff another in gray parrying with two maces and the third a portly man holding back with a single club to protect himself there was something tremendously familiar about the way the man with the maces fought but haern had no time he rolled closer to the fat man no doubt the caravans driver or owner he seemed the least skilled unable to fend off the single serpent who weaved side to side haern kicked out of his roll using his good arm to run the serpent through their collision sent them both tumbling and haern screamed as he felt something hard strike his wounded shoulder and screamed again as a sharp pain pierced his stomach he rolled off the corpse and saw blood his blood covering the thiefs dagger this time his collision had not been so lucky struggling to stand he turned to the others his vision a blur of pain smoke and tears one of the two fighting the man in gray had pulled off to address the new threat and haern put his swords in position and tried to feign confidence his opponent dualwielded shortswords and he chopped with both hoping to overpower haern not a bad strategy given his condition he crossed his swords and blocked the nerves in his wounded shoulder shrieking in protest at the collision twice three times he chopped as if haern were a wall to be broken down the third time haerns left arm gave out and he twisted to avoid the deathblow he feigned a retreat but then instead kicked his right foot out tripping the serpent he slashed with his good arm but it wasnt lethal just a cut across the thiefs chest it bought him time and this time he did retreat blood flowed across his shirt and down his pants he felt its warmth along his left arm as well he coughed and he hoped it was only the smoke not something worse that caused it his opponent infuriated by the cut charged like a mad animal haern braced his legs and met it head on just barely slapping the thrusts aside again they collided but this time he was better positioned his knee slammed into his attackers groin and he let his wounded arm absorb most of the impact when the serpent collapsed to the ground haern practically fell upon him one sword dropped from his left hand but he stabbed with his right and leaned all his weight upon it the blade pierced the thiefs belly and bit into the dirt pinning him there he thrashed for a moment as he bled out then went still haern only felt marginally better than the man he killed the collision had torn the cut on his arm further open as well as angering the arrow wound his stomach still ached he didnt know how deep it went but it felt horrendous he struggled to stand but couldnt at last he yanked out his sword and fell to his back his breath coming in hurried gasps so much for leaving the guilds a message so much for inspiring terror hed killed five only five the sounds of fighting ended his head swam a man leaned over him a face he recognized from his past another joined it younger and female he was delusional now he realized how else to explain why two people one dead one missing spoke down to him their voices muffled as if speaking through water how else to explain why senke was telling him to hold on or how delysia was tearing at his clothes to see the wound in his stomach he felt pressure there and then his vision turned yellow all shapes outlined in red sound faded and then he saw nothing at all s he knew garrick would want an explanation but veliana delayed seeing him as long as possible the longer he wondered and worried the better she wanted him to feel belittled to realize her contempt for him anything else might make him think things were different at last one of their young guild rats found her at a tavern on the other side of the city and informed her of garricks request tell him im on my way she said flicking the boy a copper piece but i still plan on finishing my drink first she nursed it for another halfhour by then several men arrived all wearing the dark gray of the ash guild they were recent recruits to the guild men she realized she knew very little about garricks men then again she cursed herself for being so blind to the mans ambition of course shed vetted them knew their names but that was the limit of her influence upon them garricks waiting said one he was named gil if she remembered correctly why had she let him in he looked like a dog had shit out a muscular version of itself that happened to walk on two legs surely he has more important problems she said draining the last of her glass than insubordination no veliana he doesnt she shot him a wink as she stood lead on boys three to one to take me to the dance i feel honored shut it it was an hour until sunset and in the orange glow veliana felt exposed wearing their cloaks as they traversed across the city they were deep in spider territory and instead of trying to travel through the less profitable outskirts they marched together through its very center she saw a few men in the softer gray cloaks but they did not accost them nor hail for an explanation strange deathmask was already waiting in the chamber when veliana arrived garrick sat on his cushions smoking as usual he looked incredibly pleased which threw her off she expected him to be ranting and raving and why was deathmask there was she about to witness another attempt on his life not counting herself or deathmask twelve men gathered about all were armed she felt her worry grow what if this wasnt for the stranger theyd invited what if this was for her execution her hands brushed the daggers at her hip if it came to that shed take garrick down with her no matter the cost better the ash guild dissolved leaderless than continue in the hands of that paranoid bastard you know how to keep a gentleman waiting garrick said as she arrived im sure deathmask will forgive me garrick chuckled not at all bothered by the slight well were all here now before we beginvel would you care to hand over your daggers id hate for someone to get hurt it took all her concentration to hide her panic should she do it if she refused it might make her seem all the more rebellious its meaning might also be taken to a far worse though truthful extreme she glanced at deathmask and during the brief moment their eyes connected she saw the corner of his mouth curl into a grin followed by a wink trusting him she handed over her daggers and crossed her arms i trust i wont like what im about to hear if youd insult me so she said perhaps but i am not the one who shall be speaking he turned to deathmask tell me please why veliana is still alive all about men murmured and she wondered how they were interpreting that statement i do not understand deathmask said feigning confusion is there a reason she should not be dont lie to me i know she attacked you last night one of my men watched your exchange tell me why is it you didnt kill her she did after all try to kill you i assumed it just a training exercise deathmask said the lie smooth on his tongue veliana confirmed as much near the end of our fight was i wrong in my assumption was her response to me a lie this was clearly not the answer garrick had expected he frowned and shifted in his cushion yes you damn fool you were wrong and she a liar you should be dead yet are not veliana held her tongue what game was garrick playing shed warned him at revealing attempts to murder an accepted member without reason or proof yet here he was exposing his plans to the guild and not just that but showing how they had failed for what reason would she attack me deathmask asked isnt it obvious she fears you she knows with your skill you might quickly ascend to take her place isnt that right veliana he grinned at her his bloodshot eyes twinkling velianas hands shook as she choked down her outrage so that was it hed cast the shame of a failed innerguild execution on her and if she tried to deny it it was her word against his her word against the word of their guildmaster one clearly outranked the other the punishment for such a charge was limited to two options banishment or death staring at that grin she knew which option garrick had already chosen you planned this from the start she said her voice nearly a whisper garrick stood and stepped closer as the rest of the guild tensed they understood the accusation and they too knew the possible punishments i merely took advantage of an opportunity he whispered so only she could hear she glared at deathmask suddenly wondering how many of his promises had been lies perhaps all of them hed set her up she realized shed wasted time debating and discussing with zusa when she should have killed the bastard all attempts on his life had been made in secret with no one else informed theyd all died as well no one could prove garricks attempts once more his word against hers damn it all as you know garrick said raising his voice to a theatrical level as he turned his back to her our laws are clear for such an attempt we cannot have anarchy within our ranks not in this crucial time while we fight for our very survival he spun you will be made an example veliana one for the entire guild to see guildmaster if i may make a request said deathmask garrick seemed worried but he gestured for him to continue since it was my life she tried to take i ask that i be the one to carry out her punishment you fuck she said her hands clenched tight into fists you sick little fuck she feinted a lunge at garrick and then hurled herself at deathmask she was unarmed but even with her bare hands she knew a multitude of ways to kill if she could strike him just right crush his throat or snap his neck then at least shed die taking revenge her fist slammed into his mouth just in case he attempted to cast a spell with her other fist she doubled him over with a blow to the stomach she heard men shouting but she stepped closer and wrapped her arms around his neck just a single hard twist and then something hard smacked the back of her head her stomach heaved and her whole body went limp deathmask pulled free and he shouted for the others to leave her be she is mine he said guildmaster i ask is your punishment for this madwoman execution it is said garrick he sounded amused by her display her helpless rage grew the men let her go but it took all her strength to stand already a knot grew on the back of her head she felt ready to vomit deathmask closed the distance and her wild punch missed he grabbed her by the throat and flung her against a wall a dagger flashed from his belt and pressed against her neck do you trust me he whispered into her ear his grip tightened around her throat her eyes met his and against all her instincts something in those brown orbs gave her hope she nodded a barely perceptible movement given how tightly he held her against the wall then stay perfectly still he muttered a few more words soft whispers hidden by his grin at last he pulled back his dagger and stabbed her chest in and out with such speed her blood was flowing before she ever felt the pain black dots cluttered her vision as he held her still sleep in darkness she heard him say as the rest of the ash guild hooted and hollered no doubt garrick was one of them she tried to curse his name as she died but her whole body was turning rigid refusing to cooperate refusing to struggle refusing to breathe and then the darkness came and she could only obey deathmasks request o ric waited until midafternoon before heading out he traveled south along the main road ignoring the peddlers and the beggars he veered off when appropriate making his way to the mercenarys guild while it had once been a weak entity the years of battle and constant work had filled its coffers upgraded its recruitment and increased its influence anyone wanting work had to go through them there were some advantages like guarantees in price or insurance should some of the higher ranked fail to fulfill their duties mostly oric thought it a grand scheme to jack up the cost of hiring mercenaries but what did he know the building itself was still small little more than a large cube to house records and provide the wealthy a place to visit close enough to the main road that they might not be afraid oric entered crossing his fingers as he looked about the office hoping to see an old friend sure enough there he was white bushy unibrow and all oric asked the old man as he came from a back room to the front at the sound of a bell ringing above the door come closer my eyes arent what theyso it is you good to see you you ugly son of a bitch oric grinned was worried youd died off or been replaced by someone who can still remember what happened more than an hour prior the old man laughed his name was bill trett and in orics former sellsword life a respected colleague bill had killed until his strength failed him but by then hed acquired such a wealth of knowledge of the various employers that the guild taught him his numbers and set him in charge of the guilds transactions you see this mess he asked pointing to the various shelves stocked with expensive paper only i know where everythings at theyll keep me on until i die and perhaps a little bit longer than that if they can figure out a way gods know they need you oric said the trifect still filling your purses bill waved a dismissive hand the moneys steadied nearly every one of em just wanting the bare minimum not like when this mess first started when i saw more gold change hands than i could count blood really filled the streets then didnt it oric smiled remembering the many thieves hed cut down while in leon conningtons pay itd been a very good year i think alyssas going to give everyone some work later today so be prepared oric said bill raised his eyebrows but didnt inquire further but for myself i need a favor bill whats that not that i should be doing you any favors last i remember i saved your life up in felwood not the other way around if not for favor then for gold he said dropping a bulging coin purse atop the desk i need the best you have to hire and i dont mean who the guild thinks is the best you know every sellsword from here to angelport and i want your real opinion i need someone who could find a mouse in a forest before an owl could that damn good bill rubbed his chin as his milky eyes stared off into nowhere i suppose you dont mind if hes a bit unsavory he can be the ugliest meanest bastard you know id probably prefer it wed get along bill laughed but it was lacking in humor i know of one and hes good oric hes all the way over from southern ker though some say he aint even from dezrel out of the nine jobs hes done for me hes never once failed to catch his prey and always done it with days to spare been tough getting work lately though charges twice what anyone else does whats his name he calls himself ghost im not brave enough to tell him to pick something more original besides with this guy its fitting once you see his face oric crossed his arms whats that mean youll find out for yourself no point in me telling you hes costly hes dangerous but hes the best you still want to meet him oric thought of the six men he and arthur had lost when this lone watcher had ambushed them along the northern road he also thought of how alyssa might execute him if she found out their role in her sons death yeah i need the best where can i find thisghost know where the mug and feather is no lousy tavern built to the far south just off the main road head there a few hours from now the barkeeps a cheat but hell point ghost out for youthough im thinking you wont need him to bill opened the purse and dumped the coins across his desk after he counted them up he nodded youve got a few extra in here keep them oric said heading for the exit consider it a gift to an old friend for keeping things quiet understood safe travels oric though bill had told him to wait oric had no such plans he wanted to be there when this ghost showed up for a drink besides if he had enough time he might glean some information out of the regulars there just after midday anyone in there would certainly be a frequent drinker finding the tavern was easy enough given the sign hanging above the door a poorly drawn mug and an even uglier feather owner had probably been cheap enough to draw it himself oric checked his sword and then stepped inside the room stank of vomit and alcohol and the lighting was abysmal in one corner was a firepit no doubt the only source of both heat and light at night among the various tables he saw a few stragglers most eating they glanced back at him as he entered and squinted to see in the dark none stood out at least not as dangerous assassins the barkeep was a thin man with a blond beard that reached to the bottom of his neck he nodded at oric and then waited for him to take a seat before coming over whatevers cheapest oric muttered tossing him several coppers when the barkeep came back with a third of his mug froth oric rolled his eyes a cheat indeed deciding he needed information more than he needed to give a good beatdown he let it slide need anything to eat the barkeep asked whats warm havent started the soup yet got a bit of bread though and butter if youre willing to pay thatll do he kept his eyes to himself as he waited for his food just in case the ghost was already there he didnt want to make it seem like he was looking when they met he wanted to have the upper hand just in case this ghost tried to haggle for more pay which he might given the target when his bread arrived he smothered it with butter and ate when he caught the barkeep watching he pulled out a silver keep the rest he said care to answer me a question the barkeep held the silver piece close to his eyes as he inspected it frowned and then put it away sure thing he said not so busy i cant stay away from the bar long enough to talk with a customer oric chuckled at his sarcasm then lowered his voice im looking for a man who calls himself the ghost the barkeep wiped his hands on his pants and laughed not too many go looking for him usually hes got to go to those making offers no one else is dumb enough to accept what business you have with that darkskinned monster an actual darkskin from ker thought oric interesting no business of yours he said now fill the rest of my mug and with ale not foam got it the barkeep glared but obeyed oric washed the rest of the bread and butter down then glanced around once more no darkskin in the tavern shit he wasnt even sure if hed seen a darkskin in all of veldaren no wonder the guy had trouble getting work settling in for a wait he moved from his table to one farthest from the door he leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes he didnt actually sleep but let it look like he was if anyone was dumb enough to try and rob him well theyd get a nice surprise as the sun moved across the sky steadily approaching dusk more men filtered into the tavern oric thought it might be the only tavern left in southern veldaren ever since king vaelors edict banned the caravans from entering the southern entrance forcing them to the east all the merchants and subsequent wealth had shifted further and further north the men who entered looked tired and haggard and he guessed many of them worked the nearby fields outside the city walls the ale was terrible same as the prices but they were probably far closer to home and among friends youre in our seat he heard someone say he opened his eyes to see three men their tanned skin covered with soil all three of them combined might still be skinnier than he was thats a damn shame oric said shifting so they could see the sword sheathed at his side aint no swords allowed in here said one of them like to see him stop me oric said nodding toward the barkeep the men scowled but armed with only their fists they dared not challenge him and his blade they backed down to another seat and as they moved out of his way he finally saw ghost he sat alone in the center of the tavern his skin was indeed dark reminding oric of obsidian the mans head was shaved and he wore loose clothing more appropriate for a warmer climate his enormous strength was obvious his arms thick as tree trunks most shocking though was the brilliant white paint he wore across his face oric stood glared at the men whod wanted his seat as if daring them to try and take it back and then approached ghost mind if i join you he asked the man looked up and he flashed a smile revealing clean white teeth i have a seat to spare so take it if you wish his voice was deep intimidating oric sat and leaned back in his chair if not for the white paint this ghost might have been handsome he tried to decide why he wore it yet could not was it because of his name a pathetic attempt to fit in not much need to ask but i assume youre the one called ghost the mercenary chuckled i am they say youre good who is they that blind fool running the guilds coffers or the rest of my colleagues id be surprised if any bothered to speak of me except in disdain it was bill oric admitted is it true im starting to have my doubts is that an attempt to make me boast no boast there is none better now tell me your name and your business otherwise i might decide i prefer to drink alone sad man thatd prefer to drink alone ghost grinned again and there was something wolfish in his brown eyes come now stranger do you think i am unused to being alone oric felt put off guard and he cursed his verbal clumsiness arthur would have been so much better at milking information out of this guy figuring out who he was what made him tick fair enough my names oric who i work for is my own business i need you for a job and ive already paid bill for your services ghost leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms oric saw two hilts just below his elbows it seemed ghost didnt care much for the barkeeps no weapons policy either i can refuse if i wish so dont think i am already in your pocket oric do you wish for someone found killed or both both again that wolfish smile excellent who they call him the watcher oric was surprised by the sudden burst of laughter it seemed the rest of the tavern winced at the sound as if they expected him to explode any second the watcher asked ghost now that is interesting ive heard a rumor of him here or there but they make him sound as real as the reaper but now you come and ask me to kill him do you have anything for me other than a name i saw him with my own eyes oric said annoyed he wore gray and kept his face hidden with the hood of his cloak you describe nearly every beggar in this city he wielded two swords one for each hand id be more impressed if he wielded two swords in the same hand enough oric slammed his hand against the table i wont be intimidated by a freak like you the entire tavern quieted at his words ghost smiled not angry just amused but something twinkled in his eyes something dangerous he leaned closer to oric letting his voice drop to a whisper a freak he asked why is that is it my skin there are thousands like me in ker only a freak would paint his face to look like a dead whore oric said still trying to rein in his temper ah the paint his voice dropped even lower as if he were to say something intimate for only oric to hear it itches like ivy and does not come cheap here do you know why i wear it because youre trying to fit in fit in he laughed loud a boisterous eruption that startled the nearest tables oric felt himself jump though he didnt know why hed lost control of the conversation he knew that much if he wanted to be in charge of any further negotiations he needed to get his act together and fast no not to fit in ghost continued i wear it to stand out when people see this paint it only reminds them of why i must wear it people cannot hide from me oric that is why i am the best everyone i talk to feels fear for they know nothing of who i am only that i am different do you see that farmer over there i could find out the name of his wife faster than you could introduce yourself when you ask questions theyll evade theyll delay theyll hope for bribes or favors when i ask questions they wish me gone because i make them afraid without a single threatening word fear is stronger than gold all the wealth in the world cannot make someone conquer their fear not when it comes to death and blood they will tell me everything so ill let them go back to their safe little existence fit in what an unimaginative man you are enough oric said will you accept the job or not ghost took a drink of his ale and set down the glass triple what bill told you he said i wont accept a copper less i could hire fifty men for that price and all fifty would stomp about unable to find their own assholes triple oric stood having had enough i wont darkskin i refuse either accept your standard pay or nothing at all ghost drew his sword and slammed it onto the table oric jumped but instead of reaching for his sword he realized he had turned to run for the door his cheeks flushed and he knew ghost had seen it as well i expect the rest in bills hands by nightfall farewell oric i will have the watchers head in two weeks should i fail though i wont all the coin will be returned to you he left and it seemed the whole tavern breathed easier with him gone to his shame oric realized he did too he ordered another glass drained it and then hurried off he still had another pressing matter to attend and he needed to handle it far better than he had with ghost further into southern veldaren he approached a large wooden structure with two floors itd been there several years ago when hed last been to the city and thankfully it still was inside at least fifty boys and girls hurried about cleaning sweeping and preparing their beds for nightfall a man of forty hurried to the door to greet him hello my friend said the man my name is laurence and welcome to our orphanage may i help you perhaps with finding an apprentice or maidservant show me the boys oric said laurence whistled and sent them running they traveled further in it looked like a giant warehouse with rows of bunk beds on either side he lined up twenty boys of various ages parading them before oric as if they were cattle for the most part the children behaved having certainly gone through this before anything particular youre looking for laurence asked licking his lips thats my own business not yours of course sir of course oric kept nathaniel in mind as he looked over the younger ones one in particular looked close in size maybe an inch taller his hair was even the same color which might help match the illusion step forward he said nodding toward that boy hell do whats the cost adoptions are not cheap but hes still young so itll be nine silvers oric reached into his pocket and pulled out twice the amount no papers he said i was never here laurences eyes bulged and he glanced between the man and the boy his names dirk he said thats fine come on boy laurence watched them leave but said nothing oric traveled by foot so he took dirk by the hand and told him to hurry along no questions he said were heading along the northern road ive got a house for you there where you can work off all that silver i just spent on you you understand dirk nodded good he took him to the southern gate not wishing to travel through the more populated areas of the city regardless of how close to night it was getting the guards gave him a cursory glance before letting him through at a branch in the road they followed the loop back around the city and then to the north dirk looked maybe six and his legs were nowhere near as long as orics he tired rapidly and by the way his skin clung to his bones itd probably been forever since he had a filling meal oric eventually picked him up and carried him until the city was behind them and the sun almost set how long until were there dirk asked the first time hed spoken in an hour no questions oric growled he glanced about as the first of many stars appeared in the sky he was nearing the kings forest stretching out to the east were acres of hills he turned toward one of them still holding the boy almost there he muttered once he put the closest hill between him and the road he set dirk down you see that forest over on the other side of the road i want you to go fetch me some sticks whatever you can carry yes sir oric pulled out his sword and a piece of flint while the boy was gone he gathered enough dry grass to create kindling he carefully shielded it with his hands once he got it lit when dirk returned holding about six sticks oric snapped them on his knee and carefully set them into the kindling he sprinkled a tiny bit of lamp oil from his pack to get it going then stood we need far more wood than that he said still holding his sword but ive got time first arthurs orders come here dirk while the boys body bled out on the grass oric went to the forest and broke off several thick branches he dragged them back to his camp grunting as he did he used his boot to break the branches into pieces and one by one he tossed them upon the fire once it was roaring he picked up the body it felt stiff and cold he hoped itd burn without a bit of ceremony he tossed it into the fire the ragged clothing caught first then the hair and finally flesh the burning meat smelled sweet but he always hated the scent of burning hair deciding he could go without the warmth he unpacked his bedroll and slept upwind so he wouldnt be bothered by the smell come morning he gathered up the bones into a sack and returned to veldaren h e had a soft bed underneath him which confused haern to no end a bed when was the last time hed slept in a bed three years ago four wait what about at that farm no thatd been on the floor right when he opened his eyes it didnt help much he saw a low ceiling poorly plastered a glance around took in the rest of his surroundings the room was tiny barely any space to walk between his bed and the door opposite him was a single closet stacked full of a strange assortment of clothing and weaponry he recognized his own weapons in the pile and he tried to go for them the pain in his stomach convinced him it wasnt a good idea he lay back down and pressed a hand against his abdomen his fingers touched bandages sticky with blood pieces of the attack at the caravan came back to him hed been stabbed in the stomach that he remembered as well as what is going on he muttered as he inspected his arm he remembered the cut there and itd been bad if not to the bone it was bandaged as well but the pain was only a dull ache he pried back some of the cloth and saw an angry scar lacking any stitching to help it close it didnt seem possible for that much healing hed have to have been out for weeks the same went for the arrow wound on his shoulder either that or a priest had come and healed him or a priestess haern remembered those last fleeting images images no longer certain to be hallucinations could it be after all these years had delysia exited the safety of ashhurs temple a part of him felt excited to meet her but for the most part he felt terror his hair was still a mess his face unevenly shaven his clothes fit the part of the beggar shed been his first glimpse of light in a world of darkness something clean and pure he felt like living dirt scabbed over with his blood and the blood of those hed killed it seemed so wrong for her to find him like this assuming she even remembered him or recognized him through the filth he tried once more to sit up and now prepared for the pain he managed a better job of it using his hand to support his weight against the wall he leaned into the closet and grabbed his swords he knew it made no sense for anyone to try to kill him there not after bandaging him up and healing him but he felt naked without their weight at his hips sweat dripped down his neck as he caught his breath he offered a quick prayer to ashhur for strength and then pulled the door open a very surprised senke stood there holding a slice of buttered bread his free hand still reaching for the door handle that had swung away from him at the last moment going somewhere senke asked it was too much haern staggered back and half sat half fell onto his bed he stared his mouth hanging open you look like youve seen a ghost senke said seeming amused by the whole scenario i think i have senke laughed and that familiar laugh helped melt his doubts the man had shaved his head and grown out his beard but underneath the disguise he had the same smile same laugh same guarded amusement in his eyes only a handful have recognized me but i guess i shouldnt be surprised that youre one of them always were the observant one werent you aaron aaron a flood of memories tore through him of days practicing with senke of walking at the side of his father and of those few fleeting moments with robert haern before executing him at his fathers command and then cleaning up the blood aaronhe hadnt gone by that name since that day hed adopted a new name a new person to be haern he said aaron died a long time ago senke handed over the bread and leaned against the door chuckling again that you did and i was one of many who thought so though i forgot your little oddity about the name everyone heard how you died in the fire i barely got out myself though i lost most my hair in the process helped disguise myself though and im kind of attached to the look now haern looked at the bread as if he didnt know what it was for at last he dropped it stood and flung his arms around senke he didnt say anything didnt know what to say he felt thirteen again bewildered torn and suddenly given a link to a past that actually had moments of good it seemed senke understood for he patted haern on the back and then gently pulled free dont get all sentimental he said winking otherwise i might start thinking you arent really threns son now have a seat del says youve got another day or two before youll be in top shape and i dont want you tearing those wounds open youve grown up god damn boy taller than me now how about you tell me what youve been doing these past five years thinking over his life haern felt embarrassed to say hed never once discussed it with anyone only acted out his vengeance still strange looking or not there was senke the closest to a friend hed ever had the time melted away he told it all of his escape from the fire and living on the streets always keeping his hair messed and unevenly cut his skin a blanket of dirt and scabs he stole food to live and lived to kill those of the thief guilds he felt keen shame admitting that though he wasnt sure why in his heart he felt justified howd you end up at our caravan senke asked as his story neared its end investigating the serpent guild and their newfound gold was on my way back when i stumbled upon your attack i must admit aaron i thought it was actually thren whod come to our aid the way you just charged in then danced and weaved it seemed so familiar i said its haern now senke lifted his hands to show he meant no offense forgive me just habit why so strict haern felt a chill coming on and he wrapped his blankets tight about him because thats not who i am anymore i refuse everything of my father including his name i wont be what he wants me to be wanted senke said he thinks youre dead now and instead of being your fathers pet killer you instead spend every night killing a neat trick that dont you dare judge me no judging just stating the obvious well guess its my turn not nearly as interesting i fled the city for the first few years always wanted out think i told you that but thren wasnt one to take such requests too well that fire seemed as good an opportunity as any to make a new life spent some time down in woodhaven cutting lumber after awhile got bored took some odd jobs more favorable to a dagger than an ax all the sudden i had a slow but steady stream of mercenary work about a year ago i came back to veldaren going by the name of stern and hoping for a bit more lucrative employment before you start thinking it i wasnt exactly falling into that same old trap i chose my contracts carefully and while i wasnt always working for the nicest of people i wasnt killing innocents or torching the homes of the poor either anyway eventually met with my current employer even joined up with him as a permanent member of his mercenaries seems like he went through twenty guys trying to find one who waswell not scum lucky me eh haern smiled but said nothing he was still trying to wrap his head around everything here was someone he could talk to could trust after half a decade of silence and loneliness it all came crashing to an end because of a single poorlytimed ambush for all the many times he felt overlooked by ashhur he wondered just how unnoticed he really was while he thought he ate figuring it a good excuse not to talk all his confidence had flown out the window with senkes arrival if anyone made him feel like the confused thirteen year old boy hed once been it was him i see your eyes drooping senke said when haern finished his meal let me send in delysia to swap out some clean bandages and then you can rest ponder over this craziness delysia he asked is sheis her last name eschaton senke raised an eyebrow well yeah but how would youwait a minute you did know a delysia is she her the one you killed dustin to protect andshit that is her isnt it haern nodded and was totally unprepared for senkes eruption of laughter looks like she returned the favor shes the one that kept you from bleeding out like a stuck boar damn this is too funny you never told me she became a priestess always wondered how she hid from thren so well i never told anyone haern mumbled kayla told me the night of the kensgold senkes face saddened at the mention of her name she was a pretty lass what i heard thren killed her for aiding you such a shame didnt pay much to help you out did it the comment stung deeper than senke intended and at the pained look crossing haerns face he immediately started trying to take it back im sorry haern you know i dont mean that it wasnt your fault any of it your fathers just a bastard still is though his influence is slowly dwindling thank ashhur senke iim not ready to see her yet shes seen plenty of you he blushed a fierce red but remained adamant please just let me rest meeting you again is too much as is let me think all right senke shrugged i guess youll survive though if those cuts get infected its your own damn fault sleep tight haern thanks even after senke left his words echoed in haerns head didnt pay much to help you out did it how many had died because of him robert died by his hand his father killed kayla again for helping him senke had nearly died in the fire delysia had been forced into hiding and now when every thief guild in the city would gladly string him up by his thumbs and let the entire underworld have a go at him the two had brought him into their home and given him succor were they mad he was a monster a beacon of chaos and murder the streets were where he belonged their gutters had room for the blood besides he couldnt face her he just couldnt the last image he had of delysia was her gasping in his arms as the bolt pierced her back shed looked so shocked so betrayed and then to see his own father approaching crossbow in hand hed felt such guilt he tightened his belt and held back a grimace at the pain in his stomach his cloaks were folded up beside his bed as were his tattered clothes again he blushed a bright red as he remembered senkes comment and he prayed that it had been anyone but delysia who had changed him into what he wore now a plain white shirt and brown pants quietly he changed into his old clothes in their dirt and dried blood he felt all the more wretched and eager to be gone everything about him was filthy even the task hed devoted his life to was he really any better than his father at least thren had developed an empire however fleeting all haern was doing was destroying it all he shook his head trying to banish such thoughts he needed to concentrate drowsiness still tugged at his eyes and that soft warm bed tempted him more than any woman had deciding it was now or never he crept open the door and looked about whatever building he was in was small in space but attempting to make up for it by being two stories tall he saw a second door across from him and a few feet away stairs curling downward at sharp angles to the bottom floor he heard muffled talking from the other door feeling like a trespasser he hurried along as fast as his wounds allowed him to go the bottom floor was blessedly empty sparsely furnished he saw a table an oak desk in the corner and a modest pile of books atop it at the door he removed the bolt and stepped out into the street he looked around a moment taking in his surroundings the sun was rising still low enough to hide behind the citys walls there was an inn not far away prathers if he read the sign right and that meant he was oncrimson alley deep in southern veldaren he felt muted horror at the realization senke and delysia lived on the crimson one of the most dangerous places in the city no wonder he never saw either of them when he patrolled the night theyd certainly keep their doors locked and windows bolted how often had he passed right on by when scouring for isolated members of the guilds he worried about his injuries but those desperate enough to rob in daylight he could certainly handle giving one last glance at the dilapidated building to memorize its location haern rushed north eager to put some distance between him and his sudden assault from the past v eliana floated in silence and that alone convinced her she was dead she didnt know if her eyes were open or closed all she saw was darkness though she didnt really see it as much as be swallowed by it the numbness she felt she likened to cold so at least she felt something however faint time drifted by as if it were bored of her then came a sudden shocking pain to her chest it lit up her darkness with streaks of red again she felt the pain but this time there was a comfort to it a strange familiarity the third time it hit she realized it was her heartbeat restarting pins and needles came in waves first to her chest then her face and last her extremities the darkness gradually faded from black to yellow to red and at last to an assortment of colors that congealed together to create the unmasked face of deathmask welcome back he said with a smile she would have hit him if her limbs bothered to listen to her commands he vanished she lay on her back and now she stared at a cobwebbed ceiling based on the cold she felt she decided she was on a dirt floor her ears about the only thing working properly heard shuffling followed by a laugh im sure youre angry with me but let me assure you i hope i never have to do that again deathmask leaned over and she felt him press his hands against her neck pulse is getting stronger good never actually tried that spell before so consider yourself a lucky first try stopping someones heart is never easy well not if you want to start it again whathappened she forced her dry throat and swollen tongue to ask i faked killing you the thrust to your chest wasnt deep enough but i made sure no one bothered to investigate the matter with your heart stopped and your body in stasis there wasnt much reason to think otherwise i took over the burial and here we are simple enough explanation and once you get your bearings i think youll be pleased with its elegance the pins and needles returned throughout her body and this time she felt herself regaining control her head pounded with the unholiest of headaches but she forced herself to sit up forced the memories to come back shed been in their headquarters garrick was there accusing her of she reached for a dagger at her side but all she did was topple herself back to the dirt dont rush things she heard deathmask say youll be fine in a few more minutes we have much to discuss so try not to do anything stupid like killing me all right no promises she thought amid her delirium as her body reawakened so did her mind she glanced about taking in her surroundings they appeared to be in a cellar of some sort the only light coming from a single torch lit behind her head she saw no door but assumed it was also behind her deathmask leaned against a stone wall to her right his arms crossed his face blanketed with a smug grin shed give everything to cut off feeling far better she sat up braced herself for the ensuing dizziness and then sat on her knees im fine now she told him you say we have lots to talk about so lets talk he nodded as if perfectly fine to hurry through the bullshit garrick surprised me with his boldness id feel more upset if he didnt surprise you as well and youve known him far longer than i even a rigged die will roll something new with enough throws if you know what i mean i tried to save us both but clearly garrick wasnt one to be persuaded he wanted you dead and i did my best to fool him regarding that i succeeded of that im sure my position in the guild is tenuous right now esteemed in most of the lower members that despised you but garrick wants me killed that much is obvious and now here we are its only been a day and i managed to keep you wrapped and safe so no bugs or worms could get at you veliana shuddered at the prospect so here we are she said what is it you want why keep me alive because i made you an offer and i wont let some idiot guildmaster interfere with my plans that offer still stands though i need your answer now will you aid me or must i find another and if i say no his eyes held no joy no amusement only grim truth ill put you as you were though this time no spell will bring you back she thought of the cold the darkness an involuntary shudder coursed through her too strong to hide she couldnt go back to that even if it wasnt a true death garrick had turned against her and even now she would be a outsider a banished ghost from her own guild ill help you she said even if i did have a choice id still help you i want that son of a bitch to die slowly painfully and at my hand that is all i ask can you promise me that deathmask handed her a small bottle of some red vintage she tore out the cork and drank that my dear he said is something i can assure you of hell be your kill all yours the alcohol burned going down but damn did it feel good then enough lies and games i can hardly turn against you now that ive been executed by the ash guild what is your plan why have you come to veldaren deathmask smoothed his robe and then sat opposite her on the floor he scratched at his chin as if thinking where to start i was once a member of the council of mages he said less than six months ago in fact they preach noninvolvement in political matters but its nonsense we had our eyes everywhere especially on the kings and their capitals when this war erupted between the guilds and the trifect i was assigned to watch through coin and magic i learned of every guildleader their goals and the reaches of their power as the years dragged on and my boredom grew i formulated various plans and contingencies i was not a high ranking member veliana far from it my strength was equal to many but my years were few not enough gray hairs if you will i also had a reputation as atroublemaker shocking veliana muttered he chuckled and continued they told me nothing of why i was tracking veldarens underworld so left to my imagination i thought of every possible reason recently i came up with a plan i was sure could work it wasnt foolproof and would involve risk to whoever tried carrying it out but i was certain of its worth this stupid grudge war wasnt going to end not without killing off thren felhorn and i knew a way when i tried to convince the council of this they gave me strict orders not to interfere i saw a wealth of gold but gold means nothing to those aging bastards they want influence power and information gold helped with that but was hardly their true ambition i went on with my plan without their approval and that is when i realized how dangerous they thought me several of my contacts were actually in the pockets of other higher ranking members my assassination attempt accomplished nothing but my banishment they took my name from me veliana they stole it with a spell called my ambitions foolish my desire for gold a young mans folly we call you nameless they said for you are death they refused to see the power i might gain the wealth the underworld of veldaren smuggled every single night i came here to prove them wrong i lurked until the right moment to introduce myself i have a plan many in fact and this is just one of them we will take over the ash guild and turn it into a powerful force no one will dare act against well kill many accomplishing this possibly hundreds does this bother you she thought over everything hed said it made sense and it explained many of his strange powers of course he could be lying but even if he was it didnt change what garrick had done to her as for his question no she said not if it lets me kill garrick the innocent arent long for this world anyway deathmask smiled good girl he said then you shouldnt mind what you must do next e velyn washed her hands in the bowl and wiped them on a nearby cloth feeling like a morbid butcher she tossed her bloody apron aside matthew stood beside her looking down at the boy will he live he asked i believe so she told her husband i sewed him up quick enough lost more blood tending to the kenders boy when he hit his head on their fence he was also older matthew said evelyn nodded but said nothing the silence stretched as they both looked upon the sleeping boy his skin pale and slick with sweat she hoped that meant his fever was finally breaking but it easily could be because of the amputation the human body did strange things when in pain and evelyn didnt want to imagine what the boy had felt when she took the saw to his shoulder hed been feverish and unable to talk so maybe he hadnt felt much strange not knowing his name matthew said we could give him one not much point if he wakes hell tell us it himself when he wakes her husband gave her a look then nodded it was the closest she ever got to an apology with him right when he wakes give me a moment to take care of this the boys arm lay wrapped in rags on the floor by the bed matthew scooped it up and carried it outside though he didnt tell her she knew the hogs penned out back were about to get an interesting addition to their diet theyd kept the children out of the house while she cut though her oldest trevor had insisted he watch just shy of fourteen he might have been able to stomach it but truth be told she couldnt afford the distraction should he have cried out or lost control of his stomach ive been thinking she said when matthew returned we might as well name him both him and that haern were injured and i have no doubt theyre hiding from someone id hate for one of us to let slip his real name before we can get him home i reckon youre right any ideas always wanted to have a boy named something fancy how about tristan too fancy no one would believe us when we say hes ours how about john she frowned hell only have this name for a week or two at most and you want something so plain as john he blinked at her my fathers name is john your father was a very plain man himself he took an angry step toward her grabbed her wrists and then laughing pulled her against him her own laughter faded as he held her tight and she wrapped her arms about him you going to be all right he asked just blood and dead flesh she said not as if he was squealing like a hog its just you and me right now you know that right we can open the stitches say he bled out when we took the arm wouldnt be a lie she pulled away we gave our word she said as if that should explain everything i dont know whats going on but what i do know is anyone out to kill a boy that young aint on the side of right that stranger paid us a fortune for this we can buy more land from the potters those acres they cant till worth a damn but we could do it we can hire help extra salt and meat for next winter lumber for the housei wont better our life on the blood of a dead child and i expect you to feel the same his cheeks flushed red when he went to speak he shut his mouth again and waited another moment to get his composure back true enough he said hard as it is to get the kids to avoid a lying tongue wont do no good to go lying ourselves im scared evelyn were just farmers i dont like going up to tyneham to trade our wares to the miners let alone all the way south to veldaren where the real crooks are whoevers after this boy tristan he laughed fine whoevers after tristan probably has money soldierswholl take care of debbie or anna or little mark should something happen to us or ashhur forbid what if something happen to them she stood on her tiptoes and kissed his lips stop worrying well deal with each problem as it comes and ashhur will keep us safe now let tristan here sleep tristan matthew muttered as they passed through the curtain into the other room you really wanted to name one of our children tristan tristan woke them a few hours past midnight evelyn was the first at his side the boy was moaning and his legs and arm twitched every few moments she touched his forehead it was like touching fire get water in the tub she told trevor mix in some snow too if you can stand to keep your hand in it for long it aint cold enough yes maam trevor said his eyes lingering on tristan as he put on his coat and boots they had a small tub inside their home a luxury if i ever saw one liza her crone of a neighbor had once told her they had to bring the water in by buckets and that would take time until then she tore off the boys blankets and clothes stripping him naked upon the bed he going to be all right asked anna as she poked her head through the curtain she was twelve old enough to help her mother when she acted the healer wake your father evelyn said ignoring her question and make sure mark and julie stay in bed probably already scared and i dont want them scared worse anna nodded and her head vanished behind the curtain evelyn lifted tristan in her arms and it was like picking up a burning log when she brushed through the curtain into their living room she found matthew putting on layers trevor said you needed water in the tub the fever gotten that bad she nodded i told you he hadnt had enough to drink he said cant sweat off a fever if you aint got nothing to sweat i know she said nows not the time she caught her younger children looking at her and she turned her back to them and hurried to the tub the door to the house slammed shut whether from matthew leaving or trevor coming in she didnt know in the tub she found a single bucketful of water barely enough to wet the surface she put him in anyway and held him down as his body flailed against the cold anna she cried her daughter hurried in after help me hold him down his shivers are going to get worse dont feel bad about the chill either hell burn to death before he catches cold she shifted so that anna might hold his arm then pressed down on the boys knees trevor came in with another bucket of water and he looked lost about what to do with it just dump it on him evelyn said trying to be patient its only water trevor hesitated but the look in his mothers eyes got him going he upended the bucket cold water from the well tristans moan turned to a fullfledged wail rather than stay trevor hurried out evelyn leaned more of her weight on her arms as tristans struggling grew beside her anna quietly cried start praying she whispered itll help you but dont you dare let go of that arm matthew came in with a larger bucket and he poured it in by the boys feet the water was halfway up his body and evelyn told him one more should be enough still need the snow he asked this water will be warm soon enough all right when they came back she put the bucket of snow beside her saving it for when the chill left the tub tristan was still shivering and he cried when he had the energy and moaned when he did not after twenty minutes she dumped in the halfmelted bucket of snow sending tristans shivers back to full strength ten more minutes and she lifted him out wrapped him in a towel and brought him back to his bed matthew was there not long after a small cup of milk in one hand a slender funnel in the other evelyn recognized it sure enough they used it to feed their animals various herbs and tonics should they catch ill he needs to drink matthew said hold open his jaw and dont let him move i have no intention of drowning him once the milk was gone they wrapped him tighter in blankets and waited go rest she told her husband you have enough work in the morning and it wont be no good for you to do it on a half nights sleep get the kids back to bed as well ill keep vigil on him matthew squeezed her shoulder and then left once he was gone she gently stroked tristans forehead with her fingers he looked like a drowned rat but his fever had finally dropped hed fallen back asleep too for which she was thankful shed mixed a bit of hogroot in the milk and she prayed itd break his fever completely while he slept a quick inspection showed the stitches on his shoulder to be clean no infection thank ashhur there wasnt anywhere higher left to cut other than his neck just to end the suffering on her knees her weight leaning against the bed she waited out the night just before dawn his fever broke and for the first time since haern had brought him there he opened his eyes im thirsty he said his voice croaking evelyn smiled and clutched his hand fresh milk she said coming right up m atthew was breaking the thin seal of ice atop their pond when he saw the men ride to his front door there were two of them their chainmail dirty from the road even from this distance he could tell they were armed who are they trevor asked beside him he squinted against the light reflecting off the snow do you know them no i dont matthew said remember if anyone asks tristans your brother and he caught infection from a spider bite you understand me yes sir and just in case get your knife but dont you dare let them see you holding it this is serious trevor the lads eyes widened he went to ask a question thought better of it and then just nodded matthew led them back to the house evelyn had answered and after a moment invited them in he trusted her to keep her wits about her probably more than himself his other children were in there though and once outside the public eye he wondered just what type of men they might be should have made them wait outside until i got back he thought damn it evelyn sometimes you ought to act the proper wife just before reaching the house he stopped and ducked into the barn he heard his son gasp as he yanked their pitchfork off the wall wont do much against their armor he said inspecting its four teeth but they aint wearing helmets so thats something he set it beside the door then opened it and stepped inside the two men sat beside the fire their cloaks stretched out to dry at their feet they both had swords still sheathed thank ashhur the rest of his children kept a safe distance away again something to be thankful for the strangers held small wooden bowls of a broth evelyn had prepared for breakfast his stomach grumbled involuntarily he hadnt eaten yet himself he wondered how much of his own portion sat in the strangers bowls welcome gentlemen he said taking off his gloves i see my wife has helped you feel right at home which is proper its cold work riding in winter shes a lovely host one of them said he was a plain looking man darkhaired flat nose only the scar running from his eye to his ear made him seem dangerous he wore no tabard but his accent was distinctly of the north most likely tyneham or one of the smaller mining villages that she is he said on your way to felwood or beyond i must say i didnt catch which direction you came from while out at my pond riding north said the other he was uglier with brown hair in desperate need of a cut our horses need a rest and we must admit the thought of a warm building was too much for us to resist when we saw your farm a fire warms eight as well as six he said evelyn gave him a glare and he realized his mistake he had seven in his family if he counted tristan been times we had to cram twelve of us in here he continued hoping to make them forget the comment neighbors had their house burn down lost one of their sons too makes for a rough winter with no roof so we brought em in until spring it must have been tough said the first looking around the small home forgive me ive yet to introduce myself my names matthew pensfield youve met my wife evelyn this heres my oldest trevor little marks over there hiding in the corner and thesere my two daughters anna and julie the girls smiled and tilted their heads in proper respect the soldiers tipped their heads back and each of them had a leer that sent fire up and down matthews spine he hesitated trying to decide what to do about tristan he didnt know what was the right course of action the boy had been asleep when he last went outside his wife took the decision away from him and as much as it scared him he trusted her you must forgive us for not introducing you to tristan hes sick with a fever in bed just had to amputate an arm the poor dear thats a shame said the darkhaired one my names gert and this heres ben like i said were riding the road maybe to felwood maybe all the way to tyneham only wanderers and thieves ride the road without knowing how far they wish to go matthew said i hope youre neither gert laughed nah were looking for someone actually a lost boy five years in age perhaps youve seen him matthew shook his head hed played cards only a few times when trading in the bigger towns hed never been good figuring the odds of things but hed always done all right because of one thing going for him he had one of the best card faces of anyone he knew only evelyn could read what was going on behind his eyes i havent and i doubt i would either a boy that young running around in the snow hed be lucky to last a single night how longs he been missing i hope i cause no offense but a coyote packs probably gotten him or at least what was left of him theres the thing said ben he might not be alone had another man with him wore gray and carried two swords hes a kidnapper and were trying to capture him before he can think of asking for ransom kidnapped asked evelyn from who gert sipped some of his broth thats something id rather we keep to ourselves either you seen the boy and that bastard or you havent dont matter none where eithers come from as they talked trevor slipped back into his room when he came back matthew saw the bulge in his pocket that was a knife matthew walked to the door and put his weight against it his shortsword leaned beside its hinges sheathed whenever he needed it before itd always been at the door so far if either of the two newcomers had seen it they hadnt said anything well i aint seen a boy wandering around here nor some man in gray weve been shuttered inside for most of the past few days the storm and all if they went this way they probably rode right on by not sure theyre riding said gert think theyre walking honestly not too many out right now and we managed to find what might have been his tracks that so led this way actually said ben you sure you aint seen nothing matthew paused trying to think of a lie again his wife beat him to it bless her heart we turned them away she said they came wanting shelter but they were bleeding and he was armed looked like a thief he did we didnt want any trouble and we dont want any now he said he was on his way to veldaren if hes to be trusted the two men looked to one another as if communicating silently a hard woman that could refuse a wounded man asking for succor ben said matthew watched his wife give them an iron glare one hed been on the receiving end more times than he preferred life out heres cold and cruel gentlemen we do what we can for our family maybe things are different where you come from but here thats the way things are i understand ben said were just getting paid to ask these questions your broths delicious by the way feel it warming me all the way to my toes matthew started to relax but only a little the men seemed too confident too sure of themselves they were no strangers to those swords at their hips either the sooner they left the better when they finished they stood and flung their cloaks over their shoulders our horses are probably itching to continue gert said or at least get out of the wind as they stepped toward the door they stopped and gert turned toward the curtain where evelyn had said tristan slept you know ive been fighting and killing for a long while if theres anything ive seen before its a chopped limb mind if i take a look i can make sure you stitched it up right well as cut it proper theres more art to keeping people alive than making em dead after all evelyn hesitated and matthew knew if she were unsure then he was in over his head if you wish he said putting on his gloves i should get back outside only wanted to come visit with my guests be polite you two men have a good day want me to come with asked trevor no matthew said harsher than he meant no you aint much use outside stay with your ma he got the idea and his hand brushed the knife hidden in his pants matthew winced and hoped neither of the soldiers saw he pulled the door open and stepped outside when he shut it he leaned his back against it closed his eyes and listened never one with an active imagination he struggled to picture the most likely thing theyd do they were searching for the boy obviously theyd step into the curtain one inside to look the other hanging back watching them waiting to see if anyone did anything stupid his hand closed around the pitchforks handle something stupid like this matthew kicked the door inward it seemed like his entire vision narrowed down just a thin window to see one of the soldiers staring back at him from the curtain the one named ben his eyes widened for just a moment his hand reached for his sword as if he were lagging in time matthew thrust the pitchfork for the soldiers exposed throat bens sword couldnt clear his scabbard in time so instead he ducked and turned away from the thrust a purely instinctual move it only made matters worse when two of the teeth pressed against the side of his face matthew shoved with every hardworked muscle in his body the tips were thick but with such force behind them they still punched through flesh and tore into bone ben rolled his head downward trying to pull free when he did blood spewed across the floor he screamed it might have been a word a curse but matthew didnt know didnt understand bens jaw hung offkilter his right cheek shredded and the bone connecting it shattered the look in his eyes reminded matthew of the one time hed encountered a rabid coyote attacking his animals his sword free ben charged not waiting for gert matthew took a step back braced his legs and shoved the pitchfork in the way the teeth hit his chainmail and amid the screams of his family he heard the sound of metal scraping against metal they didnt punch through the armor but they still bruised his flesh and pushed inward strong enough to break more bones matthew twisted the handle to the side bringing ben to his knees still stuck on the pitchforks teeth dimly he heard his wife cry out the words not registering any meaning only her tone gert rushed through the curtain his sword swinging abandoning the clumsy weapon matthew lunged for the door he landed on his knees grabbed his shortsword and spun gert bore down on him swinging with both hands their blades connected and panic flooded him when saw a tiny chip break off at the contact his sword was weaker the metal cheaper it wouldnt be long before it broke leave him alone he heard evelyn shout finally piercing through the haze gritting his teeth he groaned as gert pressed down with all his weight he spared only a moments glance to see ben fling the pitchfork to the dirt and turn toward his wife he had to help her but he was pinned and badly positioned trevor he screamed where was his boy why wasnt he helping now wasnt the time for fear damn it he angled his sword to block another chop realized it was a feint and smacked aside the thrust aimed for his belly dont you be a coward boy treat em like damn hogs evelyn hurried across the room grabbing the poker from the fire she held it clumsily a pathetic weapon compared to the gleaming sword ben wielded in his blood soaked hand then he couldnt spare the glimpse for gert had dropped to one knee hoping to lessen the distance between them so he might lock matthews sword out of position matthew struggled against it but slowly his sword wavered then hit the floor beside him gerts elbows pressed against his chest his knee atop one of his legs dont worry bout your wife gert said his beady eyes inches away ill take good care of her your daughters too it was the absolute worst thing gert could have said matthew let go of his sword one hand grabbing gerts wrist the other ramming his eyes and mouth with his fingers the soldier howled and tried to pull away but matthew dug his fingers in deeper and held on feeling softness give way cartilage crunch in his grip gert tore his wrist free aimed the blade and stabbed matthew rolled knocking his attack off balance the sword struck the floor with every bit of strength in his right arm matthew slammed gerts head against the wall he heard a wet crack like the sound of a breaking pumpkin the abrupt end was startling he heard his children crying but saw no motion he stood shaking the gore from his hand evelyn huddled beside the fire the poker at her feet trevor in her arms he still held his bloodsoaked knife nearby lay ben bled out from the cuts on his face and the deep stab wound at the small of his back everyone all right he asked evelyn met his eyes then nodded thank ashhur he gave his wife a hug making sure he didnt stain her dress with his right hand the rest of his children stayed sitting and he could tell they were traumatized by the violence he went to each of them hugging them and whispering that all would be well at last he grabbed the dead bodies and dragged them outside by their feet once they were out of sight he came back inside and plopped into a chair beside the fire his upper body started shaking and he closed his eyes to try and hold back a sudden bout of nausea well bury the armor until we can sell it in the spring he told evelyn talking in hopes of stopping the violence replaying over and over in his head same with their swords well unbridle the horses and send them on their way hopefully far far away as foryou knowwell give em to the hogs his wife made a soft cry he shuddered but forced himself not to dwell on it theyd do what they must no different than ever before opening his eyes he looked to the curtain wondering if that blasted boy still slept or if he were in there cowering in terror not worth the coin he said just before leaning to one side and vomiting a squad of twelve mercenaries escorted alyssas litter through the city anyone foolish enough to linger in their way received a quick slap with the flat edge of a blade they stuck to the main streets where thief guild presence was weakest the town guards too numerous to act rashly the distance from her estate and leon conningtons new mansion was far enough to be a bother but she felt it necessary to carry her message in person she pulled her fur coat tighter about her and waited when they arrived she stepped out and surveyed the place shed been there once just before completion after leons old mansion had burned down during the kensgold hed rebuilt with security in mind an enormous fence of stone surrounded his estate perfectly smooth so thered be no handholds there were no trees in the yard either nothing to hide behind four men stood at the gate wearing ornate platemail and wielding halberds greetings lady gemcroft said one please wait while we summon an escort make sure you stay on the path for an errant step might prove deadly bertram wasnt there but if he had been alyssa could imagine the scowl hed have given them for her part she was willing to understand leons need for safety perhaps he took it too far but it had been his belongings destroyed in the fire not hers ten armed men came from the front door approaching in neat formation along the cobblestone path leading across the yard when they reached the front they unlocked the gate from the inside and ushered alyssa through your men must stay outside said their leader when her mercenaries started to follow alyssa paused gave him a glare to show she didnt appreciate being told just before entering but then accepted if she felt safe anywhere other than her mansion it was there an assassin would have to be a lunatic to risk the guards the wall and the various traps hidden underneath the grass the heavy boots clacked across the stone as they entered leon waited just inside the door a large smile on his face everything about leon was big his face his eyes his home and most of all his belly hugging him was like hugging a giant sweetroll wrapped in silk only his mustache was thin im so sorry about your loss he said as he let go im sure hed have been a fine man very fine if theres anything you need please let me know thank you she said doing her best to smile and forget how hed always glared at nathaniel as if he were a cockroach whenever he was in his presence bertram is busy finishing the arrangements for the funeral so i thought it best i got out of his way of course of course itd do you well to get out of that stuffy old mansion anyway always told your father he should fire whoever was in charge of his maidservants every breath in there was like licking the bottom of a dustbin another smile her last head maid had died coughing and gagging on blindweed she had a feeling leon would have approved such a fate for letting his sensitive allergies be affected have you any news from laurie she asked as they walked towardof coursethe dining area ever since the kensgold hes refused to come to veldaren leon said as he took her hand i think your fathers death spooked him more than a little such cowardice is inappropriate for a member of the trifect but what can you do surely someone who lives with an army of mercenaries behind great stone walls has no reason to question anothers bravery she said unable to hold back far from upset leon only gave her a wink its one thing to be brave and another to be stupid i wont die to a garrote in my sleep neither would laurie if he took proper precautions maybe staying in angelport is his precaution leon laughed true maybe it is still he is going a little overboard eh they sat down at one end of a luxurious table easily able to seat more than eighty people alyssa watched the servants parade a variety of treats and pastries before her she didnt feel like eating but it seemed leon would keep them coming forever until she picked deciding on a small flour cake topped with strawberries she scooped a tiny bit with her spoon and ate the flavor awakened a dormant part of her a tiny voice reminding her of her own needs and not of others her stomach grumbled and she wondered how long itd been since she ate she was horribly tired and in the fog that was her mind she couldnt remember the rest of the cake vanished as she wolfed it down leon smiled at her and tore into his own assortment of desserts as if hed known all along shed been neglecting her appetite you are more than welcome to stay the night he said sipping some wine from a silver goblet but only after a servant tasted it first just say the word and ill let your men at the gate know they can go home thank you but id still prefer my own bed besides the funeral is tomorrow and i should make sure bertram has everything in order where will it be held she sipped her wine the alcohol tasted strong and she pushed it away fearing how much it might affect her my mansion well bury nathaniel in the garden out back beautiful she debated then called over a servant and asked for another pastry the woman bowed and moments later returned with a cake topped with blueberries alyssa wondered how much leon spent keeping such stock deep in winter did he have some secret to keeping it from spoiling she made a note to ask him once she had more free time on her hands halfway through her second cake she decided she could delay no longer there is another reason im here she said pushing her food away i will soon be putting something in motion and ive come to ask for your cooperation oh he said that one word pregnant with meaning the way he lifted his eyebrow the way he let his lips linger in an o shapehe knew he was about to be asked something he wouldnt like he could read her too well she had to improve she felt like an imposter walking in her fathers shoes no wonder bertram always harped on at her to host more visit more her social skills were lacking their proper finesse weve crossed ten years of this nonsense with the thief guilds she said i once thought my father inept but ive come to see how difficult it is finding these rats and bringing them to their proper fate worse i thought we could make peace at least to reach a level of understanding there will always be those who steal from us but neither of us should fear death in the night they live off our trade after all and should that trade end they will be like leeches sucking a corpse without blood but this wont happen though it may sting we must pull them off my son died because we have gone soft tried to pretend they would finally calm down and leave us be no longer does this have something to do with what potts has been telling me about you hiring every mercenary able to lift a sword it does leon sighed and shockingly enough pushed his own plate away listen youre just a silly girl trapped in your position so ill do my best to save you from this embarrassment you cant find them all alyssa youll never win youd sooner drive out every flea from the southern district than bring the guilds down half those youre paying will just sit in taverns and claim they killed a rogue or three before dinner how will you know how will you keep track every damn beggar you passed by on your way here might have been a serpent or a spider or a member of the ash can you know for sure can you prove it youre throwing your money in the damn gutter ive killed more thieves trying to sneak onto my grounds than i have actually going out and looking for them she felt her neck reddening but she pressed on anyway his arrogance be damned they want us to think that she said but it isnt true they act as if theyll endure but their organizations can crumble their loyalties break they threaten us with poison and razor wire and theyve convinced the city that they are the ones to fear they are the vicious ones it is our fault for believing the lie a guarded look crossed leons face as if realizing how far off his first read of her had been what exactly are you planning he asked we break into every building we search every crack of every wall i have many men skilled in interrogation and the men weve hired are even better at it well find where they run every time these men have no pride no honor theyll point us the right way until they run out of places to hide every guildleader will fall as will their replacements if they wear a cloak they die regardless of the color leon looked ready to explode are you out of your mind we havent had that level of conflict since this started not even during the bloody kensgold youll get every single one of us killed and all because of someof some bastard she stood and flung what was left of her cake into his face father was right she said as he wiped icing from his cheek your cowardice is as big as your gut i will not fear them anymore and neither should you come the end of nathaniels funeral i will unleash my wrath upon the city that has sheltered the murderer of my son now if you would kindly request a servant to escort me to the door he chewed on his lip a moment his fat face blotched red at last he clapped and did as she requested wait he said just before she exited the room just how many men have you hired close to two thousand she said and she felt a sense of victory at the way his jaw dropped as i said leon i will destroy them i will destroy everyone who dares try to stop me even the king even the trifect itself he muttered something but she did not hear it still furious she turned and followed the servant lady out more than ever wanting to be home to plan with her mercenary captains hiding was no longer for her it was time to act come the funeral it was a lesson the whole city would learn a rthur looked about the room with total disgust hed worked with mercenaries before but to invite them into his home so disgraceful they gathered in the dining hall over twelve of them they were the captains the ones with at least a hundred men at their disposal they chatted with one another killing time until alyssa returned they were a motley bunch wearing various combinations of armor ribbons and tunics to distinguish themselves arthur dared not imagine how much coin was flowing into their pockets for simply picking their teeth and eating alyssas food not sure how much fun thisll be said one a bald man with a shaved head proper fight is on a battlefield not crashing into peoples homes and searching for rats killings killing said another since when you started getting picky ill take the money but dont mean i cant want a nice open place to swing my ax probably need that space too otherwise youll cut your own fucking head off fuck you jamie you probably cant wait to start your men will feel right at home wading through open sewers arthur turned to leave and found bertram standing behind him at the door looking just as miserable the stains they leave on the carpet he said shaking his head a price of doing business i suppose the old man nodded as he watched the captains bicker arthur joined his side his arms crossed over his chest have you talked with alyssa lately bertram asked after a time just this morning her mood has soured the closer the funeral approaches id hoped she might grieve like any other regular girl but instead shes out for blood she wants that boys killer found im working on it but hes proven an elusive little fuck bertram chuckled it seems that way yes there are a thousand thieves in this city finding one over another must be difficult still you might look at it a different way knowing one thief from another is just as difficult just like last time arthur wondered if he were being tested this time the wording seemed too strong to be coincidence he decided to go out on a limb im sure that even if we do catch the watcher itll be tough proving thats who he is he said no one seems to know bertram agreed though i trust you in these matters and would vouch for your opinion arthurs eyes lit up is that so he said i dont think it will be long before i have a man to present to her the city might be large but there are too many eyes too many mouths for a man to hide but im glad to know your trust in me is so great i trust you more than i would any of them bertram said waving a dismissive hand at the mercenaries the hadfields have always been good friends of the gemcrofts i can only do so much alyssa needs help in matters such as these a guiding voice amid her grief if only you could talk to her get her to listen i understand arthur said i have my own matters to attend but i should return before nightfall or close to it when i do ill see if alyssa will open up to me thank you bertram said bowing low now if you will i must try to convince those men that while the wine is a courtesy it is certainly not free if you drink it by the barrel gods give you luck with that arthur left the dining hall retrieved his coat and sword and exited the estate normally oric would have gone with him but he had headed north after bringing back nathaniels supposed remains arthur was skilled with a sword though and he knew his way besides once inside the serpents territory hed be treated like a king only minutes from alyssas mansion he noticed the first of many escorting him along the shadows their cloaks were green so he relaxed no doubt william ket leader of the serpent guild wanted to protect his investments arthur couldnt blame him he took a few turns vanishing deeper into the dark dilapidated part of the city several more followed him and for a moment he swore he even saw someone along the rooftops when he arrived at the guildhouse his escorts came into view of its torches and they motioned for him to enter amid the emerald cushions and goldframed paintings arthur sat and waited for william a pretty lady wearing thin veils and nothing else approached and asked him his preference of drink normally he refused always fearing some sort of poison or drug but tonight he needed the help the strongest of whatever you have he said oh but make sure it doesnt taste like piss as you wish she said batting her beautiful green eyes at him he watched her go admiring her figure with enough coin he knew he could have her shame he had to spend the night at alyssas mansion tight figure like that there was so much he could do to arthur welcome arthur stood and tore his attention away from the little tart william he said offering his hand to his younger brother who had been william hadfield before hed changed his name to ket to protect his family from embarrassment my apologies for being gone so long no need said william he was as tall as arthur and had the same eyes and hair i figure you have your hands full handling a grieving mother am i right hands arent full just yet but shell give in to me in time the lady returned with his drink and he accepted it gratefully after a sip to test its flavor about somewhere between sewer water and burning oil he took a large gulp as it set his throat aflame he chuckled at his brother youve been late with your last shipment he said holding back a cough damn that stuff was strong im a little curious as to why williams smile drooped but only for a moment before he fixed it this time far more fake i should have figured a leisurely chat was not in store for me this evening the gold was stolen from us as we smuggled it into the city and through no fault of our own no fault is that so a convenient excuse to not pay me my half wouldnt you think william sat down and arthur followed suit the two stared at one another a quick silent exchange arthur knew william was trying to decide how much he should tell and what his reaction might be for once he hoped his little brother told the truth the whole damn truth have you heard of the watcher by any chance arthur was too surprised to hide his reaction should i take that as a yes william asked raising an eyebrow i have but tell your tale first and then perhaps i can better explain mine william waved over another servant girl who brought him a vintage of wine in a long slender glass well whoever that bastard is got lucky he said after taking a sip stumbled upon us while we were lifting the crate over the wall killed my men took the bags of gold and then do you know what this motherfucker did he scattered it across the street middle of the day high market and he just tears them open and flings em to the crowd not the first time hes done that to us either but usually with smaller amounts scary really if hed throw away that much coin then there isnt a chance we can bribe or deal with him hes out to kill us all of us not just serpents wish i knew what wed done to piss him off normally id doubt the ability of one man to kill so many of yours said arthur but ive seen it for myself lost six soldiers to the watcher wrote his name with their blood he took some of the gold but not all thank the gods another day or two and ill have the rest outside the walls and ready for you alyssa thinks all of it was stolen which will help make up for what we lost i can exchange most of it into neldaren crowns with my merchants and amusingly enough by buying large quantities of food and wine from keenan something quite appropriate about laundering the trifects gold using the trifect themselves any large increase will take some time though when will you be ready to pick up your portion of what weve exchanged so far keep it safe for now things are too chaotic thats one of the other reasons ive come tomorrow is nathaniels funeral and come nightfall you need to make sure your men are prepared alyssas hired at least a thousand mercenaries perhaps far more shes going to let them loose upon the city williams face darkened is she mad what could we have done to spark such animosityunless you blamed her sons death on us i told her the watcher was in the pay of the guilds to keep her from asking too many questions i never could have expected this reaction william flung his halfempty glass to the floor of course not youll throw us to the wolves to make your life easier always have always will what do we do now we cant face that many on our own then dont do it on your own spread word to the rest of the guilds i want alyssa humiliated by this course of action she needs to doubt herself her decisions so she might trust me more she is not in my pocket not yet in time she will be i have no doubt but until then i need your help the redness gradually left williams neck as he leaned back in his chair i think i can convince the others though i have little time a single night to prepare a counterambush thank you for not telling me sooner i like having to pull plans out of my ass a hardness entered arthurs words you chose this life not me i came here the moment alyssa was away now deal with it they glared at one another but finally william relented so be it but what will you do about this watcher hes making life miserable for the both of us if he left the city then hes certainly caught wind of our scheme or at least part of it a wrong word whispered to alyssa and youll hang well hang you mean william smirked at him i live my life in the shadows she already wants me dead and is about to spend a fortune trying to achieve that tomorrow night but you you live your life in the light the only place you can hide would be with me are you prepared to crawl through the gutters and eat shit to save your own ass i think i might prefer the noose william stood their conversation clearly over then you need to make sure the watcher fucking dies z usa watched the ceremony from the rooftops her long cloak wrapped tight about her with only a few days of warning the crowd was smaller than it might have been she recognized various merchants wealthy nobles and a few members of conningtons distant family plus leon himself all were from within veldaren or its surrounding estates tradition would have expected a long enough delay for laurie keenan to travel from angelport but alyssa seemed to care less and less about tradition with each passing day zusa didnt blame her the bones had been placed within a small sealed coffin as they lowered it into the ground alyssa stepped forward to address the crowd she wore a dress of black and dark blues and shed smeared ashes upon her face behind her the sun dipped below the walls of the city and in the twilight she made her decree it is despicable that such a thing could happen she said loud enough for zusa to hear worse that i might be expected to deny my son vengeance so many of you here have made peace with the thieves and in doing so stripped away every shred of your pride and dignity i will not those who prey on us steal from us kill and poison to claim their power they die tonight go home if you must or stay here if you fear the streets but this night only this night must you fear them any longer veldaren aches for a purge and i will be the one to deliver it cry out at me if you wish but it will change nothing the gold is spent the orders are given let the blood flow she looked to the rooftop directly at zusa she nodded back in return that was the last command there was no turning back spinning about her cloak billowing silently behind her zusa raced to the front of the mansion and vaulted off the roof when she landed it was amid the gathered group of mercenary captains who had been ordered to wait opposite the funeral you have your orders she told them all bring the abyss to veldaren and throw every cloak into it give vengeance to my lady the captains grinned and smacked one another on the shoulder about damn time said one lets get to it zusa left to the south still trying to decide her course of action the mercenaries were scattered all throughout the city in taverns camps and houses of those loyal to the trifect they would spill out onto the streets and no one would be there to stop them only king vaelor could make a reasonable attempt with his soldiers but hed have to break a streak of cowardice which zusa knew would not happen ever since the bloody kensgold hed given them all freedom to kill one another so long as their threats were never aimed at him no doubt when the nightmare began the watch would turn the other way if they even left the castle at all she had an inkling they wouldnt but the bloodshed would accomplish nothing if she couldnt find nathaniels killer the watcher where did he hide those in the shadows were about to be flung into the light she resolved to scour the city keeping an eye open for anything unusual if the watcher were as skilled as veliana made him sound he would hold his own no matter how many mercenaries they flung at him veliana she might have offered a prayer for her but she had turned her back against her former god karak she had no one to pray to so instead she just murmured the thoughts aloud hoping that she might survive the night if only she could have relinquished her desire for control of the ash guild she might have made a new life at her side within the gemcroft mansion stay safe vel she said crawling up the side of a small house with a flat roof once atop she leapt across scanning her surroundings for a man cloaked in gray and wielding twin swords a man skilled enough to maybe even defeat her half an hour passed painfully quiet it seemed the entire city had drawn its collective breath then all at once came the exhalation two fires erupted in southern veldaren both supposed headquarters of various thief guilds deciding there was as good a spot as any she headed that way she passed several patrols and one even had the gall to fire a crossbow at her she ducked lower and continued on realizing she would be far from the only one to travel by rooftop that night they were torturing a thief in the street when she arrived at the first fire it was probably supposed to be an interrogation but that would have involved a chance for answers from the victim the thief had blood smeared across his face and the way his jaw hung it looked like itd been broken in multiple places the best he could do was point the light of the fire bathed them in red and in it the thief sobbed for mercy this is your creation zusa whispered to the distant thief hardening her heart against the violence this is the fate you have earned still it seemed a cruel fate when the soldier impaled the thief she was thankful she turned for the second fire when she caught movement from the corner of her eye she backflipped into the air as a blade cut where she had been facing her attacker she fell grabbed the ledge of the building and then flung herself at him he was a giant man his features shrouded in twilight she slammed her knees against his chest it was like trying to knock down an ancient oak she rolled over his head jumped away to give her some distance and then drew her daggers as her opponent whirled she used the halfsecond to examine him he was darkskinned darker than shed ever seen and wore light clothing with a long gray cloak he carried two enormous swords each a length most would need two hands to hold his muscles looked more appropriate to a woodcutter or blacksmith than a thief but most of all her eyes were drawn to the white paint across his face making his shaved head look like a bleached skull a woman he said zusa lunged hoping to take advantage of his surprise she parried one of his swords to the side then thrust her other dagger for the opening the man seemed prepared for the maneuver he twisted slapped aside her thrust and stepped closer she tried leaping back to gain more distance but he followed trapping her at the edge of the roof falling to one knee she tried to hamstring him but again his swords were there batting the far smaller weapons aside part of her wondered why with such advantage in reach he forced them to remain in close combat then one of his swords fell and he felt a hand grab her hair each finger as thick as a sausage her feet lifted off the roof she held in a scream all her focus narrowed to a razor edge her daggers swung both aiming for his neck with only one weapon he had no chance to block at least she thought but he used its flat edge to strike both her wrists as they thrust pushing them over his head before she could bring her arms back down the swords edge pressed against her throat stop struggling he said im not here to kill you his voice was deep so deep it reminded her of the rare times shed heard karak whisper to her in the night she forced herself to calm to look into his brown eyes without flinching the sword pressed tighter against her throat as if he expected her to try and break free instead what do you want she asked not you said the man my target is not a woman i might have said so if you hadnt leapt at me like a rabid dog who are you he stared at her as if deciding something decision made he unceremoniously dropped her she landed on her feet and crouched before him ready to leap at the slightest wrong move i am ghost ive come to claim the watchers head and other than the breasts you fit the description rather closely zusa slowly straightened though her muscles remained tense whoever this ghost was she had no intention of relaxing in his presence who is it that has hired you she asked one of the thieves he grinned at her something about it worsened her unease i cannot tell you as surely you can understand you seem at home in the night and you move as i expected the watcher to move do you know of him tell me and i might make it worth your while whatever i know i cannot say for i seek him as my own bounty my master wishes to be the one to claim his life and i would not dare risk cheating her of it her asked ghost raising an eyebrow too much stop speaking you always say too much so she smiled hoping to convince him that it wasnt a slip of a tongue instead a purposeful decision to make him wonder if she spoke truth or not he probably didnt buy it but it was still worth the attempt so be it ghost said one of his swords shifted she moved to jump but then he saluted her with the blade a game then i will let you search unimpeded but i expect the same courtesy of you if you somehow find him firstall i asked is that you come to me at the mug and feather tavern so i may know your name any lady more skilled in tracking than i is a lady i would sorely wish to meet with again consider it a repayment of my generosity the generosity of a man who nearly stabbed my back before seeing my face to confirm a kill ghost laughed you are still alive woman that alone is proof of my generosity the way he said it with no anger or pride only amusement chilled zusas blood this was a man with whom death was a common companion who believed himself having nothing to prove if such an agreement kept her safe from his blades i accept she said now forgive me but i have a man to find good luck he said oh and stay safe i hear theres a lot of mercenaries out searching for people like you she looked to the fire behind her and the several corpses left there to rot in the street when she looked back ghost was gone no one that big should be able to move so silently she thought but it seemed she was wrong cursing herself she hurried north following the distant cries of battle if she were lucky they might still scare out the watcher but now she wondered if she truly had any hope of finding him before ghost how great would alyssas anger be if she found out ghost had captured him first still that was better than them finding him at the same time however that confrontation might end she knew her blood would be spilled t he city had gone to the abyss there was no other way to describe the horrors haern watched as he hurried along the streets keeping his head down and his swords hidden it was too dangerous to remain on the rooftops every mercenary with a bow was firing at whatever moved hed counted four fires the last time hed found a quiet enough spot to scale a wall and look over the city madness total madness was this what itd been like when his father first declared war against the trifect so long ago the mercenaries traveled in squads some as large as a hundred they roamed the streets smashing in doors dragging out scared owners to ask questions demand names and sometimes execute outright he watched a group of three thieves spiders based on their cloaks chased by twenty men in armor they died when a second group cut them off another ten with naked blades and eager eyes the mercenaries left only pieces of the three pieces because he lacked guild colors and appeared the beggar hed managed to avoid much of their ire hed been questioned twice the first time he feigned deafness the second time he pointed them on their way toward the headquarters of the serpent guild while following them he watched a couple dragged out of bed the husband hollering his wife holding blankets to her chest to hide her nakedness while their children watched from the doorway the mercenaries cut their throats and cheered the name of alyssa gemcroft as if she were a goddess of blood and murder all the while the city guards remained nowhere to be found haern ducked through a side alley not surprised to find two more there with him they wore the colors of the hawks and they drew daggers as he rushed by he wished them luck out of nothing more than professional courtesy part of him wondered how many would abandon their cloaks doing so was considered punishable by death still it seemed the only way to survive of course hed seen plenty without cloaks or colors dying in the street perhaps all itd take was a single man whispering your name to find yourself in the arms of sellswords deciding it worth the risk he used a window ledge to vault atop a house that overlooked the headquarters of the serpents thirty soldiers surrounded the place some wielding crossbows some torches there was no doubt to their intentions those inside could die by blade or by smoke and fire hardly a choice hed desire to make by order of lady gemcroft all those affiliated with the thief guilds are to be executed the mercenary captain shouted we know youre in there so come out and die with honor haern flattened on the rooftop making sure no one could see him the last thing he wanted was some crossbowman with a twitchy finger putting a bolt through his eye this city aint hers challenged a hidden stranger haerns eyes narrowed as he realized the voice did not come from the surrounded headquarters time you sellswords learned that there were five buildings with clear views of the headquarters including the one haern lay atop of from every one of their windows appeared greencloaked men with bows and crossbows with a loud cry they released a third of the mercenaries died in the first wave some tried fleeing toward the main streets while others stormed toward the buildings the arrows gave chase when the last fell haern saw william ket step out from the headquarters a gleaming sword in his hand he found the mercenary captain chopped off his head with three swings and lifted it to the air the rest of his guild cheered haerns blood ran cold the other guilds would certainly be preparing ambushes as well while itd be foolish not to expect losses on both sides and he generally held no love for mercenaries there were a few mercenaries that he did care for damn it senke he whispered pulling back so he wouldnt have to see the executions of those who still cried out in pain tell me you arent part of this nonsense you cant have been this stupid but of course he would have it seemed every free man had been brought into alyssas fury what had spurred this on why now he so rarely heard news of her of the trifect in general theyd grown quiet defensive but this there was nothing quiet about the screams that seemed to come from everywhere as the stars vanished beneath great curtains of smoke how much of the city would burn would any be desperate enough to form bucket brigades while the death squads marched he didnt know and didnt care he had to find senke and delysia losing them once had been hard enough he couldnt do it again the city was large and swarming with men finding them would be near impossible but at least he knew names to search forassuming neither were using aliases haern dropped back to the street and began searching for a smaller group of men to ambush he had to avoid several larger patrols and at one point a crossbow bolt at last he encountered a group of three deep in combat with five members of the ash guild a sixth bleeding out nearby the mercenaries were cornered against the city wall and it was only their superior armor and reach that kept them alive against the greater numbers haern descended upon them like a whirlwind his swords cutting down two before the thieves even knew he was there he cut the throat of a third then watched the final two die at the hands of the mercenaries thanks said one of them a gruff man with a beard and a wicked cut across his nose that was still bleeding fuckers led us here as a trap then jumped us from the rooftops i have no time haern said making sure to keep his cloak low so they only partially saw his face im searching for a small group of mercenaries one is named senke another delysia eschaton they should be together not a clue said the man with the bleeding nose dont know about no delysia said the second as he walked over and killed the sixth ash member who had been whimpering in pain but that name sounds familiar i know a tarlak eschaton and he runs his tiny group nothing but smalltimers guys half off his rocker might be them youre looking for perhaps do you know where they might be the man spat all them smaller groups got put together and sent to the far south alyssa figured itd be easier to spread out and find the rats when they tried to hide in their slums haern fought down his panic theyd been sent into the very homes of the thieves as if they would be the ambushers when the guilds fled to safety there it would be they doing the killing not the mercenaries he had to get them out of there and fast he bowed to the three men and then turned south hey whats your name asked the man with the bleeding nose i have none he shouted when he turned he caught sight of something strange like a white face peering down from the wall round and hairless a glance back revealed only darkness im jumping at shadows he thought if youre alive senke im going to murder you for accepting such a stupid assignment he wondered where his father was in all this he wouldnt hide not against such blatant disrespect the spider guilds headquarters were in the southeast if these eschaton mercenaries stumbled upon him and his best haern ran faster deciding speed was more important than stealth he cut to one of the main roads and trusted himself to outrun any patrols he raced south all the while doing his best to ignore the pain in his stomach the wound there hadnt quite healed though it was hardly more than an angry red scar still the movement was enough to stretch the skin and agitate it what hed have given for an extra day or two to heal before all this madness hit you stop haern cursed as he saw a group of five up ahead rush toward him no doubt thinking him a fleeing member of the guilds the houses were packed tight on either side so it was either turn back in search of a route around or go straight through move he screamed hoping to startle them with his mad rush he slidekicked just before nearing avoiding an arrow that whistled overhead his kick took out the legs of one and he rolled away smashed under that much armor hed be killed in seconds by the others a sword swung for his head but he twisted and fell to one knee two others lunged their swords thrusting haern dove to his right landing hard on his shoulder hed made it to the other side we said stop one of them shouted haern laughed wondering who exactly he thought would obey the command he weaved side to side not surprised to see one last arrow plink into the dirt beside him with their heavy armor they couldnt hope to match his speed last he looked theyd abandoned the chase and instead smashed in the door of a nearby home he offered a prayer to the inhabitants as he ran it seemed the very air grew thicker as he plunged deep into southern veldaren he counted five fires now and one of them wasnt far off the smoke whirled down the streets its distortion good for the thieves bad for the mercenaries he heard sounds of combat from one home with a broken door and he watched another group battle four hawks against two mercenaries he let them be there were too many fights for him to help them all the graveman would be busy tomorrow he thought grimly whatever didnt burn would soon have its walls painted with blood a plume of smoke erupted to his left accompanied by a deep explosion his curiosity couldnt take it he turned climbed onto a rooftop and hurried that way whatever he was expecting to see what he found was not it the area opened up to a fountain carved in the likeness of two women bathing each other long broken and out of water at least twenty men lay dead half mercenaries half thieves their blood mixing together to stain the surrounding cobblestones red a large group of thieves remained wolves judging by their colors they faced off against only four a strange four at that senke guarded one half of the fountain parrying and blocking with his two flanged maces on the other half fought a short man in platemail a punch dagger in each hand delysia stood in the fountain behind senke her lovely red hair matted to her face by a cut across her forehead she was taller than he remembered and she wore the white robes of a priestess his heartbeat raced faster and he forced himself to move while delysia cast spells that bathed them with white light the last of the four stood in the other side of the fountain with his hands surrounded by fire he wore a yellow robe and a pointy yellow hat the color reminded haern of dandelions he had red hair similar in color to delysias and a welltrimmed goatee guys half off his rocker the mercenary had said about tarlak their leader haern had a feeling that was him only the insane or the extremely confident would dare wear such an outfit this tarlak swung his hands in a circle fire danced across his fingers then streaked toward where a group of three hid behind an overturned wagon trying to fire crossbow bolts from cover the wagon exploded into shrapnel and embers the short man seemed hard pressed fighting the one but the wizard kept zapping thin bolts of blue lightning knocking the thief back and keeping him from scoring a kill senke fought three at once yet seemed to be doing better at protecting the two in the fountain having been on the receiving end of so many smacks to the head and kicks to the chest while training with him haern wasnt surprised decision made he drew his swords and charged it was senke and delysia hed come to protect so it was them hed help the wizard saw his approach and turned magic shimmering on his hands its haern senke shouted just as the lightning arced out having seen his approach as well haern rolled wishing hed had far more training in dealing with spellcasters the roll seemed to work for he heard the ground behind him crackle and break from the impact he kicked back to his feet and jumped having closed enough distance to reach the first the wolf turned and tried to impale haern with his sword having had enough of that nonsense only a few days before haern landed short batting aside the thrust while still in the air his opponent exposed it was easy work looping his other sword around and cutting his throat sorry he heard the wizard shout damn fool haern thought as he linked up with senke standing side to side as the wolves closed in glad you could join us senke said between breaths despite the smoothness of his parries and kills he was clearly winded i shouldnt have to what the abyss are you doing out here fight now insult me later as one they went on the offensive it felt like old times carelessly training in threns safe house but this time it wasnt dummies they fought nor did they wield wooden swords this time their opponents bled haern struck both high and low forcing the thief to make desperate parries with his daggers the shorter weapons made his arms move more than haerns to keep up with the attacks and haern used that to put him more and more out of position at last he feinted a wide slash pulled his sword in and stabbed the edge sliced through cloth flesh and into lung as the thief fell senke gave him a good bash on the head with his mace just to be sure two more rushed ahead but a blinding flash from behind haern dazed them with such a handicap they fell with ease to the skilled fighters help brug senke shouted as three more wolves approached from the north joining the others brug the short fat guy haern felt a moments hesitation hed fought alone for so long he wasnt used to obeying orders but then again he felt himself slipping once more into the past nothing but an awkward child learning from his masters he turned and circled the fountain joining brug who was bleeding from his shoulder and face a dagger was still lodged in the crease of his armor he yanked it out as he ran past hurled it at his opponent and then followed it up with a flying kick the dagger hit the thiefs throat with the hilt and then haerns foot cracked his chest the wolf dropped to one knee lifting his dagger in a clumsy defense haern cut him down a clean slice through his throat brug looked ready to explode i had him haern blinked uh sorry a fireball sailed over both their heads delaying the attack of several wolves who had abandoned their attempts at shooting the wizard and instead chosen to close the distance haern felt the heat of it on his neck damn it brug what am i paying you for and you haern right keep him alive will you haern turned to his opponents somewhat amused at how much redder brugs face grew he blubbered then rushed ahead punching the air with his daggers haerns amusement left the idiot was going to get himself killed because of his pride he rushed after the two of them barreling at the three wolves as if they were madmen at the time it was a fair assessment the wolves wavered he saw the doubt in their eyes and then they turned to flee haern killed two for he was too fast and had far too much momentum to be outrun he sliced the hamstring of the third as he ran on by allowing brug to catch up and eviscerate the thief with his punchdaggers sucking in air haern turned back to the fountain the last of the wolves were either dead or fleeing tarlak stepped out of the fountain helped delysia follow and then waved that wasnt so bad he said haern shook his head off his rocker indeed g host followed the watcher south though he did so with no hurry hed watched him fight and learned two things one no pukebrained mercenary was going to be the one to do him in two he had someone close to him he might have thought his quiet voice concealed his emotions but he heard the hint of worry particularly about the one named delysia with that it was only a matter of time before he brought the watcher down you couldnt have attachments not if you wanted to survive against someone like ghost tarlak eschaton wasnt wellknown to him but if he played the mercenary game then he had contacts friends employers maybe even a spot in the guild there would be no hiding so as he strolled down the street always given a wide berth by the groups that rushed past with bloodied swords he paused and looked west a strange commotion was brewing down therehe could tell by the torches and the way several of the recent patrols all turned in that direction had the fighting coalesced into an actual battlefront surely not they werent that organized nor would that benefit the thieves in any way so what then his hands on his hilts he strode over to the mob he estimated at least sixty men gathered around what he realized was the temple of ashhur so far they remained at the steps but that appeared ready to change at any moment fifteen priests stood in their way their hands at their sides they were proficient with many spells he knew but how effective theyd be on armored men he was unsure an elderly priest with a bald head stood in the center of the steps and he faced the crowd without any semblance of worry sweat ran down the sides of his neck though and ghost knew him just as scared as the rest you cannot enter the old man shouted hardly heard over the din of the mercenaries let us in they shouted out of the way you harbor thieves ghost frowned he needed a better look to the side he found a pillar and he used that to vault himself halfway up the steps and from there he peered into the temple inside was chaos hundreds of people crammed within seeking shelter given how many homes hed seen ransacked it made perfect sense where else might be safer they sat on benches huddled against walls and lay in the aisles if need be sure enough he caught sight of a few cloaks in there but not many i will not hand anyone over to be butchered in the streets the head priest was saying go on your way curse our city with your bloodshed if you must but i will not allow it to happen on my doorstep another patrol joined the group this one numbering twenty they muttered amongst each other wanting to know the reason for their delay several more lit up torches ghost felt his blood boil they would set fire to a temple all to meet their bloodthirst a thousand rogues must remain hiding elsewhere but they would come here the head priest lifted a hand over his head a bright light grew from his palm and even from the side it was painful for ghost to look upon he didnt want to imagine staring into it from the front this seemed to draw the mercenaries back a little a captain hed met a couple of times named jamie halfear for obvious reasons stepped forward we dont want nothing bad to happen here he said but we saw plenty run inside before we surrounded the place no one innocent needs to be hurt just send them out those who came here for succor shall receive it said the priest i know i know you gots to say that said jamie please er calan calan i doubt you want us filthy men running through your fancy place so how about i just send one or two to point em out to your little helpers only the guilty get taken out and just a few everyone else stays safe see what im saying they aint your flock they aint your children theyre damn thieves and those with more power than you say its time they die calan shook his head in time perhaps but not tonight go on your way all of you theyre dying tonight you stupid ass no matter what you do i see a lot of stone but this buildings still got plenty thatll burn you hearing me calan itll burn that was enough for ghost though he couldnt care less about their deity the temple was a beautiful structure stubborn and blind the whole lot of them he reached into a side pocket and withdrew a handful of knives weighted to fly true scanning the crowd he waited wanting his choices to be absolutely perfect jamie was too close too public but those near the front most eager for blood hidden behind his pillar he flung his first knife into the crowd it plunged deep into the throat of a man hollering at the top of his lungs ceasing his cries for fire his next three took down torch bearers as ghost decided fire was the greatest threat to the temple down they went their torches clattering across the stone by now the crowd had noticed the deaths and while some wondered aloud most roared for blood theyd blame the priests which was the goal all the better to make the mercenaries appear the fools when he stepped out youd murder us in the street while claiming to protect life jamie cried more to the mercenaries than the priests we have done no such thing calan insisted he might as well have shouted at a thunderstorm to cease its rumbling ghost slipped to the other side of the pillar then hopped lower closer to calan he was directly behind him with a clear view of halfear the captain was practically frothing at the mouth while screaming for blood but hed not yet drawn a blade not yetbut closehis hand twitchingnow ghost coiled his legs and pushed off launching himself between them he wielded a single sword in both hands needing the power before jamie could swing ghosts sword tore through him slicing from collarbone to hip when jamie kicked the upper half of him collapsed backward and rolled down the steps spilling innards while the legs crumpled and lay in place a flood of gasps came from the crowd those that were not stunned silent ghost held the bloody blade before his face peering over it with his eyes be gone damn cowards you have no business here go elsewhere and slay the cloaks in their homes the streets wherever but here this is madness calan said behind him i cant allow quiet priest you may not want bloodshed but itll happen and better here on these steps than inside your halls such disrespect its shameful they deserve to die just as much as those thieves within id rather neither die calan said his voice dropping lower good luck with that ghost had hoped the brutal display would cow the crowd but he underestimated their desire too many seemed eager for a fight theyd gone unchallenged no doubt thought themselves already nearing the end of their task if they went south theyd probably think differently the fires were growing the smoke blanketing the city this fight wasnt over not even close stun as many as you can he said to the head priest blind them knock them back leave the killing to me ill be better at it than you anyway he drew his other weapon and lifted both high above his head as if worshipping a god of the sky draw swords or flee he shouted to the crowd it was time to end this stalling it was time for blood or cowardice the mercenaries surged forward not following any spoken command only a collective realization to attack now or be revealed as bluffers the priests raised their hands their palms facing down the steps light shone from them the intensity blinding ghost heard the sound of a hundred claps of thunder and it passed over him like a physical force those at the front staggered or fell back forcing the rest behind to pull them out of the way ghost took advantage of the confusion leaping forward to gut one mercenary and cut down another he backpedaled up the steps parrying random thrusts that seemed wild as if his opponents were still struggling to see fall back he ordered the priests exchanged a quick look but then calan nodded as he says shouted the head priest the fifteen climbed the steps prayers still on their lips walls of force slammed into the crowd invisible but their effects not he watched noses break heads bruise and fingers snap in painful directions more stumbled upon the steps crushed by those who rushed behind them ghost stayed before calan figuring him the most important to protect he was the strongest and as long as he stood the other priests wouldnt break rank and flee we must hide inside calan said we cant hold them back ghost lunged left to right taking out those who pushed through the spells ahead of the pack they fell disadvantaged by the lower ground and disoriented beyond measure if not for the sheer numbers ghost feared he might have gotten bored we go inside and theyll burn us out he insisted stand and fight old man stand and fight he kicked another body down the steps they were gathering before the door nearly out of space to retreat calan nodded accepting the mans decision so be it he said standing beside ghost and lifting his arms forgive me ashhur but i need your retribution this night he lowered his hands a sound of thunder rolled and then the steps to the temple trembled and broke dust rippled outward in concentric circles giving visibility to the shockwave there were about twenty men pressing upward at the time and they collapsed crying out in pain the amount of broken limbs ghost witnessed was staggering it was like ashhur had stepped down and crushed them with his heel calan trembled then stepped back and accepted the support of two more priests the rest of the mercenaries not willing to even think of climbing those corpsestrewn steps turned and fled ghost leapt among them killing a few more for good measure coated with gore he returned to the temple where he heard songs and lamentations coming from within a couple of the priests thanked him but most eyed him warily and scooted further away when he neared why asked calan his arm still around one of the younger priests why did you help us ghost shrugged cant stand disrespect and thats all that was they should respect me and respect you they didnt and now theyre dead not all of them calan said gesturing to the many wounded he turned to his priests go and tend to them i doubt theyll bother you now ghost said but id consider getting rid of those with colors in your temple while its still calm if i did that said the head priest with a smile i wouldnt be worthy of much respect would i ghost laughed maybe youre right then i hope your god watches over you before this night ends you might still need him d eathmask watched the carnage from the window of a room currently absent of its original occupants no doubt theyd fled to safer territory assuming there was anywhere safe within the city walls hed gone out with the initial patrols under orders from garrick to help ambush some of the smaller mercenary groups when the first fight began hed slipped away joining veliana in the large apartments overlooking their headquarters after a few initial confrontations that left many on both sides dead the area had remained quiet for the past hour most recently a squad of fifty men had checked the headquarters for thieves found none and then moved on i doubt therell be much guild left for you to rule after tonight veliana said relaxing on a motheaten chair hope garrick survives though would be heartbroken if some lousy sellsword gets the honor of cutting off his head hes too cowardly to die tonight deathmask said as he tied gray cloth over his face and straightened it so the eyeholes lined up properly behind him veliana did the same using the knot of the cloth to also keep her hair in a tight ponytail they both wore loose gray clothing and cloaks of a darker shade veliana had killed a pair of spiders in the initial chaos before joining deathmask in the building bringing with her their clothes and weapons while unexpected tonight certainly works in our favor he said once more looking to the window the fewer we have to thin out the better have you given thought as to who we should spare the only ones who come to mind are the twins she said they have a head on their shoulders though it seems like they share it they think so alike its creepy can they wield a blade theyre better at throwing them than wielding them but no average cutthroat could handle them either good names she tugged at her mask trying to get it to fit comfortably mier and nien deathmask rolled his eyes what wonderful parents gods forbid their names be at least a little different he leaned away from the window as a man rushed down the road a jittery fellow who kept glancing in every direction two more followed after veliana saw deathmasks reaction and straightened in her chair someone there she asked looks like some scouts no doubt making sure its safe to come home get ready well have little time between their leaving and garricks arrival the ash scouts vanished into the building deathmask peered out the window watching waiting when the scout emerged deathmask beckoned veliana closer go he said when the scout turned a corner they tossed a rope that was tied to the bed in their room sliding down even as it uncoiled they hit the street in seconds and sprinted for the headquarters deathmask led the way veliana at his heels once inside they slowed walking through the hallway into the lavish rooms pick your spot he said his eyes darting about keep close to the doors for when we make our escape im no stranger to this sort of thing veliana said glaring at him through her mask keep your hood raised if they see your hair they might figure out who you are instead of just assuming you another spider she lifted the hood of her cloak and let it fall across her face as deathmask did the same he entered one of the side sections curtained off to give privacy with the dancer women leaving a gap through which he could watch the entrance veliana adjusted a giant pile of pillows hiding behind it she drew her daggers and waited deathmask did the same there would be no magic for him no spells of blood and shadows the moment he did hed reveal himself to garrick veliana had trained him for a few hours but at knife work he was far from proficient hed spent an hour casting spells of speed and strength on himself to try and make up for the lack but he wouldnt know for sure until the ambush not being much of a praying man he crossed his fingers and swore to succeed whatever the cost the door slammed open in rushed a collection of the ash guild all men closest to garrick deathmask noticed their clothes were lacking in blood and gore no ambushes for garrick which put a smile on his face that fact would work wonders for them later should he and veliana survive for the second part of their plan the thieves went straight for the obvious the bar filled with bottles of wine and ale deathmask was glad he couldnt see veliana who was no doubt smirking shed insisted that would be their reaction whereas he thought many would rest atop the pillows to relax after a brutal night of fighting theyll drink it off before they sleep it off shed said while they waited through the night need to listen to her more often he thought she thinks more like a man than i what i get for growing up among wizards i guess they both waited deathmask watching until he was sureand there he was standing amid his men holding his glass the highest as they toasted a night of survival to standing atop the dead he heard garrick say toasting your own cowardice and to think i thought i was a bastard he pushed aside the curtain and charged his dagger drawn and ready as he pushed himself to the limit he felt his feet move faster the world almost imperceptibly slower he buried his dagger into the back of the nearest thief whose glass fell from his hand before it hit the ground two daggers flew across the room thudding into the back of another veliana scattered pillows as she lunged much of her face thankfully hidden by her hood she kicked the closest thief the one shed hit with her daggers yanking out the blades as her foot slammed him into the others wine splashed to the floor as the rest dropped their drinks and drew their blades crying out warnings of trap and ambush garrick was in their center and he fell back instead of drawing his dagger deathmask knew he was velianas target not his but he had to clear a path for her sidestepping a thrust he jammed his dagger into the chest of another using the body to protect himself from several more the ash members were starting to spread out better to take advantage of their numbers that thinned the wall toward garrick and veliana wielded her daggers like a demoness twisting and curling to avoid every thrust blood soon joined the wine that stained the floor deathmask felt pride in seeing her work no one that survived could possibly doubt that the best of the spider guild had come to take the life of a rival well those that watched her anyway he on the other hand struggled to stay alive his dagger batted side to side sometimes faster than he expected thanks to the earlier enchantment the impulse to cast a spell to blind his opponent filled him and only at the last second did he refrain the ruse was more important he gained nothing giving himself away the ash needed to be his guild to rule he couldnt do that if revealed in the guise of a rival guild his arms trembled as he felt steel cut into them he fought three men at once and they grinned at the sight of blood he was outmatched and now they knew it finish it he cried to veliana hurrying to the door veliana was in the middle of disemboweling another man and at his cry she shoved him aside the path between her and garrick was clear instead of charging she lifted a dagger and threw its aim was true the point pierced his shoulder and lodged deep burying up to the hilt garrick howled as his blood ran that was enough deathmask rushed for the exit feeling like his legs didnt belong to him veliana hesitated for just a moment and he saw her other dagger trembling in her hand trusting her to do the smart thing he burst through the door and into the night she appeared a moment later looking none too pleased come on he said he took a zigzag course through the city on a path he had memorized by heart they arrived at an inn with rooms theyd already paid for several hours before deathmask climbed in through a window which had no glass only thick wood shutters that he had left unlocked he was already changing back into his ash guild outfit when veliana climbed inside did you kill him he asked i wanted to that a no she yanked the mask off her face and flung back her hood what do you think he grinned knowing his skill was nowhere near hers hed left the delicate task of harming but not killing garrick up to veliana up until the throw itself he hadnt been sure if she would make it lethal or not you did marvelously he said tossing the old cloak to the bed and pulling off his tunic and now i can trust you all the more if i was in your position i might have accidentally hit garricks throat that would have left me homeless and guildless she said grabbing her old ash outfit from the bed she reached for the door where you going he asked to change the door shut behind her deathmask sighed no fun at all she returned moments later dressed in the colors of the ash and looking to be in an even fouler mood theyre still stained with my blood she said referring to the red patch on her chest ill try to get you something newer when i can he said didnt want to attract any attention they might wonder why i was requesting an outfit for someone half my weight youre a thief now remember steal it deathmask shrugged ready she pushed him aside and climbed out the window this better work she muttered otherwise were in for a lengthy death im in for one perhaps but youve already had your public execution remember she slammed the shutters in his face w hen amid her grief she had thought hearing the cries of pain and seeing the river of blood would give her closure but instead alyssa felt hollow as she watched the fires spread across the city standing at the secondstory window of her private study she touched the cold glass and wondered what it was she had done had she brought freedom to the city peace of mind not this night but perhaps this was just like cauterizing a wound there would be heat pain but then the bleeding would stop and healing could commence someone knocked on the door and she had a feeling who the rest of her help would be asleep or perhaps laying awake in their rooms wondering about the safety of their friends and family beyond her mansions walls come in arthur she said surprised by how tired she sounded she rubbed her face with her hand discovering tears had she really reached such a low crying without realizing it while she wasted the night away staring out a window the door opened then softly shut moments later she felt arthurs hands on her shoulders when he started massaging she leaned back pressing her head against his neck people are too scared to form bucket lines he said the fires will only spread she sighed she should have known of course probably did even but let her hatred blind her let the whole city burn shed thought plenty of times so long as it burned the rats with it but this was her war now and that meant dealing with all its ills all its blame send someone to the castle tell the king i request the aid of his soldiers in putting out the fires with the castle guard there it should outweigh any fear selfpreservation is strong arthur said letting her go for so many to remain in hiding willing to lose everything to the fire shows how great a fear you have created i meant to scare the thieves she said not the innocent but are there any innocent anymore how deep does veldarens sickness run maybe i should let it burn all of it my son is nothing but ash so why not them why not he wrapped his arms around her and held her tight and in them she let herself cry she found herself crying often in his presence there was a strength in him and a desire to please more than anything she felt she could trust him hed been there for her when she needed him most was this wrong she asked have i truly erred so badly his response was long delayed to the point she thought he might not answer you have done what you thought was right and what was best for the gemcroft family i will not fault you for that if you will do the same for me and what is that arthur he turned her about and kissed her his hands were firm on her shoulders she felt herself responding she was so exhausted so drained his touch was like an awakening a pull from a nightmare that threatened to consume her day in and day out the messenger she breathed while her mind remained able to think arthur leaned close his hot breath against her ear let the fires burn a little longer if the cowards cannot save their own city the blame lies with them the study lacked a bed but the carpet was soft they made love him atop her she wrapped her arms around his chest and clutched him as if her life might end if she let go she tried to forget the death and fire her call for revenge even as the pleasure tore through her she could not help but wonder if that wicked wicked man responsible for the death of her son lay dead somewhere in the street or if his body were nothing but ash in a distant fire atop her arthur continued to grunt and thrust t he arrival of the sun was a blessed thing to veldarens citizens the mercenaries retreated having fought and searched long through the night those with cloaks and colors buried themselves inside whatever safe houses they had to recuperate and plan those who sided with neither filled the streets forming bucket lines from the wells and digging ditches to combat the fires many others went to their families and friends needing confirmation of their survival before beginning their daily tasks the markets bustle was subdued the streets awash with murmurs haern watched it all through the window of the small apartment the fire had gotten dangerously close to senke and delysias home reaching all the way to prathers inn and burning it to the ground people were everywhere halfburied in the smoke that billowed from the dying fire soldiers of veldaren hurried about but their presence in the streets did nothing to ease peoples minds you look troubled delysia said and he flinched as if poked with a stick blushing for no reason he turned back to her and accepted the cup of warm milk shed brought him i mixed in some herbs she said sitting opposite him in a rickety chair youll sleep well and by looks of it you could use the rest he thanked her again and sipped the milk wisely deciding not to comment on how terrible the drink tasted his eyes lingered on her face and he struggled not to make his staring obvious shed grown so much over the past five years filling out into womanhood her hair was longer but still the same fiery red her cheekbones were more pronounced and in her priestess robe she looked almost regal her chest was also significantly larger out of everything he tried to make sure his glances at that remained uncaught he continued to sip the drink mostly to avoid conversation he had no clue what to say to her the last time theyd met hed come to her in desperate need for guidance hed needed to understand a life outside the cold retribution of his father his tutor robert haern had spoken of the god ashhur and now here she was a priestess of the same god his thoughts had turned only to survival yet now came back with a burning vengeance what was it hed told delysia he needed ashhur otherwise hed end up like his father hed be a killer without mercy a terrible creation the city feared long live the watcher he thought what have i become iim glad youre all right haern blurted feeling lame as he said it he saw a shadow cross over delysias face but she pushed it aside with a smile i try not to think about that night she said theres too much i dont understand even now who you were who you are what ashhurs purpose might have been i must confess i almost hoped id die i was so tired so confused but i feared i might never see my brother and so i struggled for every breath the room fell silent the rest were asleep exhausted from the long night but delysia had stayed awake insisting she could manage for a few more hours haern used to going long periods without sleep had dully stared out the window and waited for a chance to talk now he had the chance he didnt have a clue what to do with it im better at killing does that prove just how far ive fallen youd be proud father the man who shot you was my father he said figuring to start with what he knew for certain he feared what your influence might do to me he was right to fear it too they dragged me to karaks temple and did their best to burn away my faith did they succeed she asked sipping from her own cup her green eyes peered over its edge he felt like he was that same stupid kid shed trapped in her cupboard he remembered watching her cry moments after thren had executed her father what could he ever be to her but a remembrance of those painful times he saw her watching him and he remembered her question no he said the past five years murdering men in the streets seemed to have done a fine job of it though what have you been doing she asked how have you survived he didnt want to answer why was he so afraid shed judge him so long ago hed come to her for advice now he feared every word she might say i slept in the streets he said he was the watcher of veldaren damn it he would fear no one nothing ever since ive been killing members of the thief guilds hoping to destroy them its pointless futile but still i try its the only thing that gives me meaning he thought shed berate him or challenge his claim instead she looked at him with sad eyes and that was worse im so sorry she said its because of me isnt it because you protected me his mouth fell open of course not dont bedelysia i chose everything i did i would have stayed with you spoken with you forever if i could that nightthat single night ive cherished that memory it was one of the few bright spots in my entire childhood but then my father darkened it with blood my precious memory always leads to him his murder his guilt it pushes me on consumes everything i have become something i dont think either that little girl or that little boy could ever have understood or accepted he looked back to the window not wanting to see her reaction he was a damn fool thats what he was hoping shed leave him be he refused to react when she stood from her chair set her cup down and came closer her hand touched his face and reluctantly he turned to her tears were in his eyes she kissed his cheek then pressed her forehead against his go to sleep and try to remember that while you are not that little boy i am no longer a little girl she trudged up the sharply curved stairs to the second floor haern watched her go and when she was gone almost fled to the streets but he remembered that feeling in the pensfields home of having a home he felt that same thing here though the company was on the odder side he downed the rest of his drink grimaced and then set the cup aside his chair was comfortable enough far more than the cold street he was used to so he crossed his arms and tried to sleep footsteps coming back down the stairs opened his eyes he didnt think hed slept but he wasnt sure it wasnt delysia that had come down though instead it was the wizard her brother hed shed his pointy hat though he still wore those strange yellow robes he rubbed his goatee as he plopped down in a chair opposite haern had some words with senke he said that so well most involved variations of get out of my room so i can sleep you idiot but there were some more intriguing bits i dragged out of him most interesting was that of your father thren felhorn really you look more like something two vagabonds might bump out on a cold drunk night flattered tarlak tapped his fingers together and his mouth shifted about as if he were chewing on his words before saying them not much for talking i get that i like to talk so perhaps i can make up for the both of us senke says youre good really good what i saw out there tonight certainly confirms it cant expect much less from threns son of course youve established quite a reputation too ive heard plenty talk of the watcher usually poor thieves grumbling into their cups about how much gold you cost them a few even thought you were ashhurs vengeance come down upon them for their lifestyle though they usually had to be incredibly drunk to admit it you have a point several one on my nose one on my hat and one where the ladies love me but thats beside the uh point it seems like other than revenge you dont have much going for you ashhur knows those streets out there arent comfortable living so how about you join my mercenaries instead pay isnt the best but with half the city employed in killing thieves i think we could make a few coins besides his eyes lit up can you imagine the rates i could charge if people knew the watcher was in my pay im not for sale haern grumbled tarlak frowned well thats disappointing you sure very the wizard scratched at his chin this a pride thing i have no use for money tarlak grinned im not sure i believe that but im more thinking you feel you dont need money considering all the stories of you tossing gold coins in the middle of high market i can believe that but there are some things you can buy with gold that you might be more interested in our introductions were a little haphazard but you met brug right short guy cussed a lot cant fight worth shit thats him i didnt hire him because of his skill with those ludicrous whatevertheyare he fights with obviously you want to know why i did haern stared at him with an expression showing he didnt think himself having a choice in whether he found out or not tarlak blinked right anyway hes a blacksmith and with my help he can create items that many would sell their souls to own would you like to run faster jump higher or perhaps a fancy sword or three im not much for bribery either dont see why you shouldnt be you spend your nights crawling around the rooftops killing thieves might as well get paid for it haern turned his chair so his back was to tarlak and he stared out the window very well tarlak stood ill leave you be take a nap or vanish in the afternoon you arent held prisoner here think about my offer though we may not be much now but i think weve got potential haern snorted whether tarlak heard or not he didnt react only went up the stairs staring at the men and women still fighting the fire he wondered what in the world had gotten a hold of him that wizard was no better than anyone else not even his father he killed for money except he used fire and words instead of a blade what could have possibly possessed senke to join them he closed his eyes and felt the light of the sun warm his face come that afternoon hed sneak his way out oh he had no delusions of abandoning delysia and senke completely he knew himself better than that itd be easy enough to keep an eye on them though keep his eyes open for a wizard in yellow accompanied by a beautiful girl with hair like fire when he opened his eyes many hours had passed he shook his head fighting the grogginess his back ached and it popped several times as he shifted his upper body side to side senke stood at a small counter eating cold bread leftover from that morning his fingers drummed the counter the sound no doubt what had awakened haern you chew like a cow haern said pressing his thumb and forefinger against his eyes and you look like one only worse when was the last time you had a bath consider that a luxury my life cannot afford senke shoved the rest into his mouth and wiped crumbs from his shirt here he said his mouth full he pointed at haerns swords been a long time since we sparred thought itd be a nice way to catch up where the room was cramped as is senke nodded toward a back exit there come on there was a small space of flat dirt out back part of an alleyway that ran behind their group of apartments the faint outline of a circle remained dug into it and senke refreshed it with his heel only person to train with has been brug and trust me thats not much of a workout youll do me fine haern stretched away the rest of his drowsiness senke had been the better fighter when they last met but the years had hardened haern granted him strength and height while his nightly excursions had honed his reflexes and skill he touched the tips of his swords together and bowed senke had carried two shortswords with him and he wielded those instead of his maces maces will be too slow for you he said so lets try the blade eager to show how much hed learned haern initiated their combat with a quick lunge expecting the ensuing parry he followed up with a slash with his other weapon using it as a distraction to allow his first thrust to pull back and thrust again senke however hadnt been threns enforcer without good reason he shoved both attacks high stepped closer and feinted an elbow to haerns face when haern stepped back trying to fall into position senke pressed the attack keeping his swords out wide the second elbow that came flying in was no feint and it smacked into his chest with a heavy thud again he stepped back but instead of chasing senke pointed to where hed stepped beyond the bounds of the circle out he said feeling his cheeks flush haern stepped back into the practice ring he wasnt focused wasnt analyzing senkes reaction like he might other opponents taking a deep breath he forced himself to calm a nod and they resumed this time he remained patient and he swallowed down his pride to acknowledge senke was just as fast as him most opponents he could overwhelm with simple brute speed the massive gaps in their skill overriding any of his carelessness not now senke stepped closer swinging both his blades in a downward arc haern parried them aside then looped both swords around as he advanced senke blocked the barrage then planted his back foot to halt his steady retreat to the circles edge seeing this haern pressed the attack relying on his opponents lack of mobility but the planted foot had been a kind of a feint for when haern swung with all his might ready for the clash of steel and challenge of strength instead senke twirled out of the way overextended he could do nothing but accept the stings of senkes shortswords slapping against his arm come on now senke said pausing to catch his breath i expected far better than that kings sake i saw you handle yourself better last night against those thieves again he felt his neck flush was he holding back he didnt mean to be treat me like any other opponent senke said clanging his swords together fuck treat me like your father everything haern show me everything you got everything he thought everything it seemed like a red light bathed over him flashing from a ring on senkes finger he forgot they only sparred forgot they fought in a dirt circle instead of a real battlefield he forgot his opponents name was senke and imagined instead the glaring figure of thren felhorn furious deadly a bow in his hands and delysia dying at his feet his father grinned as if the corpse there suddenly didnt matter hello son said thren he gave that image everything his swords weaved in tight circles as he slipped from stance to stance always shifting always attacking the sound of steel on steel became a song in his ears their blades looped and twisted parrying away sure hits and blocking cuts that should have hit before either could counter threns grin faded just a cold image that watched him without any sign of exertion or worry haern found himself wondering where he was what was going on around him the alley had become an old safe house theyd lived in for a year the hardwood floor polished and prepared for practice youve learned nothing thren shouted bearing down on him with his shortswords haerns arms ached with each block and that ache slowed his response when one of the attacks slipped to the side curling back for a thrust haern twirled his sword parrying moments too late his chest burned and blood ran down as he grunted in pain thren rammed his heel into his stomach knocking him back what are you to me now what could you hope for come at me son kill me your skill is nothing nothing haern felt his mind change becoming something whole focused and dangerous the entire world ceased to exist and even time struggled to keep him under its rule he let out a cry and attacked this time his fathers attacks were no longer so frightening despite his feints his parries haern saw through them all and refused to be controlled by them faster and faster he whirled his body lost in a dance their blades intertwined their motions in constant reaction to each other he managed a snapkick into threns face dropped to the ground and then swept his feet out from under him as he fell haern lunged one sword shoving his fathers defenses out of the way the other stabbing for his throat instead of piercing flesh he stabbed dirt thren scattered as if his body were made of dust and then he was back in the alley the wound on his chest vanished his pain along with it senke leaned against the complex his arms crossed haern felt naked before him his heart exposed and bleeding your hatred for him is so great senke said softly its all that keeps you alive isnt it you cant live like that haern you have every reason to escape his shadow yet you still let it lord over you what have you become how many have you murdered in his name they were all guilty haern shouted thieves and murderers were they always i just saw what lurked behind your eyes haern more frightening than anything your father might have done to me haern thought of all the men and women hed hunted in the night theyd worn guild colors yes but how many had been innkeepers farmers smiths and butchers how many had he killed for doing business with them smuggling and trading and selling night after night he felt the waves of his dead for ashhurs sake hed written his name with their blood its not hopeless senke continued i thought id lost you but now finding you i wonder what is left of that small boy who loved to read the one who asked me about jewelry for a girl he liked id always hoped that if youd survived youd have gone and experienced everything thren denied you now i see you denying yourselflove faith friendshipand you do so out of revenge senke walked over and sat down beside him putting a hand on his shoulder sorry about the illusion he added just a trick of this ring tarlak gave me i had to see i had to know who you are how good you can be now you do haern said feeling his insides tighten and twist behind his ribs is it truly so bad senke squeezed then smacked his back doesnt matter he said with a wink im still here for you as is that pretty redhead tarlak has for a sister hes a good man tarlak a bit strange but hes a wizard so thats to be expected stay with us put these streets behind you if youre to have a legacy it shouldnt be this youve become the feared reaper of the guilds should thren ever find out you still live i cannot help but wonder if hed be furiousor proud he stood and moved for the door go back to your streets he said think on everything ive said theres so much good in you i can see it still its never too late to change who you are so long as youre willing to bear the consequences youve carried heavy burdens your whole life haern maybe its time you let some of them go not waiting to see if he stayed or not senke stepped into the room and closed the door behind him as its lock shut haern felt thrust back into the world hed called his home for the past five years but for once the streets seemed foreign their alleyways and rooftops offering no safety only a winding path deeper and deeper into confusion he took them anyway getting farther with every step d o you think hes telling the truth matthew asked his wife as they cuddled in bed for the night i dont see any reason for him to lie i can think of plenty hes hurt sick and in a strangers home truth might be the farthest thing from his mind what if he doesnt know lady gemcroft only hopes shell take him in if we show up at her doorstep evelyn put her arm across his chest and pressed her face against his neck it would explain a lot though wouldnt it she asked her voice quiet why those men were searching for him we both knew he was no ordinary boy not to be hunted like he is but why would arthurs men be after him the whole bloody north knows hes been courting her an unspoken question hovered in the air between them until at last matthew gave it voice what if the men we killed were actually trying to rescue him matthew waited for his wife to speak trusting her to better understand these complicated matters he could list the price of every vegetable that grew in dezrel what the color of the soil meant and what could grow in it but these things were beyond him he liked living outside the city where so long as you paid the taxman when he came you could live unbothered by your lord and always trust your neighbors hard luck comes in strangers hands his ma had always said that man haern might have kidnapped him evelyn said if he were wounded and low on food hed need someone like us to help out but why leave the boy here why tell us to take him back to his parents whenever he could talk everything he paid us for he could have taken by force still i wont pretend to understand arthurs reasons and neither does tristan he says his name is nathaniel evelyn kissed his neck i told him his new name and well use it so long as hes with us no need to risk undue attention should we go out and about matthew grunted fair enough it might be arthur himself that came for him though everythings just a jumble when tristan tells what happened but i think youre right those men weret up to no good could see it in their eyes so what do we do matthew sighed he wished he knew while he thought he ran his rough fingers through her hair enjoying its softness we got to get him home even if that means travelling all the way to veldaren what if you stop in felwood and deliver him to lord gandrem hes always been a friend to the gemcrofts so was arthur he was right of course and he could tell she knew it let us all go then i dont want to be left here and it wont be safe for the kids either our livestockll die with how much haern gave us we could buy our farm back twice over matthew shook his head side to side thinking of all the work hed put into raising his cattle and pigs still no good reason to let them die waste all theyre worth besides me going to the city might be strange but it aint unheard of all of us packing up to go if theres more soldiers looking and you know there are then theyll hear about it in a heartbeat ill go alone just me and the boy hes light enough we can ride together make good time we have no horses ill buy one from the utters in the morning evelyn pulled her arms tight across her chest as if she were cold she recognized that tone in his voice hed made up his mind and itd take tears and a hysterical fit from her to change it she didnt have it in her they had to do something before more soldiers showed up looking for tristan trevors old enough to look after most things matthew continued as if trying to reassure her and with the cold already breaking well easily last until spring on what wood we have ill leave you half the coin too in case something happens you can afford salt or meat if need be i know i can do it she snapped dont mean i want to or will enjoy it im scared matt scared witless what if men come looking while youre gone he kissed her forehead i trust you he said and ill pray you stay safe i dont know what else to do evelyn i just dont know come morning he trudged east through the halfmelted snow across fields he knew by heart the utters were a large clan and wealthier than most at least compared to the local farm folk they had several horses and while they might not be eager to part with one matthew knew the gold jingling in his pocket would be persuasive enough when he returned it was atop a mare hed paid for far more than she was worth but given how they were still waiting for winter to make its exit and time wasnt on his side hed been forced to accept he refused to be overcharged on the saddle though without that mare you got no reason for it anyway hed said and after threatening to buy a saddle from the haerns or the glenns theyd relented the mare was a beautiful horse named strawberry so named by one of their daughters matthew thought the name a little demeaning for such a majestic creature but figured hed leave it be considering the horse was already familiar with it on his ride back he swung by fieldfallow the closest thing to a town for thirty miles and bought trail rations and a thick riding coat little early to be heading up to tyneham the old storekeep had said matthew only gritted his teeth and paid again twice as much as he would have in spring back at the house tristan was already bundled up and ready to go his fever had come and gone but never as bad as before matthew kissed his kids goodbye hugged his wife and then set tristan on the saddle you ever ridden a horse before he asked the boy nodded at the castle he said matthew guessed he meant felwood and again he felt tempted to stop there lord gandrem was an honorable old man surely he wouldnt let something untoward happen to the boy resolving to decide the issue later he climbed into the saddle shifted tristan so they could both sit more comfortably and then set off the first day came and went uneventfully a caravan passed them heading north dour men that didnt even wave greeting just before nightfall he spotted a distant pond glad for once for the cold since thered be no mosquitoes flitting about he set up camp beside it strawberry staked close enough to the waters edge to drink tristan had remained quiet through much of the ride and matthew didnt press him to talk come the fire though it seemed both their tongues loosened how long until we get there tristan asked matthew poked the fire with a stick shifting one of the thicker logs into a hotter section so it might burn better itll be several days to reach felwood from there less than a week to ride into veldaren thats where your ma is right the boy shivered as if the mere mention of her name reminded him how far away from her he was i think so he said do youdo you think she misses me cant see why not evelyn would be sick with fits should one of our sons run off missing tristan pulled his blanket tighter about him and his eyes glazed as he stared into the fire he died protecting me he said who mark i liked him hes nicer than lord hadfield the name mark didnt ring any bells but hadfield sure did do you know why arthur would want you dead boy youre young sure but you got ears and you probably know more than i when it comes to the upper crust i dont he always said i was like his son and when he married mom hed be my father matthew felt a tingle in the back of his head at that perhaps it had something to do with marriage had alyssa rejected arthur and he lashed out spite did he want to remove any potential heirs what foul plans might he have for alyssa as well too many questions without answers safe to say he aint planning to be much of a father to you matthew said now eat up got a long ride tomorrow and youll need the energy for it ridings tiring work though you wouldnt think it they slept under blankets halfway through the night matthew awoke to distant howling coyotes he figured a tired glance to his side showed tristan shivering a shaking fist pressed to his lips he was crying touched matthew reached out and put his arm around the boy sliding him closer so he could wrap him in a hug tristan continued to cry but his trembling stopped soon the crying turned to sniffles which turned to steady breathing matthew fell asleep not long after come morning they both woke redeyed tristan said little and several times matthew had to hold back an angry word evelyn always insisted he was a bear when he got up in the morning no reason to take that out on the poor kid they ate some rations drank and then rode south stopping every few hours to stretch their legs and rest their backs matthew wasnt a stranger to a horse but he hadnt ridden in over six months muscles he didnt know he had announced their angry presence to him starting to think walking would be a better idea he grumbled tristan said nothing by the second day the plains were spotted with trees and with each hour they rode they gathered thicker forming clusters that would soon be a forest felwood castle was getting closer it was one of those nearby clusters that saved both their lives theyd stopped by one for a piss and while dismounted they heard the thunder of hoofbeats approaching from the south a warning instinct like when he knew something was after his animals told matthew it was time to get off the road this way he said grabbing the reins in one hand and matthews wrist with the other he led them into the copse of trees far enough that theyd go unnoticed stay here and hold on tight he said handing tristan the reins hurrying back toward the road he peered from behind a tree as a group of five rode past at full gallop they wore dark tabards that he easily recognized hadfields men did they know of gert and bens absence more importantly did they know where itd happened trying not to think about it he returned to matthew who stood with wide eyes its them again isnt it he asked yeah matthew said looked like it will everyone be safe matthews jaw clenched tight he yanked the reins from the boys hand and led them back to the road ashhur only knows he said as the silence hung over them and if not then may karak curse every one of those bastards including the one who brought you to me he thought not cruel enough to say it aloud o ric sped his men across the road between felwood and tyneham the lightest touch of panic brushing his neck it wanted to dig in sink its claws deep but he refused to let it he hadnt failed his master yet and so far he had no reason to think he would not a soul had seen or heard anything of nathaniel it seemed likely hed frozen to death that strange watcher there for the gold and nothing else the lack of information suggested the boy was a corpse in the melting snow somewhere his body devoured by coyotes or vulturesexcept for one troublesome detail theyd found gerts horse unbridled the soldier nowhere to be found that meant he was dead somewhere killed while searching for nathaniel so far he had no evidence but he assumed the same had happened to ben for two of his men armed and armored to mysteriously vanishtheyd found nathaniel and then paid the price he needed to discover where and quick if the boy even made it to felwood thered be disaster lord gandrem certainly knew of alyssas loss and oric had personally brought the body to be buried all sorts of questions would need answered should nathaniel appear alive and well and none of the answers would endear him to anyone it was either find the boy or hang from a noose the farms were few and far between as they rode north and something clicked as he finally came upon where the ambush had first been lets say youre wounded and carrying a sick boy he said to his men snows falling and youre low on food what is it youd do ditch the boy said one either way hes dead no reason to go with him assume yourself a better man than that what then carry him until i find the closest shelter oric tapped his forehead exactly patt take rat and go north stop at the first two homes off the road and you search them thoroughly the rest of you come with me they split two north three south oric had a feeling this watcher when in danger would have gone south instead of north since by all appearances veldaren was his home they saw no dwellings for the rest of that first day but come the second a farm appeared in the distance oric led the way feeling his pulse quicken this had to be it the watcher would have stopped here maybe not for long but at least for food and water when he knocked on the door it was a long time before he heard a response whos there asked a womans voice oric silverweed soldier of lord hadfield of the north i demand entrance a lock rattled from inside oric leaned back toward his men and whispered hands on your hilts at all times the door opened revealing a mildly attractive woman in her early thirties beside her stood a teenage boy a dagger tucked into his belt from where oric stood he saw several more children all younger huddled about a wood stove wheres the man of the house he asked as they stepped inside thats me said the eldest boy oric raised an eyebrow as he glanced at the woman something already felt off whats your name boy he asked glad to see him ruffle at being called boy if he was angry he might say something stupid something hed rather have kept quiet about trevor wheres your pa trevor that brief hesitation along with the womans sudden flare of her eyes was all oric needed to know he had two men with him one a young soldier named uri and the other a skilled fighter named ingram oric turned to them purposefully putting his back to trevor and his dagger ingram search out back check the barn the fields anywhere they might keep him uri search the house pull up the floors if you have to you cant do this the woman shouted oric struck her with the back of his hand finally trevor drew his dagger before he could do a thing oric crossed the distance rammed his throat with one arm and grabbed trevors wrist with the other he held him pinned against a wall as the younger children screamed you pulled a blade on me boy oric said feeling like a wolf among sheep he let a wildness appear in his eyes knowing itd frighten them more that means i can do whatever i want and i got half a mind to leave you a cripple think your ma here will keep feeding a worthless belly that cant help out in the fields how you think shell like watching me cut off your fingers one at a time trevors eyes were wide and he looked ready to cry he couldnt speak only cough and oric kept the pressure up to keep it that way he wanted him lightheaded scared convinced he was about to die stop it please the woman pleaded she still stood near the door a red mark swelling on her face meanwhile uri flung open drawers and dressers as he searched the house occasionally stamping hard with his heel to test for false floorboards stand over there with your children oric snapped at her you make a move toward me anything at all and you can watch as i pull your sons guts out one inch at a time she reluctantly obeyed sitting between her two girls a young boy was with them and he moved to sit at her feet oric turned back to trevor who had dropped the dagger and started retching silently take a deep breath he said lessening the pressure as air sucked into his windpipe trevor coughed every gasp he made strained good now you listen to me got it im missing two of my men and im thinking they were here but lets not worry about that right now right now i want to know about a little boy red hair about five years old did someone bring him here the truth you worthless shit tell me the truth trevors face contorted with pain he had something to say no doubt about it but he didnt want to even threatened with death he didnt want to say he was protecting his parents oric realized nothing else could keep his tongue still when so blatantly faced with death well there were ways around that uri he shouted the man appeared seconds later yeah oric find anything uri shook his head he aint in here nothing for ben or gert either oric looked to the adjacent room which was curtained off decided there would work come take him he told uri the other soldier grabbed trevor by the wrists and shoved him through meanwhile oric walked over to the woman whats your name he asked her evelyn she said through clenched teeth pretty name that you come with me now or ill drag you away by the hair while your little ones watch your choice she kissed her daughters and stood oric put a hand on her neck and guided her into the room where uri pinned trevor against a wall youre trying to protect your ma maybe your pa or both oric said as he shoved evelyn onto the small bed in the cramped room but you aint protecting them not anymore gonna show you whatll happen trevor if you dont tell me what you know got that hold him tight uri will do oric struck the mother spun her onto her stomach and ripped at her skirt when she started to sob he took a wad of the blanket and shoved it into her mouth trevor struggled but uri stood a foot taller and easily outweighed him oric pulled off his belt pushed aside the rest of evelyns skirt and shoved himself inside she screamed into the gag tears streaming down her face oric beat her when her screams got too loud or when trevors struggles lessened he needed the horror to continue he wanted that fucking brat scarred when he finished oric pulled back and refastened his belt evelyn pulled at her skirt trying to hide her nakedness but oric yanked at it denying her even that let him go he said to uri trevor flung himself at oric who expected the reaction he ignored a single punch caught trevor by the throat and flung him back against the wall you want to know what will happen next he asked as trevor clutched his wrist im thinking uri wants a turn but im not letting him know why because youre going next unless you tell me everything that happened here he laughed hows that sound ever wanted to needle your ma trevor heres your chance no one will blame you you were just being a man right protecting your family how about one of your sisters out there think they could use a good poke maybe ill make you do all three just one after another until just stop he screamed with what little breath he had ill tell everything ill tell everything please just stop just stop he let trevor go who collapsed at his feet oric knelt before him so they could stare eye to eye you tell me every goddamn detail you know or next time i might not be so nice oric listened as trevor told of haerns arrival with a boy he knew only as tristan he listened as he detailed tristans amputation then came ben and gerts arrival and oric felt his blood boil as he heard of how their father killed them both of them trevor insisted he seemed determined to make that clear last came their fathers departure for veldaren only a few days prior mounted and following the main road good boy oric said slapping the boy across the face when he was finished mind if i have a go uri said nodding to where evelyn remained upon the bed her face wet with tears oric shrugged get on out boy no need for you to watch this the three soldiers gathered outside the house ten minutes later no sign of anything strange ingram said found where they maybe did some digging recently but the grounds too hard and cold for me to check dont bother said oric we know what they did nathaniels with their father riding south if we press hard we can overtake him uri pointed a thumb back at the house you leaving them alive they helped kill two of us tried lying as well dont set much of an example leave them all for now oric said when we find this matthew i want to drag him back to his home so he can watch as we kill every last member of his family let that story spread across the north no one opposes arthur and no one dares kill his soldiers now ride no matter what they cant get to felwood before we do d eathmask and veliana toasted their success with stolen wine in wooden cups theyd killed three of thren felhorns spiders before fleeing and their cloaks had made their guild affiliations clear as far as both guildmasters knew they were at war with one another given how close the attacks had been and the overall chaos of the night itd be near impossible to prove which had been first so neither could prove theirs had been mere retaliation threns a cautious paranoid bastard deathmask said as he sipped the wine it tasted terrible but his head pounded and he needed alcohol no matter how cheap a form he might think somethings amiss or the attack a bit too blatant for garricks taste still the doubtll be there and neithers going to be happy with one another you should hurry back before they wonder where you were she told him quite true looks to be another long day finish your glass i want you to come with me keep an eye out on the guildhouse entrance if garrick suspects something i might need you to cover my hasty escape as you wish your majesty she said with nonetoothick sarcasm they left their basement and hurried to the ash guilds headquarters with veliana watching from the rooftop deathmask strode inside he couldnt have been happier with what he saw the entire room was in disarray pillows lay scattered and shards of glass covered the floor by the bar garrick stood trembling at the far end about twelve ash members were inside and none seemed eager to be near their guildmaster greetings deathmask said pretending nothing was amiss good to see you survived last night intac where were you garrick shouted deathmask blinked and he glanced at one of the other men as if to show how confused he was running for my life out in the streets much like every other thief in veldaren i stopped by here once but found the place empty so i hid until morning garrick paced back and forth his eyes were bloodshot deathmask wondered how much crimleaf the man had coursing through his veins his speech was also slurred perhaps from one or several of those broken bottles over at the counter drunk and stoned deathmask struggled to contain his amusement spiders garrick shouted as if none of them were there anymore goddamn spiders what is thren thinking he think i betrayed him he think id be stupid enough to do that we had a deal you fucking spider you fuckingfuckingdamn fucking spider deathmasks eyes lit up at that a deal could garrick have been working for thren someone showed up about half an hour ago offered one of the nearest thieves keeping his voice low so his guildmaster would not hear claimed that two members of the ash came and killed several of threns men and he demanded an explanation garrick still overheard and he stormed closer deathmask saw how incredibly dilated his pupils were and he decided his guess was correct if garricks entire strength and confidence were built upon threns protection then having that suddenly taken away would probably scare the shit out of him deathmask couldnt wait to tell veliana shed been ready to kill the man before what might she do knowing hed sold the entire guild out to the man whod executed her former guildmaster serious accusations deathmask said repeatedly telling himself not to smile what did you say this is bullshit garrick said waving an unsteady finger in his face and ill convince him of that but i want to know whats going on mercenaries by the hundreds running through the street and for what and tomorrow night will they do the same we need to plan we need to prepare shit what about the other guilds maybe they know whats going on we should ask someone should go behold your glorious leader deathmask mused glancing at the rest of the ash that mingled about he was a puppet for veliana then a puppet for thren yet now the strings are cut and he can do nothing but collapse i will go deathmask said and to the spider guild no less we should show them we mean no ill will and most of all that the survival of all the guilds is more important than our petty squabbles how many of us died last night this is now a war a true war let me take that message to thren garrick bit his lip no doubt trying to process the idea in his drugaddled mind the rest of the thieves looked pleased deathmask wasnt surprised hed arrived in the chaos remained calm and then presented a plan this was something they could latch onto however simple let the guild see that he was in control not garrick fine he said you may speak for me be careful and dont press if thren turns you away friends thats what we must be good friends well teach the trifect to mess with us wont we wont we a halfhearted cheer came from the rest of the thieves as deathmask left he caught the looks they gave him and this time he did not hide his smile he was a stranger a newcomer to the guild but he was still becoming more of a leader in their minds than garrick come a crisis men and women search for stability let them see that in him when he stepped out to the street he looked to the rooftop for veliana but she was not there odd had someone else spotted her he approached that same building looped around to its back and then climbed up he expected veliana to be lying there perhaps bored or asleep instead no one vel he wondered aloud then he saw it a single streak of blood he followed it to an alley and when he peered down he saw veliana kneeling over the body of a fallen man deathmask climbed down to find her bandaging the mans wounds what the abyss is going on he asked its him she said not at all surprised by his arrival it has to be i fought him once years ago but who else might the watcher be its aaronthren felhorns son deathmasks mouth dropped and every plan whirling through his head rearranged itself to match this new set of circumstances take him he said hurry we have so much to discuss z usa had scoured the south and found nothing the night had come and gone bathed in blood and lit with fire yet she had seen nothing of this elusive watcher too much chaos too much death how do you pick one murderer out of a thousand it was a question she had no answer for still it seemed alyssas desires had been met hundreds of thieves died though many mercenaries had fallen as well she doubted her master would grieve for their loss her grief was saved solely for herself her only strategy left was to hope the watcher had lain low during the night knowing he wasnt needed come morning though perhaps hed try to escape or survey the damage as she ran along the rooftops zusa crisscrossed between the various thief guild headquarters at least those that she knew she saw various men pass below her staying to the alleys and quiet streets but they all wore the colors of various guilds from what shed gathered from men shed interrogated the night before the watcher never appeared wearing any guild colors only a multitude of gray cloaks and shirts still gray was akin to both the ash and the spiders so to those she went at the ash guild she leaned atop a triangular rooftop rested her arms on its tip and overlooked the square nothing the magnitude of her task set upon her then she was trying to find a lone man in the entire city one who appeared to have no friends no allegiances and no clear motive other than killing thieves she had a vague description to go on based on his clothes and a rumor that he had blond hair some said he had red eyes but she dismissed those as well as the stories claiming he had demon blood and blades for hands but blond she could work with she dozed for a while not meaning to sometime later she startled ashamed of her weakness itd been a long twenty hours sure but shed handled worse nava would be so disappointed she whispered feeling sad and tired nava had been one of the last three faceless women killed at the hand of a dark paladin of karak theyd been deemed outcasts traitors to their god but it was their god that had abandoned them and so shed turned on his paladin that had come for alyssa protecting her zusa had given karak no prayers for the last five years she missed nava and eliora more than his presence not far to her right down in the alley she heard someone cry out in pain curious she rushed over and leaned down her eyes widened whirling below her was a mass of gray cloaks spinning and sliding as if possessed three men fought against it all wearing the colors of the ash a man lived inside those cloaks and she saw his face his blond hairbut even that wasnt what convinced her she saw his eyes and they were tormented yet lost in pleasure one by one the thieves fell throats sliced and chests cut open his skill was incredible watcher she whispered drawing her daggers i find you at last she felt a seed of worry planted in the back of her mind her master wanted the watcher brought back alive but the way he fought the way he moved it might be impossible hed die before surrendering she knew that the way she knew hed prepared for her attack from above despite all her silence his swords danced their weapons collided her feet slammed into his chest but he held his ground she pushed off flipping twice in the air before landing on her feet the two stared at one another a smile blooming across her face ethric was the last true challenge i fought she said can you be the next watcher damn woman said the watcher he pointed a blade at her cloak who is it you work for what fool have you sold your soul to zusa laughed the amusement only half acted the man was watching her analyzing her she felt naked before his eyes as if in time he might know every movement she was doing the same to him true but he was too guarded too still you seek my colors she asked slowly she lifted one arm slashed it and let the blood drip down onto the cloth of her cloak she wondered if her spell would take hold her strength had come from karak or so shed always thought shed once lived within shadows danced with cold fire on her blades but not since ethric had she tapped karaks power the color spread through the cloak in seconds turning it a vibrant red it coiled around her as if suddenly alive zusa felt her blood pound in her ears her head ached from the effort but still she smiled perhaps karak hadnt abandoned her after all i serve willingly she said tensing for an attack i have sold nothing she lunged one dagger looping upward to block the other thrusting for his chest her cloak wrapped about her like a shield when the watcher countered her dagger parried his blade away but her thrust met his other sword and her arm jarred at the strength of the block her cloak lashed out like a whip its fine edges sharp as razors it slashed across his face blood splattered them both and then he leapt back his hood fell lopsided and she saw how blue his eyes were how dirty his face was who was hidden beneath the guise who would alyssa find when she dumped his body before her neat trick the watcher said before leaping into his own attack their weapons clashed again and again his speed incredible twice zusa had to spin and let her cloak snap inward deflecting a killing thrust this was no spar no game he wanted her dead that seed of worry in her mind grew to a thorn one of his swords slashed her thigh the other pierced her chest shallow but painful the worry bloomed like a deadly flower it was the narrowness of the alley they fought in that saved her when he lunged for a killing blow she kicked off the wall sailing over his head her feet hit the opposite side the collision jarring but she pushed off higher her cloak trailed below her twisting it lashed at him cutting deep grooves into his arms hed expected her to land not continue back the way she came the cloak kept him off balance and when she landed she lunged in daggers leading she underestimated his speed the sound of steel hitting steel rang in her ears and her carefully coordinated attack broke as his swords danced she refused to relent chasing every backward step he took there was still no fear in his eyes only death whether it was for her or himself she didnt know the ache in her head grew she couldnt maintain the cloaks enchantment much longer itd never hurt like this before never drained her so terribly maybe karak truly had abandoned her as shed abandoned him or perhaps karak wasnt with her at all intrigued she suddenly somersaulted away from him pulling out in midattack while he was unprepared to give chase shed once been able to treat the shadows as doorways could she still do so the sun was low enough that several deep stretches of darkness remained in the alley zusa focused on one behind the watcher then turned and leapt at the shadowed wall behind her part of her expected to hit stone but she passed cleanly through again her mind ached but when the distortion ended she was behind her opponent her cloak resuming its normal color and shape she flung herself at him knowing her chance to surprise him like this again was nonexistent any normal opponent would have died but this watcher was beyond normal he looked a man possessed and the moment she vanished he was already spinning searching for her he parried her leading thrust and she was forced to use her other dagger to counter a slash aimed for her throat her momentum continued and they slammed into one another his head cracked against the wall her hands a blur she cut once twice into the tendons at his elbow the sound of his sword hitting the ground was music to her ears he screamed but the pain did not slow down his other blade she felt its edge dig into her skin and she rolled with it to prevent too deep a cut blood ran down her face and neck urging her on she used both her daggers to pin his sword aside then rammed her elbow into his throat he gasped for air his gag reflex leaning him closer pulling her daggers back she hit his temple with the hilts the watcher dropped to his knees ill kill if i must she said as he leaned on his arms as if bowing to her come now and face the woman you wronged ive wronged no one he said his voice hoarse murderer of children liar surrender now he laughed it was tired and broken i am the murdered child woman ask my father he flung his cloak at her as she batted it aside his heel followed after ramming into her forehead fearing an attack she retreated her daggers falling into defensive positions her blurred vision saw no attack he was gone but where follow the blood she thought follow the blood she caught a speck of it halfway up the building to her left the rooftops he was running away knowing her time was short she jumped from one windowsill to another and grabbed hold of a ledge before she could pull herself up something hard and blunt struck the back of her head the blow smacked her forehead against the side her vision swam her stomach heaved im sorry zusa she heard a familiar voice whisper but this one is mine and then her hands clutched only air and she was falling h aern awoke with his head pounding and no clue where he was the last thing he remembered was crawling across a rooftop just before being struck from behind then hed been thrown forward off the building and to the ground below then nothing his eyes slowly adjusted to the dim light he saw stone walls a dungeon perhaps no that didnt seem right more of a cellar windowless lit by torches youre awake he looked up a man and a woman stood before him the man wore a red robe his dark hair pulled tight behind his head as for the woman she looked vaguely familiar as if hed seen her before a long time ago in a dream it had something to do with the long scar that ran down her face bloodying her eye he tried to stand but he was tied to a chair whoever had tied the knots knew what they were doing there wasnt the slightest give and the moment he tested them various chords across his chest and neck tightened choking off his breath not sure i want to be he said doing his best to relax hed known this was the fate awaiting him he couldnt make enemies of every guild and expect to live forever still it seemed too soon hed accomplished so little hed die without mourners without friends without a legacy a damn shame do you remember me the woman asked it was during the kensgold you were still a boy then almost a man we fought and then he did remember hed seen her twice once when his father had tried blackmailing her to turn against her guildmaster then later in the attic of conningtons mansion her name was veliana and the last time theyd met shed nearly killed him you do remember she said seeing the recognition in his eyes i could never forget he said softly you showed me there would never be a life for me aaron was dead yet you never believed me you refused she crossed her arms and leaned back against the stone wall the man beside her remained quiet seemingly content to let them talk you could have let the smoke take me she said why didnt you he shrugged the best he could given the circumstances it wasnt right to i was there when my father left you to die at the hands of that disgustingworm i couldnt do so again his words hung in the air when she spoke her tone didnt seem quite so hard i spread word of aaron felhorns death after that night i did it to hurt your father but id be lying if i denied doing it for you as well aaron was dead and it seemed true enough what was the name you spoke to me that night something plain haern thats right is that who you are now haern the watcher i find it hard to believe youre that same boy who spared my life do you know how many friends of mine youve killed how many associates youre still threns son arent you perhaps you should adopt your old name aaron i am not he shouted in the corner the darkhaired man laughed such ferocity well theres no doubt youre skilled and vel here was lucky enough to get the jump on you after you were injured seems to corroborate everything weve heard about you other than the demon blood id sense that if it were the case still your father cavorting with a succubus is an amusing thought haern shifted in his bonds what is it you want from me he asked before i tell you that i want you to understand just how powerless you currently are i could kill you right here thats obvious enough but i could also tell your father youre still alive how beautiful a game that would be watching him tear the city apart house by house until he found where you hid my curiosity is almost high enough to see what exactly hed do would he greet you with open arms or a dagger perhaps both haern glared the man saw this and laughed again still im in this for the coin and power not the curiosity i have a proposition for you aaron sorry watcher or would you prefer haern so many names i find myself at a loss haern is fine very well then haern my name is deathmask and i have a request of you this is something i cannot do on my own nor with just velianas help but youyou have no loyalties no weaknesses no aspirations other than killing so my request is simple really help me end this war between the guilds and the trifect this time it was haerns turn to laugh ive slaughtered hundreds of you thieves and even with my help the trifect has sat on its hands and failed to do what needed to be done last night was a start but it wont work we both know it itll just anger them further the retaliation will be terrible if it hasnt happened already what could i possibly do your name carries weight believe it or not deathmask continued though really i should say your reputation does every thief fears the night when the mark he goes to rob turns out to be you even the guildleaders are frightened of you except for perhaps thren a rampage of dragons wouldnt make him soil his pants but you have to understand something all of these thieves these underworld rogues theyve been trained since birth to survive thats all they know theyll claw and grab everything they can on their way up but deep down they just want to live and live well if you threaten that you can turn them to your side no guildmaster would step down at my threat haern said youre a fool theyd rather die than forfeit their wealth and thats the other thing you must understand deathmask said grinning they have no honor no code they want wealth and they want to live but they wont live without wealth not when theyve at last obtained it so you must threaten their lives while at the same time offering them a chance to keep everything theyve gathered it can work i know it haern leaned back in his chair still not convinced what is your plan he asked do you know how much the trifect pays to employ those mercenaries how much money they lose year in and year out from thren burning their goods from kadish slaughtering their help from garrick looting their wares theyre going bankrupt fighting this war but they cant stop they cant make peace for thren wont let them no one wants this to continue before the guild wars everyone made a tidy profit and hardly anyone died we had a system but thren took offense and the trifect overstepped their bounds a fair mistake by both but now everyones too stubborn to stop tell me haern do you understand how protection money works im the son of thren felhorn he said as if that should explain everything good my plan is very simple we take half of what the trifect is paying for mercenaries as well as losing annually from our destructive ways and then accept it as protection money protection for what the trifect their lands and their possessions we split the money evenly among the guilds this way everyone gains and the trifect not only stops having us burn down their shit but we even protect it itd never work you have to know that even if they agreed itd fall apart in months if not sooner someone will get greedy someone will turn on another i expected something cleverer as if your five years of trying to singlehandedly conquer the thief guilds has worked out so much better deathmask said but youre right it would fall apartunless we had an enforcer haern remained quiet for a long time untie me he said at last will you try to kill me deathmask asked such little trust for someone who wants me to work for him the man shrugged fair enough cut him loose vel she did so reluctantly haern stood and stretched his muscles grimacing as his back popped his arm also ached like mad the muscles there definitely torn he glanced about the dim cellar then turned his attention to deathmask tell me everything he said well let every member of the trifect and every thief guildmaster know the terms let them also know in no uncertain language that if they refuse theyll die after that well broker a few meetings get everyone in one room and make them agree to these conditions anyone who tries to make a fuss we send you after them how does that sound insane haern said he looked for his swords saw neither were you not out last night the blood clogs the gutters theyll never agree not to anything youre delusional deathmask if you dont accept veliana said stepping in front of the stairs leading upward to daylight then well have no choice youll have no one to blame but yourself for what well tell your father of your new name and of who you really are how long do you think your little crusade against us will last once he knows right now he sees you as a nuisance a ghost to keep his men on their toes and to cull the weak from his guild but for aaron felhorn to turn against his own flesh and blood haern stood before her staring eye to eye even wounded and exhausted he would not back down do it then he said but ask yourself who will find who firstmy father finding me or me finding you move aside now she tilted her head so she could see deathmask who must have made some sort of approving gesture very well it was good to see you aaron he stepped out into the street winced at the daylight and then hurried away with nowhere else to go he headed for senke and the mercenaries hoping he might reach there without any other strange women attacking him d o you think hell change his mind veliana asked once he was gone deathmask shrugged depends on what you mean over what i just offered no but i never expected him to veliana raised an eyebrow care to fill me in of course haern will never put his heart behind a plan i created it needs to be his own one he feels will be his legacy we need his pride involved otherwise hell be ineffective and dangerous ive planted the idea though he knows many of us desire peace and that he can be a key part of it all she sat down on the pile of cushions that had been her bed since deathmask took her away from the ash guild are you serious about the protection money of course deathmask said why wouldnt i be and why else would i turn the spider guild against the ash everything clicked into place and velianas mouth dropped you hope to destroy the ash guild tear it down to nothing but yourself not quite deathmask said youll be there as well as two or three others who have the skill to endure the bloodshed to come when the trifect distributes whatever wealth is decided upon well get a fair share but while some will spread that gold through a hundred or so men well we ash will have just a small handful then this was your plan all along but you couldnt possibly have expected the watcher to aid you deathmask chuckled no i thought that id be the one who must threaten and kill the various guildleaders but why risk my own life when haern might do it for me and potentially better veliana rubbed her temples trying to think everything she and james beren had created itd been dwindling since thren killed james but theyd still held onto shards of it might it all vanish all those recruits those friends shed made over the yearsdead or gone could she let him do this destroy the legacy of the ash guild forever youll ruin everything ive worked for she said quietly ill give the ash guild a legacy all of dezrel will one day learn i dont expect it to be easy well have to kill a lot yes but if we succeed think of all that wealth that respect we fill every other guild with the fear of retaliation well never need to guard only attack those who turn against us will meet death every single one once that reputation takes hold well be gods in this city youre a lunatic he smiled perhaps but oh what fun itll be in the attempt are you getting scared on me vel aspire to greatness and damn all others garrick took your guild help me take it back and mold it into something never seen before in the history of dezrel she still wasnt sure but shed not let deathmask know what of the spider guild she asked werent you to meet with thren deathmasks eyes twinkled and his grin pulled wider despite it she thought she sensed fear hiding behind the guise come with me he said hopefully we havent missed the show i discovered something when in garricks audience and ive rethought what threns reaction to our masquerade will be they removed their cloaks and dressed in drab colors that showed no affiliation veliana kept a hood low over her face to hide her scar given the cold wind of the morning no one would think the hood odd deathmask led the way taking a winding path back to the ash guildhouse before they were even halfway there veliana could already see the smoke rising what happened she asked careful he said hugging the wall and peering around every turn we might have a few more enemies now do you remember when the hawks tried to ambush you the attempt i broke up garrick didnt do anything did he no she said but what does that the spider guild attacked the hawks barely a day later why do you think that veliana why do you think garrick suddenly grew testicles and dared challenge your hidden control the realization hit her like a battering ram no that cowsucking shiteating motherfucker ill kill him itll hopefully take days but ill kill him assuming hes still alive deathmask said as he led them into an apartment they climbed the stairs stopped at a door on the higher floor and knocked when no one answered veliana kicked it in the room was disheveled what little was left by all accounts the occupants appeared to have either fled or died from the small window they could see the guildhouse deathmask looked first then backed away so veliana might see the guildhouse was in flames it had already collapsed on its supports black smoke billowing surrounding it was a circle of thieves wearing the cloaks and colors of the spider while she watched a man crawled from the wreckage and even from their distance he looked badly burned one of the spiders shot him with an arrow before he could rise to his feet unbelievable deathmask said as he took a second look an army of mercenaries descends upon us and without hesitation he massacres a fellow guild all for a single act of betrayal thren is not one to hesitate deathmask muttered and flopped down onto the poorly stuffed bed we need to establish control of the guild and now veliana id hoped for a bit of backstabbing between the two a thinning of members but thisthrens viciousness is astounding we must take over before the guild disbands completely and the rest of the city moves in on our territory at least the mercenaries will keep them from doing so for a while as for threnif theres to be any chance of peace hell need to be dealt with one way or another tell me where will the remainder of the guild flee now this place has burned the old house she said below the split pig inn we expanded their cellars and paid handsomely to do so they should still be empty and the owner was a crusty old dog that wont be intimidated by sellswords then thats where well go he said retying his mask over his face let them see you alive let them hear my demands of obedience as of now the ash guild is under my control and if garrick still lives deathmask flashed her a smile all pretense of fear gone then you get your revenge assuming youre strong enough to take it she patted her daggers ill be fine follow me and keep your eyes open the last thing i want to do is die before my steel tastes garricks blood g host woke when the sun shone bright on his face he stirred rubbed his eyes and then forced them open midday he guessed his stomach rumbled and his head pounded from the night before he felt he could sleep another four hours or so but his body would have to endure still he wasnt in too much of a hurry he had a name after all a place to search and question not much harm in grabbing a bite to eat once he left his room at the shabby inn he swung by the main market in the center of town buying a thick slice of bread smothered with butter and honey while he ate he sat by a fountain in the center and listened to the idle talk as men and women passed by the overwhelming sensation was not fear as hed expected it was anger more surprising was how it wasnt directed at the guilds or even the trifect they directed it at the king stupid dogs he thought as he ate youve lived under this chaos for so long its become normal to you the trifect and the guilds will war and you see this as acceptable but only if the king protects you last night destroyed your apathy last night saw your blood joining the others so you rage but only to your protector damn king should have put this nonsense to rest years ago still fairly new to veldaren ghost knew only a little of the king but what hed gleaned wasnt flattering as he listened to men swear against their lieges honor and women insinuate hed been born without his manhood it seemed obvious that his cowardly indifference could no longer last but whose side would it fall upon the guilds or the trifects logic seemed to place him as a puppet of the trifect but ghost was unsure which one would he fear more if the man were a true coward hed fear the enemy he couldnt keep out with gates and walls the enemy thatd fill his drink with poison and lay a dagger under his pillow while he slept meal finished he drank from the fountain and then headed to the mercenaries headquarters not surprisingly it was crowded with both the rich and the poor they were pleading their cases demanding compensation for damages done in the chaotic night the old keeper bill trett shouted the same phrase over and over as if come the fiftieth time it might sink in take all complaints to alyssa gemcrofts estate she has promised to accept full responsibility im sorry if your house burned down or someone died but please take all complaints to alyssa gemcrofts estate she has promised ghost slammed a massive fist against the door the sound thunderous in the small room the crowd about twenty in all jumped and turned enough he roared get your asses out of here and go to gemcrofts with your problems he kept his muscular arm pressed against the door holding it open the stance also revealed the weapons at his hips he glared letting them see he had no desire to argue a few filed out while the rest looked about as if trying to decide just how serious he was only a few carried weapons and he doubted they were proficient with them im letting go of the door he said his voice lowering in volume but not in depth when it shuts i kill everyone in here not a member of the mercenary guild that clear he let go a wiry man in silks lunged for it sticking his hand in the way the rest followed him until only a thankful bill remained what the abyss happened last night the older man asked i expected several of them to jump the counter and attack me frightened sheep ghost said let gemcroft handle them no reason for you to put up with their bleating i doubt youve come here to be my savior bill said sitting down and smoothing his hair he pulled out a bottle from a drawer and took a deep swig so what is it you need a small group of mercenaries led by one named tarlak do you know them bill raised an eyebrow i do but only because theyve caused me a bit of trouble tarlak eschaton leader of the eschaton mercenaries refused to join our guild or pay dues the last representative i sent to forcefully request they join came back as a toad ghost blinked a toad a damn toad cost a fortune to send for a representative of the council of mages to come change him back they werent too happy with that tarlak either evidently hes a rogue apprentice or something but since hes not an official member they dont consider him their problem so long as he doesnt start blowing up houses or trying to become anything more than what he is now which is bill shrugged a smalltime mercenary why do you ask i need to find him last i knew he was on crimson alley thirteenth heading south from axe way should still be there do you know how many else are with him bill took another long swig paused to think and then stood after hed locked the door then put a wooden bar across he sat back down im thinking were closed for the day he said and im not sure i like where this is going ghost care to tell me why you want to know so much about this tarlak he knows something from what i hear people that know something you want to know have a funny way of turning up dead ghost shrugged depends on how loose their lips are my arent you a piece of work bill said chuckling but considering they arent part of the guild and you are i guess i can tell you what i know he lives with his sister young gal priestess i think also got some guy named brug though why hes taken him in i dont have a clue we turned down that guys application twice too much temper without a shred of skill to back it up last is a guy named stern bald as you but thats all i know if he can fight i havent heard word of it like i said smalltime with only his petty magic tricks to make him stand out in the slightest oh and those godawful yellow robes of his theyve only been around for nine months or so maybe a year i dont expect em to last ghost bowed stealing bills bottle as he did he took in several gulps the burning in his throat doing much to awaken him enjoy your day in peace ghost said handing it back and lock the door after i leave theres still people gathering outside will do a glare from ghost caused the few waiting outside to step back and he didnt move away until he heard the thump of the wood barring the door youve still got your lives he told them if youve got that you can move on i suggest you do your pleading and curses wont do a damn thing to sway anyone not in this city he trudged south toward the crimson keeping an eye out for axe road so he could begin counting finding the thirteenth from there was easy eyeing the buildings two floors he crossed his arms and thought deciding his entry point he continued on a block later he turned around coming back in a side alley the way was dark and two men glared at him as he passed any other they might have tried to rob but hed flashed them a grin and he saw the way they stared at his painted face theyd have been more likely to try and rob a dragon the eschatons building itself was smooth stone but not the one next to it that was well worn and cracked with many handholds climbing up to the roof he turned and leapt the gap rolling to absorb the impact of his landing it wasnt that he feared injuring his legs he knew they could endure the blow he just didnt want to alert anyone inside to his presence there was no direct entrance from the roof but the second floor had a window and that would be enough for him hanging upside down he looked through it the glass was surprisingly clean and he guessed it was because of the woman who slept beneath the window redhaired and buried under blankets the priestess he figured the muscles in his legs flexing to keep himself steady he brushed his fingers against the glass testing whether or not the window opened it didnt he swung back onto the roof and debated if he broke in through the front door his surprise would be less and he wouldnt have immediate access to one of their members he could try coming back later but if they slept through the day theyd probably be out with the other mercenaries come nightfall again no good itd have to be now he put his back to the ledge then crouched down so he could clutch it with his hands the window would be a tight fit but if he stretched out enough he could squeeze through his feet kicked shifting him into a pivot he smashed feet first through the window showering the womans bed with glass he let go of the ledge and held his arms high above his head his momentum carried him through and he landed on top of her with him on his back before she could scream he rolled over and clamped a hand over her mouth shush now he said ramming an open palm against the side of her head knocking her out cold knowing time was short he pushed off the bed and made for the door del he heard someone ask from the other side his voice was nervous but not yet worried a broken window could be many things most likely a stone least likely a dangerous man built like a mountain the door opened inward before it was a third of the way open he rammed it closed with his knee then grabbed it with one hand and flung it wide a man was falling on the other side his balance broken by the sudden hit from the door it was tarlak based on his outfit bill was right what is that pissyellow ghost rammed a meaty fist into his mouth just to make sure no spells got out he had no intention of showing up at bills later as a toad the punch split the wizards lip and blood flecked across ghosts knuckles ghost followed it up with a punch to the stomach doubling him over he dropped him with both his fists together bashing the back of his head tarlak crumpled easily unconscious neither he nor the girl would be out long maybe a few minutes but ghost felt it enough time when they came to theyd be bound and the wizard most likely gagged there was one other room up top its door open deciding it was tarlaks he hurried to the stairs if the other two were awake theyd be rushing up them sure enough he heard hollering and a short man with muscular arms and a beard met him halfway what the bloody ghost snapped a fist into his face cutting the sentence off short a knee to his groin sent him rolling back down again bills information rang true the guy wasnt much use was he he followed brugs roll down the stairs kicking him at the bottom to convince him to stay down one left the one called stern his eyes swept the lower floor two doors were in the back plus an exit to outside one was open brugs he assumed the other the door blasted open as he reached for its handle he spun immediately in the direction of the door using it as a shield a flanged mace cut through the air where hed been ghost bounced off the wall drawing both his swords he shoved the mace aside then slashed blind behind the door the other sword hit something hard and then they were both in view of each other the man stern no doubt glared back at him a mace in each hand their weapons pressed against each other testing strength stern while stronger than he looked was still no contest this didnt seem to surprise him though and when ghost tried to push him back stern parried both swords to the side and tried to leap past he wanted the open area ghost realized hoping his speed might win out ghost couldnt stop him but he could make life more difficult he kicked a foot as he rotated his body taking out one of sterns knees stern didnt even try to keep his balance instead rolling forward around an old wooden chair and up to his feet before the door he lifted his maces and grinned clearly skilled he said so what person with money did we piss off this time dont matter ghost said he feinted a charge then kicked the chair at him stern blocked it with his heel but it was enough of a stall doubleslashing ghost gave him no choice but to block and block he did his arms jarred though nothing broke like hed hoped sometimes if he swung just right he could pop a collarbone or wreck the joints in an elbow ghost looped his swords around for an attack from both sides that left the only opening straight ahead toward his chest he wanted this stern character to try it to hold his own instead of bouncing about maddeningly he didnt take it stern dropped to one knee blocking the lower slash from his left and letting the right sail over his head immediately after blocking he rolled to the side ghost chased but each slash smashed only floor time was no longer on his side the others would be up soon groggy and heads full of fog perhaps but still up how much concentration did it take to turn someone into a toad ghost wondered stern at last had nowhere to run his back was to the wall to his left were the stairs and the right the main door his eyes flicked from both deciding ghost gave him no time rushing in while keeping his swords close he would block a retreat with his own body and let his blades do the work stern had no chance matching strength and without retreat dying would be his only option left it seemed stern knew this as well his eyes widened and he appeared pressed to the very edge of his control by adrenaline and fear the look of a cornered animal ghost knew stern would not roll onto his back and hope for mercy hed lunge mad vicious and thats just what he did ghost feared those first few seconds as the maces came crashing in slamming into his swords with shocking impact he felt kicks strike his body at one point an elbow and still the maces looped and struck but they were fighting ghosts fight now close up and animalistic he blocked a swipe from the side then savagely struck its length with his other blade knocking it from sterns hand sterns other weapon came around straight for his head instead of ducking he stepped closer chest to chest the side of sterns arm hit his face but that was far better than the sharp edges of the mace one sword slashed his arm making him drop his weapon the other thrust into his belly and twisted shit stern grunted clutching ghosts wrist with both hands his whole body shook and his face rapidly paled ghost pulled his weapon free breaking sterns grip as if it were that of a child the man slid along the wall blood pouring across his hands and down his legs he held the wound with his palms slowing the bleeding should have surrendered ghost said though i respect your defense of your friends this was all unnecessary he left him there stepped over brug and climbed the stairs the short fighter was moaning still conscious but only just he was no threat ghost found the wizard first glad to see him still out unwrapping the rope hed looped about his waist he cut a length of it and bound tarlaks hands thinking for a moment he cut a smaller length wedged a piece of the wizards own robe into his mouth and then tied it into a gag hefting him onto his shoulder he carried him back down the stairs and deposited him in a chair stern watched him with glazed eyes from where he lay last was the girl she opened her eyes when he stepped inside but she showed no recognition nor any signs of fear concussion he figured she probably didnt know the difference between him and the king of ker to your feet he said id hate to strike you again he grabbed her wrists and held them tight as he escorted her down the stairs once she was tied to another chair he kicked brug to see how he was faring damn it brug muttered his eyes suddenly focusing what was that for he saw ghost standing over him and then he tried to reach for his weapons instead ghost slammed his heel onto his throat and pushed him back id recommend you behave he said the tip of his sword dangling before an eye otherwise i might just let go brug ground his teeth glanced about then nodded ghost bound his hands and feet and then dumped him on the floor beside the others well that was disappointingly easy ghost said sheathing his swords i hope the watcher proves more challenging than you four stern said something but his voice was too weak to hear ghost stepped closer and leaned down youll find out when he kills you stern said then made a sound like the cross of a cough and a laugh ghost slapped the side of his face the gesture almost playful at least you put up a fight he said so ill forgive your frightened boasting stay still and try not to let your grip slip you might know something useful to me and id hate to lose it because you cant keep your guts from squeezing through your fingers the priestess seemed to be getting her bearings but tarlak was still clearly out ghost reached into a pocket and pulled out some smelling salts shoving them under the wizards nose he held his head by his hair and waited after a few sniffs his eyelids began to flutter and then he jolted as if splashed by a bucket of water whmmph he said welcome back ghost said smacking his shoulder forgive the gag i know how dangerous your kind is with a few silly words i may take it out but only for a moment and only when my swords are at your throat understand a soft gasp came from his right it seemed like the priestess had finally come to her senses senke she gasped senke he followed her gaze to the wounded man against the wall a pet name perhaps or maybe bill had been wrong about the name he put up a better fight than the rest of you ghost said dont say nothing delysia brug muttered just bite your tongue and say nothing i dont think id listen to him ghost said placing the name to her face hed found with many people he interrogated it made them that much more compliant when he called them by their name please i can help him she squirmed against her bonds hes dying if hes dying hes doing a poor job of it he watched her struggle to see if his ropes would hold satisfied he took her chin in a giant hand and forced her gaze to his but if you want untied youll have to talk thats all little girl just talk no sin in that right what do you want she asked dont brug shouted ghost turned on him and this time his kick was lower and harder brug howled like an animal and his face turned a beet red enough out of you he said youre beaten and at my mercy lies and silence get you pain only pain not honor not sacrifice no nobility just pain tarlak mumbled something into his gag ghost debated but then left him alone hed go to the wizard only if the others proved uncooperative so far this delysia appeared the most compliant he knelt before her all teeth and smiles senkes bleeding over there he said dropping his voice lower she went to look but his eyes held her he knew he could do that had so many times before he felt like a snake charmer controlling them by the sheer ferocity of his personality you can feel it his pain washing over you like a heat youre a priestess so you could help him tend his wounds how badly you must wish to go to him such sweet compassion he shifted behind her pressing a painted cheek against hers as they both looked to where senke lay but is it just compassion i dont think it is i think its fear i smell the stink on you its rising in your chest crawling upward like a beast you dont want to watch him die yet thats what you are doing life is draining away before you and all you can do is sit here struggling against your ropes wont seal the hole in his gut delysia only one thing will and that is talking to me tell me the truth and only the truth can you do that pretty girl can you do that for senke she bit her lower lip tears ran down her face yes she said at last brug sighed by the wall senke chuckled tarlak let out another mrmph into his gag good lass its a simple question really i have a contract to find the watcher and your group knows of him tell me where can i find him i dont know she said she stared into his eyes and he realized she wanted him to know she didnt lie hes only stayed here twice where he goes when he leavesplease i dont know none of us do ghost frowned tell me his name then he must have a name tears ran down her face she looked to senke but ghost grabbed her jaw and forced her back to him haern she said he calls himself haern last name first just haern possibilities ran through ghosts head and he didnt like any of them a single plain name would be marginal help at best in tracking him down still it was better than nothing which is what hed been going on before but mostly he didnt want a name he wanted the man in person will he be coming back here she hesitated just a second but ghost saw it and smiled no lies he said that just gives pain remember i dont know she said at last but i think he will please can i help him now hes almost gone of course my dear he untied her wrists and then gestured for her to go she ran to senkes side and knelt he whispered something to her and he heard her begin to cry ideas raced through ghosts head as he watched out of the corner of his eye if this haern were coming back then he had to keep them all here until he did otherwise they might find a way to warn him of course it could be days until he showed or worse this haern might spot the ambush through a window or sense it through a lack of common activity troubling hed have to dump them in one of the rooms preferably without a window once done then he might and that was when the door opened and in stepped the watcher h aerns elbow still ached like the abyss but at least itd stopped bleeding he felt naked without his swords so he kept his head down and shambled along as if he were drunk given the horror of the previous night he knew he was far from the only one that staggered along the road many had buried their grief in alcohol his nerves rose as he hurried down the crimson but he reminded himself it was safer in the day than at night sure some of the young cutpurses might try to swipe his coin but he had nothing to steal when he reached the eschatons building he put his hand on the door and closed his eyes returning here meant many things and he wasnt sure if he was prepared for the implications could this place become a home to him could he accept the companionship of senke even knowing his presence was danger deep in his heart he knew he desired nothing else it was his head that kept getting in the way but sometimes you needed to think like that to protect others to haern the self had never mattered more than those he cared for hed learned that lesson from watching his teacher robert sacrifice his life to protect him he opened the door with his good arm so lost in his thoughts so focused on what he might say to them and they say back that he was unprepared for the sight before him tarlak sat bound and gagged in a chair brug lay on the floor also bound senke slumped against the wall blood covering his clothes delysia knelt before him her hands also covered with blood and there amid them all was a giant stranger skin like obsidian face painted white as a skull it seemed the stranger was as surprised as he was and they both froze for a splitsecond haern looked into this mans eyes and saw death watcher said the painted man not a question just a statement his deep voice chilled haern to the bone telling him it was time to act this was no game their lives hung in the balance run delysia screamed but he couldnt leave them like this damn it what hed give to have his swords the stranger lunged drawing two swords as he did haern dove further into the house tumbling to avoid his attack his eyes searched for a weapon any weapon there on the wall he saw the shortswords senke had used when pretending to be thren scrambling to his feet he ran for them not even slowing when he slammed into the wall his good arm snatched one free and then he rolled aside the strangers sword cutting several inches into the thin wall who are you haern asked as he held the blade before him and crouched into position i am ghost said the man his brown eyes shone beneath the paint sweat dripped down his neck and arms every inch seemingly nothing but muscle his swords lifted and dipped into a stance perfectly smooth perfectly calm haern felt terror at the sight for all his reputation all his killings this man faced the watcher unafraid he even smiled every instinct told haern to retreat but he wouldnt he thought hed lost senke in a fire and hed never come back to look hed been dragged off by his father while delysia bled this time hed stay until the end whatever that might be death or victory he thought his father would be proud come then haern said kill me if you can he kicked aside the table and in the limited space began spinning in place his multitude of cloaks dipped and rose hiding his presence ghost watched it the concentration in his eyes frightening when he moved to attack out lashed haerns shortsword nearly slicing off his nose again ghost watched waited haern knew his cloakdance could defeat lesser foes and give him advantage against several attackers at once but against someone so skilled it was a stalling diversion nothing more stop dancing and kick his ass brug shouted unable to do anything but watch from his spot on the floor a sword swung in haern dipped below it his spine nearly parallel to the floor out went his blade cutting into ghosts knee itd be painful but not debilitating beyond a bad limp he hadnt been able to get enough force due to his awkward position worse was that the blade caught on the bone instead of slicing free ghost stepped in unafraid of the cloaks and defiant of the weapon lodged in his flesh he swung downward with both swords haerns momentum had him rising to a stand so he kicked out his own feet to fall instead the swords missed but only barely haern landed flat on his back the impact knocking the breath from his lungs his wounded elbow hit hard as well and the pain of it filled his vision with black dots ghost twirled a sword in his right hand pointing the blade downward eager for a killing thrust but then delysia was there her hands raised palms facing the ghost bright light flared blinding even to haern ghost roared and he took a step back as if struck by a blow haern swung his legs wide taking advantage of the distraction his heel struck the wounded knee hard enough to dislodge the sword stuck in the joint down ghost went the knee crumpling again delysia let out a cry shouting out the name of her deity her hand moved in a downward arc a golden sword materialized in the air before her mimicking the motion it sliced into ghosts chest blood sprayed across her but she didnt appear to notice another prayer was already on her lips demanding the strength of ashhur be gone she cried haern saw a faint outline almost like an enormous hand shimmer and vanish in the blink of an eye ghost flew back several feet as if hit by a battering ram when his body met the wall it was the wall that gave the cheap plaster breaking haern took to his feet his wounded elbow held against his chest it had started bleeding again staining the gray of his clothes red ghost took a woozy step forward then collapsed when he tried to stand on the other leg haern reached down and grabbed his sword while the giant man crawled toward the exit dont delysia said grabbing his shirt her voice had authority now and something in him was unwilling to challenge it please dont kill him are you mad brug asked still squirming against his ropes haern felt inclined to agree hes beaten and leaving she insisted dont he let me save senke he deserves as much hes also the one who did it in the first place senke said with a sleepy voice just thought id point that out phggrrmpf tarlak chimed in ghost looked at them as if they were all mad he used a chair to brace himself as he stood then limped toward the door his teeth clenched against the pain you were beaten he said as he took a lumbering step outside sure thing haern said delysia still clutching his shirt the moment the door closed he slumped backward sitting atop the edge of the overturned table delysia checked his elbow senke needs my help more than you she said it can wait untie tarlak and brug as you wish delysia returned to senke and knelt before him haern heard her prayers and white light shone around her hands no wonder the wound on his chest had healed so quickly those few days ago friend of yours tarlak asked once the gag was removed you arent funny haern said he cut the ropes around his hands and feet and while the wizard stretched he did the same for brug son of a whore ambushed me coming up the stairs brug said grabbing his punch daggers otherwise id have torn him a new hole you mean like this one senke asked brug flushed and looked away haern tossed his shortsword to the floor he felt sick and he still hadnt recovered from the blow to his head earlier in the day his elbow throbbed feeling even worse than when hed first received the cut he saw brug and tarlak glaring at him and he felt like he deserved their ire he tried to stumble for the door but tarlak blocked the way holding it shut with his arm not yet he said and not anytime soon its time we talked watcher m atthews relief upon seeing felwood castle lasted only as long as it took him to see one of hadfields men standing watch far from the other guards it was as hed feared less than ten minutes ago hed had to drag them off the road and when the horsemen rode on by his gut told him who it was they served what do we do tristan asked matthew had abruptly turned them both around and back north on the road hoping the soldier hadnt seen their approach given the distance it seemed probable i dont know he said he could imagine what would happen if they tried to pass by the soldier would cut them down before letting them reach lord gandrem whatever explanations or punishment the soldier received would still be preferable so long as no one identified the onearmed boy as the son of lady gemcroft given his disfigurement the dirt on his face and the plain clothes he now wore it seemed doubtful will we continue on to veldaren tristan asked quiet boy i dont know he waited until his temper calmed then resumed and im not sure we can dont have the food and water might end up scarce too i need inside to resupply but that might mean leaving you behind for a while they wont know me from shit but youre the one they want that and i dont know who gandrems sided with in all this john was always nice to me tristan said referring to the lord i wish id stayed with him what ifwhat if i get us inside will he keep us safe matthew shot him a look how could you get us inside i dont know i could run real fast im a fast runner even arthur said it matthew bit his lip it was just one man a professional soldier perhaps but still just one he touched the old sword at his hip if he could last for a little while just a little his eyes fell upon the near empty sack that had carried their food i have an idea he said but you better run like the wind you hear me like it and faster my life is depending on those legs of yours i ngram mumbled curses as he shifted his weight from foot to foot trying to generate some heat to counter the cold after another minute he pulled a blanket from a saddlebag and wrapped it around his shoulders beside him his horse clomped the ground blanket aint big enough for two of us he said well get you somewhere warm once we find that brat though i promise he and his horse waited a hundred yards beyond the castles entrance near the fork where the main road turned toward him the woods had been thinned out toward the front though they were still close enough to make him worry nathaniel and the farmer might try to sneak along the walls using the woods as cover doing that was a good way to earn an arrow in your back by a guard though theyd come traveling down the road he felt certain of it according to his bitch of a wife hed left immediately after killing gert and ben dimwit farmer couldnt know how many were actually looking or that they might have beaten him here ingram expected him to come riding full gallop the boy behind him on his horse thinking hed finally reached safety already ingram had practiced his excuses for when the castle guards came running guy looked mad as a dog hed say started hollering for me to hand over my money then sent the boy to do his dirty work no one would question him for killing two hungry thieves too stupid to know better even if they did what would it matter gandrem wouldnt challenge arthur not on something so petty as a dead farmer and his boy while he held the rough blanket and looked about he saw a man approaching he walked on foot leading his horse a large sack lay slung across the saddle ingram raised an eyebrow at the sight no boy but what could someone be bringing to trade this late in winter slow down there ingram said tossing his blanket back toward his horse and putting a hand on his hilt strange time for travel dont you think pigs die when they die said the man come to see if his lordship would like a fine meal tonight the cogs and wheels in ingrams brain were never the most tightly fit but still they turned the words over again and again unable to get rid of a deep feeling of someone pulling something over him let me see it he said the man continued leading the horse right on by forcing ingram to jump in his way still the man didnt slow and ingram took several steps backward to prevent from getting knocked over at last he drew his sword and stood his ground i said let me see he said i dont think thats no pig if you say so said the man he pulled the sack off the horse with a grunt and plopped it to the ground just a small one maybe good for john and some of his closest while he talked his hands messed with a tie at the end the moment the knot came undone it flung open and out ran a boy who even ingram knew had to be nathaniel the boy darted underneath his horses legs and then shot straight for the castle fuck ingram shouted turning to give chase this time the farmer matthew obviously got in the way he wielded an old sword recently polished but still timeworn and unreliable didnt seem to matter though for he wielded it as if it were ashhurs blade itself and ingram the darkspawn of karak outta the way ingram slashed with his sword hoping to overpower the unskilled farmer he blocked clumsily perhaps but it still banged his sword away instead of pressing the advantage matthew retreated full defensive behind him the little brat hollered like his lungs were on fire hes gonna kill my pa hes gonna kill my pa hes gonna kill him damn right thought ingram ingram feinted smirked at how easily the farmer fell for it and then cut from the other direction the edge of his sword slashed into his arm eliciting a cry of pain ingram swung again lower hoping to split his belly open the man put his blade in the way just in time the metal on metal sound rang out though there was something funny to it as if one of their weapons wasnt flexing like it should ingram doubted it was his blood spilled down matthews arm and he saw the elbow below it shaking should have turned him over ingram said their eyes met and for that brief moment he could tell matthew thought the same behind him the guards approached alerted by the boy fear bubbled up ingrams throat even if he lived what might oric do for such a screw up the least he could do was kill the stupid man who had given them so much trouble he thrust the tip nicking ribs before matthew managed to parry it aside stepping closer ingram pulled his sword around smacking it against matthews which had pulled back to defend and then he slashed once more at exposed flesh matthew fell back but he was too slow too unprepared for the maneuver he was a farmer not a trained fighter the sword cleaved through his shoulder and shattered his collarbone in the distance he heard nathaniel scream matthew coughed once his sword falling from limp fingers his eyes grew wide his lips quivered his skin turning white ingram put a boot on his chest and kicked him back freeing his crimson blade the body clumped to the ground and lay still stubborn little shit ingram muttered as he wiped his sword clean on matthews leg drop your blade ordered the two gate guards as they arrived they had their swords drawn and ingram promptly obeyed he gave nathaniel a smile who cowered behind the two guards tears on his face what is the meaning of this asked one as he picked up ingrams blade the other circled around to his back and pressed the tip of his sword against him to ensure he did nothing stupid a hand reached in yanking his dagger from his belt and tossing it to the dirt i can explain though oric can do it better he said he pointed to the body that man theres a kidnapper i know it cause we been searching high and low for him and that boy there well he turned to matthew whose eyes looked like white saucers he grinned for he felt his lie building the slow gears in his head turning thats nathaniel gemcroft back from the dead as we always hoped the guards looked to the boy whose skin had gone pale i wasnt kidnapped he insisted to the guards i wasnt he was helping me and you let him kill him why didnt you run i told you to run he was crying now snot dripping from his nose the first guard took him by the hand while the other grabbed ingram by the arm and led him toward the castle this is something lord gandrem will settle said the guard stay quiet and answer only when youve been asked directly understand sure do but dont squeeze so rough youll be treating me like a hero soon enough the four entered through the castle gates then followed the emerald carpet into the main chamber uri and oric were already there in midconversation with john gandrem on his throne he sat up straighter at their arrival clearly recognizing the boy nathaniel he said his mouth hanging open ingram saw oric glaring at him his eyes ready to bulge out of his head not knowing what his captain might have been saying he knew he should set things in motion let his captain know what lie hed created i just saved him from his kidnapper he said loud and boastful a mailed fist struck the back of his head and for a moment his vision turned to white stars over a purple sky you werent addressed said the guard behind him my apologies ingram muttered nathaniel rushed into the lords arms and in their comfort he sobbed uncontrollably john patted his back and whispered comforting words but his eyes remained drawn to where his missing arm should have been milord said one of the guards we found him attacking another who had traveled with the boy killing him before we could arrive weve brought both here for you you told me you were searching for a man john said looking to oric though you said he was merely a thief and indeed he was oric said ingram beamed as his captain took his lie and ran with it we suspected him of taking nathaniel from one of lord hadfields caravans never could we have hoped wed find him here of course perhaps he had come to issue ransom nathaniel had begun shaking his head and ingram watched him carefully a childs story against that of several men shouldnt matter but one never knew if only hed keep his mouth shut keep crying i was told nathaniel had died john said learned too late of the funeral sadly i was told theyd been given a body by you in fact oric oric licked his lips we suspected too late it was another child hed been badly burned when i thought it might be a trick to throw us off the kidnappers trail we went looking we learned nothing worthwhile not yet so weve been keeping our reasons a secret dont want harmful rumors flying about nor to give alyssa false hope hes lying nathaniel said dont listen to them hes lying he was my friend he killed my friend he helped me orics voice dropped lower men do strange things to boys in their capture given time he might twist their head around make them friendly he needs rest this alls clearly been too much for the lad he called the stranger his pa when running to us offered one of the guards john nodded as this bit seemed to support what oric was saying he kept nathaniel close as if afraid he might lose him should he let go what happened to your arm he asked they said my arm got sick and had to be cut off who is they ingrams eyes widened this might be tougher to explain maybe they could spin some blame onto that wife of his shes just a filthy liar thats all ingram said ignoring orics glare probably cut the arm off to torture him johns face darkened at this she he asked ingram opened his mouth then closed it he didnt know how to respond to that meant he he said lamely we discovered a lady who claimed her husband had nathaniel oric said trying his best to amend the situation but clearly fighting a losing battle johns eyes had narrowed and he had a look like a snake ready to strike thats how we knew to come here is all john patted the boy on the head and leaned closer to him he whispered something too quiet for ingram to hear nathaniel whispered something back when finished john sank deeper in his chair take them into custody he said to his guards wait you got things wrong ingram felt men grab his arms and wrench them painfully behind his back it seemed like the very curtains had spawned armored guards oric reached for his sword but the sheer number made him decide not to one of the guards smashed his face with his fists as if insulted hed even considered it i wasnt there ingram shouted as he was yanked backwards but it only seemed to make matters worse oric was he saw it all i was just doing what i was told bring him to me john roared standing from his throne two guards dragged ingram across the carpet then shoved him to his knees a fist grabbed his hair and forced his head to bow reverently i want you to watch this lord gandrem said to nathaniel you deserve it with your arm as it is youll be living a hard road and this is something you should always remember this is how we treat the scum who dare strike against us no ingram moaned as he felt his head pulled back john held a beautiful sword and he pressed its edge against his throat pull back the carpet he said to his servants i dont want to stain it ingram felt hollow fear building and building please he begged i didnt do nothing i didnt i was just they lifted him up and when they set him back down his feet touched smooth stone you killed a good man john said says who says nathaniel and i trust his word over yours the sword moved he felt pain but when he gasped to scream it was as if hed been dunked underwater his exhalation was a pitiful garble his head swam and he thought to faint but still the guards held him upright until the darkness came he watched john and nathaniel watching him die there was no mercy in either of their eyes g uardsman mick trudged up the road away from the castle having drawn the shortest straw of the lot one of the mens horses remained standing on the path the other had wandered off and he grumbled and hoped it wouldnt be far hed have to stable them both work out ownership probably even send one or both back to whoever originally owned them bunch of hassles of course there was also the body which needed to be stripped of any valuables and then disposed of deciding the horses could wait mick knelt beside the body and he glanced around to see if anyone was watching no one was so he put a hand into the dead mans pockets searching for loose coin of course not all valuables needed to be handed over when the dead body let out a groan mick startled fell back on his rump and nearly soiled his armor he closed his slackjaw put a hand on the mans chest and leaned close both were weak but he felt the tremors of a heartbeat and heard the soft hiss of breath goddamn youre a stubborn one he said unable to believe it he took to his feet and ran toward the castle crying out for a healer to make his way to the gate a re you prepared to do what you must deathmask asked her i am said veliana youll have to kill many of them they were once your friends your guildmates maybe you even considered them family they wont understand and their loyalties are anyones guess this is garricks guild and youre nothing but a feeble woman who got in his way last time i ask can you stick a knife in them every one of those familiar faces not so familiar anymore she said she tapped her sickly bloodied eye too many hate me for this ive heard their whispers their insults of my ugly mark im damaged beauty they never loved me not like they loved james beren this guild may or may not be mine but more than ever i know it should not be garricks if he sold his soul to thren then he betrayed every shred of jamess memory anyone who stays at his side is no friend of mine deathmask smiled at her i want to do something for you he said this will take just a moment but i hope youll appreciate it he put a finger to his eye the same as velianas injured and then whispered words of a spell they seemed simple enough and then came the change his iris changed from a dark brown to a bloody red this is what i think of your ugly mark he said ill proudly bear it so long as you stay with me i will never cast aside your loyalty for ive been cast aside enough in my own life veliana felt strangely touched by the gesture one day she said i hope to believe you they turned their attention to the unassuming building before them the rooms appeared dark but both knew of the lower expansion below ground no doubt housing the last remnants of the ash guild a few men and women wandered past them on the streets several with dead eyes and drunken gaits to veliana it seemed like the entire city was suffering a massive hangover a crude comparison given how many of her kind had been mercilessly butchered so far deathmask hadnt explained how he planned on dealing with all the mercenaries but she had no choice but to trust him patting her daggers she told him to move and she would follow keep your hood low he told her surprise is everything theatrics can turn even the most ordinary of foes into something fearsome and you are no ordinary foe they approached the door a single thief leaned against it looking like hed been up for two days straight through bleary eyes he watched their arrival recognizing deathmask when they were almost within striking distance hey we thought thren veliana cut his throat before he finished the sentence as his body fell she glanced to deathmask and her look was clear look what i can do do not fear my loyalty they are no longer friends of mine atta girl he said his mismatched eyes sparkling behind his mask when she tried the door it was both locked and barred deathmask gently moved her aside put his hands upon the wood and closed his eyes theatrics he whispered his hands shimmered between red and black and then the door exploded inward in a great shower of splinters accompanied by a shockwave that thumped against velianas chest with enough force to make her catch her breath deathmask stepped through the dust and debris into a small entry room two men sat on either side of the doorway their hands raised over their faces specks of blood dotted their clothes damage from the shrapnel veliana rushed the one on the right thrusting a dagger into his chest before he could react deathmask waved a hand at the other who suddenly dropped to his knees gagging before she could see the total effects of the spell veliana stabbed his heart sometimes quick is better she said deathmask pushed open the second door and they stepped into the last remnants of the ash guild all gathered from the various corners of veldaren there were twenty of them sitting on chairs and pillows and looking miserable veliana felt both anguish and elation in seeing garrick among them part of her had hoped hed died in the fire for he deserved nothing better but at least his survival meant that he would be hers all hers members of the ash deathmask said screening veliana with his body he wanted to maximize the impact of revealing her she knew a smirk crossed her lips they all thought her dead garrick included how his mouth would drop how wide his eyes would go all around the thieves stood and drew their weapons for though deathmask was one of them there was something dangerous about his arrival in the way he walked the way he addressed them you garrick said pointing a shaking finger you turned the spiders against us didnt you why else would they let you live i am not the one who went into bed with the spider thinking i might not get bitten deathmask said this destruction is your doing all your doing listen to me guildmembers he sold your souls to thren felhorn all so he might sleep well at night you lie about a third of the men around them were exchanging glances and their daggers and clubs lowered veliana watched and waited she had to be fast the first attacker needed to die immediately if she were to discourage the rest when it came to a battle of personalities between deathmask and garrick there would be no contest at some point garrick would call an end to it before he lost completely how else would you have maintained leadership deathmask asked why else would the guilds have made peace with you even though your position was weak weeks ago you made your pact and one by one the other guilds realized and left you alone only the hawks attacked and only once thren punished them severely for that didnt he more mumblings about them a couple glared at garrick these were the rumblings of treason veliana knew normally such accusations would be whispered ear to ear allowed to fester and grow but the trifect had pressed too hard if they were to survive they needed new leadership and now i dont know what youre talking about garrick said he had drawn his dagger but it remained at his side as if he were afraid to even point it at deathmask come now we all know whose guild this truly was before it was threns it was velianas not yours never yours that is why you wanted her dead louder grumblings though many were disparaging her name she felt anger simmer in her heart even now they would deny her work her sweat her toil the gods damn them all she died because she tried to kill you thats all garrick said veliana stepped to deathmasks side and pulled her hood back she smiled and the look on garricks face was everything shed hoped itd be i never died she said her voice was soft but even a whisper could have been heard in that suddenly quiet room but you will you traitor you sold our soul to thren i can never forgive you she flung herself at him not caring for her safety nor the greater numbers she would have his head and this time no one would stop her garrick cried out for aid and several thieves jumped in her way spinning away from a club she gutted one on her left rolled along the ground and hamstrung another as she stood the one with the club tried to smash her back but she twirled again her spine bending in an unnatural angle so the swing passed above her breasts and then she was up again stabbing him repeatedly kicking away his corpse with seven bleeding holes in his chest make your choice deathmask cried out it seemed many had they turned on the others striking at those who moved toward him the room was now in chaos and within it veliana thrived she kicked out the legs of one rushing for deathmask burying a dagger through his ribs as his body hit the ground pulling it free she flicked blood off it toward garrick who stood with his back to the wall his dagger held before him wheres then to protect you now she asked as she stalked him her daggers hungry in her hands wheres the men who would rather rape me than serve under my leadership wheres your guild garrick a blinding flash burst from behind her a spell of some sort from deathmask in its light she rushed garrick her knee leading it slammed into his crotch while she swatted away his dagger her other daggers hilt struck his forehead she rammed an elbow into his mouth then slashed across his face when she pulled back blood spurted from a gash across the bridge of his nose his cry of pain was a garbled weak thing now youre the example she whispered to him she stabbed her dagger into his throat twisted it left then right and finally yanked it free blood splashed across her chest but she didnt mind at his death much of the chaos slowed for it seemed there was little point left in fighting she glanced around and saw all eyes upon either her or deathmask only ten remained of the initial twenty those who would betray their loyalties deserve nothing less deathmask said kneeling beside garricks body he put a hand on his head which burst into flame the fire did not burn him the body blackened and smoked and in seconds it was nothing but a pile of ash taking a handful deathmask stood and flung it into the air it revolved around his head hiding his visage making him look like some strange monster instead of a man i am the ash now none of you are worthy of my leadership you killed for me and for that i spare your lives be gone throw down your colors or prepare to have them stained with your blood it seemed none there had the will to challenge the bloodsoaked veliana and her master her heart panged at their exit feeling like the last remnants of the guild she and james had built were gone but deathmask had promised her something greater and she had to trust him she scanned those exiting looking for a set of faces men who had remained out of the fight like the sensible opportunists they were nier mien she said as they left you two stay the twins looked back they had pale skin dark hair and brown eyes that seemed to twinkle with subdued amusement yes they asked deathmask approached them and he offered his hand veliana has vouched for your skills would you remain with me and fight not for the ash guild that was but for what it might yet be the two glanced about the room as if to point out the obvious to them what guild mier asked there are only us four said nien and as long as the four of us live there will always be an ash guild deathmask said you have seen what we can do join us we need your strength tonight the mercenaries must be shown that we will not roll over and die for them the twins shared a look and veliana swore some sort of mental conversation was going on between them that she was not privy to then they accepted deathmasks offered hand and shook it why not could be fun indeed deathmask said grinning behind his mask of cloth and ash veliana shook her head wiped the blood clean from her daggers she spat on what little was left of garricks remains h aern sat atop the roof of the eschatons home and watched the sun dip below the wall his elbow rested upon his knee his chin on his hand tarlaks words haunted him and no matter how hard he tried he could not shake them from his head i dont care who you think you are or how good you might be hed said youre a danger to me and a danger to my sister i made you an offer and i wont go back on it now but you better put some serious thought into it because otherwise youre just a renegade killer with a vendetta theres no reason to house you then no point how many more will come storming through my windows come kicking down my doors im terrified the secrets out haern or it will be soon what do you expect me to do fight for you protect you give me a reason any haern had none to offer his neck had flushed and hed shook his head what could he say im sorry a mercenary broke into your home hurt you your sister and your friends all while trying to find me hed always thought he was so careful but hed slipped up as usual what had senke said it didnt pay to be his friend yet again that remained painfully true hed left but lacked the heart to go far so up to their rooftop he went part of it was because he didnt want to leave them to say goodbye to delysia and senke forever part of him also feared that the giant man with the painted face might return and if he did he wanted to be there waiting haern he looked down from the roof to see delysia peering up at him will you come down she asked he shook his head then can you help me up sighing he grabbed the side of the roof with one hand and hung he offered her his other hand and she took it for reasons hed never understand still trusting him using him as a guide she stepped on a window ledge then with his aid jumped up to catch the roof once she climbed all the way up he swung himself up to join her i think a set of stairs might be easier she said brushing off her priestess robes and defeat the whole point of me coming up here haern said immediately regretting it why should he snap at her her silence showed the comment stung and he tried to think of something to say is senke all right he asked i stopped his internal bleeding and i sealed the wound best i could hell be sore for days but yes hell be fine he walked back to the center of the roof and sat down she sat beside him and immediately he felt himself pulled back to the past would thren arrive once more death in his smile and a crossbow in his hand im sorry about my brother she said he can be a bit of a hothead no kidding whyd you join up with him anyway mercenary work doesnt seem suited to you because he asked she said as if it should have been obvious when i left the priesthood they gave me back my fathers wealth from their safekeeping it wasnt much not after itd been used to settle my fathers estates and debts we used it to buy this place was all we could afford but here haern asked gesturing about on the crimson you deserve someplace better someplace safer she shrugged my brother had a place he wanted but the king refused to even hear his offer its no matter i spent two years in the temple unable to leave for fear of threns anger im used to keeping inside its not right haern said she smiled at him you living on the street is what isnt right at least i have a warm bed and a family to share my meals with what do you have haern what have you done over the years he thought of his deals his rumors his ambushes in the night and days spent sleeping with the homeless and destitute i tried to stop my fathers war i tried to kill until thered be no one left to fight in his name i failed she took his hand and held it dont be so hard on yourself we all make mistakes you once wanted something more to understand a life beyond what your father taught you i think you still do but you wont find a new life in vengeance haern only sadness and loneliness silence fell over them he let it linger trying to find the courage to ask what he needed to know do you hate me for killing no i am not so naive i would like to live in a world where no killing was needed but i fear i may never see it i wont judge you for what you do haern i can only try to be a light and to shine as long as i can in a world that seems obsessed with darkness if you need forgiveness then know you have it from me and from ashhur if you need guidance ask and i will do my best to answer ill heal your wounds and pray for you before i lay my head down to sleep i wont hate you how could you ever think so he felt like a child and he clutched her hand tight she shifted so she might sit next to him and her head rested against his shoulder will you go out tonight he asked her no tarlak didnt understand the magnitude of what was going on when he first agreed our fault for not being part of the mercenary guild i guess we gave one night and that is all alyssa will get from us she paused will you i think i will i have some part to play in all of this whether i want it or not she pulled back and gently took his injured elbow into her hands for the first time he truly looked at her and he saw how tired she was the whites of her eyes rimmed with angry veins still she closed her eyes took a deep breath and began praying soft light shone from her fingers and he felt their healing magic pour into his elbow several minutes later she stopped the pain had become a vague ache like a sore muscle but little else he flexed it twice and it felt strong enough for combat i should go she said its not safe for me out here after dark please he said taking her hand justsit with me awhile longer youre safe with me he saw the look on her face and he wished he could understand what it was she thought her hesitation was brief and then she sat back down her arms wrapped around him and he allowed his own eyes to close it wasnt until he was with her that he realized he never relaxed that he was always like a coiled spring but there with her he felt able to let it go he had nothing to hide and no reason to together they watched the sun sink further until it was nothing but a glow peeking over the wall help me down she said at last senke wants you to see him before you leave he seemed certain you wouldnt be staying tonight i think he knows you better than i he understands the world i came from is all tonight will be worse for everyone i think he knows that the rest were eating when the two came in brug and tarlak seemed to act as if he werent there but senke greeted him warmly enough follow me he said leading haern to a closet built into a space underneath the stairs he pulled out a wooden crate wincing at the effort feeling guilty haern ordered him aside and pried open the crate himself inside were an assortment of weapons from knives to twohanded swords and various instruments in between i saw your fight with that mercenary senke explained that cloakdance you did was something special but your swords werent right for it at all here take these he lifted a pair of weapons out and handed them over they were long and slender with the ends gently curved these sabers are designed for slashing and should do well with how youre always moving the points are sharp but youll still have a hard time thrusting through heavier armor same with heavy chops but i have a feeling brute force isnt your usual method given your speed haern swung the swords about getting a feel for their weight they were lighter than his previous swords with a slightly longer reach their grips were comfortable feeling natural like an extension of his body when he wielded them he could tell they were expertly made thank you he said dont thank me thank brug over there he made them just dont break em brug muttered from the table both sides will be out for blood tonight senke said leaning against a wall and holding a hand against his stomach you sure you have to go out people will kill each other just fine without your help he realized they were all looking at him either blatantly or through the corners of their eyes in his heart he felt something harden as if he wanted to prove them wrong to show he didnt care what they thought but what did it matter why did he go out what might he accomplish he remembered deathmasks biting words as if your five years of trying to singlehandedly conquer the thief guilds has worked out so much better something clicked in his head several pieces tumbling together as the idea took form he looked to them then out the window no there was nothing out there for him not this night come the day hed find deathmask assuming he still lived perhaps there was a chance to have a legacy opposite his father you know he said feeling a great weight lift off his shoulders i think i will stay here tonight if youll have me pull a seat up at the table senke said with a smile you bet your ass we will i n the dark of felwoods dungeon oric shivered he sat on a wood cot and listened to the water drip where it dripped he didnt know to pass the time hed tried to guess but the echo always seemed to change on him his cell was completely dark without a single shred of light hed scoured the floor with his palms but everywhere he touched was wet and a drop never landed upon him still the search did better to pass the time than thinking about his fate anytime he thought of that or of how long he might be in the total darkness his head swam and his heart lurched into his throat hed tried talking to anyone else a guard or fellow prisoner but his voice only echoed through the emptiness never answered for some reason that always made it worse without light company or a single meal time was meaningless at least two times he slept and in his dreams he saw color women friends he wished he could sleep more often a loud creak startled him from a doze heavy footsteps echoed down the hall orange and yellow flickered along the walls at first a wonderful sight but soon painful in their brightness holding a hand before his eyes to block the pain he felt a wretched sight as john gandrem stepped in soldiers at his side stay seated he said otherwise my guards will open you up in many places but a man should always rise at the arrival of a lord oric said he held back a cough his voice felt scratchy dry he remained sitting despite his protest with how light his head felt he thought hed pass out if he stood too quickly john crossed his arms and looked down at him in the yellow light his skin seemed like stone old and unmalleable his eyes looked even worse for all the stories hed heard of lord gandrems kindness hed yet to hear a story describe those eyes mercy didnt belong in them not now maybe not ever perhaps this was the lord of the dungeon a different man than the lord of felwood before we start theres a few things you should know gandrem began first i have talked extensively with the boy nathaniel his story is consistent and most damning second the man ingram thought he killed the farmer matthew is not dead third my men have already worked over uri and how he sang oric i know what you did to that farmers wife the idea that you could claim they assaulted a caravan and held nathaniel hostage is laughable i never claimed it that was ingrams stupid idea the faintest hint of a smile stretched at lord gandrems lips but then vanished perhaps a shame i cut his throat before i could tell him the farmer lived i plan on ensuring matthew is well rewarded as is his wife but the question remains now what do i do with you well between the rope and the ax i think id prefer the ax in time oric in time see my biggest problem is not with you but with your master arthur hadfield mark tullen visited me before meeting with you and nathaniel in tyneham i know he was escorting the boy back and im not a damn fool everyone knows he was a potential suitor of alyssa and arthur wanted him gone proving that however is another matter his soldiers rushed in and grabbed oric by either arm up went his hands back and above his head chains rattled and then he felt clamps tighten about his wrists with him safely shackled john sat on the small cot and pulled his heavy coat tighter about him now i dont mean proving it to just alyssa he continued shes a bright gal and theres too much here for her to ignore however arthurs long held those mines at the edge of my lands always refusing taxes i want those lands it is my knights that have protected them it is my lands his traders travel across to veldaren it is on my roads he ships his gold and sends for his supplies by all rights they should be mine and would have been if not for the gemcrofts what could i possibly have to do with that oric asked his shoulders were starting to cramp and he had a creeping feeling it was about to get a whole lot worseespecially if they left him like this for several hours if not days king vaelor has rejected every claim of mine for taxes no doubt because he fears the trifect more than he fears me that and their bribes but arthur has no heir and hes never written a will in case he does have a son doesnt want anyone feeling jealous of the brat or thinking he suddenly stole their wealth if he dies as such his lands will be joined with the closest lords you but you arent the one holding arthur alyssa is you think shell make him foreswear his lands before she strings him up i have no doubt she could john said but shell only do that if she discovers what happened now do you understand i hold all the control here arthur wont dare challenge me about your deaths for the truth gets him killed he can only keep his mouth shut and pray for the best i however oric tried to flex his back but he was held too closely to the wall he rolled his neck back and forth and it popped loudly minutes itd only been minutes but he already wanted out far better to shiver freely on the floor than sit unable to move half his body he didnt want to think about hours or days or gods forbid years i hold arthurs life in my hands and yours as well i might have used uri for this but he didnt take well to my low servants questionings we had to ensure he spoke the truth of course so it is down to you where do your loyalties lie oric you deserve death we both know this what might you do to be spared that fate help me or otherwiseyou said it yourself rope or ax oric couldnt believe his luck he thought that hed have nothing of value to offer but if he could roll on his former master and somehow escape with his head what is it you want from me he asked i need you to kill arthur before he can discover things have gone awry and before alyssa might realize his involvement before you do i want you to sign a statement i might use in the kings court detailing every bit of yours and arthurs involvement what do i do once i kill arthur oric asked what happens then this time lord gandrem did smile a man of your talents surely you could disappear into a crowd afterward and then wellkers a long way away and mordan even farther i also hear the sailors in angelport often need a good sellsword aboard their ships what about the farmer hes injured and my healers say it will take several days for him to recover we should have this concluded before he can be of any concern besides these matters are far above his station and his word in any court would be suspect at best being just a lowbirth simpleton it couldnt get any better oric was hardly afraid of a little travel and killing arthur would be no skin off his nose given the nature of his mission itd only be natural they go somewhere quiet to talk and after a bit of knife work hed have his freedom ill do it oric said excellent well claim you escaped the dungeon after we extracted your confession when you went to arthur he tried to cut ties and claim everything was your plan you killed him and fled and to where i dont want to know is this understood it is ill have a servant down here with candles and parchment tell him everything you know every possible detail farewell oric he stood and left and to orics great relief he had his guards remove the clamps at his wrists before he went sure to his word an elderly man with crooked nose arrived the beginning please he said dipping his feathered quill into an inkwell so oric did starting with arthurs theft from the gemcroft mines and smuggling it to the serpent guild for laundering w ill you truly let him go asked one of the soldiers walking alongside lord gandrem a veteran and trusted knight named cecil of course not the lord snapped the gemcrofts have had those mines tied up in legal protection for over a century i could wipe out half their family their extended family arthur included and theyd still find someone besides myself to be legal heir then why the ruse i need his confession quick truthful and most importantly damning to arthur ill be sending you to veldaren with that confession in your hands along with a letter of my own cecil bowed to show he was honored will we not be bringing nathaniel back to his mother he asked as they exited the dungeon doused their torch and headed toward the mess hall nathaniel was already abducted once on the road and when he should have been in my care no less my own damn foolishness for trusting that snake arthur i will keep him here and in safety until alyssa comes for him but youyou can let alyssa know of his survival shes a bright lady but arthur has a way with words and who knows what lies he has spun about her to protect himself that confession should burn them all away and if she is who i think she is shell deal with him accordingly let me get some food into these old bones and then ill pen my letter when you have mine and orics ride hard to veldaren if arthur suspects somethings amiss i fear he will make a move against her of course milord what of oric john grinned but something dangerous sparkled in his eyes that made it seem sinister he said he preferred the ax so prepare the gallows he deserves nothing not even the choice of his own death let him hang from my walls the honorless bastard f or a second night alyssa watched the city burn from her window there were more fires now at least seven she could see she wondered what it meant were her mercenaries finding more ratholes for the thieves she held an empty glass in her hand and she toasted the stars which were hidden behind a blanket of smoke you deserve better nathaniel she whispered i too can think of better homages for your son zusa said having slipped inside without making a noise alyssa had trained herself not to jump at zusas voice but still she quivered her nerves frayed perhaps she said as the woman joined her side but this is the best i can do you lie to yourself this is for you your hurt do what you must but do it in truth and bear the burden proudly enough alyssa said hurling her glass against the window it shattered small flecks of red wine dripping down to the floor i dont need speeches i dont need your wisdom i need my son back my little boy she pressed her head against the glass and refused to break as the tears ran down her face she stared at the distant fires and tried to revel in the bloodshed they represented but she only felt hollow as you wish she heard zusa say stay she whispered knowing the faceless woman would leave her as you wish tell me how goes it out there zusa gestured to the city the thieves are ready more than they were last night they started those fires and theyve killed many innocents i think theyre hoping to turn the people against the king and it might work if veldaren is an altar youve covered it in blood as a sacrifice to your son i dont know which god will honor it though perhaps theyve both washed their hands of this miserable city alyssa nodded it sounded right she had opened up her coffers and replaced their stores of gold with bodies of the dead was it a fair trade could it ever be what about the one who killed my son she asked zusa thought of her fight with him and how shed been stopped at the last minute by someone with a feminine voice who knew her name it could only be veliana but what might she want with the man when she checked their usual practice spot shed found the area vacant despite her best efforts she hadnt located where it was she now hid it seemed both veliana and the watcher had eluded her i fought him she admitted but he escaped before i reached victory where he is now i do not know did you hurt him yes i drew blood good at least thats a start will you go out again before the night is over zusa put a wrapped hand upon the glass and stared out slowly she shook her head no theres nothing out there just men killing one another i think even the watcher has stepped back to let it run its course may i leave alyssa nodded when zusa was halfway to the door she stopped and glanced back she looked as tired as alyssa felt if i may be so bold i have a request make this the last night alyssa killing doesnt cover the pain of loss itll only drain you leave you empty i do not pretend that these men deserve mercy not all of thembut this path youve chosen will only lead to ruin even if it does i will follow you into it even unto death i dont know if i can stop this alyssa said youre strong enough lady gemcroft i know it and with that she left the door closing with a soft click of wood alyssa watched the fires but it seemed she could not longer keep her mind upon them she felt tired and she often thought of returning to her bed she hadnt slept well lately maybe a few hours at most all throughout the day men and women had come to her claiming fault for what her mercenaries had done near the end she had paid off every request whether they could prove it or not she hadnt had the energy left to care at last shed delegated the responsibility to bertram as if thinking his name had summoned him the old man opened the door then knocked upon it after the fact yes bertram she said keeping her face to the window so he couldnt see her tears if this is about the cost of damages and repairs spare me i am in no mood and you should be asleep in any case as should you bertram said quietly approaching but it seems sleep is a difficult thing for most of us in these troubled times ive come to discuss a different matter and what is that she could see his reflection in the glass and she watched him chew on his lower lip while his hands clasped behind his back ive gone over the mercenaries pay along with our promised payments to the citizens and the total is i told you i had no interest she snapped its more than that bertram said doing well to keep his tone soothing and controlled i did as you requested and treated cost as no object but i feared the folly and like i feared it has come to pass the cost has been astronomical especially with how many have died the guild requires extra compensation for men who fall in line of duty for wives children mistresses and the like plus the fires were more than we expected and you have accepted blame for nearly all cases your point she asked he stood up straighter as he spoke we have nothing left lady gemcroft your fortune is spent unless we delay payments for several years we will default on at least a third of the mercenaries and aid with only half of the repairs her mouth dropped are you certain he nodded i have checked multiple times she saw the fires burning before her and suddenly they took on a different meaning is that counting tonight for the mercenaries yes but not necessarily any extra for the dead since i cannot know for certain until tomorrow but not the fires no i can only assume the worst she felt her whole world spiraling away from her how could all their wealth have vanished so quickly it didnt seem possible of course the mines in the north had lessened in their production over the past year but still what of their contracts their trade had the thief guilds truly destroyed so much all is not lost he said sliding closer and wrapping a comforting arm around her shoulders i have thought of a way to help ease this burden we still may delay some payments especially for those who died without families or still have means to survive what is it she asked lord hadfield has an extensive amount of wealth saved up an amount he hoped to bequeath to an eventual heir if you were to marry he would assume your debts i have already discussed the matter and he is willing to do his part to help you move on from your sons death including this debacle you have unleashed upon our city she crossed her arms and held them against her as if she were cold could she marry arthur true hed been kind since he arrived and he seemed to have no intention of leaving theyd shared a bed even and with him she did feel some measure of comfort her heart ached for mark but he was gone as was her son should she continue to let it haunt her maybe zusa was right maybe it was time to end all of it when she finally asked it will need to be soon especially given how deep our debt is if we make significant payments we can hold our debtors at bay as well as convince them we have every intention of making good on our promises lord connington will help if you ask no member of the trifect would let the other fall so far as to bring shame upon them as well perhaps in a few days i can have the ceremonies prepared and all the proper documents written and presented before the kings council to approve there was something chipper about his tone that scraped against her spine like metal on glass enough she said start on whatever you must but dont tell arthur anything other than that i am open to the idea he should at least be the one to propose not my fathers old advisor bertram smiled quite right quite right goodnight milady perhaps soon you will finally have pleasant dreams goodnight bertram once he was gone she blew out her candles returned to her bed and tried to sleep she couldnt arthur gemcroft she whispered moving the word about her tongue as if trying to taste it he would adopt her last name as all men and women did when entering into a family of the trifect arthur gemcroft arthurgemcroft it had a ring to it she must admit shed put off marriage for long enough it was time for her to be practical still as much sense as it made it gave no comfort and she tossed and turned until the morning light shone through her curtains falling upon her ragged face and bloodshot eyes t he wound in ghosts leg was worse than hed originally feared hed returned to his squalid inn carefully put his weapons aside and then collapsed onto his bed the windows had no shutters or curtains and the light streamed in upon his face without much reason to join the nights slaughter hed instead languished in his favorite tavern drowning himself in alcohol to dull his pain hed passed out and no one had had the nerve to wake him the dressings on his leg haphazard at best had leaked through and were now infected as he lay there he felt the pain crawling its way up his thigh as if it were a spider scurrying through his veins if he didnt do something soon hed lose use of the knee if not the entire leg he wouldnt be the best anymore he wouldnt even be a threat a man of his strength his skill was not meant to be a cripple surely the gods did not intend such a fate for him the gods ghost rolled off the bed putting all his weight on his good leg damn that priestess the watcher had been his thoroughly beaten he didnt give a shit that hed appeared wounded and weaponless assassinations by their very nature were unfair but hed been a fool to let her tend to the wounded senke hed thought her too young to be a threat but how wrong hed been its not the big snakes you need to fear he remembered a friend telling him once as they crossed the grasslands toward veldaren its the tiny ones who carry the real venom put that on your darts if you want a sure kill the priestess was the tiny snake the insignificant one among the wizard and warriors stupid stupid he took a hobbled step toward the only decoration in his room a large dresser full of clothes and outfits leaning against it for support he yanked out the top drawer letting it crash to the floor reaching into the gap he pulled out a small bag of coin itd have to do retrieving his swords he opened the door and stepped out into the painful morning light twice on the way to the temple he collapsed his knee unable to bear his weight a black bruise swelled across it and the puss from where the watchers sword had cut him was turning green no one paid him any attention the crowd flowing to either side as if he were an overturned cart or a dead body reaching the temple offered ghost little comfort he still had to climb the many steps and after the first few he gave up any pretense of pride he sat down upon them put his back to the temple and pushed himself up one at a time at the top he braced himself on a pillar and used it to keep his balance while he stood men and women gathered about the wooden doors crying out for aid no doubt the temple was swarming with people inside as well hed seen the fires heard the sounds of combat flowing up and down the streets the thieves had put up a fight this time firing arrows from the rooftops and preparing a hundred ambushes he pushed his way through them the wound in his leg meaning nothing to his enormous arms most turned to glare at him then decided otherwise seeing his size and painted face once inside the temple he leaned against a wall and surveyed the madness priests and priestesses of all ages were running about they looked like white bees zipping from flower to flower theyd kneel exchange a word maybe a prayer and then move on the older ones lingered and with many he saw them put their hands on wounds and whisper words of prayer to ashhur white light would cover their hands sometimes weak sometimes strong and then sink into the wound that was what he needed faithful or not he wouldnt deny that the priests had their uses but he wouldnt risk some juvenile treating him he wanted a master someone who knew what he was doing where is calan he asked as he grabbed an elderly priestess her face a circleweb of wrinkles busy she said giving him a reproachful glare she didnt seem the slightest bit unnerved by his size or skin bring him he said refusing to let go despite her tugging to break free he owes me one tell him that and who are you she asked as he released her sleeve just point him my way hell recognize me she looked him up and down and though it seemed impossible her frown grew deeper i can imagine so she said then hurried on her way he leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes if he could ignore every noise every visual distraction he could focus on the pain and doing so made him feel better his temples throbbed with each pulse of pain but he kept it under control he felt the pains limits how far it stretched throughout his leg time passed and he was dimly aware of it i see youve returned a mans voice said ghost stirred to see calan standing before him he looked tired with dark circles under his eyes and his smile forced may i ask why youve given us the pleasure in answer ghost pulled up his pant leg to reveal the wound he winced when he saw it himself the purple bruise had spread and the green puss was filling up his bandage calans smile immediately vanished and he grabbed ghosts arm this way he said you need a bed now ghost wanted to protest but didnt hed hoped for a bit of healing magic and then off hed be instead he obeyed without argument for his head ached his stomach continued to do loops and he felt intensely drained it was as if the pain were a fire burning away his energy calan led them through the maze of people and pews his head swiveled but he saw no opening no space available muttering he turned them toward the back then through a door to a quaint room it had a small desk a bookshelf and a bed and it was that bed calan set him upon my quarters will have to do the priest said though i fear the bed might be small for you a beds a bed ghost mumbled i suppose youre right here he tossed the small bag of coins to pay for his treatment save my leg will you calan rolled the pant leg carefully folding it over and over until it was up to his thigh ghost closed his eyes for some strange reason he didnt want to watch he didnt want to understand what it was the priest would do or what its implications meant gods were for other people not him gold and killing that was god enough for him he heard whispers undoubtedly prayers so he leaned his head back and tried to relax the pain continued to throb its reach growing he felt it down to his shin as if instead of a single cut the watcher had beaten and smashed his whole leg with a club a strange sound met his ears it was like a soft breeze blowing past the entrance of a cave yet deeper fuller even through his closed eyelids he saw the light flare when it plunged into his legs it was like fire he clutched the sides of the bed and clenched his teeth his nostrils flared as he breathed in and out the infection is deep he heard calan say bear with me ghost i know youre strong you will endure more prayers and another burst of light this time when it plunged into him there was no feeling of fire only a cold numbness that spread with alarming speed he worried if it reached his lungs hed never breathe again it stopped at his thigh though and then seemed to shrink back in on itself with its retreat he realized he felt no pain even when the coldness left his leg entirely what did you do he asked daring to open his eyes what you wanted me to do calan said looking down at him what else the priest resumed his prayers and as his hands hovered over ghosts knee the flesh began to knit itself together forming a pale white scar on his dark skin when finished calan took a step back and more collapsed than sat with his weight pressed against the door his head thumped against the wood and it seemed those dark circles had increased a long two days he said as if to himself blame the trifect ghost said i blame no one have no reason some days are long and some painfully short must say i do prefer the calmer ones to this however ghost chuckled but he didnt have the strength to continue drowsiness was stealing over him hed only slept a few hours in the tavern and itd hardly been deep or comforting the pain had found him even in his dreams i think ill sleep now he said and then he did his sleep was deep dark and strangely without dreams when he awoke he felt as if an immense amount of time had passed his leg felt worlds better though he was still hesitant to bend it what if it were all an illusion and the pain returned tenfold when he finally tested it rubbing his eyes with his hand he shook his head to speed up his waking he found himself alone in the room when he put his weight on his knee it buckled and gave completely he caught himself on the bed and collapsed back atop it what the fuck he asked then felt guilty for cursing in the middle of a temple it was a silly feeling but still his neck flushed he stretched his arms and back then settled in what should he do now it wasnt like he was in any real danger and hed already paid for the bed and healing the only thing nagging on his mind was the watcher he needed another confrontation one without those annoying mercenaries getting in the way how could he manage it and would the watcher be foolish enough to return to that building return to where he knew others might find him what he knew about the watcher could be written on a pebble the man might still be with the eschaton or he might be halfway to ker ten minutes later the door opened and in stepped calan he looked a little better but not much was your rest pleasant he asked he sounded distracted the question more obligatory than any conscious desire to know best in years how long was i out five hours calan said he pulled the chair out from the desk and plopped into it massaging his forehead with his fingers he stared down at the wood and appeared to soak in the calm ghost had seen people look like that before after theyd endured a long stretch on a battlefield once the blood and bodies were gone the men looked as if solitude was something physical they could soak in like a sponge silence a concoction they could massage through their temples and neck it bad out there he asked disliking the lack of noise it was calan said his eyes staring through his desk better now a lot of dead and even more anger and hopelessness too many expect miracles as if i had any to give ghost felt another awkward silence descend over them deciding he was out of his league he pulled things back to something more grounded more real to him whats wrong with my knee he asked i cant stand on it calan looked up i cleansed the infection and knit the flesh but it is still tender the spell i used to numb your pain will take time to fade and until it does most of your muscles will ignore any request you make of them dont fight it there isnt much point in another few hours youll be walking albeit with a limp a few more and youll be back to doing whatever it is you do killing i assume sending me even more men and women to care for i came and paid good coin for healing not insults my apologies that was uncalled for it was he tilted his head toward the wall not even wanting to look at the old man the only ones hed killed recently were those hed been contracted for or defending the priests temple that was the thanks he got vague accusations of making his life harder and a claim that he was nothing but a killer you know what its like to live in a place where everyone who sees you either hates you or is afraid ghost asked there are many who are unsettled by my presence and more who are angered by what i speak but it isnt the whole city even those who fear you do so because youve got something they dont understand they dont understand me either but you they could choose to be like you if they wanted they cant be like me no matter what they do they best they could do is smear themselves with coal and thatd vanish with a good scrub calan leaned back in his chair and he seemed to truly look at him for the first time is that why you paint your face to show them how different you are ghost chuckled you want to know why truly why it should show them how the difference between us between me and you is something as stupid as a strip of paint something so thin and artificial we think nothing of it if done to a wall or a piece of armor but that never happens instead they look at me with even greater fear when i first started those i hunted called me ghost and so i took the name and abandoned my old one at least if they hated the ghost feared it it was my own creation they feared it wasnt me it wasnt who i really was let them focus their hatred on something i can shed as easily as i shed this paint upon my face are you a killer the priest asked no but i think ghost is and who are you when you are not the ghost ghost looked at him trying to understand the true desire behind the question calan seemed interested almost invested in what he might say and do there was no lie or deceit in him and ghost considered himself an excellent judge of both who was he when not the man with the white face who was he when not hunting when not contracted to capture or kill another im not sure i remember anymore he said do you still remember your name he should have but suddenly it didnt seem so clear itd been over ten years since he adopted the ghost moniker before that hed gone by a dozen names changing them as he traveled east each city a new name he tried to pull up childhood memories of hearing his mother say his name but each one was different in the timeworn haze suddenly he felt ashamed and he wanted to be anywhere other than beneath the priests unrelenting gaze no he said at last and i may never why does it matter to you old man if you have to ask i fear your mistrust has sunken in far deeper than any infection ghost used the wall to shove himself onto his good leg enough he said my thanks for your help good luck with your wounded and you with your wounds as well ghost limped from the temple more than ever certain that haern needed to die if only to put his suddenly troubled mind to rest veliana pulled her dagger free of the wolfs neck and kicked his body away all around her rose the stench of blood and dead bodies theyd thoroughly trashed the home broken chairs and shattered tables deathmask stood at the door scanning for more trespassers to their territory while the twins entered from the houses other room im bleeding said mier hes bleeding said nien badly deathmask asked not bothering to glance inside no no that seemed good enough for deathmask veliana cleaned her dagger and jammed it into her belt she felt ready to pass out between mercenaries and other members of the guilds theyd killed over thirty men since the night started and now it was halfway through morning and still they continued it seemed deathmasks desire for blood knew no bounds she felt ready to collapse at the slightest breeze yet he was still searching still bouncing as if he were an excited maiden the worst was that the territory theyd chosen to make their stand on was a single street aptly named shortway poorly traveled and worth a meager handful of coins in theft and protection money this is hopeless she said approaching her guildmaster some guild she thought four of them slaughtering trespassers on a single street surely the other guildmasters were quaking in their boots weve accomplished nothing other than a few bodies rumors deathmask said still scanning the sparsely populated street whispers exaggerations given time they will work for us we start with a single road and let the rest of the city know that it is ours then we take a second and a third with each passing day we spread until we can take no more and by then they will fear us greater than any other guild for we will be few we will be skilled and we will have shown they cannot stop us cannot even slow us down veliana rolled her eyes but decided not to press the point she felt too tired to argue sleep would be nice said mier or perhaps it was nien very nice said the other very well deathmask said lets return tomorrow will be just as long and longer should the mercenaries finally slack off we have more to fear from the guilds than from them to the mercenaries we are a small nuisance a paltry four worth no bounty its the other guilds they want but thren kadish williamtheyll understand one of them will descend upon us with all their fury and that is the battle we must win that our entire fate will rest upon rest said veliana it was really the only word her mind could latch onto during his spiel i think thats the smartest thing youve said his eyes narrowed behind his mask but then he laughed we have longer days ahead of us than this you three i hope you understand that still no reason to press ourselves without reason weve accomplished what we must lets get back to our little hideout deathmask led the way no one accosted them on their travel and it seemed none were tracking them either shortway was hardly the center of much guild activity and those few who had stumbled upon it had died most of their kills had been thieves fleeing from other territories where the mercenaries had been at their thickest when they reached their safe house a cellar rented from a wellbribed tavernkeeper deathmask flung the doors open lit a waiting torch with a touch of his finger and led them down the cellar was not empty it took you long enough said the watcher leaning against the far wall the twins drew their daggers and veliana felt her hand reach for her own deathmask put an arm before them all then took off his mask and grinned forgive us we didnt know we had company waiting have you come to accept my offer haern nodded toward the twins have you made new friends for now the twins said in unison the watcher chuckled very well then i take it you can read a pouch hung from his waist and he pulled one of many scrolls from it and tossed it to deathmask who caught it and began reading his eyes widened so veliana glanced over but he was moving it too much for her to decipher anything useful the whole city deathmask asked he looked ready to both laugh and lash out in rage have you lost your mind perhaps have you lost your courage dont turn this on me you want to present every guildleader and member of the trifect with the same demand and then force them to accept within the span of a single night veliana yanked the document from his hand and read further in a tight careful script the letter warned the reader to either accept the following terms or die a sum to be decided by the king or his advisors equal to half the gold lost to theft or spent on mercenaries would be equally distributed among the remaining five major thief guilds in return the thief guilds would protect everything within the city walls from theft of all their members at the end was the date the watcher expected an answer the winter solsticetwo nights away she rolled the document up and tossed it back to haern who deftly caught it youve lost your mind she said if i remember correctly it was your idea not mine so the insanity should at least be shared deathmask laughed but he looked ready to explode i wanted them to meet to decide terms i wanted delays chances to manipulate various parties and to thin out the guilds who might resist you want to do it all in a single night how what madness in you makes you think this could work you know several will agree haern insisted those mercenaries are devastating everyone and will continue to do so as long as the trifect can afford them this war has lasted ten years far longer than even thren wanted the trifect itself is hemorrhaging money but they currently have no way to end this while saving face and thats assuming thren would even let them end it veliana shook her head you of all people should understand too many would resent this youd turn us from honest thieves to lowrent bodyguards the very nature of the guilds would shift i can do this haern said softer his eyes narrowed and his gaze hardened ive killed and killed and now i will make it have meaning every guildmaster or leader who refuses will die by my hand those who assume control will be given the same demands and suffer the same fate if they refuse my father began this chaos and i will end it veliana looked to her guildleader who was deep in thought it was almost as if she could watch the idea growing in his mind taking shape every potential reaction sifting through a spider web of end results you have the ash guilds approval he said suddenly as if snapping from a daze will you deliver the letters tonight i will then go do it i only have one request leave your father to me haern paused and his eyes glanced away very well he said when he looked back you stand to make a fortune deathmask that is why i trust you but remember the same deal applies to you as well if her guildmaster was upset by the threat he didnt show it save your energy for those who will give you the most trouble when the watcher was gone veliana spun on deathmask shoving a finger into his face i can understand him wanting to perform this madness but you deathmask winked at her with his red eye if he succeeds he succeeds if he fails we lose nothing besides veliana what else does this plan need but some theatrics the watchers plan is insane and most likely hell get himself killedbut i wont stop him he already frightens the lower members of the thief guilds if he lives hell become a terror to them the only real chance of keeping this agreement in order long enough for us to benefit why thren asked mier why us asked nien because deathmask said turning to the twins with his smile nearly ear to ear if he accepts the rest of the guilds will fall like dominoes you wouldnt think id leave the most important part of the entire plan to someone else would you not since the hunger riots preceding the bloody kensgold had gerand crold seen the people of the city so furious as advisor to the king he had listened to the many complaints about guards fires theft and overall demands for compensation hed sat in his uncomfortable chair a ledger before him and denied every single one the line of petitioners seemed endless and that was with the castle guards filtering out some of the more unkempt individuals once the sun had finally set gerand spoke to the king whispering lies in his ears about how the people still respected him back in his chambers a full bottle of wine awaited him as per his orders to his servants just what he needed to relax fucking thieves he muttered as he shut the door the past five years had filled his head with gray hair and the marriage with his wife had plummeted into occasional nights spent together but mostly him sleeping in the castle her in their mansion removing the cork he poured a glass and toasted the empty room to you alyssa he said for destroying in two days everything i built in five years to alyssa someone whispered their breath upon his neck gerand nearly choked on his wine he spun torn between diving for a weapon and falling to his knees to beg for his life the last time a thief had snuck into his room itd been thren felhorn and a female companion theyd kidnapped his wife to make him enforce certain desires of theirs the first thought that ran through his mind as he saw a man cloaked in gray was that theyd have to kidnap someone better if they wanted him to obey thren he said startled by the sight it looked like thren only much younger he had a sudden fear that the man was immortal immune to time and that he might never be rid of him as a wolfish grin spread across the intruders face he choked down such irrational thoughts this wasnt thren no matter how much he looked like him no said the man close though i am the watcher perhaps you have heard of me i have though ive wondered if you were actually real he chuckled i guess this should count as proof the watcher snatched the glass from his hand and drank the remaining half as he smacked his lips he tossed him a scroll read it he commanded gerand did his eyes growing wider with each sentence you want the credit of the idea to go to the king he asked when finished but why the more involved the better said the watcher he leaned against the wall to the inside of where the door would open even if gerand managed to call the guards and not die doing so the man would still get the jump on them besides i need someone neutral in all this someone both sides trust youve accepted bribes from both the thieves and the trifect both will think youll be in their pocket once the smoke clears but edwin will never agree hes terrified someone will poison his tea or put shards of metal into his bread by the gods he thinks every shadow in his bedroom is a man poised with razor wire he has something more real to fear and we both know it veldaren is furious youve failed to protect its people and this time its gone too far fires have burned down a quarter of the city innocent men and women died at the hands of mercenaries and they come here finding no justice no empathy they have no one to turn to no one to trust do you remember the riots five years ago they will make those look downright orderly gerand nodded he remembered how much anger simmered in the many waiting in his line theyd certainly not left in a better mood after discussing with him either getting king vaelor to agree would involve marginal effort at best once he played on his fears then offered him the deal as a way to come out a hero hed agree in a heartbeat gerand glanced down at the parchment in hand still trying to decide the loophole the underhanded secret hidden beneath the words what do you gain from this he dared ask we all want a legacy the watcher said this will be mine the arrangement will rely on you once everything is in order can you enforce it the way he said it sparked a memory and coupled with the face he couldnt keep it in any longer for a time he had tried to capture threns son aaron and had even used the kings old advisor robert haern to aid him in the task time had dulled his memory and no doubt the child had grown but still you have to be threns kin he said his long lost son aaron perhaps the watcher pulled his hood lower over his face and his mood seemed to sour i would keep such thoughts to yourself friend they are dangerous gerand felt his blood chill of course of course i guess it is no matter but can you pull this off a bluff wont work with either side i have lived on the streets hunting them like dogs every single guild has initiated me into their order without knowing it i know where they live where they hide few can challenge my skill and none my determination i will kill them all of them if i must make the king listen to you he stood and put a hand on the door ive already delivered the rest of the messages theyll bring their answers to you come tomorrow ill check here first to see who is safe and who must be dealt with i understand as the door opened gerand couldnt hold in a chuckle the watcher stopped as if he suspected a trap no its not that he said as the man closed the door i just found it humorous is all a long time ago your father came to me threatening my life to help him escalate his conflict yet now you come here seeking to end it i guess you arent your fathers son are you this seemed to put a smile on the watchers face good night advisor do your part and trust me to do mine he vanished out the door gerand plopped down onto his bed and now that he was alone he felt his hands start to shake his nerves finally getting the better of him it seemed despite the guards and walls those with enough skill could still reach him perhaps the kings jumping at shadows wasnt so irrational after all wheres that damn wine he asked seeing it he held it by the neck and drank straight from the bottle given what he was about to go through the following day and night hed need all the courage he could get delysia stumbled upon him getting ready as night fast approached where are you going she asked hed shared senkes room but the other rogue had gone out to spend a night relaxing in the taverns ive got some business to take care of he said brugs trunk of weapons lay open before him and he slid several daggers into his belt plus another into a pocket of his boot my brother did some digging and he says the mercenaries wont be going out again tonight she said crossing her arms underneath her breasts what is it youre planning for once the night might be peaceful haern felt a halfsmile tug at the corner of his mouth the nights are never peaceful here quiet perhaps but killing can be silent work when done right never mind that though promise me youll stay inside things are about to get very dangerous she put a hand on his arm for you as well he shrugged cant help it i have a chance to do something great delysia something real will you kill he rolled his eyes this isnt the same then what is it safety he said for all of us my father wants a legacy and ill deny him it what he started ill end or ill die trying you dont have to do this alone she said let us help let me help you lost enough because of me i wont risk the life youve rebuilt here who said you had a choice he winked at her where im going tonight i dont think a priest or priestess has ever been good night del he took her hand kissed it and then left the trip to the castle wasnt long though scaling the outer wall sneaking past the guards climbing up to one of the higher windows and then stealthily descending to gerands room took more time than hed prefer probably should have made the advisor meet him at the front gates he thought would have saved him the time and trouble when he slipped inside gerand looked ready for him he smiled at his entrance but haern saw the way his eyes darted about and how the edges of his smile quivered the man was nervous but he didnt think it was because hed set a trap no doubt he felt the eyes of every guild upon him plus the anger of the trifect what were their responses haern asked having no time to waste ive received an answer from everyone but the ash guild and james keenan with him down in angelport theres no way he might give an answer and no keeper of his estate here would dare agree to something like this without confirmation dont worry about the ash guild i have their answer keenan will fall in line when the other two trifect leaders agree tell me have any said yes the wolf guild will but only if thren agrees as well if the spider guild doesnt fall in line though theyll deny ever saying so is that it gerand licked his lips the serpent guilds man said theyd rather kiss the asses of a thousand corpses than the trifects the hawks fired an arrow over our wall a cloth tied to the shaft with the word never written in blood upon it leon conningtons advisor sent a letter saying they were open to negotiations but not under such conditions lady gemcrofts response was cryptic i received a letter from her saying youd have to kill her while her advisor came by later insisting she might change her mind given time as for the spider guild he gestured to a package waiting beside his bed haern opened it to find a severed head eyes and mouth sewn shut who is it he asked frowning look closer he did saw the gray hair thin nose and most noticeably a fresh cut running from the heads left eye to its ear haern glanced back at the advisor and saw a similar albeit faded scar on his face he felt a pang of guilt and he wondered who the poor guy had been intimidation haern said dont fall for it i wont let them get to you how asked gerand exasperated there are five guilds and three leaders of the trifect three of the guilds and two of the trifect have denied you can you kill them all i might be better off having you killed instead and letting them fight amongst themselves haern narrowed his eyes and the advisor immediately retracted his comment forgive me im stressed and have had more to drink than i probably should how will i know if you succeed theyll come tell you haern said turning to leave oh and escort me out will you i dont have time to mess around with your guards sure said gerand why not a kings advisor and an assassin side by side as friends ive suffered through stranger they walked through the halls toward the castles exit and several times gerand had to calm soldiers who saw haerns cloaks and sabers and immediately assumed the worst at the giant doors gerand grabbed his arm and pulled him close be careful who you kill first he said if you fail but still strike down the leaders of either side you will unbalance everything you must succeed in this watcher if i unbalance things at least youll finally have a winner haern said grinning and i dont plan on dying ill visit you come the morning i promise he flew down the streets his legs pumping his eyes darted every which way knowing that the guilds would be prepared for his arrival for the longest time hed only been a phantom to them but now theyd heard his promise this was their chance deathmask had asked him if he was insane perhaps he was but at least deathmask had also seemed to understand if he were to try why not try for the impossible he decided the first ones to visit would be the hawks they were no friends of the spider guild and their recent conflict with both them and the mercenaries had surely devastated their numbers their leader kadish vel was a sensible enough man bit of a gambler if haern could convince him to give the treaty a chance especially as a way to diminish threns danger to him then he should be able to win over the guilds cooperation without having to kill its leader the hawk guilds headquarters had shifted several times but even after threns attack theyd refused to move from their current tavern no doubt kadish was tired of running theyd emptied out during the mercenaries rampage but with the night turning quiet he felt certain theyd return with the strange threat of the watcher hanging over them all theyd want to be where they felt safe where they recognized every face knew every shadow every entrance if he was lucky they would think it all a bluff or even an opportunistic lie of the king in an attempt to save face before his furious populace still their eyes would be open even if they doubted nothing that night would be easy if he had to open up with a stealthy kill he would conversation be damned dead bodies spoke clearer than anything else in the world of thieves hed given them their warning two men stood at the entrance obviously on the lookout the one on the left looked bored as if hed drawn the short straw that night the other was older and more aware haern drifted along on the left hunched over limping and muttering to himself as if hed had too much to drink neither hawk gave him a second glance once out of their sight haern walked closer a hand leaning against the tavern as if he needed it for balance upon reaching the back he saw a door most certainly locked and barred he tested it just to make sure no lock but it was bolted a veritable army of feral cats lurked about and one hissed at his presence as it hunkered down over a scrap of fat youre right haern whispered to the feline i should wait my turn shouldnt i the alley was thin dark and full of places to hide ten minutes later he heard a thud from the other side of the door and then it creaked open enjoy said a burly man chucking a bucket of what seemed to be a mixture of vomit and woodchips the mess splattered onto the stone and in leapt the cats there to hiss and growl while they searched for something edible when the mans back was turned haern stepped from his hiding spot jumped into the opening and flung his arms around his neck a quick jerk and he fell his scream muffled by haerns palm sleep well he whispered slipping inside haern stepped inside a storeroom cramped and occupied almost entirely by the two shelves on either side the man hed knocked out wasnt the barkeep one of the few things that might allow him to remain hidden already he heard the raucous drinkers at the front and they would not tolerate any sort of absence by the man supplying their liquor judging from his size and duty hed taken out a heavyhand someone to deal with those who got out of line haern chuckled talk about someone that would not be missed by the crowd he ducked underneath the lowest shelf peered out from the door and was rewarded with the sight of a pair of hairy legs as the barkeep scratched at a scab near his ankle rows of bottles stretched before him he was behind the bar from his time inside before he knew thered be a locked door to his right blocking off a staircase that led into the lower quarters that the hawks had enlarged and adopted as their own question was how did he get inside as he pressed his back against the wall an idea came to him he waited a moment to see if the barkeep noticed the movement then pressed his elbows against the wall there was no plaster or paint just a thin piece of wood bracing with his feet he pressed inward hoping the laughter and singing might drown out the noise he pressed harder every muscle in his legs taut and then the board gave wincing at the noise he pushed it all the way in until it snapped in half he worked an arm through then his head and finally the rest of his body when he fell out the other side he was behind the locked door and inside the small staircase leading to a second door haern drew his sabers thrilled by the way they handled senke had given him a fine gift hopefully hed put them to good use the time for stealth was over he tested the door found it unlocked and then kicked it in as the loud crack echoed in the room he leapt inside already searching for his first victim there were four men inside sitting at a table with cards and wooden chips stacked before them they shouted and reached for their weapons but they were too slow haern whirled through them rolling across the table and to the other side chips and pieces clattered along the floor mixing with the blood shit he said as he stared at the bodies none were kadish vel he glanced about seeing only one other room within were some ledgers a shelf stocked with tiny bottles and a bed haern couldnt believe it the first of his many places to attack and he hadnt even bothered to check inside the tavern first kadish was probably with his men drinking so much for being the feared watcher of veldaren so much for his plans he rushed back to the stairs trying to decide a course of action no one would know hed come down there yet kadish was in a public place lots of people but that could work in his favor halfway up the stairs he turned back and hurried to the small side room scouring the shelf he looked to see if his idea was possible the tiny bottles werent alcohol like he first assumed they were tonics tinctures and most importantly poisons only half were labeled as he expected haern recalled his lessons when training under his father for three months hed had a tutor who knew more about poisons than haern could ever learn in a lifetime many of his lessons during those long days involved discovering the nature of unlabeled poisons he shook several checking their color their consistency and their weight he pulled four aside cleared a space on the shelf and put the bottles atop it one of the bottles was clearly an extract of shadeleaf but that was only part of what he needed he took two others shook them and then poured drops of each together when they turned green he frowned trying another bottle he mixed the two when they turned clear he grinned dumping out half the bottle of shadeleaf extract he poured the other bottle a common mixture of kingsblood and dandyblooms in with the rest and shook it the resulting mixture turned clear it had a strong taste to it which meant it only worked with certain alcohols and wines that it complemented that was if you planned on putting it in someones drink of course haern had other ideas among the marked bottles one was a useful paste that bonded with most poisons thickening them into something akin to glue taking one of his daggers haern applied the poison to the blade careful not to rush the last thing he wanted was to prick a finger and die in the hawks basement dwelling that hardly seemed like the noble end he felt he desired last he found one more particular bottle and smashed it haern climbed back through the hole in the wall slipped out the rear of the tavern and then circled around to the front the two thieves remained on guard and they sneered at his approach hey you got to have money first said the one on the right blocking his way with his arm haern glared then pointed through the door slurring his words and making sure his hand bobbed up and down in the air thatthat guy theres my brother hell cover for me really ask him hes a great guy married a whore who makes more money on her back than i couldithat could make in a month haern made sure he pointed between the tables and the movement of his arm made it no clearer who he was referring to as his brother the guard on the left looked inside as if he could somehow pinpoint him anyway the one on the right grabbed his arm i said get out he said but haern moved too fast he spun out of his grip slashed open his throat and then turned to the other before he could let out a cry haern stabbed his chest with a nonpoisoned dagger ramming his arm over his mouth to hold in the scream it came out muffled but not loud enough to attract any attention within it seemed like the men and women were eager to celebrate their first moment of peace in two days no doubt they thought theyd beaten the mercenaries or at least wanted to think so knowing time was far from an ally he lumbered into the tavern resuming his drunken gait with his head low he scanned the bar looking for kadish vel he found him in the far corner sitting with his back to a wall at the giant round table six men sat with him along with a pretty lady at his side she seemed bored with the proceedings and haern wondered if she stayed with him for coin or for safety the rest were joking or boasting their voices loud and slurred all but kadish he seemed mildly amused at best haern drifted toward him he had one chance at this just one hey hey hey shouted one of the men as haern slid between them directly opposite kadish he put his hands on the table and he leaned forward as if keeping balance was a struggle kadisshh haern asked looking lazily at the guildmaster im sorry friend the bar might be mine but the drinks still dont come free said kadish haern never responded his hands leaning there on the table were also within inches of the sabers at his hips as his cloaks folded away kadish saw them and that was when haern moved he drew them both and in one smooth motion sliced through the necks of the men beside him as they collapsed their blood splattering across the table kadish flung himself out of his chair pressing his back into a corner the pretty girl looked dazed as if she didnt believe what she saw two of the men moved closer to defend kadish the others drawing daggers and lunging haern batted one aside killed another with a riposte and then spun a whirling machine of death cries of alarm spread across the tavern as the rest realized what was going on falling to one knee haern let go of a saber and yanked the poisoned dagger from his boot from underneath the table he saw the lower half of kadishs body no armor no realization of the danger he flung the dagger trusting his aim it plunged into the meat of kadishs thigh and haern allowed himself a smile and then he was moving again his sabers reveling in the blood of his opponents the whole tavern was in chaos half fleeing wanting no part of whatever might happen many others cried out in warning expecting an ambush one shouted threns name as if he must be the one responsible haern weaved through them all deflecting sword strikes and slicing into the arms of those who thrust their daggers a heavyset man tried to block his way at the door but haern rammed into him with his left shoulder his right hand stabbed repeatedly the two collapsed through the door landing beside the bodies of the guards out in the open haern took to his feet and ran curses followed after him but he was too fast the city so familiar that he could weave and turn without pause down the maze of alleys and streets he wished he could have talked to kadish convinced him to change his mind but thered been no way the poison would work its way up his leg and to his lungs locking them in place there was a cure but that had been the bottle haern smashed before leaving by the time they found another kadish would be dead a list of targets passed through his head hed taken out one of the guilds so it was time to move on to a member of the trifect from what hed learned the recent wave of mercenary attacks had been the doing of only one if there were to be any peace in the city alyssa gemcroft would need to die alyssa had been hiding in her room from her relatives when zusa arrived a letter in hand hes coming she told her as she handed over the parchment the man who killed your son he wants you to agree to his terms or hell kill you this man the watcher she crumpled the letter without reading it needing only the signature at the bottom to know her answer he kills nathaniel then dares make demands hell come tonight zusa said and hes skilled milady he might carry through his promise let him come alyssa said you will protect me he cannot hide from you not here in my mansion this is our home and he the stranger i trust you with my life zusa dont let me down the terms arent so unfair zusa insisted bertram would have you agree i dont care let the watcher try he dies tonight and so the day had droned on alyssa with less and less patience with the relatives that had remained after the funeral preferring the safety of her mansion to their own homes bertram came to discuss the wedding but she ordered him away shed even been curt with arthur who had brought her a plate of food and a glass of wine you have eaten nothing all day hed said please take something you will feel better we have things we must discuss fearing he might bring up the subject of marriage or gods forbid propose right there holding a plate of bread boiled potatoes and cabbage she told him to get out a bit of his caring demeanor had faltered there and he stormed away you have no time left to be a little child hed told her before slamming the door shut already your immaturity overstays its welcome and you yours she screamed hurling the glass of wine hed left behind she wished zusa was there but shed vanished although promising to never be far if you know then you might reveal my presence the faceless woman had argued if you trust me then trust me trust the shadows to hold only me the night dragged on this time there were no fires to watch no men rushing up and down the streets just quiet it seemed eerie as if the city were suddenly waiting for something bertram had told her he feared terrible retribution from the guilds for her actions but so far it seemed none were coming or maybe one was coming in the name of the watcher alyssa doublechecked the lock to her room for the fourth time with nothing to read and nothing to do she sat down on her bed closed her eyes and wished she could sleep itd be so much better for her to die that way unable to feel the pain part of her expected just that to happen though another part was revolted by the sheer weakness involved in considering it she should be stronger better but she was so tired the gemcroft estate felt like chains attached to every inch of her body dragging her down pulling her into an exhausted pit where she could feel no emotion cry no tears and express no love it was in that pit arthur waited the sound of cracking glass startled her to a sitting position her heart leaping all the way up to her throat any calm she might have felt in accepting this fate vanished with the threat finally there a man was outside her window hanging from a rope the glass had cracked in a circle of veins from where his heel rammed into it she saw him kick off his momentum bringing him back into the glass this time it shattered and in rolled the watcher all cloaks and blades and shadows alyssa rolled off the bed in the direction opposite him hitting the ground with a thud she scampered toward the door a dagger flew and she felt a tug as it passed through strands of her hair before thudding into her locked door panic struck her and she spun to face her attacker lady gemcroft said the man and he bowed low as if in respect it seemed so comical coming from him her mouth dropped open ive come for an answer to my offer and for your sake i hope it different than what i last received she thought to lie or bargain or maybe just turn fling open the lock and hope she was faster than him even though she knew she wasnt shed die with a dagger in her back or maybe a saber in her neck with each step he took she took one back until she realized he was carefully guiding her away from the door if she were to flee she had to do it now either that or give in before she could choose either option the shadows above her shifted and out from the corner zusa leapt her cloak uncurling from about her body as if she were an insect emerging from a cocoon the watcher instead of retreating at the ambush rushed toward her alyssa dove out of the way and only when she landed did she realize shed done as the man hoped hed cut her off from the door from her knees she watched zusa and the watcher clash his sabers were longer than zusas daggers and he had the greater reach but it seemed to not matter alyssa had seen zusa leap naked into a river to fight a dark paladin of karak shed seen her fight through a crowd of mercenaries to bring her the head of her rapist shed never seen her fight like this sword and dagger clashed in a constant echo of noise sharp and painful in the closed room the watcher whirled his weapons a blur yet zusa met every move her body arched and weaved as if her bones were liquid and her balance relied on mental will alone alyssa tried to follow it with her eyes but could not over and over a saber would pass so close to her flesh shed wince expecting a shower of blood but it never happened alyssa someone shouted from the other side of the door something heavy thudded against it most likely a fist striking in a panic send my guards she screamed back returning to her wits another thud this heavier but the lock on her door was sturdy designed to hold out far more than a single man she desperately wished shed left it unlocked the watcher leapt side to side avoiding zusas thrusts and then spun about hiding his body with a sudden flourish of his cloak from within its folds she saw the glint of his sabers darting out with a quick slash from the chaos zusa retreated from it careful to keep herself between him and alyssa for a moment alyssa thought it might work if zusa could hold on until help arrived the man would have to retreat but then zusa cried out and blood splashed across the carpet alyssa felt her heart stop zusa continued fighting even as the wraps on her left arm soaked with blood could she fight through it for a few long moments she did zusa went on the offensive her whole body twisting into her thrusts giving her a reach beyond even the sabers this time the watcher fell back batting each thrust aside the contact ringing in alyssas ears their speedit was unreal at one point their weapons entangled looping and parrying in what could only be described as a lethal dance faster and faster they moved each refusing to give the other an inch of room the sound of their battle escalated and alyssa found herself clutching the carpet her whole body tense the second she saw another splatter of blood she would run for the door risks be damned but it was all bluster she saw the pain on zusas face and her heart broke the watchers foot struck her protectors chin and as she staggered back in sliced a saber cutting into her arm zusa dropped one of her daggers and suddenly at a disadvantage she could not hold him back his assault came vicious and quick another thin cut opened on her leg the slash so quick alyssa never even saw it fists and knees slammed into zusa and she rolled with them rollingaway from the door she was granting her a way out sacrificing her body her life to do it the watcher kicked her again hard in the throat as she fell back he descended upon her a saber tip pressing against her chest just above her heart his elbow trapped the arm still wielding a dagger the rest of his weight pressing against her waist to keep her from moving why do you hunt me she heard him ask zusa it seemed so strange to her to hear him wonder but she dared not think of it she wouldnt allow zusa to die for nothing with her fall alyssa knew there was no way for her to escape men shouted from the other side of the door but they were yet to begin breaking it in at least she could accomplish something with her death at least she could reward such a loyal servant for all she had done wait alyssa screamed before she might lose her courage take me but let her live the watcher looked over to her a quick glance before returning his gaze back to zusa who even in such a state remained dangerous why he asked why would you kill yourself i offered you a chance to end all this are you so vain that you would rather die than work with men such as me all of veldaren suffers and i offer a chance to save it i never read your offer i could never agree not after what youve done now take my life and spare hers what ive done he asked and he sounded genuinely perplexed her son zusa said her voice hoarse from the kick you killed her son then scrawled your name in the dirt with his blood the watcher looked taken aback his eyes glanced between them when something heavy thudded against the door his body tensed when he asked his voice soft weeks ago on the road north to tyneham using one of his sabers he pushed the final dagger free from zusas hand then stood murderer of children he whispered as if finally understanding something i know what child you speak of five years old perhaps six red hair he lives lady gemcroft i saved him though he was wounded and with fever i left him in the care of a family and paid them well to protect him alyssa shook her head he had to be lying it didnt make any sense why she asked how the caravan was attacked i came upon an ambush of a caravan but not by thieves they were men wearing the same insignia a sickle held before a mountain your boy was the target i never learned his name but the caravan contained crates of gold bearing your familys crest they were smuggling it in to the serpent guild though why i do not know it was too much that crest that was hadfields family crest could he have attacked mark attacked nathaniel but why would the watcher lie he could easily kill her and zusa and besides shed seen her sons bodyhis burned arthur claimed to have found the body zusa said as if she too were following her thinking his men brought it back his men found the caravan mark your lover nathaniel your heir as the door to her room cracked the hinges wincing in protest she saw the watcher tighten the muscles in his body he was preparing an action time was nearing its end she couldnt stall she had to make a decision the one that felt right if you did save my son you have my most sincere gratitude she said ill agree to your terms zusa told me they were fair and i trust her but if find this to be a lie i will bring the wrath of the entire trifect down upon you the watcher grinned at the threat i have a date with the serpents so i must be going ill keep your threat in mind he turned to the window and ran leaping out as if a madman then she saw him catch the rope still hanging and like a spider he zipped back up toward the roof and beyond her line of sight zusa gingerly rose to her feet holding her bleeding arm with her hand you know what you must do she said and alyssa nodded enough she shouted to the men trying to break down her door stand back hes gone zusa went over and unlocked the door guards spilled in their weapons drawn as if they refused to believe her one checked underneath her bed while several others looked out from the window and swore are you all right asked bertram pushing through them and hugging her im fine she said its zusa who was hurt thats all bertram didnt even glance the faceless womans way thank the gods i wish you would spend the night with the rest of the guards it was folly to remain in here alone in the first place i said ill be fine im safe here if not for a bit of a draft she tried to smile but her hands were shaking and her smile trembled on her lips and the night wasnt done just yet leave me she told her guards trust me i will be safe the men grumbled and they looked nonetoohappy but she was their employer and grumble was all they could do bertram waited until the rest were gone before bowing is there anything else you need from me he asked send for arthur i need his comfort of course most understandable when he was gone she looked to zusa how bad are your wounds i have suffered worse youre bleeding all over my expensive carpet zusa smiled then suddenly let out a rare laugh i guess i am alyssa walked to the door stopped and outstretched her hand zusa put her dagger into it and folded her fingers closed tell arthur to meet me in the gardens she said ill be waiting at nathaniels grave she hurried out her room and down the hallways every twist and turn was second nature to her and she managed her way out to the darkness without alerting any of her guards or more importantly arthurs mercenaries in her garden behind the mansion she felt the cold air bite into her skin felt the moonlight shine down upon her a few minutes later arthur arrived his arms crossed over his chest to keep in his warmth she turned and kept her hands folded behind her back the hilt like ice in her fingers are you safe my dear arthur asked immediately wrapping her in his arms i only heard the commotion at its end and bertram found me before i could dress alyssa smiled at him but when he went to kiss her she tilted her head away her eyes falling upon the grave marked by a stone angel the lettering at its feet reading nathaniel gemcroft i just want to ask you something first she said her hands still behind her as if she were shy anything she looked into his eyes watching his every reaction whose body is truly in this grave the hour was late and arthur had not the slightest reason to expect the question he paused and for one second she saw the guilt in his eyes and the fear what replaced them was cold cruelty without a word he lunged for her throat with his hands before they could close around her she stabbed him with zusas dagger as his blood spilled across her hands he looked at her with wideeyed shock she could almost read his thoughts as they flashed over him this cant be happening not to me not when i played this so perfectly she twisted the dagger taking pleasure in the pain that crossed his face i wish i could make it hurt worse she whispered into his ear as if they were still lovers and then his body collapsed and she stepped out of the way letting go of the dagger she stood there breathing heavily and watched the blood mix with the soil when zusa arrived moments later alyssa did her best to smile at least i didnt stain the carpet she said but her smile was forced and tears ran down her face zusa put her arms on her shoulders and kissed her forehead thank you she said for what for willing to sacrifice yourself for me she gestured to the body what do you want me to do with him hide him for now until we know how arthurs mercenaries will react but firstthe watchers planwill it work zusa shrugged its possible hell have difficulty doing it alone i cant do this anymore zusa if nathaniels still alive i want him here with me i want him safe go with the watcher help him against the serpents but the serpents only i wont help him harm a member of the trifect but for at least one more night perhaps i can bring revenge on the guilds that have harmed us so they stole from me them and arthur bring ruin upon them as they deserve as you wish milady zusa said despite the wounds on her body she offered no protest dragging arthurs body by the arm she hid him behind a row of rosebushes currently nothing but thorns and brown stems ill inform bertram the faceless woman said cleaning her dagger hell need to replace arthur and perhaps much of the hadfield family in their rule over our mines if he acts quickly we might find that which was stolen thank you i could use a moments peace until then zusa returned to the house and alyssa followed their paths branched she to her room zusa to bertrams once back she collapsed on her bed eager for the night to be over doubt gnawed at her and she hoped shed done the right thing at least in time shed know for sure if nathaniel lived then everything would be justified everything would be made better she thought of the carnage and chaos shed unleashed upon the city all in a desire for vengeance only for it to be arthurs doing not the thieves not directly anyway though it seemed the serpent guild had a hand in it hopefully the gods might forgive her the door opened and in stepped bertram not surprisingly he looked rather upset i can scarcely believe what zusa told me he said is it true did you kill arthur i did and i was right in doing so the old man locked the door then placed his head against the wood as if he needed its support to remain standing he was our last hope he said weve squandered our wealth on mercenaries destroyed the gemcrofts reputation and now you ruin the only chance of bringing back any respectability to our name why he turned to her and the look in his eyes sent a chill running through her spine bertram she asked sliding her legs underneath her why did you lock the door the old advisor pulled out a dagger from his bed robes for a moment his cold rage turned to pity and she wasnt sure which infuriated her more you had such potential he said stepping toward her instead youve denied your duties youve led us to ruin destroying everything ive worked my entire life for if theres any hope for us now it is someone anyone taking over including you he looked insulted by the notion i do this for the legacy of your entire family generations before and generations yet to come not myself never for myself i hope you understand he lunged for her and she rolled to the side compared to zusa or the watcher he was slow but she had no weapon no dagger or club she grabbed the sheets as she hit the ground beside her bed and flung them at bertram help she screamed as she circled around putting the broken window to her back bertram shoved the blankets aside his dagger catching momentarily on them he was between her and the door and she thought to run past while he was entangled but it wasnt a long enough distraction he stepped over the sheets his eyes locked onto her watching waiting for the slightest twitch so he might react for an old man he seemed reenergized his movements carrying purpose it wont matter he said you will be gone by the time they arrive and even if they execute me ill have removed the sickness within our house she thought of nathaniel of arthur and of bertrams insistence on marriage deep inside she wondered just how involved hed been with those events and the anger that burned within gave her the courage to do what she might never have done otherwise when he stabbed for her chest she didnt dodge instead she flung herself at him twisting to one side in hopes of avoiding the blow the edge slashed her flesh the pain almost unbearable but her mind was full of fury and adrenaline her left hand grabbed his arm so he couldnt stab again the other clutching the front of his robes she might have lacked the strength of a man but bertram was old and thin with a mindless cry she flung him behind her toward the shattered window where many shards still remained he cried out once a surprised yelp that ended in a painful shriek still trembling with rage she watched as blood poured across the glass hed been impaled by one of the thick shards the pointed edge digging deep into the flesh below his throat bertram tried to suck in another breath but it came in gargled and wet his arms flailed uselessly at his side slicing his hands as he grabbed more shards trying to push himself off the window behind her the door broke as her guards smashed it open they poured in once more and this time they did not allow her to resist as they took her by the hand and led her out she looked back only once to make sure bertram was still there still bleeding the sickness within her house she thought bertram was right at last it had been removed and then she broke down and cried the main quarters for the serpents were unsurprisingly empty when haern searched them given what he knew of william ket their leader they would not dismiss him as lightly as the others william took every threat seriously and he dealt with them as harshly as possible kadish was a gambler a drinker and a man too proud to stop celebrating when he should have been in hiding william was easily the opposite and would therefore be far more difficult of course haern knew where theyd go theyd retreated there several times usually after one of the guilds engaged them in a skirmish over territory unlike their main guildhouse this one was smaller with only a single door and no windows it had once been the armory for the city guards stationed deep in the south of veldaren before the king had repositioned them farther north and sold the building on his way there haern checked the cut on his side hed hid it from lady gemcroft and her frightening female guard though the guard might have noticed given her incredible skill it was shallow a flesh wound along his ribs it was bleeding though as such cuts liked to do pausing to catch his breath he leaned against the wall of a smithy and drew one of his sabers something tells me youll get reopened a dozen times tonight he said as he cut the edge of a cloak to make a bandage it reminded him of trying to bandage that boys arm while out in the snow at least he knew who he was now nathaniel gemcroft no wonder hed been a target of course who it had been and why was no real concern the serpents were assuming deathmask handled the spider guild like he said he would the serpents were the only guild left to be dealt with one way or another a shadow shifted in the corner of his eye elongated in a way that was unnatural to the moonlight his mind cried out in alarm and he dropped to one knee just in time a crossbow bolt smacked into the wood behind him and then ricocheted off haern drew both his sabers as he rushed toward the main street where the buildings would be further apart and hed have more room to dodge some finelyhoned instinct in him lifted the hairs on his neck he slid as he heard the twang of two more crossbows bolts flew above him striking the ground harmlessly at least three attackers he realized given the how close together theyd fired not good back on his feet in a heartbeat he continued running relying on the slow reloading of a crossbow to give him time his way was blocked however a man in the cloak of a serpent landed before him his dagger already drawn damn fool the serpent said same to you he crashed right into him positioning his sabers so they pushed the tip of his opponents dagger to the side haerns forehead rammed the serpents nose blood splattered across them both blinding an eye trying to ignore the pain haern rolled atop him and into the wide street beyond when he spun he saw bolts flying in one missed a second passed an inch from his leg as he dodged to one side the third thudded into his side and he gasped at the impact if not for his dodge it would have found the bottom of his throat is it poisoned he wondered but he dismissed the thought poison wouldnt matter if several more buried their tips into something vital the man hed rammed struggled to his feet and haern reacted on instinct he knew he needed to get away from the men with the crossbows but he also couldnt leave an opponent free to chase he lunged slashed away the serpents pitiful defense and then cut his throat as he bled out haern dove around a corner a single bolt fired after him missing by a foot and then he was running he sheathed one of his sabers so he could wipe at the blood in his eye then glanced back three serpents leapt after him two men and a woman their green cloaks trailing the color an eerie haze in the moonlight he crossed to the other side of the street giving them no choice but to climb down again he made a decision this one more on pride than rational thinking theyd hurt him maybe even poisoned him they had to pay his reputation was all that would hold this arrangement together with the guilds and trifect if they felt they could wound him make him run then all would be for naught come on he shouted slamming his sabers together before charging the three had abandoned their crossbows on the rooftop so they could climb down and all of them drew shortswords as he charged they formed a triangle trapping him in the center he grinned at the maneuver clever but it was too late to change his mind his tactics however he could change instead of lunging at the first as they thought he spun in place beginning his cloakdance his feet twisted and spun pushed to the very limits of his speed he relied fully on instinct for what his eyes saw through his cloaks were but snippets of his opponents thrust after thrust he smacked away until one overextended confused as to where he actually was within the cloaks haern broke out from the spin doubleslashing his arm down went the weapon as blood spilled and the serpent screamed back into the dance but just a moment just long enough to confuse the remaining two no time left to mess around the pain in his side was escalating and his fingers tingled assaulting the nearest he unleashed a furious display his swords weaving around the womans shortsword as if it were motionless he spun as he cut her whirling toward the last serpent in a single smooth motion the thief blocked only one of the two sabers the other taking his life damn it haern said pausing to catch his breath he gingerly touched the bolt in his side wincing as his fingers made it move the slightest bit too deep hed have to push it through and pray thered been no poison before he could he heard movement above too late he brought up his sabers but instead of the expected bolt a single serpent fell bleeding to the ground crumpling in a heap from the rooftop zusa waved at him the one you dont see is the one that kills you she called down to him despite his exhaustion he gave her a smile why are you here he asked as she climbed down to the street milady wishes the serpents punished and so ive come to help you clearly you need it he gestured to the bolt in his side clearly without giving him warning she stepped forward grabbed the shaft and pushed he clenched his jaw and ground his teeth together to hold in his scream warm blood dripped down the small of his back zusa pushed aside his cloak retrieved the bolt and then held it close to her eyes so she might see in the moonlight not poisoned she said either one of the gods favors you or they were too stupid and lazy to prepare for you properly perhaps both he grinned at her but the grin faltered sorry about your arm sorry about your chest so she had noticed he chuckled if i stumble from the blood loss make sure you kill me im not sure who would be happiest to torture me but id rather not find out theyd probably auction the right more money arent you a cheery soul he pointed further down the street come on the armory isnt far he led the way zusa trailing behind him like a feminine version of his own shadow silent as ghosts they crisscrossed their way toward their goal haern checked the alleys and zusa the rooftops for any more potential ambushes at the armory they stopped and peered around the corner of a nearby home no guards on the outside zusa whispered that would give them away they think this place is safe otherwise they wouldnt come here nowhere is safe in this city well haern said drawing his sabers lets go reinforce that lesson for them how many entrances he thought for a moment then held up a single finger they boarded up their windows together through the door no mercy zusa can you handle that she gave him a look that showed how insulted she was i was raised in the heart of karaks temple she said mercy is not my bedfellow as if to prove the point she rushed ahead and silently cursing her he followed the door was locked but when haern went to draw his lockpickers kit she only shook her head she mouthed something to him but he only caught half the words she wanted to try something though that much he understood putting her hands on the lock she closed her eyes and to him it looked like she was praying shadows slipped off her fingertips like water dripping from a melting wedge of ice a moment later they both heard an audible click from within the lock her balance wavered but when she caught it she shot him a wink haern rolled his eyes ladies first he said loud enough to spur her into action she flung open the door and in he followed two deadly specters in the night a single serpent waited on guard looking halfawake they cut his throat as they rushed past he never even had chance to cry out alarm they bashed through a door and into an elaborate room one that instantly felt familiar to haern it was like so many others of the posh headquarters the guilds created all curtains and pillows alcohol and sex their first warning something was wrong came when the door behind them slammed shut the second was when william ket greeted them with a warm smile from his chair on the far side of the room well well well is it not the watcher he said sounding far too pleased with himself and youve brought a friend excellent did you think id be foolish enough to think you couldnt find me here not with yourstoried reputation the curtains zusa whispered her body tensed like a cat before a pounce i know williams grin spread alyssa called off her mercenaries the silly girl she had us on the run but then suddenly she flooded veldaren with bored unemployed men with a penchant for violence how could i not take advantage of such a gift the curtains pushed aside revealing armored men standing in every little alcove haern estimated at least thirty he felt his blood run cold so this would be how it ended his side ached every breath hurt his chest his head pounded from exhaustion and standing before him william ket laughed dont you give in zusa whispered her voice almost a hiss they are children to you you understand we are the lions we are the hunters haern thought of his moment in karaks temple when hed been in the very presence of the lion of karak it had roared and hed gazed into an emptiness that seemed to go on forever he remembered the terror and he realized that hed been far more afraid then than he was now focusing upon that fear he knew he could be that lion to these men he looked at them as they waited for the order to attack let them see into his eyes that same emptiness that same certainty of their death pulling his hood low he let the shadows of the torchlight scatter his features beside him zusa wrapped her cloak tight about her body and then hunched low kill them william said haern went left zusa right he felt every nerve in his body firing and he gave in to his instincts completely this was the beast thren had created over the years day in and day out with training practice lectures and tutors this was the monster whose teeth had been sharpened by half a decade skulking in the shadows slaughtering the thieves of the night his sabers were a blur as he cut down the first the mercenarys axe too slow to block the two closest rushed in wielding longswords he parried their thrusts which felt slow as if his opponents fought in molasses blood soaked his sabers as the rest came rushing in swinging with their clubs maces and swords cutting twisting never staying in the same place as his feet shifted and turned he thought of the hours hed been forced to stand in strange stances to pacify a tutor as he curled his body around thrusts he remembered the complicated stretches another tutor had taught him to do every morning as he slashed and dodged he thought of the words of his father they cant kill you until you let them that is why you must be better that is why you must be perfect never ever let them think they can win said to an elevenyearold boy more than anything he wished his father could be there to see what he had created one after another the mercenaries fell they knew how to bully they knew how to put the strength of their arms into their blows and they could handle the rudimentary thrusts and parries of the battlefield but haern felt himself beyond them beyond anything they scored cuts on him to be sure but he felt the pain in a distant place locked in the back of his mind they would not kill him he would not let them his wrist might bleed from a lucky stab of a sword his chest might ache from where a club struck him before he could dodge his eyes might sting from blood running into them from where a blade slashed his forehead but they would not kill him zusas cry pulled him back from the animal from the mindless killer despite the many dead she was overwhelmed refusing to give the thieves anything haern descended upon them their backs were turned to him and he thrust and stabbed and kicked shoving them aside so he might link up with zusa she was bleeding and so was he but they grinned we were made for this he thought back to back they turned to their foes of the original thirty only ten remained blood and gore soaked the floor where it wasnt covered by a body the psychological damage was just as bad none looked ready to attack whatever they had been paid it wasnt enough the first turned to flee and as if breaking a dam the rest rushed for the door ignoring them haern looked for william not finding him where is he he asked zusa rushed to the chair hed been sitting in and flung it aside hidden behind it she found a ring and pulled revealing a trapdoor haern followed her as the mercenaries broke down the door behind them and poured out into the night the trapdoor led to a tunnel tight enough that haern had to crawl along on his elbows worming his way through it wasnt a long tunnel and zusa pushed open another trapdoor and then helped him out theyd emerged behind the armory the trapdoor hidden by a compacted layer of dirt haern felt his muscles aching the familiar feeling of receding adrenaline coming over him hed expected to search for william to have to hunt for wherever hed run off to but instead saw him laying dead in the street two men standing over him you look like shit senke said still cleaning williams blood off his mace haern tried to think of a response but his mind only stared dumbly at him and tarlak who looked vaguely amused by the whole ordeal delysia spent the better part of tonight begging us to help you he said his arms crossed and as usual i finally gave in how he asked he meant to ask how they had found him but breathing suddenly seemed difficult his body was finally taking account of all the blows and cuts hed received and it wasnt happy what find you tarlak asked im a wizard thats just what i do haern saw zusa down on one knee bracing herself with one of her arms her dark skin was disturbingly pale are you hurt he asked stepping to her side of course i am she said farewell watcher i have done as my mistress asked let your friends help you from now on she rose to her feet took an uneasy step then another and by the time she was running her balance looked like it had returned haern watched her go hoping shed be all right so tarlak said smacking him on the back whats next on the agenda haern looked back at the body of william ket and he mentally checked another off the list in his head one left just one leon connington senke whistled going after the big dogs are we who else after that haern shook his head hes the last everyone else has agreed or he gestured toward the body the last tarlak laughed arent you a freak well lets go leons not exactly close to here they walked down the street and for a moment haern let himself relax with the three of them one a wizard any thieves would have to be incredibly brave or reckless to consider an ambush he used his shirt to wipe the blood from his forehead then pressed it against his eyes they watered but when he pulled away he could see better senke twirled his two maces in his hands and haern wished he could feel as energetic as senke looked he might have just been the lion but now he felt like a lamb ready to give up everything just to lie down and sleep every single part of his body ached how long until dawn he asked about two hours said tarlak you been at this the whole night just before sunset yes we of the magical profession call that biting off more than you can chew and we of the stabby profession call that getting yourself killed said senke haern winced as an awkward step flared pain along his chest and to his back you two are such wonderful help he muttered leon conningtons estate was one of the most wellguarded places in the city and all three of them knew it the warning letter haern sent certainly hadnt given them reason to slack off either tall stone walls surrounded the mansion the single opening a thick iron gate with two guards they stood at attention no slacking there either from far down the road they observed the gate and planned there will be mercenaries stationed throughout the mansion haern said as they stared and traps along the ground other than the path leading directly to the door if were to get to leon i think well need to be stealthy about this stealthy asked tarlak he gestured to his bright yellow robes stealthy haern gave him a dumb look then shrugged any other ideas the wizard lifted his arms high and a steady stream of magical incantations slipped from his lips fire burst about his hands growing growing and then soaring toward the gate as an enormous ball it hit the iron and detonated blasting the gates aside and tearing off chunks of stone haern didnt see what happened to the guards and he didnt want to think about that either stealthy said tarlak hurling a smaller ball of fire that rolled across the ground it detonated the various traps along the grass leading toward the mansion filling the night with the sound of their explosions haern didnt know whether he should laugh or cry stealthy he asked senke who only shrugged tarlak sent on more blast this one aimed at the front door he frowned as the spell evaporated into smoke just before contact he sent another at a window this a thick shard of ice again it broke this time into water that showered the ground harmlessly strong wards the wizard said looks like the rest is up to you have fun senke led the way haern following out of his damn mind haern muttered tarlak watched them go offering a prayer for luck he wished he could help but the few spells hed cast had put a deep ache in his head and he knew he had but a few more before hed be worthless unable to help it though he neared the gates to observe his handiwork getting better he said estimating the size of the explosion tarlak eschaton he turned and with mild surprise saw the giant man with the painted face approaching from down the street im thrilled we could meet again he said especially with my mouth ungagged ghost pointed toward the mansion is the watcher inside he is tarlak said standing in the center of the gate hes a bit busy right now so youll have to wait until tomorrow to resume whatever grudge you have against him no grudge ghost said still approaching just money tarlak snapped his fingers summoning a spark of flame at his fingertips no closer he warned ghost only laughed well dont say i didnt warn you he slammed his hands together and a ring of fire rolled out from his waist burning the air with a heavy roar his opponent fell back and he landed on his shoulder so the fire could pass harmlessly above him tarlak gave him no reprieve another spell already on his lips this time it was ice thick shards that flew like arrows ghost rolled the shards shattering upon the ground behind him only one drew blood a thin gash along his side on a man so giant it looked like a cat scratch how long ghost roared back on his feet again and lunging tarlak tried to ignore him kept focused on the casting of his spell but he knew what ghost was implying how long might he last casting his spells how long until the well of energy within him ran empty and the best he could summon was a little puff of smoke from his fingertips given the pounding of his head he didnt think itd be long his hands clapped together and the space before him filled with a swirl of smoke and fire ghosts swords passed through it but his feet dug into the ground halting his momentum tarlak muttered hed hoped for a charred corpse to leap through how the abyss did this guy react so fast leaving the firewall intact he guessed a direction and pointed this time luck was with him for of the two directions ghost might have leapt hed chosen correctly a bolt of lightning shot from his finger striking the giant man square in the chest he fired a second one this one hitting his leg ghost screamed but more in anger than pain tarlak felt the hairs on his neck stand on end short of taking the mans head off it didnt look like thered be any way to stop him you hurt my friend tarlak said summoning small meteors of lava and flinging them ghost hunched on his knees blocking with his swords the meteors plinked off the steel coupled with an impressive but harmless shower of sparks you hurt my sister he said pressing his wrists together and hurling shards of stone from his palms ghost jumped and leapt like an enormous spider only two shards hit and again the wounds were superficial you even hurt brug his bolt of lightning shot out but his aim was off ghost didnt dodge this time instead lunging straight for the kill a sword slammed into him piercing his flesh tarlak gasped as the whitehot pain spread throughout his body i even hurt you ghost whispered his cheek pressed against the wizards out came the blade and tarlak collapsed unable to stop him he could only watch as ghost passed through the gates continuing the hunt for his real prey the blood flowed staining his yellow robes red his mind throbbing from pain and exhaustion he crawled across the ground bleeding upon the street as he headed for safety damn you haern he thought as he collapsed after hardly crossing any distance you better kill him for me or illill and then he felt his thoughts slipping away like leaves in a storm and unconsciousness came and took him deathmask knew he might be walking into an early grave but he didnt let worry show on his face not with the rest of his guild watching him keep an eye out for anything suspicious he said to the others i dont expect him to do anything stupid but it is thren felhorn after all stupid to us is step five of a plan for him they approached the headquarters of the spider guild it was more a mansion than anything else though careful examination would have shown how the windows were reinforced so no one could break through and all other doors but the front were boarded over two men in gray waited at the front and they drew their swords and daggers at his approach veliana glared at them but she remained quiet i am deathmask leader of the ash guild ive come to speak with thren only if thren says one said the other banged on the door a small window opened up and the guard relayed the message inside a few minutes later the door opened just him said one of the spiders from inside pointing to deathmask its all right he told veliana who looked ready to object i can handle myself he stepped inside the interior of the mansion might have once been welldecorated but nearly all its treasures had been plundered and sold off bright squares on the walls showed where paintings had once been and in many places the floor was scraped and dull as if the carpet atop it had been ripped up or a longstanding rug removed deathmask tracked the turns and doors to ensure he could find his way back all the while going over every bit of information he knew about the nearlegendary leader of the spider guild at last they reached a door and the thief gestured deathmask opened stepped inside and closed it behind him leaving him alone in a small den with thren felhorn thren looked old that was the first thing that struck him he knew the mans age still in his late forties but his hair was fully gray his skin had a tight stretched look about it but his eyes still shone with intensity he stood beside a fireplace a drink in hand his two shortswords hung at his side their hilts gleaming in the light he smiled at deathmask but it hid a strong sense of impatience and contempt thren surely knew the reason for his coming and was not pleased welcome thren said his voice was deep and the power in it impressed deathmask to no end he wished he had such a commanding voice as that the man could probably describe himself taking a shit and still have it sound authoritative ive heard rumors of your assuming control from garrick lowe not that there is much to assume what is it we say to the ladies its not the size of the sword but the skill in the wielding thren chuckled this was good if he could get the man to feel a sense of kinship things might go smoother maybe so but even i wouldnt assault a man with a spear wielding only a butter knife you know you would thren if the price was right youd cut the man three times before he knew where you were too the flattery didnt get him what he hoped thren waved a dismissive hand and set down his drink enough the night is late and you didnt come here to banter nor make introductions this is about that watcher madman isnt it i must admit i am curious to your thoughts on the deal deal deal this is no deal this is enslavement this is the king severing our testicles and selling them to the trifect do you know how this world works deathmask the strong take what the weak cannot hold and that is the proper order of things the foolish and the naive try to prop up the weak to protect them with strength that is not their own babes all of them nothing but babes forever suckling their mothers milk we would still make plenty of coin deathmask said and we have accepted protection money before is that not a way of the weak voluntarily giving up what they have to the strong never on this scale before thren insisted they dont just protect their own but the entire city what insanity led to this i have watched them bleed before me entire nations could live and die on the wealth i have taken from the trifects safes yet now they throw gold at me in a pitiful attempt to barter safety and peace of mind at least alyssa was willing to fight back though even that moment of pride lasted only two nights before cowardice returned no doubt replaced by this deal from the king deathmask saw an open bottle on a small stand and he walked over and poured himself a drink he sniffed it once and was pleased by the scent of strawberries thren didnt object so he took a drink and set it aside this is how i see it he said its been what ten years a man can only fight for so long even the greatest of us we need a break we need a return to some shred of normality says the man wearing a mask deathmask laughed relative normality then he watched thren carefully though he knew it was pointless the man could guard his emotions better than anyone probably better than even him with his mask on thren was watching him as well gauging his reactions staring into his eyes as if he could divine the true purpose of his visit this watcherhe claims hell kill everyone who refuses do you think hell succeed you and i are alive said thren it seems to me he is doing a poor job and it doesnt matter he could kill everyone but he wont kill me and as long as i survive the trifect will never have a moment of peace deathmask tapped his forehead with a finger as long as you are alivethats the clincher right there thren dont tense up im not here to kill you that wasnt a threat just a statement this war is yours solely yours and it is yours to end as you see fit but you wont have the ending youre hoping for the trifect is too big yes youve hurt it killed many and taken away their coin but has it mattered if an opponent is not allowed to surrender theyll keep fighting and fighting give them the option of defeat thats what this deal is if you look at it from their perspective they admit they cannot defeat you cannot protect themselves from you so they make it worth your while to instead do the protecting for them its a bribe nothing more nothing less and in a city where this is hardly an unusual circumstance thren looked tired of the debate and deathmask knew he was treading on thin ice hed lied when he said he hadnt come there to kill him at least partially could thren have read him correctly despite his best attempts otherwise more than anything he wanted a victory here without bloodshed other thief leaders could come and go but if thren died the trifect might decide it didnt need protection after all arent you tired of this he asked letting his voice soften every man and woman in this city has lost someone these past ten years despite the rumors i know you are human and lost as much as any for a moment so quick deathmask thought he might have imagined it thren allowed himself to look exhausted look torn with despair its for that loss i continue he said why else would i go on to accept anything less than total victory would be an insult not just to myself but my wife my he seemed to return to his senses and he glared at deathmask as if he were the reason for the sudden weakness i will not agree he said and if that is your sole purpose here get out now deathmask chuckled the slightest misstep might cost him his life but this was it this was the heart of everything that watcher i hear he is good almost impossibly good i also hear he fights like you did you know that as if he might be your own son but we both know that couldnt be he died in a fire of course im sure you saw his body he looked to thren letting the guildmaster know there was far more he wasnt telling no lie no bluff thren opened his mouth and then closed it those blue eyes barely moved what firestorm of thought must rage behind them deathmask wondered taking a deep breath he performed his wildest gambit if he succeeds the watcher will be a legend hell have beaten both the trifect and the thief guilds all in a single night hell have ended ten years of conflict with a stroke of his swords the entire city will fear him for he will be the kings watcher enforcer of the truce the night wont belong to us anymore itll belong to him he swallowed now or never take the risk hell have surpassed even you thren how amazing must that man be thren looked like a heavy burden had settled upon him his muscular frame wasnt quite so strong anymore the terrible will that had ruled him weakened and a million questions died unspoken on his lips for perhaps the first time ever thren felhorn looked uncertain did he send you here he finally asked deathmask nodded so be it give him his chance my guild will accept the terms so long as the watcher lives this city is a cruel one and even now it might have claimed him i doubt it deathmask said his heart pounding in his chest given who he is who made him come the morning well count the bodies and well see what remains of those in power i have a feeling though that tonight is when it all ends get out of here thren said and never speak a word of this to anyone or i will kill you deathmask bowed low as you wish he said glad the mask could hide his enormous smile more relieved than hed ever been in his life he exited the room weaved unguided through the halls and emerged from the mansion alive and victorious because of the breastplates the guards wore senke led the way his flanged maces able to punch through if swung hard enough haern followed watching behind them as much as ahead the entire mansion was in chaos servants fled every which way and several times he heard them cry out the name of a thief guild his lips curled into a vile grin every time no thief guild not this time they were worse than any guild theyd come live or die to complete their mission though so far it was only the guards that did the dying where might leon be hiding haern asked as he yanked his saber free from the armpit of a dead mercenary holed up in his bed senke suggested hes not the most mobile of men and where would that be senke gestured ahead and then behind them your guess is as good as mine the cries of intruder followed them as they rushed along they shoved servants aside if they got in the way but most were smart enough to cower or turn and run bottom floor haern said as they passed a set of stairs i cant imagine him climbing those every night as senke opened another door he slammed it immediately shut and on the other side arrows sunk into the wood with heavy thunks i think were getting somewhere senke said and he grinned they backtracked weaving through the natural flow of the building so they might curl around their ambushers sure enough they found them at the intersection of another hallway kneeling behind small overturned tables that had once housed vases of immeasurable wealth all three held crossbows and wore boiled leather armor senke crashed into two of them haern the third making quick work of them they turned left and continued along it should be harder than this insisted senke needing to shout to be heard over the commotion dont say it or it might come true the next hallway they met six mercenaries all wielding shortswords and small circular shields of wood latched together with iron senke laughed and rushed the six with wild glee as if he could see haerns glare behind him despite his exhaustion haern couldnt help but feel energized and he raced to his side so they might crash into the mercenaries in a single brutal collision every turn might house more men ready to kill them every door might hide archers ready to shoot a barb into their throats and neither could care less the shields proved difficult mostly because haern had little experience dealing with them it wasnt like a shield was standard issue for the men who stalked the night he kicked and stabbed as he and senke slammed into them cutting the tendons of one guards arm and tripping another before he could finish him off another was there and his saber slapped harmlessly against the wood not even drawing a splinter from the finely polished surface the soldier thrust for his midsection but haern parried it aside with his left hand leapt closer to the wall and then kicked off it to give the maneuver speed his saber crashed into the guards neck punching through the leather armor and into flesh swords stabbed for where he should have been but he dropped to the ground and rolled senke as if in some mental link with him saw and jumped over him blocking blow after blow with his maces haern leapt to his feet slamming his left shoulder against the wall to painfully kill the rest of his momentum only one guard remained within reach and haern desperately flung one of his sabers in the way the shortsword deflected and stabbed the wall close enough that haern could see his reflection in the blade and then his sabers were thrusting in and the shield could not block all of the attacks senke took down the last hammering his shield with his maces until the guard made a mistake not surprising given how the rest of his fellows had fallen and panic was surely crawling through his veins his sword slashed but he overextended and senke broke his elbow with an upward swipe of his mace a kick to his neck blasted him against the wall and he slid to the ground unconscious you hurt senke asked haern shook his head good one of those sons of bitches cut my leg delysias going to be pissed at me deeper and deeper in they went until at last they found leons bedroom it was empty slap me silly said senke looking around where could that giant tub of lard have gone off to he took a step forward not seeing the thin string laced across the door haern did and he pulled senke back by his cloak just before the entire room erupted in flame the fire swirled about in a momentary funnel before fading away leaving nothing but ashes inside the rest of the house safely intact a trap senke asked his eyes wide a fucking magical trap youre welcome haern said he leaned against the wall and closed his eyes wishing he could just order away the headache pounding in his forehead damn traps where to now he might have left haern and then what the fuck do we do stay calm he said eyes still closed he slept here until an alarm sounded because of your wizard friend and so he gets up activates the trap hes in a hurry but not moving fast the rest of his guards are ushering him along where do you go where is safe close and defensible you take him where no one could have gotten to yet where there couldnt possibly be an ambush waiting you take him to the mercenaries quarters haern opened his eyes and shot his mentor a wink good a guess as any in the back and away from the other quarters he wouldnt want their low class manners upsetting any of his privileged guests you going to make it haern worry about yourself they rushed along and this time haern pushed himself to the front despite the help this was still his task his responsibility if anyone should be springing traps it should be him but there was only one trap left and they sprung it together finding a long corridor leading to a thick set of doubledoors they rushed into it only to have doors behind them fling open out rushed mercenaries five in all leave them to me senke cried go after leon now haern accepted the order without delay he rushed toward those doors flinging out a leg to kick them open so he might go crashing in a frightening display of skill and strength his foot slammed into the door followed by the rest of him his whole body aching he realized the doors opened outward only feeling far more humble he grabbed a handle and pulled instead of a vicious display of skill and strength he walked inside a hurt calm exhausted man you said leon from the far side of the room rows of bunks were built into either side of the walls four personal guards stood before him forming a human wall of protection me haern said bowing low who is paying you for this leon asked sweat dripped down his thick neck and blotches covered his face to haern he looked like a pig overfed and then stuffed into fine clothing thren alyssa maybe the king tell me what did they offer you haern laughed he couldnt help it would leon even believe the truth could a man in his position understand there were things beyond wealth and influence could he understand a desire for atonement for a single moment of rest and relief from a life devoted to slaughter and revenge or would he just see a madman would he hear only nonsense and lies i do it because i want to he said figuring if there was anything leon might understand it was that and you dont have the ability to make me not want to last chance leon accept the terms or accept my blades neither youre just a rabid dog and my men will put you down two of the guards pulled out crossbows in a single smooth motion haern unclasped the cloaks from his neck and spun them into the air just before they pressed the triggers twisting behind the cover he made himself as small a target as possible the arrows punched holes through the cloaks and sailed on neither hitting flesh as the cloaks fell haern rushed the mercenaries his sabers feeling light as air in his hands just extensions of his body keen edges of his will this was it this was the last his night was done the men would die leon would die and he would have his truce the two abandoned their crossbows and drew swords falling behind the others who pushed ahead there was only enough space for two to stand side by side and even that was crammed haern used his greater mobility to his advantage weaving like a snake preparing to strike every thrust he smacked down and then struck with the other saber cutting thin slashes across their faces and necks each hit made them angrier until at last they tried rushing as one haern wrapped an arm around the post of a bunk whirling across the mattress and to the other side a whirlwind of steel he cut down both mercenaries from behind then turned on the other two who were unprepared for the sudden assault a third fell before lifting his sword into position and one versus one the last stood no chance he was only a sellsword and had maybe killed a handful of men in his lifetime haern had killed twenty just breaking into leons mansion when leon realized he was alone he fell to his knees and pleaded in his highpitched voice please youre a reasonable man you can listen yes ill pay you double triple whatever you were offered that deal of yours thats it right ill accept of course anything you want haern approached him his sabers dripping blood youre lying he said i see it in your eyes your lips your trembling hands besides im just a rabid dog he cut leons throat and he watched the life leave the fat mans eyes as the door behind him opened he dead he heard senke ask haern turned he wanted to smile but he felt exhausted and he knew getting out of the mansion might not be any easier than entering senke stood in the doorway and he seemed happy enough but something was wrong something was moving and then the sword pierced through the front of senkes chest the man arched back his eyes wide his limbs trembled and blood dribbled from his lips as his body collapsed slipping free of the blade haern was too stunned to even scream behind him now occupying the doorway stood ghost the white paint on his face speckled with wet blood his grin was as wide as senkes had been i found you watcher he said his deep voice rumbling in the confined room why haern asked it was the only question he seemed able to think why why now because i have a reputation to keep watcher ive been paid to kill you and so youll have to die its the way things work he lifted his swords into position and slowly as if in a dream haern did the same in the back of his mind he felt anger building and building like it belonged to someone else but would soon be given to him whether he wanted it or not you monster he said crouching into position monster i see one body at my feet watcher and five at yours how am i the monster what could he say to that that his kills had a pure motive that he wasnt motivated by greed the arguments felt hollow petty they were two killers and they eyed one another with an understanding so few could know then im the monster this city needs haern said but we dont need you ghost lunged no doubt hoping to catch him off guard while he talked haern was better than that though still his heart leapt in his chest how could the man be so huge and yet so fast with little ground behind him he refused to retreat his sabers met the swords and they rang with deafening volume haerns tired arms jolted with pain need ghost asked and his voice washed over him like a physical wave with every word he struck again hammering away at haern as if he were a door barring his way this city needs its eyes opened it needs its cowardly heart ripped from its chest and held up to the light it needs to see those it fears go beyond all possibilities what it does not need is some damn fool vigilante so fast were his movements and so strong haern could only twist and parry without hope of retaliation the few times he blocked he felt the impact travel all the way up his arm even at the peak of his skill he might have struggled to win now a full night without rest his nerves frayed his energy spent he had only one last desperate gasp to hold onto fueled by the corpse of senke slumped beside the door no he whispered a denial of everything before him of failing so close to his goal of letting senkes murderer go unpunished of succumbing to the anger in those brown eyes surrounded by paint and blood of dying no at the end of the room was a single large window and haern turned toward it running with a speed ghost could not hope to match he crossed his arms ducked his head and leapt through glass shattered and he felt its edges cut into his flesh it didnt matter hitting the ground he rolled then dug his heels into the earth he glared back at the window suppressed anger bursting free with a fire he felt sear his veins not caring for the blood not caring for the jagged edges still lodged in his arms and forehead he took two steps and leapt back through he caught ghost pulling up before the broken glass and his sabers slashed an x across his muscular chest their bodies collided haerns knee rammed into ghosts groin his forehead slammed the mans neck the glass lodged in his head tore skin blood ran free but several shards ripped into ghosts throat despite haerns momentum and surprise ghost refused to go down he held his ground matching haern fury for fury with no room to cut or thrust he punched haern in the chest with a hilt then caught his chin with a roundhouse feeling a tooth fly loose haern dropped to his knees and rolled forward his sabers slashed out cutting the tender flesh above ghosts heels the giant mans shriek rewarded his efforts but haern wasnt done tears filled his eyes born of pain both physical and from the torment of senkes corpse refusing to fade from his sight he kicked back into ghost stabbing his sabers again and again warm blood poured across his hands steel punctured lung liver heart ghost crumpled to his knees then fell upon a gorefilled smear atop the bare floor haern hovered over him one eye swollen shut the cut on his chest reopened his face rivulets of blood from cuts of glass his clothes equally soaked and then he screamed the saddened burdened victorious monster slowly the sane part of him returned he thought to carry senkes body to make sure they could bury him properly but he knew he lacked the energy limping over he knelt and kissed the mans forehead im sorry he whispered thinking of a distant memory he reached underneath senkes bloody shirt and retrieved a pendantthat of the golden mountain i hope youre with him now senke think well on me might not be long before i need you to plead my case to enter within he slipped the pendant over his neck sheathed his sabers and crawled out the window he stayed close to the house wary of any more traps at the front he followed the path the gateway was empty and dimly he wondered where tarlak had gone off to he stood there dumbly looking and then saw him two blocks down the street his yellow robes rather hard to miss as he approached he saw that tarlak slumped against a building had to get away the wizard said sounding drowsy just in case hejust in case he came back all across the front of his robes was an ominous circle of blood how bad haern asked kneeling beside him so he could check the wound not bad tarlak said his eyes drooping better than you from what i see wheres senke the name nearly made haern choke every last bit of his selfcontrol kept him speaking kept him moving he wont be coming back he said tarlak heard this went to ask something else then remained quiet tears fell from his eyes hell be with ashhur now he whispered come on haern said putting an arm around him to help support his weight we will too if we dont hurry i think theres about to be a lot of angry people on the street i think i agree they limped down the street and whether through luck or the grace of ashhur they made it to the crimson and delysias healing hands without any further trouble come the morning alyssa awoke feeling like her temples were ready to explode the dim light hurt her eyes and she covered them with an arm milady she heard someone say what is it she asked can it not wait forgive me milady my name is cecil glenhollow and i come with a message from lord john gandrem of felwood alyssa removed her arm and glared the knight stood over her looking a mixture of awkwardness and impatience she wondered what fool of her guard had let the man come to her especially with her so indecent she pulled her blankets tight about her and sat up whatever business you have it can wait she said have my servants prepare you some food and my guards will my lady said cecil it is about your son her mouth dropped open and then she saw the parchment in the knights hand she took it from him and unrolled it her eyes scanned not reading only looking for the one sentence that meant everything she missed it the first time but there it was just the second line of the entire thing i believe you will be pleased to know that contrary to what you have been told your son nathaniel is alive well and in my company alive she flung her arms around the knight and hugged him as tears wet her face thank you she whispered the knight stood shockedstill as if unsure what he might or might not do to avoid insult pulling back she kissed the mans scruffy cheek then rushed for her bedroom not caring that she wore only loose bedrobes youll take me to him she asked even as she exited the room but yesof course said cecil having to hurry to keep up alyssa couldnt believe how giddy she felt everything the watcher had said was true nathaniel was alive and now she could go to him could hold him could keep him close for the rest of his life as he grew into the man to lead her fortune nathaniel was alive no matter how many times she told it to herself it never lost its impact nathaniel was alive alive praise the gods alive when she arrived at her room cecil respectfully remained outside hurrying about alyssa opened a closet and ran outfit combinations through her head someone else knocked on the door and she told whoever it was to enter without a thought in stepped a younger man a distant cousin of hers named terrance his features were soft his reddishblond hair carefully trimmed he walked into her room trying to put on a somber face but he was clearly giddy with news when he saw the joy on her face his own lit up he must have thought shed be grieving arthurs loss she realized foolish man forgive me for the intrusion terrance said when i heard about bertramsbetrayal i went through his things im learning my fathers trade you see and he works with accounts and hurry it up alyssa said yanking off her robes and pulling a loose dress over her head the man flushed a deep red and he stammered a bit but he continued anyway rumors have it that you wouldnt be able to pay the mercenaries or to help with repairs bertram told my father anyway and several of the servants he saw the look she gave and so he skipped to the point thing is bertram was lying i found his ledger for the mercenaries payments and it only comes to a third of your current wealth expensive to be sure but not near what he she kissed the man laughed and then tied a sash about her waist before flinging open another closet and searching for a thick enough coat for the ride north i need a replacement for bertram she said and i have no time to search for one so youll have to do terrance his jaw nearly hit the floor me but im still an apprentice and my father says i cant own my own store until i reach my twentieth year to try and manage all this well you start today but why where are you going alyssa laughed again im going to get my son matthew pensfield felt the first twinges of consciousness pulling at him and he resisted dull aches felt like the only welcome awaiting him his gradual awareness thawed from whatever cold sleep itd fallen into and he remembered fighting protecting the boy tristan or was it nathaniel and how was he alive he was alive right his eyes fluttered open and there in front of him sat the boy with two names his head in his hands as he stared at the floor tristan matthew asked his voice coming out like a strained croak the boy startled but his surprise didnt last long a smile spread across his young face and it lit up his eyes youre awake he said i reckon so tristan hugged him eliciting a cough it felt like half his body was full of fluid the other half aches he tried rolling over in bed was denied by a terrible spike of pain from his shoulder he glanced at it and saw an impressive amount of stitchwork in his flesh a bruise spread from the wound all the way across his chest cut that was right hed been cut down through the collarbone by that bastard at the castle gate what happened to him he asked who matthew grunted never mind youre alive and so am i so must have worked out fine lord gandrems said you should be treated as a hero that so tristan bobbed his head up and down matthew chuckled if this is how heroes feel count me out the plow fits me better than the sword he frowned tristan kept looking to the door and his smile never seemed to last long something the matter tristan well guess i should call you by your real name shouldnt i not much point in hiding who you are now the boy obviously looked embarrassed as if he wasnt sure how to respond you can call me tristan still if you want sir i guess ill let the habit linger least until i can get out of this damn bed what is the matter you look like youre expecting the executioner something about the way tristans face paled made him wonder what hed said wrong its nothing tristan said i just itsnothing im glad youre awake really glad matthews head felt groggy and stuffed with cotton but he pushed through to see his surroundings better and to make sense of them he was in a small room with stone walls a single red carpet and a large bed with sheets stained with what must have been his blood tristan wore fine clothing far beyond anything matthew could have afforded at his farm house before that haern guy dumped a pile of gold in their hands anyway it didnt look like everyday attire but then again he was hardly knowledgeable about the ways of courts and castles they treating you well he asked yes said tristan something bothering you he looked once more to the door is itis it all right if we just talk for a while matthew smiled sure son you care about what when he shook his head matthew began discussing his plans for the farm he prattled on about cattle where he bought his pigs and how if he ever should get into the business in the north to never ever buy from the utters in the middle of winter unless he wanted to bend over and let them have their way with him tristan remained silent but it seemed as if the tension drained out of him until at last his eyes sparkled and he laughed at what few lame stories matthew had to tell every bit of that tension returned though when lord gandrem stepped into the room milord matthew said tilting his head to show his respect getting up and bowing was obviously out of the question im pleased to see you well the lord said though his voice hardly carried much pleasure youll be rewarded handsomely for protecting young nathaniel here once i found someone who recognized you i sent a rider to inform your loved ones of your stay in my care thank you milord said matthew my wife will much appreciate knowing rest matthew and when youre better we can discuss giving you appropriate compensation for now i must borrow nathaniel we have matters to attend ill talk to you tonight matthew told nathaniel right now i feel like eating a little and then sleeping for a while so dont worry about me they left and servants arrived immediately after carrying bowls of soup and bread and changes of clothing while they buzzed about matthew thought of nathaniel and he offered him a prayer for whatever trial seemed to await him nathaniel followed after lord gandrem feeling like an obedient dog the thought was unfair for he had been treated absurdly well but already he heard the murmuring of the crowd as they climbed the stairs toward the front wall of the castle the sunlight was glaring when they emerged and the crowd of hundreds below cheered at their arrival four guards stood at either side of them upon the ramparts directly ahead atop a retractable plank of wood a long rope tied about his neck was the man named oric lord gandrem waved his greetings to the crowd gathered to watch the execution this man was a coward and a traitor he cried out to them he dared lie to the lord of the lands to mock the honor of felwood my allies he struck against this fiend this foul murderer even sought to coat his blade with the blood of children what fate does he deserve those gathered below howled for his hanging nathaniel heard their cries and shivered lord gandrem turned to him and beckoned him forth his feet feeling made of lead he approached orics face was covered with a black cloth and his hands were tied behind him but still he appeared dangerous hes bound and gagged john said seeing his hesitation and even if he werent you should not show fear the eyes of the people are upon you and more than anything they want certainty from those who rule their lives nathaniel nodded yes sir he said the older man guided him to where a lever waited connected to various gears and wheels that would drop the platform oric stood upon it was as tall as him and when he put his hand upon it he worried he might be too weak to move it this way said a nearby knight gesturing the direction for him to push hurling his weight upon it nathaniel felt the lever budge then lurch forward the crowd gasped and before he could look away lord gandrem took hold of his shoulder and forced him to watch oric fell the rope snapped taut but as he swung his feet still kicked a sickening groan floated up to them barely audible over the cheer of the crowd bastards neck didnt break said one of the knights just following orders said the man beside him john wanted to send a message the words flowed over him but nathaniel refused to give them any meaning instead he just watched as oric kicked gagged and swung from the castle wall johns hand holding him with strength frightening for his age remember this always he said to him this is the fate that should meet all who challenge you if you deny them this then you become as cowardly as they besides listen to that roar nathaniel listen to them cheer our people want blood crave it every dead man hanging is a man worse than them theyll spit on his corpse when we cut him down and theyll unite in a hatred of something they hardly even understand we are their lords we are their gods never deny them the spectacle they deserve so long as you believe your acts are just they will follow nathaniel nodded his head dizzy his stomach swinging side to side along with the convulsing body of oric epilogue haern found deathmask and his ash guild back in their hiding hole and they greeted him like a long lost friend behold the legend deathmask said but his laughter cut with dark humor gerands told me of the spider guilds acceptance haern said not wishing to waste any time as for the conningtons some old man named potts has assumed control while his relatives bicker and position themselves potts has also agreed to the terms only two guilds have refused but theyre both currently leaderless already we move in on their territory veliana said same for the spiders and the wolves whoever finally takes control will readily agree just to save themselves from a combined assault so this is it then haern said he looked to deathmask gerand will arrange a set of terms to distribute payments to be divided equally among the five guilds i imagine that much wealth will divide much better among you four than say the two hundred or so of the other guilds that thought had come to mind deathmask said grinning its going to be rough these next few days everyone will be testing limits seeing what they can get away with and if you are capable of holding things in line id say you normally could pull it off but right now you look like an animal after a carriage has rolled over it a few times ill be fine haern said and ill be watching you as closely as any other guild dont forget that deathmask laughed we arent allies watcher and i never intended to be keep your eye upon me all you want you wont find anything and your blades will never touch my skin go worry about those who truly present a danger to this truce well be here reaping the rewards haern bit back a retort and then left with much of his business done until nightfall he debated where to go in the end he went back to the closest thing he had to home on the crimson he found a wagon sitting in front of the eschatons place halfloaded with trivial things how none of it had been stolen yet seemed a miracle to him until he remembered the very truce hed just set up well that was a start he went to knock on the door but it flung open a tired surprised tarlak stood before him a pile of books in hand oh you he said ive come to save it haern im sure you did your absolute best and i doubt senke would have changed a thing well other than him dying he might havelook the offer still stands no speeches no apologies no nonsense requirements i bought a tower on the outskirts of the kings forest and i plan on making it a far better home than this dung hole you want to come be useful and grab a box haern stepped aside and tarlak set his things on the wagon glancing inside he saw brug packing up various smithy tools delysia helped him the two joking with each other in hushed tones he could see the redness in their eyes even from there but they were moving on best they knew how the priestess saw him and despite the loss of a friend she smiled and beckoned him inside why not haern said as tarlak came back to the door he stepped within grabbed a box and hoped that just perhaps the newly titled kings watcher might finally have a home
