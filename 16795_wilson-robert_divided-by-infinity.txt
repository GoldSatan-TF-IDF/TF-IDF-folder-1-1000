divided by infinity by robert charles wilson in the year after lorraines death i contemplated suicide six times contemplated it seriously i mean six times sat with the fat bottle of clonazepam within reaching distance six times failed to reach for it betrayed by some instinct for life or disgusted by my own weakness i cant say i wish i had succeeded because in all likelihood i did succeed on each and every occasion six deaths no not just six an infinite number times six there are greater and lesser infinities but i didnt know that then i was only sixty years old i had lived all my life in the city of toronto i worked thirtyfive years as a senior accountant for a great lakes cargo brokerage called steamships forwarding ltd and took an early retirement in not long before lorraine was diagnosed with the pancreatic cancer that killed her the following year back then she worked parttime in a harbord street usedbook shop called finders a short walk from the university district in a part of the city we both loved i still loved it even without lorraine though the gloss had dimmed considerably i lived there still in a utility apartment over an antique store and i often walked the neighborhooddown spadina into the candybright intricacies of chinatown or west to kensington foreign as a bengali marketplace where the smell of spices and ground coffee mingled with the stink of sunripened fish usually i avoided harbord street my grief was raw enough without the provocation of the bookstore and its awkward memories today however the sky was a radiant blue and the smell of spring blossoms and cut grass made the city seem threatless i walked east from kensington with a mesh bag filled with onions and havarti cheese and soon enough found myself on harbord street which had moved another notch upscale since the old days more restaurants now fewer macrobiotic shops the palm readers and bead shops banished for good and all but finders was still there it was a tarshingled victorian house converted for retail its hanging sign faded to illegibility a threelegged cat slumbered on the cracked concrete stoop i went in impulsively but also because the owner an old man by the name of oscar ziegler had sent an elaborate bouquet to lorraines funeral the previous year and i felt i owed him some acknowledgment according to lorraine he lived upstairs and never left the building the bookstore hadnt changed on the inside either since the last time i had seen it i didnt know it well the store was lorraines turf and as a rule i had left her to it but there was no obvious evidence that more than a year had passed since my last visit it was the kind of shop with so much musty stock and so few customers that it could have survived only under the most generous circumstancesno doubt ziegler owned the building and had found a way to finesse his property taxes the store was not a labor of love i suspected so much as an excuse for ziegler to indulge his packrat tendencies it was a full nest of books the walls were pineboard shelves floor to ceiling freestanding shelves divided the small interior into box canyons and dimly lit hedgerows the stock was old and not that im any judge largely trivial forgotten jazzage novels and belleslettres literary flotsam i stepped past cardboard boxes from which more books overflowed to the rear of the store where a cash desk had been wedged against the wall this was where for much of the last five years of her life lorraine had spent her weekday afternoons i wondered whether book dust was carcinogenic maybe she had been poisoned by the turgid air by the floating fragments of ivoried frank yerby novels vagrant molecules of peyton place and the man in the gray flannel suit someone else sat behind the desk now a different woman younger than lorraine though not what anyone would call young a babyboomer in denim overalls and a pair of eyeglasses that might have better suited the hubble space telescope shoulderlength hair gone gray and an ingratiating smile though there was something faintly haunted about the woman hi she said amiably anything i can help you find is oscar ziegler around her eyes widened uh mr ziegler hes upstairs but he doesnt usually like to be disturbed is he expecting you she seemed astonished at the possibility that ziegler would be expecting anyone or that anyone would want to see ziegler maybe it was a bad idea no i said i just dropped by on the chance you know my wife used to work here i see please dont bother him ill just browse for a while are you a book collector or hardly these days i read the newspaper the only books ive kept are old paperbacks not the sort of thing mr ziegler would stock youd be surprised mysteries chandler hammett john dickson carr because we have some firsts over by the stairs i used to read some mysteries mostly though it was science fiction i liked really you look more like a mystery reader theres a look she laughed tell you what science fiction we got a box of paperbacks in last week right over there under the ladder check it out and ill tell mr ziegler youre here uh my name is keller bill keller my wife was lorraine she held out her hand im deirdre just have a look ill be back in a jiff i wanted to stop her but didnt know how she went through a bead curtain and up a dim flight of stairs while i pulled a leathery cardboard box onto a chair seat and prepared for some dutiful timekilling certainly i didnt expect to find anything i wanted though i would probably have to buy something as the price of a courtesy call especially if ziegler was coaxed out of his lair to greet me but what i had told deirdre was true though i had been an eager reader in my youth i hadnt bought more than an occasional softcover since fiction is a young mans pastime i had ceased to be curious about other peoples lives much less other worlds still the box was full of fortyyearold softcover books ace and ballantine paperbacks mainly and it was nice to see the covers again the richard powers abstracts translucent bubbles on infinite plains or jack gaughan sketches angular and insectile titles rich with key words time space worlds infinity once i had loved this sort of thing and then amongst these faded jewels i found something i did not expect and another and another the bead curtain parted and ziegler entered the room he was a bulky man but he moved with the exaggerated caution of the frail a plastic tube emerged from his nose was taped to his cheek with a dirty bandaid and connected to an oxygen canister slung from his shoulder he hadnt shaved for a couple of days he wore what looked like a velveteen frock coat draped over a tshirt and a pair of pinstriped pajama bottoms his hair what remained of it was feathery and white his skin was the color of thriftshop tupperware despite his appearance he gave me a wide grin mr ziegler i said im bill keller i dont know if you remember he thrust his pudgy hand forward of course no need to explain terrible about lorraine i think of her often he turned to deirdre who emerged from the curtain behind him mr kellers wife he drew a labored breath died last year im sorry deirdre said she was a wonderful woman friendly by nature a joy of course death isnt final we all go on i believe each in his own way there was more of thisenough that i regretted stopping bybut i couldnt doubt zieglers sincerity despite his intimidating appearance there was something almost wilfully childlike about him a kind of embalmed innocence if that makes any sense he asked how i had been and what i had been doing i answered as cheerfully as i could and refrained from asking after his own health his cheeks reddened as he stood and i wondered if he shouldnt be sitting down but he seemed to be enjoying himself he eyed the five slender books id brought to the cash desk science fiction he said i wouldnt have taken you for a science fiction reader mr keller deirdre glanced at me told you so i havent been a steady reader for a long time i said but i found some interesting items the good old stuff ziegler gushed the pure quill does it strike you mr keller that we live every day in the science fiction of our youth i hadnt noticed there was a time when science seemed so sterile it didnt yield up the wonders we had been led to expect only a bleak lifeless solar system half dozen desert worlds baked or frozen take your pick and the gas giants great roaring seas of methane and ammonia i nodded politely but now ziegler exclaimed life on mars oceans under europa comets plunging into jupiter i see what you mean and here on earththe human genome cloned animals mindaltering drugs computer networks computer viruses he slapped his thigh i have a teflon hip if you can imagine such a thing pretty amazing i agreed though i hadnt thought much about any of this back when we read these books mr keller when we read heinlein or simak or edmond hamilton we longed to immerse ourselves in the strange the outre and nowwellhere we are he smiled breathlessly and summed up his thesis immersed in the strange all it takes is time just time shall i put these in a bag for you he bagged the books without looking at them when i fumbled out my wallet he raised his hand no charge this is for lorraine and to thank you for stopping by i couldnt argue and i admit i didnt want to draw his attention to the paperbacks in the petty fear that he might notice how unusual they were and refuse to part with them i took the paper bag from his parchment hand feeling faintly guilty perhaps youll come back he said id like to anytime ziegler said inching toward his bead curtain and the musty stairway behind it back into the cloying dark anything youre looking for i can help you find it crossing college street freighted with groceries i stepped into the path of a car a yellow hyundai racing a red light the driver swerved around me but it was a near thing the wheel wells brushed my trouser legs my heart stuttered a beat and i died perhaps a small infinity of times probabilities collapse i become increasingly unlikely immersed in the strange ziegler had said but had i ever wanted that really wanted that be careful lorraine told me one evening in the long month before she died amazingly she had seemed to think of it as my tragedy not hers dont despise life difficult advice did i despise life i think i did not that is there were times when the world seemed a pleasant enough place times when a cup of coffee and a morning in the sun seemed good enough reasons to continue to draw breath i remained capable of smiling at babies i was even able to look at an attractive young woman and feel a response more immediate than nostalgia but i missed lorraine terribly and we had never had children neither of us had any close living relations or much in the way of friends i was unemployed and unemployable confined forevermore within the contracting walls of my pension and our modest savings all the joy and much of the simple structure of my life had been leeched away and the future looked like more of the same a protracted fumble toward the grave if anything postponed the act of suicide it wasnt courage or principle but the daily trivia i would kill myself i decided more than once but not until after the nightly news not until i paid the electric bill not until i had taken my walk not until i solved the mystery id brought home from finders i wont describe the books in detail they looked more or less like others of their kind what was strange about them was that i didnt recognize them although this was a genre paperback science fiction of the s and s i had once known in intimate detail the shock was not just unfamiliarity since i might have missed any number of minor works by minor writers but these were major novels by wellknown names not retitled works or variant editions a single example i sat down that night with a book called the stone pillow by a writer whose identity any science fiction follower would instantly recognize it was a signet paperback circa with a cover by the artist paul lehr in the period style according to the credit slug the story had been serialized in astounding in the pages were browned at the margins the glued spine was brittle as bone china i handled the book carefully but i couldnt resist reading it and in so far as i was able to judge it was a plausible example of the late authors wellknown style and habits of thought i enjoyed it a great deal and went to bed convinced of its authenticity either i had missed it somehowin the days when not missing such things meant a great deal to meor it had slipped out of memory no other explanation presented itself one such item wouldnt have worried me but i had brought home four more volumes equally inexplicable chalk it up to age i thought or worse senility alzheimers either way a bad omen sleep was elusive the next logical step might have been to see a doctor instead the next morning i thumbed through the yellow pages for a usedbook dealer who specialized in period science fiction after a couple of calls i reached a young man named niemand who offered to evaluate the books if i brought them to him that afternoon i told him id be there by one if nothing else it was an excuse to prolong my life one more interminable day niemandhis store was an overheated secondstory loft over a noisy downtown streetgave the books a long thoughtful examination fake he said finally theyre fake fake you mean counterfeit if you like but thats stretching a point nobody counterfeits books even valuable books the idea is ludicrous i mean what do you do set up a press and go through all the work of producing a bound volume duplicate the type flaws and all and then flog it on the collectors market youd never recoup your expenses not even if you came up with a convincing gutenburg bible in the case of books like this the ideas doubly absurd maybe if they were oneoff from an abandoned print run or something but hell people would know about that nope sorry but these are just fake butwell obviously somebody did go to the trouble of faking them he nodded obviously its flawless work and it cant have been cheap and the books are genuinely old contemporary fakes maybe maybe some obsessive fan with a big disposable income rigging up books he wanted to exist are they valuable theyre certainly odd valuable not to me tell you the truth i kind of wish you hadnt brought them in why theyre creepy theyre too good kind of xfiles he gave me a sour grin make up your own science fiction story or live in it i said we live in the science fiction of our youth he pushed the books across his cluttered desk take em away mr keller and if you find out where they came from yes i really dont want to know items i noticed in the newspaper that evening gene therapy renders heart bypass obsolete bank of zurich first with quantum encryption seti researchers spot possible et radio source i didnt want to go back to ziegler not immediately it felt like admitting defeatlike looking up the answer to a magazine puzzle i couldnt solve but there was no obvious next step to take so i put the whole thing out of my mind or tried to watched television did laundry shined my shoes none of this pathetic sleight of hand provided the slightest distraction i was not just as i had told deirdre a mystery lover and i didnt love this mystery but it was a turbulence in the flow of the passing days therefore interesting when i had savored the strangeness of it to a satisfying degree i took myself in hand and carried the books back to finders meaning to demand an explanation oscar ziegler was expecting me the latemay weather was already too humid a bright sun bearing down from the ozonedepleted sky walking wasnt such a pleasure under the circumstances i arrived at finders plucking my shirt away from my body graceless the woman deirdre looked up from her niche at the rear of the store mr keller right she didnt seem especially pleased to see me i meant to ask if ziegler was available but she waved me off he said if you showed up you were to go on upstairs thats uh really unusual shouldnt you let him know im here really hes expecting you she waved at the bead curtain almost a challenge go on if you must the curtain made a sound like chattering teeth behind me the stairway was dim dust balls quivered on the risers and clung to the threadbare cocomat tread at the top was a door silted under so many layers of ancient paint that the molding had softened into gentle dunes ziegler opened the door and waved me in his room was lined with books he stepped back settled himself into an immense overstuffed easy chair and invited me to look at his collection but the titles at eye level were disappointing they were old cloth volumes of gurdjieff and ouspenski velikovsky and crowleythe usual pseudognostic spiritualist bullshit pardon my language like the room itself the books radiated dust and boredom i felt obscurely disappointed so this was oscar ziegler one more pathetic old man with a penchant for magic and cabalism between the books medical supplies inhalers oxygen tanks pill bottles ziegler might be old but his eyesight was still keen judging by the expression on your face you find my den distasteful not at all oh fess up mr keller youre too old to be polite and im too old to pretend i dont notice i gestured at the books i was never much for the occult thats understandable its claptrap really i keep those volumes for nostalgic reasons to be honest there was a time when i looked there for answers that time is long past i see now tell me why you came i showed him the softcover books told him how id taken them to niemand for a professional assessment confessed my own bafflement ziegler took the books into his lap he looked at them briefly and took a long drag from his oxygen mask he didnt seem especially impressed im hardly responsible for every volume that comes into the store of course not and im not complaining i just wondered if i knew where they came from if i could offer you a meaningful explanation basically yes well ziegler said well yes and no yes and no im sorry that is no i cant tell you precisely where they came from deirdre probably bought them from someone off the street cash or credit and i dont keep detailed records but it doesnt really matter doesnt it he took another lungful from the oxygen bottle oh it could have been anyone even if you tracked down the original vendorwhich i guarantee you wont be able to doyou wouldnt learn anything useful you dont seem especially surprised by this implying that i know more than im saying he smiled ruefully ive never been in this position before though youre right it doesnt surprise me did you know mr keller that i am immortal here we go i thought the pitch ziegler didnt care about the books i had come for an explanation he wanted to sell me a religion and you mr keller youre immortal too what was i doing here in this shabby place with this shabby old man there was nothing to say but i cant explain it ziegler went on that is not in the depth it deserves theres a volume hereill lend it to you he stood precariously and huffed across the room i looked at his books again while he rummaged for the volume in question below the precambrian deposits of the occult was a small sediment of literature first editions presumably valuable and not all familiar had ernest hemingway written a book called pamplona but here it was its scribners dust jacket protected in brittle mylar cromwell and company by charles dickens under the absolute by aldous huxley ah books ziegler smiling came up behind me they bob like corks on an ocean float between worlds messages in bottles this will tell you what you need to know the book he gave me was cheaply made with a utilitarian olivedrab jacket you will never die by one carl g soziere come back when youve read it i will i lied i had a feeling deirdre said youd come downstairs with one of those the soziere book youve heard of it not until i took this job mr ziegler gave me a copy but i speak from experience every once in a long while somebody comes in with a question or a complaint they go upstairs and they come back down with that at which point i realized i had left the paperbacks in zieglers room i suppose i could have gone back for them but it seemed somehow churlish but it was a loss not that i loved the books particularly but they were the only concrete evidence i had of the mysterythey were the mystery now ziegler had them back in his possession and i had you will never die it looks like a crank book oh it is deirdre said kind of a parallelworlds argument you know jw dunne and so on with some quantum physics thrown in actually im surprised a major publisher didnt pick it up youve read it im a sucker for that kind of thing if you want the truth dont tell me it changed your life i was smiling she smiled back it didnt even change my mind but there was an odd note of worry in her voice of course i read it deirdre was right about you will never die it had been published by some private or vanity press but the writing wasnt crude it was slick even witty in places and the argument was seductive shorn of the babble about planck radii and prigogine complexity and the dancing wuli masters it came down to this consciousness like matter like energy is preserved you are born not an individual but an infinity of individuals in an infinity of identical worlds consciousness your individual awareness is shared by this infinity of beings at birth or at conception soziere wasnt explicit this span of selves begins to divide as alternate possibilities are indulged or rejected the infant turns his head not to the left or to the right but both one infinity of worlds becomes two then four then eight and so on exponentially but the underlying essence of consciousness continues to connect all these disparate possibilities the upshot soziere says it all in his title you cannot die consider suppose tomorrow afternoon you walk in front of a speeding eighteenwheeler the grillwork snaps your neck and what remains of you is sausaged under the chassis do you die well yes an infinity of you does die but infinity is divisible by itself another infinity of you steps out of the path of the truck or didnt leave the house that day or recovers in hospital the youness of you doesnt die it simply continues to reside in those remnant selves an infinite set has been subtracted from infinity but what remains remains infinite the subjective experience is that the accident simply doesnt happen consider that bottle of clonazepam i keep beside the bed six times i reached for it meaning to kill myself six times stopped myself in the great wilderness of worlds i must have succeeded more often than i failed my cold and vomitstained corpse was carted off to whatever grave or urn awaits it and a few acquaintances briefly mourned but thats not me by definition you cant experience your own death death is the end of consciousness and consciousness persists in the language of physics consciousness is conserved i am the one who wakes up in the morning always every morning i dont die i just become increasingly unlikely i spent the next few days watching television folding laundry trimming my nailsspinning my wheels i tossed sozieres little tome into a corner and left it there and when i was done kidding myself i went to see deirdre i didnt even know her last name all i knew was that she had read sozieres book and remained skeptical of it and i was eager to have my own skepticism refreshed you think odd things sometimes when youre too often alone i caught deirdre on her lunch break ziegler didnt come downstairs to man the desk the store simply closed between noon and one every weekday the may heat wave had broken the sky was a soft deep blue the air balmy we sat at a sidewalk table outside a lunchandcoffee restaurant her full name was deirdre frank she was fifty and unmarried and had run her own retail business until some legal difficulty closed her down she was working at finders while she reorganized her life and she understood why i had come to her theres a couple of tests i apply she said whenever i read this kind of book first is it likely to improve anyones life which is a trickier question than it sounds any number of people will tell you they found happiness with the scientologists or the moonies or whatever but what that usually means is they narrowed their focusthey cant see past the bars of their cage okay you will never die isnt a cult book but i doubt it will make anybody a better person second is there any way to test the authors claims soziere aced that one beautifully i have to admit his argument is that theres no subjective experience of deathyour family might die your friends your gradeschool teachers the princess of wales but never you and in some other world you die and other people go on living how do you prove such a thing obviously you cant what soziere tries to do is infer it from quantum physics and lots of less respectable sources its a bubble theoryit floats over the landscape touching nothing i was probably blushing by this time deirdre said you took it seriously didnt you or half seriously half at most im not stupid but its an appealing idea her eyes widened appealing wellthere are people whove died people i miss i like to think of them going on somewhere even if it isnt a place i can reach she was aghast god no sozieres book isnt a fairy tale mr kellerits a horror story pardon me think about it at first it sounds like an invitation to suicide you dont like where you are put a pistol in your mouth and go somewhere elsesomewhere better maybe even if it is inherently less likely but take you for example youre what sixty years old or so well great you inhabit a universe where a healthy human being can obtain the age of sixty fine but what next maybe you wake up tomorrow morning and find out they cured cancer say or heart diseaseexcluding you from all the worlds where william keller dies of a colon tumor or an aneurism and then youre a hundred years old a hundred and twentydo you turn into some kind of freak so unlikely in sozieres sense that you end up in a circus or a research ward do they clone you a fresh body do you end up as some kind of halfhuman robot a brain in a bottle and in the meantime the world changes around you everything familiar is left behind you see others die maybe millions of others maybe the human race dies out or evolves into something else and you go on and on while the universe groans under the weight of your unlikeliness and theres no escape every death is just another rung up the ladder of weirdness and disorientation i hadnt thought of it that way yes the reductio ad absurdum of sozieres theory was a kind of relativistic paradox as the observers life grows more unlikely he perceives the world around him becoming proportionately more strange and down those unexplored narrow rivers of mortality might well lie a cannibal village or the temple of gold what if deirdre was too pessimistic what if among the all the unlikely worlds there was one in which lorraine had survived her cancer wouldnt that be worth waiting for worth looking for no matter how strange the consequences might be news items that night neural implants restore vision in fifteen patients telomerase cocktail creates immortal lab mice twinned neutron stars pose potential threat nasa says my sin was longing not grief grief isnt a sin and is anyway unavoidable yes i grieved for lorraine grieved long and hard but i dont remember having a choice i miss her still which is as it should be but i had given in too often to the vulgar yearnings mourned youth mourned better days made an old mans map of roads not taken from the stale perspective of a dead end reached for the clonazepam and turned my hand away freighted every inch with deaths beyond counting i wonder if my captors understand this i went back to zieglernodding at deirdre who was disappointed to see me as i vanished behind the bead curtain this doesnt explain it i gave him back you will never die explain ziegler said guilelessly what the paperbacks i bought from you i dont recall or these i turned to his bookshelf copies of in our time our mutual friend beyond the mexique bay i didnt realize they needed explaining i was the victim of a conjurors trick gulled and embarrassed i closed my mouth anomalous experience ziegler said knowingly youre right soziere doesnt explain it personally i think there must be a kind of critical limita degree of accumulated unlikeliness so great that the illusion of normalcy can no longer be wholly sustained he smiled not pleasantly things leak i think especially books books being little islands of mind they trail their authors across phenomenological borders like lost puppies thats why i love them but youre awfully young to experience such phenomena you must have made yourself very unlikely indeedmore and more unlikely day after day what have you been doing to yourself mr keller i left him sucking oxygen from a fogged plastic mask reaching for the bottle of clonazepam drawing back my hand but how far must the charade proceed does the universe gauge intent what if i touch the bottle what if i open it and peer inside these questions of course are answered now i have only myself to blame i had tumbled a handful of the small white tablets into my hand and was regarding them with the cool curiosity of an entomologist when the telephone rang pills or telephone both presumably in sozieres multiverse i answered the phone it was deirdre hes dead she told me ziegler i thought you should know i said im sorry im taking care of the arrangements he was so alone no family no friends just nothing will there be a service he wanted to be cremated youre welcome to come it might be nice if somebody besides me showed up i will what about the store thats the crazy part according to the bank he left it to me her voice was choked with emotion can you imagine that i never even called him by his first name to be honestoh god i didnt even like him now he leaves me this tumbledown business of his i told her id see her at the mortuary i paid no attention to the news that night save to register the lead stories which were ominous and strange we live ziegler had said in the science fiction of our youth the et signals nasa scientists had discovered were it turned out a simple star map at the center of which wasnot the putative aliens home worldbut a previously undiscovered binary neutron star in the constellation orion the message one astronomer speculated might be a warning neutronstar pairs are unstable when they eventually collide drawn together by their enormous gravity the collision produces a black holeand in the process a burst of gamma rays and cosmic radiation strong enough to scour the earth of life if the event occurs within some two or three thousand lightyears of us the freshly discovered neutron stars were well within that range as for the collision it might happen in ten years a thousand ten thousandnone of the quoted authorities would commit to a date though estimates had been shrinking daily nice of our neighbors to warn us i thought but how long had that warning bell been ringing and for how many centuries had we ignored it deirdres description of the soziere book as a bubble theory haunted me no proof no evidence could exist that was ruled out by the theory itselfor at least as ziegler had implied there would be no evidence one could share but there had been evidence at least in my case the paperback books anomalous books imported presumably from some other timeline a history i had since lost to cardiac arrest a car accident clonazepam but the books were gone i had traded them in effect for you will never die which i had returned to oscar ziegler cup your hands as you might the water runs through your fingers there was only the most rudimentary service at the crematorium where zieglers body was burned a few words from an episcopal minister deirdre had hired for the occasion an earnest young man in clerical gear and neatly pressed levis who pronounced his consolations and hurried away as if late for another function deirdre said afterward i dont know if ive been given a gift or an obligation for a man who never left his room mr ziegler had a way of weaving people into his life she shook her head sadly if any of it really matters i mean if were not devoured by aliens or god knows what you cant turn on the news these days well i guess he bailed out just in time or moved on moved someplace where his emphysema was curable his failing heart reparable his aging cells regenerable shunting the train oscar ziegler along a more promising if less plausible track the evidence i said suddenly what the books i told you about oh right well im sorry but i didnt get a good look at them she frowned is that what youre thinking oh shit that fucking soziere book of his its bait mr keller dont you get it not to speak ill of the dead but he loved to suck people into whatever cloistered little mental universe he inhabited misery loves company and that book was always the bait no i said excited despite my best intentions as if zieglers cremation had been a message his personal message to me that the universe discarded bodies like used kleenex but that consciousness was continuous seamless immortal i mean about the evidence you didnt see itbut someone did leave it alone you dont understand about ziegler oscar ziegler was a sour poisonous old man maybe older than he looked thats what i thought of when i read sozieres book oscar ziegler someone so ridiculously old that he wakes up every morning surprised hes still a human being she stared fiercely at me what exactly are you contemplating hereserial suicide nothing so drastic i thanked her and left the paradox of proof i went to niemands store as soon as i left deirdre i had shown the books to niemand the book dealer he was the impossible witness the corroborative testimony if niemand had seen the books then i was sane if niemand had seen the books they might well turn up among zieglers possessions and i could establish their true provenance and put all this dangerous soziere mythology behind me but niemands little secondstory loft store had closed the sign was gone the door was locked and the space was for lease neither the jeweler downstairs nor the coffeeshop girl next door remembered the store its clientele or niemand himself there was no niemand in the phone book nor could i find his commercial listing not even in my yellow pages at home where i had first looked it up or remembered looking it up anomalous experience which constituted proof of a kind though ziegler was right it was not transferable i could convince no one ultimately save myself the television news was full of apocalypse that night a rumor had swept the internet that the great gammaray burst was imminent only days away no it was not scientists insisted but they allowed themselves to be drawn by their cnn inquisitors into hypothetical questions would there be any safe place a halfmile underground say or two or three probably not they admitted or we dont have the full story yet to a man or woman they looked unsettled and skittish i went to bed knowing she was out there lorraine i mean out among the plenitude of worlds and stars alone perhaps since i must have died to herinfinities apart certainly but enclosed within the same inconceivably vast multiuniverse as alike in our way as two snowflakes in an avalanche i slept with the pill bottle cradled in my hand the trick i decided was to abandon the charade to mean the act in other words to swallow twenty or thirty tabletsa more difficult act than you might imagineand wash them down with a neat last shot of glenlivet but deirdre called almost too late not late enough i picked up the phone confused my hands butting the receiver like antagonistic parade balloons i said or meant to say lorraine but it was deirdre only deirdre and before long deirdre was shouting in an annoying way i let the phone drop i suppose she called i woke in a hospital bed i lay there passively for more than an hour by the digital clock on the bedstand cresting waves of sleep and wondering at the silence until i was visited by candice her name was written on her lapel tag candice was a nurse with a throaty jamaican accent and wide sad eyes youre awake she said barely glancing at me my head hurt my mouth tasted of ashes and quicklime i needed to pee but there was a catheter in the way i think i want to see a doctor i managed probly you do candice agreed and probly you should but our last resident went home yesterday i can take the catheter out if thats what you want there are no doctors home with their families like everybody else she fluffed my pillow only us pathetic lonelyhearts left mr keller you been unconscious ten days later she wheeled me down the corridorthough i insisted i could have walkedto a lounge with a tall plateglass window where the wards remaining patients had gathered to talk and weep and watch the fires that burned fitfully through the downtown core sozieres curse we becomeor we make ourselvesless likely but its not our own unlikeliness we perceive instead we see the world growing strange around us the lights are out all over the city the hospital fortunately has its own generator i tried to call deirdre from a hospital phone but there was no dial tone just a crackling hiss like the last groove in an lp record the previous weeks newspapers stacked by the door of the hospital lounge were dwindling broadsheets containing nothing but stark outlines of the impending gammaray disaster the extraterrestrial warning had been timely timely though we read it far too late apparently it not only identified the threatening binary neutron starswhich were spiraling at last into gaudy destruction about to emit a burst of radiation brighter than a billion galaxiesbut provided a calculable time scale a countdown in other words which had already closed in on its ultimate zero too close to home a black hole was about to be born none of us would survive that last flash of annihilating fire or at least if we did we would all become extremely unlikely i remember a spot of blue luminescence roughly the size of a dinner plate at arms length suspended above the burning city cherenkov radiation gamma rays fractured molecules in the upper atmosphere loading the air with nitric oxides the color of dry blood the sky was frying like a bad picture tube the hard ionizing radiation would arrive within hours cosmic rays striking the wounded atmosphere would trigger particle cascades washing the crust of the earth with what the papers called highenergy muons i was tired of the ward lounge the incessant weeping and periodic shouting candice took me aside ill tell you she said what i told the others i been into the medicine cupboard if you dont want to wait there are pills you can take the air smelled suddenly of burning plastic static electricity drew bright blue sparks from metal shelves and gurney carts surely this would be the end the irrevocable death the utter annihilation if there can ever be an end i told candice a nightcap might be a good idea and she smiled wanly and brought me the pills they want me to keep on with my memoirs they take the pages away from me exchange them for greater rations of food the food is pale chalky with the claylike texture of goat cheese they excrete it from a sort of spinerette white obscene lumps of it like turds i prefer to think of them as advanced machines rather than biological entitiesvending machines say not the eightfootlong centipedes they appear to be theyve mastered the english language i dont know how they say please and thank you their voices are thin and reedy a sound like tree branches creaking on a windy winter night they tell me ive been dead for ten thousand years today they let me out of my bubble let me walk outside with a sort of mirrored umbrella to protect me from the undiluted sunlight the sunlight is intense the air cold and thin they have explained in patient but barely intelligible whispers that the gamma ray burst and subsequent bath of cosmic radiation stripped the earth of its ozone layer as well as much of the upper atmosphere the oxygen that remains they say is fossil oxygen no longer replenished the soil is alive with radioactive nuclei samarium iodine isotopes of lead of plutonium there is no macroscopic life on earth present company excepted everything died people plants plankton everything but the bacteria inhabiting the rocks of the deep mantle or the scalding water around undersea volcanic vents the surface of the planethere at leasthas been scoured by wind and radiation into a rocky desert all this happened ten thousand years ago the sun shines placidly on the lifeless soil the distant blueblack mountains everything i loved is dead i cant imagine the technology they used to resurrect me to recreate me as they insist from desiccated fragments of biological tissue tweezed from rocks its not just my dna they have recovered but apparently somehow my memories my self my consciousness i suppose carl soziere wouldnt be surprised i ask about others other survivors reclaimed from the waterless desert my captors or saviors only spindle their sickeningly mobile bodies a gesture of negation ive come to understand the equivalent of a shake of the head there are no other survivors and yet i cant help wondering whether lorraine waits to be salvaged from her gravesome holographic scrap of her at least information scattered by time like the dust of an ancient book there is nothing in my transparent cell but bowls of water and food a floor soft enough to serve as a mattress and the blunted writing instruments and clothlike paper are they afraid i might commit suicide the memoirs run out i want the extra food and i enjoy the diversion of writing but what remains to be said and to whom lately ive learned to distinguish between my captors the leader that is the individual most likely to address me directly and see that others attend to my needs is a duller shade of silverwhite his cartilaginous shell dusted with fine powder he or she possesses many orifices all visible when he sways back to speak i have identified his speaking orifice and his foodexcreting orifice but there are three others i havent seen in use including a toothlined maw that must be a kind of mouth we are the ones who warned you he tells me for half of a million years we warned you if you had known you might have protected yourself his grammar is impeccable to my ears anyway although consonants in close proximity make him stumble and hiss you might have deconstructed your moon created a shield as we did numerous strategies might have succeeded in preserving your world the tocsin had sounded in other words for centuries we had simply been too dull to interpret it until the very end when nothing could be done to counter the threat i try not to interpret this as a rebuke now we have learned to transsect distance the insectile creature explains then we could only signal i ask whether he could recreate the earth revive the dead no he says perhaps the angle of his body signifies regret one of you is puzzle enough they live apart from me in an immense silver halfsphere embedded in the alkaline soil their spaceship for a day they havent come i sit alone in my own much smaller shelter its bubble walls polarized to filter the light but transparent enough to show the horizon with vicious clarity i feel abandoned a fly on a vast pane of dusty glass and hungry and thirsty they returnapologeticallywith water with paper and writing implements and with a generous supply of food thoughtfully preexcreted they are compiling they tell me a sort of interstellar database combining the functions of library archeological museum and telephone exchange they are most grateful for my writings which have been enthusiastically received your cosmology by which they must mean sozieres cosmology is quite distinctive i thank them but explain that there is nothing more to writeand no audience i can even begin to imagine the news perplexes them the leader asks do you need a human audience yes yes thats what i need a human audience lorraine warning me away from despair or even deirdre trying vainly to shield me from black magic they confer for another day i walk outside my bubble at sunset alone with my silver umbrella tilted toward the western horizon when the stars appear they are astonishingly bright and crisp i can see the frosted breath of the milky way we cannot create a human audience for you the leader says swaying in a chill noon breeze like a stately elm but there is perhaps a way i wait i am infinitely patient we have experimented with time the creature announces or i think the word is experimented it might as easily have been the clacking buzz of a cricket or a cicada send me back i demand at once no not you not physical objects it cannot be done thoughts perhaps dreams speaking to minds long dead of course it changes nothing i rather like the idea when they explain it of my memoirs circulating through the terrestrial past appearing fragmented and unintelligible among the night terrors of neanderthals cromagnons roman slaves chinese peasants science fiction writers drunken poets and deirdre frank and oscar ziegler and lorraine even the faintest touchbelated impossibleis better than none at all but still i find it difficult to write in that case the leader says we would like to salvage you salvage me they consult in their own woody windy language punctuated by long silences or sounds i cannot hear preserve you they conclude yourself your soul and how would they do that i would take you into my body the leader says eat me in other words they have explained this more than once devour my body hoc est corpus and spit out my soul like a cherry pit into the great galactic telephone exchange but this is how we must do it the leader says apologetically i dont fear them i take a long last walk at night bundled against the cold in layers of flexible foil the stars have not changed visibly in the ten thousand years of my absence but there is nothing else familiar no recognizable landmarks i gather anywhere on the surface of the planet this might be an empty lake bed this desert of mine saline and ancient and save for the distant mountains flat as a chessboard i dont fear them they might be lying i know although i doubt it surely not even the most alien of creatures would travel hundreds of light years to a dead planet in search of a single exotic snack i do fear their teeth however sharp as sharks teeth even if as they claim their bodies secrete an anesthetic and euphoriant venom and death i dont fear death i dread the absence of it maybe soziere was wrong maybe theres a teleological escape clause maybe all the frayed threads of time will be woven back together at the end of the world assembled in the ultimate library where all the books and all the dreams are preserved and ordered in their multiple infinities or not i think at last of lorraine really think of her i mean imagine her next to me whispering that i ought to have taken her advice not lodged this grief so close to my heart whispering that death is not a door through which i can follow her no matter how hard or how often i try will you accept me the leader asks rearing up to show his needled mouth his venom sacs oozing a pleasant narcotic ive accepted worse i tell him
