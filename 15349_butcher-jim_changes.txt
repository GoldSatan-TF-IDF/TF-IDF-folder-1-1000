changes book in the dresden files series jim butcher chapter i answered the phone and susan rodriguez said theyve taken our daughter i sat there for a long five count swallowed and said um what you heard me harry susan said gently oh i said um the line isnt secure she said ill be in town tonight we can talk then yeah i said okay harry she said im not i never wanted to she cut the words off with an impatient sigh i heard a voice over the loudspeaker in the background saying something in spanish well have time for that later the plane is boarding ive got to go about twelve hours okay i said ill ill be here she hesitated as if about to say something else but then she hung up i sat there with the phone against my ear after a while it started making that doublespeed busysignal noise our daughter she said our daughter i hung the phone up or tried i missed the base the receiver clattered to the floor mouse my big shaggy grey dog rose up from his usual napping spot in the tiny kitchenette my basement apartment boasted and came trotting over to sit down at my feet staring up at me with dark worried doggy eyes after a moment he made a little huffing sound then carefully picked the receiver up in his jaws and settled it onto the base then he went back to staring worriedly at me i i paused trying to get my head around the concept i i might have a child mouse made an uncertain highpitched noise yeah how do you think i feel i stared at the far wall then i stood up and reached for my coat i think i need a drink i said i nodded focusing on nothing yeah something like this yeah mouse made a distressed noise and rose sure i told him you can come hell maybe you can drive me home or something i got honked at a lot on the way to mcanallys i didnt care i made it without crashing into anyone thats the important thing right i pulled my battered trusty old volkswagen bug over into the little parking lot next to macs place i started inside mouse made a whuffing sound i looked over my shoulder id left the car door open the big dog nosed it closed thanks i said we went into the pub macs place looks like cheers after a mild apocalypse there are thirteen wooden pillars irregularly spaced around the room holding up the roof theyre all carved with scenes of old world fairy tales some of them amusing more of them sinister there are thirteen ceiling fans spinning lazily throughout the place and the irregularly shaped polished wooden bar has thirteen stools there are thirteen tables in the room placed in no specific pattern therere a lot of thirteens in here i said to myself it was about two thirty in the afternoon no one was in the pub except for me and the dogoh and mac mac is a man of medium height and medium build with thick bony wrists and a shining smooth pate that never shows signs of growing in he could be anywhere between thirty and fifty and as always he was wearing a spotless white apron mouse stared intently at mac for a moment then he abruptly sat down in the entryway at the top of the little stairs turned around once and settled down by the door his chin on his paws mac glanced toward us harry i shambled over to the bar mac produced a bottle of one of his microbrews but i shook my head um id say whiskey mac but i dont know if you have any whiskey i need something strong i think mac raised his eyebrows and blinked at me youve got to know the guy he was practically screaming but he poured me a drink of something light gold in a little glass and i drank it it burned i wheezed a little and then tapped a finger next to the glass mac refilled it frowning at me i drank the second glass more slowly it still hurt going down the pain gave me something to focus on thoughts started to coagulate around it and then to crystallize into definite shape susan had called me she was on the way and we had a child and she had never told me susan had been a reporter for a yellow rag that covered supernatural news most of the people who worked there thought they were publishing fiction but susan had clued in to the supernatural world on her own and wed crossed trails and verbal swords several times before wed gotten together we hadnt been together a terribly long timea little less than two years we were both young and we made each other happy maybe i should have known better if you dont stand on the sidelines and ignore the world around you sooner or later you make enemies one of mine a vampire named bianca had abducted susan and infected her with the blood thirst of the red court susan hadnt gone all the way overbut if she ever lost control of herself ever took anothers lifeblood she would she left me afraid that if she didnt id be the kill that turned her into a monster and set out into the world to find some way to cope i told myself that she had good reason to do so but reason and heartbreak dont speak the same language id never really forgiven myself for what had happened to her i guess reason and guilt dont speak the same language either it was probably a damned good thing i had gone into shock because i could feel emotions that were stirring somewhere deep inside me gathering power like a storm far out to sea i couldnt see them i could only feel their effects but it was enough to know that whatever was rising inside me was potent violent dangerous mindless rage got people killed every day but for me it might be worse im a professional wizard i can make a lot more things happen than most people magic and emotions are tied up inextricably ive been in battle before and felt the terror and rage of that kind of place where its a fight just to think clearly through the simplest problems id used my magic in those kinds of volatile circumstancesand a few times id seen it run wild as a result when most people lose control of their anger someone gets hurt maybe someone even gets killed when it happens to a wizard insurance companies go broke and theres reconstruction afterward what was stirring in me now made those previous feelings of battle rage seem like anemic kittens ive got to talk to someone i heard myself say quietly someone with some objectivity perspective ive got to get my head straight before things go to hell mac leaned on the bar and looked at me i cradled the glass in my hand and said quietly you remember susan rodriguez he nodded she says that someone took our daughter she says shell be here late tonight mac inhaled and exhaled slowly then he picked up the bottle and poured himself a shot he sipped at it i loved her i said maybe love her still and she didnt tell me he nodded she could be lying he grunted ive been used before and im a sucker for a girl yes he said i gave him an even look he smiled slightly shed be six seven i shook my head i cant even do the math right now mac pursed his lips hard thing i finished the second glass some of the sharper edges had gotten softer mac touched a finger to the bottle watching me i shook my head she could be lying to me i said quietly if shes not then mac closed his eyes briefly and nodded then theres this little girl in trouble i said i felt my jaw clench and the storm inside me threatened to come boiling up i pushed it down my little girl he nodded again dont know if i ever told you i said i was an orphan mac watched me silently there were times when when it was bad when i wanted someone to come save me i wished for it so hard dreaming of of not being alone and when someone finally did come he turned out to be the biggest monster of all i shook my head i wont let that happen to my child mac folded his arms on the bar and looked at me intently and said in a resonant baritone youve got to be very careful harry i looked at him shocked hed used grammar something like this will test you like nothing else mac said youre going to find out who you are harry youre going to find out which principles youll stand by to your deathand which lines youll cross he took my empty glass away and said youre heading into the badlands itll be easy to get lost i watched him in stunned silence as he finished his drink he grimaced as though it hurt his throat on the way down maybe hed strained his voice using it so much i stared down at my hands for a moment then i said steak sandwich and something for the pooch he grunted in the affirmative and started cooking he took his time about it divining my intentions with a bartenders instincts i didnt feel like eating but i had a little time to kill while the buzz faded he put my sandwich down in front of me then he took a bowl with some bones and some meat out to mouse along with a bowl of water i ate my sandwich and idly noted that mac never carried food out to anyone guess he was a dog person i ate my sandwich slowly and paid mac thanks i said he nodded luck i got up and headed back for the car mouse followed beside me his eyes lifted watching me to see what i would do i marshaled my thoughts i had to be careful i had to be wary i had to keep my eyes open i had to keep the storm inside me from exploding because the only thing i knew for certain was that someonemaybe susan maybe my enemieswas trying to manipulate me either way mac was right i was heading into the badlands chapter susan arrived at around one in the morning i had gone back home from the pub and straight to my lab in the subbasement and made with the wizardry which demanded an intense focus on my tasks over the next several hours i prepared a couple of things that might come in handy in the immediate future then i went back up the stepladder to my apartment and put on my force rings each of them is a braid of three individual rings and i had enchanted them to store up a little kinetic energy every time i moved my arm they were pretty efficient but it wouldnt hurt to top them off so i spent half an hour beating the tar out of the heavy bag hanging in one corner of my apartments living area i showered cleaned up made some dinner and generally never stopped moving if i did that thoughts might start to creep in and i wasnt sure how i would deal with them i didnt even consider trying to sleep it just wasnt going to happen so i stayed in motion i cleaned the kitchen i bathed mouse and brushed out his coat i picked up my living room my room my bathroom i changed out my cat misters litter box i tidied up the fireplace and set out fresh candles to illuminate the room it took me a couple of hours of that to realize that i was trying to make my apartment look nice because susan was coming over old habits die hard i suppose i was debating with myself whether or not i might need to clean mister up and having a narroweyed glare bestowed upon me from his perch atop my highest bookshelf when there was a polite knock at the door my heart started being faster i opened the door and found susan facing me she was a woman of medium height which meant she was about a foot shorter than me her features were leanly angular except for her mouth she had dark straight hair and even darker eyes and her skin had a sunbronzed tone to it far deeper than i had ever seen on her before she looked thinner i could see the tendons and muscles beneath the skin of her neck and her cheekbones seemed starker than they had before she wore black leather pants a black tshirt and a leather jacket to complement the pants and she had not aged a day it had been most of a decade since i had beheld her in that time you expect peoples appearances to change a little oh nothing major a few more pounds maybe a few more lines a few silver hairs people change but susan hadnt changed at all i guess thats a nifty perk of being a halfturned vampire of the red court hi she said quietly hi i said back i could meet her eyes without worrying about triggering a soulgaze she and i had looked upon each other already she lowered her eyes and slipped her hands into her jacket pockets harry can i come in i took half a step back i dunno can you come in her eyes flickered with a spark of anger you think i crossed over i think that taking unnecessary chances has lost its appeal to me i said she pressed her lips together but then nodded in acquiescence and stepped over the threshold of my apartment the barrier of magical energy that surrounds any homean action that simply would not have been possible for a vampire without first receiving my permission okay i said backing up to let her enter before i shut the door again as i did i saw a sandyhaired plainlooking man seated casually on the top step of the concrete stairwell that led down to my apartment he wore khakis a blue denim jacket and was reclining just enough to display the lines of a shoulder holster beneath the jacket he was susans ally and his name was martin you i said joy martins lips twitched into the faint and distant echo of a smile likewise i shut the door on him and just to be obnoxious clacked the dead bolt closed as loudly as i could susan smiled a little and shook her head she looked around the apartment for a momentand then suddenly froze as a growl came rumbling from the darkened alcove of the minikitchen mouse didnt rise and his growl was not the savage thing i had heard once or twice beforebut it was definitely a sound of polite warning susan froze in place staring at the kitchen for a moment then she said you got a dog he kind of got me i replied susan nodded and swept her eyes around the little apartment you redecorated a little zombies i said and werewolves place has been trashed a few times i never understood why you didnt move out of this musty little hole musty little my home this is i said get you something coke beer water sure have a seat susan moved silently over to one of the easy chairs framing the fireplace and settled down on its edge her back straight i got her some ice water fetched myself a coke and brought the drinks over to her i settled down in the other chair so that we partly faced each other and popped the tab on my drink youre really going to leave martin sitting outside she asked amusement in her voice i most certainly am i said calmly and took a sip of my drink she nodded and touched her glass to her lips maybe she sipped a little water i waited as long as i could stand it maybe two or three whole seconds before i broke the heavy silence so i asked casually whats new her dark eyes regarded me obliquely for a moment before her lips thinned slightly this is going to be painful for both of us lets just have it done we dont have time to dance around it okay our child i asked yours and mine yes how do you know she smoothed her face into a nonexpression there hasnt been anyone else harry not since that night with you not for more than two years before that if she was lying it didnt show i took that in for a moment and sipped some coke it seems like something you should have told me i said it in a voice far calmer than i would have thought possible i dont know what my face looked like when i said it but susans darkly tanned skin became several shades lighter harry she said quietly i know you must be angry i burn things to ash and smash holes in buildings when im angry i said im a couple of steps past that point right now you have every right to be she said but i did what i thought was best for her and for you the storm surged higher into my chest but i made myself sit there without moving breathing slowly and steadily im listening she nodded and took a moment to gather her thoughts then she said you dont know what its like down there central america all the way down to brazil theres a reason so many of those nations limp along in a state of nearanarchy the red court i said i know you know in the abstract but no one in the white council has spent time there lived there seen what happens to the people the reds rule she shivered and folded her arms over her stomach its a nightmare and theres no one but the fellowship and a few underfunded operatives of the church to stand up to them the fellowship of st giles was a collection of the supernatural worlds outcasts and strays many of them half vampires like susan they hated the red court with a holy passion and did everything in their power to confound the vampires at every opportunity they operated in cells choosing targets training recruits planting bombs and funding their operations through a hundred shady business activities terrorists basicallysmart quick and tough because they had to be it hasnt been disneyland in the rest of the world either i said quietly i saw my fair share of nightmares during the war and then some im not trying to belittle anything that the council has done she said im just trying to explain to you what i was facing at the time teams from the fellowship rarely sleep in the same bed twice were always on the move always planning something or running from something theres no place for a child in that if only there had been someone with his own home and a regular income where she could have stayed i said susans eyes hardened how many people have gotten killed around you harry how many hurt she raked her fingers through her hair for gods sake you said yourself that your apartment has been under attack would that have gone any better if youd had a toddler to watch over guess well never know i said i know she said her voice suddenly seething with intensity god do you think i didnt want to be a part of her life i cry myself to sleep at nightwhen i can sleep but in the end i couldnt offer her anything but a life on the run and you couldnt offer her anything but a life under siege i stared at her but i didnt say anything so i did the only thing i could do she said i found a place for her far away from the fighting where she could have a stable life a loving home and never told me i said if the red court had ever learned about my child they would have used her against me period as a means of leverage or simple revenge the fewer people who knew about her the safer she was going to be i didnt tell you even though i knew it was wrong even though i knew that it would make you furious because of your own childhood she leaned forward her eyes almost feverish from the heat in her words and i would do a thousand times worse than that if it meant that shed be better protected i sipped some more coke so i said you kept her from me so that she would be safer and you sent her away to be raised by strangers so that she would be safer the storm in me pushed up higher tingeing my voice with the echo of its furious howl hows that working out susans eyes blazed red swirling tribal marks began to appear on her skin like tattoos done in disappearing ink only backwardthe fellowships version of a mood ring they covered the side of her face and her throat the fellowship has been compromised she said her words crisp duchess arianna of the red court found out about her somehow and had her taken do you know who she is yeah i said i tried to ignore the way my blood had run cold at the mention of the name duke ortegas widow shes sworn revenge upon meand she once tried to buy me on ebay susan blinked how did no never mind our sources in the red court say that shes planning something special for maggie we have to get her back i took another slow breath and closed my eyes for a moment maggie huh for your mother susan whispered margaret angelica i heard her fumble at her pockets then she said here i opened my eyes and looked at a little walletsized portrait of a darkeyed child maybe five years old she wore a pink dress and had purple ribbons in her dark hair and she was smiling a wide and infectious smile some calm detached part of me filed the face away in case i needed to recognize her later the rest of me cringed away from looking any closer from thinking about the image as anything but a bit of paper and ink its from a couple of years ago susan said quietly but its my most recent picture she bit her lip and offered it to me keep it i told her quietly she put it away the red marks were fading from her skin gone the way they had come i rubbed at my eyes for now i said slowly were going to forget about your decision to edit me out of her life because chewing over it wont help her right now and because her best chance is for us to work together agreed susan nodded i spoke the next words through my teeth but i havent forgotten will never forget it there will be a reckoning on that account later do you understand yes she whispered she looked up at me with large shining dark eyes i never wanted to hurt you or her i was just no i said too late for that now its just wasting time we cant afford to lose susan turned her face sharply away from me to the fire and closed her eyes when she opened them again her expression was under control all right she said for our next step weve got some options like diplomacy she said i hear stories about you half of them probably arent true but i know youve got some markers you could call in if enough of the accord members raise a voice we might get her back without incident i snorted or offer reparations to the red king in exchange for the childs life he doesnt have a personal interest in this matter and he outranks arianna give him a bribe big enough and shell have to let maggie go right off the top of a building probably i growled susan watched me steadily what do you think we should do i felt my lips do something that probably didnt look like a smile the storm had settled somewhere around my heart and heady tendrils of its fury were curling up into my throat it was a good ten seconds before i could speak and even then it came out in a snarl do i said the reds stole our little girl we sure as hell arent going to pay them for that a hot and terrible hunger flared up in susans eyes in response to my voice we find maggie i said we take her back and we kill anyone who gets in the way susan shuddered and her eyes overflowed she bowed her head and made a small sound then she leaned over and gently touched my left hand the one still covered in slowly fading burn scars she looked at my hand and winced beginning to draw away i caught her fingers and squeezed hard she settled her fingers against mine and did the same we held hands for a silent moment thank you she whispered her hand was shaking in mine thank you harry i nodded i was going to say something to stiffarm her and keep the distance but the warmth of her hand in mine was suddenly something i couldnt ignore i was furious with susan furious with an intensity you can feel only when someone you care deeply about hurts you but the corollary of that was unavoidablei still cared or i wouldnt be angry well find her i said and i will do everything in my power to bring her back safe susan looked up at me tears streaking her face and nodded then she lifted a hand and traced her fingers lightly over the scar on my cheek it was a newer one still angry and colorful i thought it made me look like some oldschool german character from golden age hollywood with a dueling scar on his cheek her fingertips were gentle and warm i didnt know what i was going to do she said there was no one willing to stand up to them there was no one our eyes met and suddenly the old heat was there between us quivering out from our joined hands from her fingertips against my face her eyes widened a little and my heart started pounding along rapidly i was furious with susan but apparently my body just read that as excited and didnt bother examining the fine print i met her eyes for a long moment and then said through a dry throat isnt this how we got into this mess she let out a shaking sound that was meant to be a laugh but was filled with awareness of the inherent irony and drew her hands away i im sorry i didnt mean to her voice turned wry its been a while for me i knew what she meant i took several slow deep breaths separating mind from body then i said quietly susan whatever happens from here were done i looked up at her you know that you knew it when you chose not to tell me she looked brittle she nodded slowly as if something might break off if she moved any more quickly than that she folded her hands in her lap i know that i knew it when i did it silence stretched right i said finally now i took another deep breath and told myself it would help the way i see it you didnt fly into chicago just for a chat with me you wouldnt need martin for that she lifted an eyebrow at me and nodded true then why she seemed to gather herself her voice more businesslike theres a red outpost here its a place to start okay i said rising lets start chapter i hope there are no hard feelings martin told me as he pulled out of the little gravel lot next to the house i board in susan had yielded the passenger seat of the rental car to me in deference to my storklike legs hard feelings i asked about our first meeting martin said he drove the same way he did everythingblandly complete stops five miles an hour under the limit wherever we were headed it was going to take forever to get there you mean the way you used me to attempt to assassinate old ortega i asked thereby ensuring that the code duello was broken the duel invalidated and the vamps war with the white council continued martin glanced at me and then into the rearview mirror at susan i told you she said to martin hes only dense in the short term he sees everything eventually i gave susan a slight wry tilt of my head in acknowledgment wasnt hard to realize what you were doing in retrospect i said the red courts war with the white council must have been the best thing to happen to the fellowship in ages ive only been with them for slightly over one hundred years martin said but it was the best thing to happen in that time yes the white council is one of the only organizations on the planet with the resources to seriously threaten them and every time the council won a victoryor even survived what should have been a crushing defeatit meant that the red court was tearing itself to shreds internally some of them have had millennia to nurse grudges with rivals they are appropriately epic in scale call me wacky i said but i had to watch a few too many children die in that war you helped guarantee no hard feelings i smiled at himtechnically marty believe me when i say that you dont want me to get in touch with my feelings right now i felt martins eyes shift to me and a little tension gather in his body his shoulder twitched he was thinking about his gun he was pretty good with firearms the night of my duel with the red court vampire named ortega martin had put a round from one of those enormous sniper rifles into ortega about half a second before the vampire would otherwise have killed me it had been a gross violation of the code duello the set of rules for resolving personal conflicts between individuals of the nations who had signed the unseelie accords the outcome of a clean duel might have put an early end to the war between the red court and the white council of wizards and saved a lot of lives it didnt turn out that way dont worry guy i told him ortega was already in the middle of breaking the code duello anyway it would have fallen out the way it did regardless of what you had done that night and your being there meant that he ate a bullet at the last second instead of me you saved my life im cognizant of that i kept smiling at him it didnt feel quite right so i tried to do it a little harder im also aware that if you could have gotten what you wanted by putting the bullet in my back instead of his chest you would have done it without blinking so dont go thinking were pals martin looked at me and then relaxed he said its ironic that you the mustang of the white council would immediately cling to its selfrighteous position of moral authority excuse me i said quietly he spoke dispassionately but there was a fire somewhere deep down behind the wordsthe first id ever heard in him ive seen children die too dresden slaughtered like animals by a threat no one in the wise and mighty council seemed to give a good goddamn aboutbecause the victims are poor and far away and isnt that a fine reason to let them die yes if putting a bullet in you would have meant that the council brought its forces to bear against the red court i would have done it twice and paid for the privilege he paused at a stop sign gave me a direct look and said it is good that we cleared the air is there anything else you want to say i eyed the man and said you went blond it makes you look sort of gay martin shrugged completely unperturbed my last assignment was on a cruise ship catering to that particular lifestyle i scowled and glanced at susan she nodded it was i folded my arms glowered out at the night and said i have literally killed people i liked better than you martin after another few moments i asked are we there yetµmartin stopped the car in front of a building and said its in here i eyed the building nothing special for chicago twelve stories a little rundown all rented commercial space the reds cantlook it cant be here i said this building is where my office is a known factor for red court business holdings purchased it almost eight years ago martin said putting the car in park and setting the emergency brake i should imagine that was when you saw that sudden rise in the rent i blinked a couple of times ive been paying rent to the red court increased rent martin said with the faintest emphasis duchess arianna apparently has an odd sense of humor if its any consolation the people working there have no idea who theyre really working for they think theyre a firm that provides secure data backups to a multinational importexport corporation but this is my building i frowned and shook my head and were going to do what exactly martin got out of the car and opened the trunk susan joined him i got out of the car on general principles we said martin definitely not including me are going to burgle the office and retrieve files that we hope will contain information that might point the way toward ariannas locations and intentions you are going to remain with the car the hell i will i said harry susan said her tone brisk and reasonable its computers i grunted as if susan had nudged me with her elbow wizards and computers get along about as well as flamethrowers and libraries all technology tends to behave unreliably in the presence of a mortal wizard and the newer it is the wonkier it seems to become if i went along with them well you dont take your cat with you when you go bird shopping not because the cat isnt polite but because hes a cat oh i said then i guess ill stay with the car even odds weve been spotted or followed martin said to susan we had to leave guatemala in a hurry it wasnt as smooth an exit as it could have been we didnt have days to spare susan said her voice carrying a tone of wearily familiar annoyance it was like listening to a husband and wife having an oftenrepeated quarrel she opened a case in the trunk and slipped several objects into her pockets allowances have to be made martin watched her for a moment selected a single tool from the case and then slid the straps of a backpack with a hardsided frame over his shoulders presumably it had computer things in it i stayed on the far side of the car from it and tried to think nonhostile thoughts just watch for trouble harry susan said well be back out in twenty minutes or less or we wont martin said in which case well know our sloppy exit technique caught up to us susan made a quiet disgusted sound and the pair of them strode toward the building got to the locked front doors paused for maybe three seconds and then vanished inside and im just standing here i muttered like im clifford the big red dog too big and dumb to go inside with emily elizabeth and its my building i shook my head hells bells i am off my game or out of my mind i mean here i am talking to myself i knew why i was talking to myselfif i shut up i would have nothing to think about but a small person terrified and alone in a den of monsters and that would make me think about how i had been shut out of her life and that would make me think about the beast in my chest that was still clawing to get out when the local red court badass the late bianca had stolen susan away and begun her transformation into a fullfledged vampire of the red court it had been the vampires intention to take my girlfriend away from me one way or another she had succeeded susan as she had beenalways joking always laughing always touching or kissing or otherwise enjoying life in general and life with me in particularwas gone now she was somewhere between emma peel and the shehulk and we had loved each other once and a child had been born because of it and susan had lied to before i could begin circling the block a few more times on that vicious cycle a cold feeling went slithering down my spine i didnt even look around several years of tense missions with wardens not old enough to buy their own beer had taught me to trust my instincts when they went insane in a darkened city at two in the morning without even thinking about it i crouched reached into the air surrounding me and drew a veil around myself veils are subtle tricky magic using one of several basic theories to render objects or people less visible than they would be otherwise i used to suck so badly at veils that i wouldnt even try thembut id had to bone up on them enough to be able to teach my apprentice molly carpenter how to use them molly had a real gift and had learned quickly but id been forcing her to stretch her talentsand it had taken a lot of personal practice time for me to be able to fake it well enough to have credibility in front of the grasshopper long story shortfast simple veils were no longer beyond my grasp the street darkened slightly around me as i borrowed shadow and bent light being under a veil always reduced your own ability to see what was happening around you and was a calculated risk i figured it was probably worth it if someone had a gun pointed my way i had a long damned run before i could get around the corner of a nice thick building it would be better to be unseen i crouched next to the car not quite invisible but pretty close the ability to be calm and still was critical to actually using a veil it is hard to do when you think danger is close and someone might be planning to part you from your thoughts in a purely physical fashion but i arrested the adrenaline surge and regulated my breathing easy does it harry so i had a dandy view of half a dozen figures that came darting toward the office building with a hideous somehow arachnid grace two of them were bounding along rooftops vaguely humanoid forms that moved as smoothly as if they were some kind of hunting cat three more were closing on the building from different angles at ground level gliding from shadow to shadow i couldnt sense much of them beyond blurs in the air and more shivers along my spine the last form was actually scuttling down the sides of buildings on the same street bounding from one to the next sticking to the walls like an enormous spider and moving with terrible speed i never got more of a look than thatflickering shadows moving with sinister purpose but i knew what i was looking at vampires red court vampires they closed on my office building like sharks on bloody meat the tempest in my chest suddenly raged and as i watched them vanish into the buildingmy fricking buildinglike cockroaches somehow finding a way to wriggle into places they shouldnt be the anger rose up from my chest to my eyes and the reflections of streetlights in the window glass tinted red i let the vampires enter the building and then i gathered up my fury and pain honing them like immaterial blades and went in after them chapter my blasting rod was hanging from its tie on the inside of my coat a stick of oak about eighteen inches long and a bit thicker than my thumb the ridges of the runes and sigils carved into it felt comfortably familiar under the fingers of my right hand as i drew it out i went up to the building as silently as i could let myself in with my key and dropped the veil only after i was inside it wasnt going to do anything to hide me from a vampire that got closetheyd be able to smell me and hear my heartbeat anyway the veil would only hamper my own vision which was going to be taxed enough i didnt take the elevator it wheezed and rattled and would alert everyone in the building to where i was i checked the index board in the lobby datasafe inc resided on the ninth floor five stories above my office that was probably where martin and susan were it would be where the vampires were heading i hit the stairs and took a risk spells to dull sound and keep conversations private were basic fare for wizards of my abilities and it wasnt much harder to make sure that sound didnt leave the immediate area around me of course that meant that i was effectively putting myself in a sonic bubblei wouldnt hear anything coming toward me either but for the moment at least i knew the vampires were here while they presumably were unaware of me i wanted to keep it that way besides in quarters this close by the time i reacted to a noise from a vampire i hadnt seen i was as good as dead anyway so i murmured the words to a reliable bit of phonoturgy and went up the stairs clad in perfect silence which was a good thing i run on a regular basis but running down a sidewalk or a sandy beach isnt the same thing as running up stairs by the time i got to the ninth floor my legs were burning i was breathing hard and my left knee was killing me what the hell when had my knees become something i had to worry about cheered by that thought i paused at the door to the ninthfloor hallway opened it beneath the protection of my cloak of silence and then dropped the spell so that i could listen hissing gurgling speech in a language i couldnt understand came from the hallway before me maybe right around the corner i could see ahead i literally held my breath vampires have superhuman senses but they are as vulnerable to distraction as anyone if they were talking they might not hear me and regular human traffic in this building would probably hide my scent from them and why exactly a voice somewhere within the storm in my chest whispered should i be hiding from these murdering scum in the first place red court vampires were killers one and all a halfturned vampire didnt go all the way over until theyd killed another human being and fed upon their lifes blood granted an unwilling soul taken into the red court found themselves at the mercy of new and nearly irresistible hungersbut that didnt change the fact that if they were a cardcarrying member of the red court they had killed someone to be there monsters monsters who dragged people into the darkness and inflicted unspeakable torments upon them for pleasureand i should know theyd done it to me once monsters whose existence was a plague upon millions monsters who had taken my child the man once wrote do not meddle in the affairs of wizards for they are subtle and quick to anger tolkien had that one mostly right i stepped forward let the door bang closed and snarled fuck subtle the gurglehissing from around the corner ahead stopped at a confused intersection of speech that needed no translation huh i lifted the blasting rod aimed it at the corner ahead of me and poured my rage my will and my power into it as i snarled fuego silverwhite fire howled down the hallway and bit into the corner ahead blowing through it as easily as a bullet through a paper target i drew the line of fire to my left and as quickly as that the fire gouged an opening as big as my fist through several sections of studs and drywall blasting through to the perpendicular hallway where id heard the vampires talking the din was incredible wood tore and exploded drywall flew into clouds of dust pipes screamed as they were severed as neatly as if id used a cutter wires erupted into clouds of popping sparks and something entirely inhuman let out a piercing shriek of pain pain driven by unnaturally powerful lungs into a scream that was louder than gunshots i screamed in answer in challenge in defiance and pelted forward the runes on my blasting rod shone with whitehot fire throwing brilliant silverwhite light out ahead of me into the darkened building as i ran as i rounded the corner a shape was already in motion coming toward me my shield bracelet was ready i lifted my left hand fingers contorted into a gesture that had nothing to do with magic but that was generally considered insulting my will poured into the charm bracelet hung with multiple tiny shields and in an instant my power spread from there into a quarterdome shape of pure invisible force in front of me the black shape of the vampire hit the shield sending up concentric circles of blue light and white sparks and then rebounded from it i dropped the shield almost before he was done rebounding leveled the blasting rod with a flick of my wrist and ripped the vampire in half with a word and a beam of silver fire the pieces flew off in different directions still kicking and thrashing hideously in the middle of the hallway was a second bisected vampire which id apparently hit when firing blindly through the wall it was also dying messily because ive seen too many bad horror movies and know the rules for surviving them the instant id made sure the hallway was empty of more threats i swung the rod up to point above me a vampire clung to the ceiling not twenty feet away people have this image of vampires as flawless beautiful gods of dark sex and temptation and while the red court can create a kind of outer human shell called a flesh mask and while that mask was generally lovely there was something very different underneatha true hideous unrepentant monster like the one looking down at me it was maybe six feet tall when standing though its arms were scrawny and long enough to drag the backs of its clawtipped hands along the ground its skin was rubbery and black spotted here and there with unhealthylooking bits of pink and its belly hung down in flabby grotesquerie it was bandylegged and hunchbacked and its face was somewhere between that of a vampire bat and something from h r gigers hallucinations it saw me round the corner and its goggling black eyes seemed to get even larger it let out a scream of terror it screamed in fear the vampire flung itself away from me even as i unleashed a third blast bounding away down the hall flinging itself from the ceiling to the wall to the floor to the wall and back again wildly dodging the stream of ruinous energy i sent after it thats right i heard myself scream youd better run pretty boy it vanished around the next corner and i shouted in incoherent rage kicked the stilltwitching head of one of the downed vampires with the tip of my steeltoed work boots and rushed after it in pursuit cursing up a storm the entire business had taken at most six or seven seconds after that things got a little complicated id started half a dozen small fires with the blasts and before id gone another half a dozen steps the fire alarms twittered shrilly sprinkler systems went off all around me and at the same moment gunfire erupted from somewhere ahead of me none of that was good the alarms meant that the authorities would be on the wayand except for the smartest guys in cpds special investigations they just werent ready to deal with a vampire theyd be little more than victims and potential hostages to the supernatural predators the falling water wasnt good either running water grounds magical energies and while it wouldnt shut me down completely it would make everything harder to do like running through soft sand or over wet clay and the gunshots werent good because a pair of bullets came through the wall not six feet away and one of them tugged hard at the hem of my jeans over my left ankle ack i said fearless master of the witty dialogue thats me i twisted my left wrist across the front of my body brought my shield up again a couple of bullets that probably wouldnt have hit me anyway popped off of it concentric circles of flickering blue light spreading from the points of impact i dashed down the hall and around the corner the blasting rod in my right hand lifted and ready there were two vampires in front of a door to an office one of them was on the floor thrashing and hissing in agony clutching at its flabby belly it was leaking blood all over the floor several dozen bullet holesexit holesin the door explained why the injuries wouldnt kill the vamp but they were painful and robbed it of the source of its supernatural powerthe blood it had devoured the other was crouched to the side of the doorway as if debating with itself whether or not it should try to rush the door as its companion apparently had my runner went by them wailing in fear i slid to a stop on the rapidly moistening floor lifted the rod and cut loose with another blast it howled down the hallway and the running vamp seized the wounded one and pulled it up to intercept the shot id meant for it the wounded vamp screamed and absorbed just enough of the energy to let the runner plunge through the drywall at the end of the hall it vanished from sight and a second later i heard the sound of glass breaking as it fled the building the luckless vampire was dead or on the final approach to it since the beam had sliced off almost everything to the left of its spine the final vampire whirled toward me hesitating it proved fatal the wall behind it suddenly exploded outward and martin his skin livid with dark tattoos came crashing through it he drove the vampire across the hallway and slammed it into the wall one hand snaked around the surprised vampires belly and a knife gleamed scarlet gore fountained against the wall and the vampire collapsed screaming breathlessly martin leapt clear before the thrashing creature got lucky with one of its claws snapped his gaze up and down the hallway saw the hole in the far wall and said damnation you let one get away before i could answer him susan appeared slipping out through the hole in the wall she had the computer backpack slung over one shoulder and a smoking gun in her hand a automatic with an extended magazine she took a look at the vampire on the ground and lifted the gun her dark eyes hard and cold wait i said there were six hes number four there are always six of them susan said standard operations team she calmly pulled the trigger letting loose a short precise burst of automatic fire and blew the wounded vampires head into disgusting mulch martin looked at his watch we dont have long susan nodded and they both started down the hallway toward the stairs come on harry we found floor plans the buildings wired i blinked and ran after them wired to what the explosives are on the fourth floor martin said calmly placed all around your office those jerks i said they told us they were cleaning out asbestos susan barked out a short laugh but martin frowned her down when that runner gets them word about what happened theyll set them off i suggest we hurry holy crap i breathed we sprinted for the stairs going down them took a lot less time than going up but it was harder to control i stumbled once and susan caught me by the arm her fingers like bands of rigid steel we reached the bottom together not out the front i barked inbound authorities i pounded past them and led them down a short hallway and out a side door into an alley then we sprinted to the back of the building down another alley and away we had made it to the next block when light flashed and a giant the size of the sears building hauled off and swatted us all with a pillow from his enormous bed we were flung from our feet susan and martin landed in a roll tumbling several times by contrast i crashed into a garbage can it was of course full i lay there for a moment my ears putting out a constant highpitched tone a cloud of dust and particles washed over me mixing with whatever hideous stew was in the trash can and caking itself to my body i am not playing at the top of my game i mused aloud i felt the words buzz in my throat but i couldnt hear them a few seconds later sounds began to drift back in car horns and car alarms were going off everywhere storefront security systems were screaming sirenslots and lots of sirenswere closing in a hand slipped beneath my arm and someone helped me stand up susan she was lightly coated with dust it filled the air so thickly that we couldnt see more than ten or twenty feet i tried to walk and staggered martin got underneath my other arm and we started shambling away through the dust after a little while things stopped spinning so wildly i realized that martin and susan were talking sure theres not something left susan was saying ill have to examine it sector by sector martin said tonelessly we might get a few crumbs what the hell was he thinking throwing that kind of power around when he knew we were after electronic data he was probably thinking that the information would be useless to the two of us if we were dead susan said back rather pointedly they had us and you know it martin said nothing for a while then he said that or he didnt want us to get the information he was quite angry he isnt that way she said it isnt him it wasnt him martin corrected her are you the same person you were eight years ago she didnt say anything for a while i remembered how to walk and started doing it on my own i shook my head to clear it a little and looked back over my shoulder there were buildings on fire more and more sirens were on the way the spot in the skyline where my office building usually sat from this angle was empty except for a spreading cloud of dust fires and emergency lights painted the dust orange and red and blue my files my old coffee machine my spare revolver my favorite mug my ratty comfortable old desk and chair my frostedglass window with its painted lettering reading harry dresden wizard they were all gone dammit i said susan looked up at me what was that i answered in a weary mumble i mailed in the rent on my office this morning chapter we got a cab we got out of the area before the cops had cordoned off a perimeter it wasnt all that hard chicago has a firstrate police department but nobody can establish that big a cordon around a large area with a lot of people in the dead of night quickly or easily theyd have to call and get people out of bed and onto the job and pure confusion would slow everything down by morning i knew word of the explosion would be all over the news there would be reporters and theories and eyewitness interviews with people who had sort of heard something happen and seen a cloud of dust this hadnt been a fire like wed seen a few times before this had been an explosion a deliberate act of destruction they would be able to find out that much in the aftermath there would be search and rescue on the scene i closed my eyes and leaned my head on the window odds were good that there was no one else in the building all the tenants were businesses none of them was prone to operating late at night but all of them had keys to get in when they needed to just like i did there could have been janitors or maintenance people thereemployees of the red court sure but they didnt know that you dont explain to the janitorial staff how your company is a part of a sinister organization with goals of global infiltration and control you just tell them to clean the floor there could very well be dead people in that building who wouldnt have been there except for the fact that my office was on the fourth floor jesus i felt susans eyes on me none of us had spoken in front of the cabbie nobody spoke now until martin said here pull over here i looked up the cab was pulling up to a cheap motel we should stay together susan said we can go over the disk here martin said we cant do that at his place i need your help he doesnt go on i said peopleby which i meant the policeare going to be at my place soon anyway easier if they only have one person to talk to susan exhaled firmly through her nose then nodded the two of them got out of the cab martin doled out some cash to the driver and gave him my home address i rode home in silence the cabbie was listening to the news on the radio i was pretty beat having tossed around a bunch of magic at the building magic can be awfully cool but its exhausting what was left buzzing around me wasnt enough to screw up the radio which was already alive with talk of the explosion the cabbie who looked like he was vaguely middle eastern in extraction looked unhappy i felt that we stopped at my apartment martin had already paid him too much for the ride but i duked him another twenty on top of that and gave him a serious look your name is ahmahd it was right there on his cabbie license he nodded hesitantly you have a family ahmahd he just stared at me i touched my finger to my lips in a hushing gesture you never saw me okay he grimaced but dipped his head in a nod i got out of the cab feeling a little sick i wouldnt hurt the guys family but he didnt know that and even if he did that and the bribe together wouldnt be enough to keep him from talking to the cops if they came askingthough i suspected it would be enough to keep him from jumping up to volunteer information buildings were exploding sane people would want to keep their heads down until it was over i watched the car drive away put my hands in my coat pockets and shuffled wearily home id cut into my physical and psychic resources pretty hard when id turned all that energy loose on the vampires and now i was paying the price id unintentionally poured soulfire into every blast id leveled at themwhich was why id had the nifty silverwhite blasts of flame instead of the redorange of standardissue fire i felt like falling into bed but it wouldnt be the smart move i debated doing it anyway i had time to get a shower take mouse out for a muchneeded trip outside put on a pot of coffee and was just finishing up cleaning the debris and trash from my leather duster with some handydandy leathercleaning wipes charity carpenter mollys mother had sent over when there was a knock at the door mouse lifted his head from where he lay near me his brown eyes wary and serious then his ears perked up and his tail began to wag he got up and took a step toward the door then looked at me yeah yeah i said im going i got up and opened the door it stuck halfway i pulled harder and got it open the rest of the way a woman a little more than five feet tall stood at my door her face weary and completely free of makeup her hair was golden blond but hanging all over her face and badly in need of attention from a brush and maybe a curling iron or at least a scrunchie she was wearing sweatpants and an old and roomy tshirt and her shoulders were hunched up in rigid tension she stared at me for a moment then she closed her eyes and her shoulders relaxed hiya murphy i said hey she said her voice a little feeble i enjoyed the moment i didnt get to see murphys soft side often do i smell coffee made a fresh pot i said get you some murphy let out a groan of something near lust marry me maybe when youre conscious i stepped back and let her in murph sat down on the couch and mouse came over to her and laid his head shamelessly on her lap she yawned and scratched and petted him obligingly her small strong hands making his doggy eyes close in bliss i passed her a cup of coffee and got one for myself she took it black with a couple of zerocalorie sweeteners in it mine came with cream and lots and lots of sugar we sipped coffee together and her eyes became more animate as the caffeine went in neither of us spoke and her gaze eventually roved over my apartment and me i could hear the wheels spinning in her head you showered less than an hour ago i can still smell the soap and you just got done cleaning your coat at four in the morning i sipped coffee and neither confirmed nor denied you were at the building when it blew up she said not at it i said im good but i dont know about having a building fall on me she shook her head she stared at the remainder of her coffee rawlins called told me that your office building had exploded i thought someone had gotten to you finally we on the record i asked murphy was a detective sergeant with chicago pds special investigations division it was the deadend department of cpd and the only one with any clue whatsoever about the supernatural world even so murphy was a cop to the bone she could stretch the line when it came to legality but she had limits id crossed them before she shook her head no not yet red court i said they bought the building a few years back they wired it to blow if they wanted to do it murphy frowned why do it now why not blow you up years ago i grunted personal grudge i guess i said duchess arianna is upset about what happened to her husband when he tangled with me she thinks its my fault is it pretty much i said she swirled the coffee around the bottom of the cup so why not just kill you click boom i dont know i said she figured it wasnt enough maybe clickboom is business what i have going with her is personal my jaws creaked a little as i clenched them murphys blue eyes missed little personal she looked around again your place looks too nice who was it susan her back straightened a little it was the only sign of surprise she showed murphy knew all about susan you want to talk about it i didnt but murphy needed to know i laid it out for her in sentences of three and four words by the time id finished she had set her mug on the coffee table and was listening to me intently jesus and mary mother of god she breathed harry yeah that that bitch i shook my head pointing fingers does nothing for maggie well do that later she grimaced as if swallowing something bitter then she nodded youre right thank you what are you going to do she asked martin and susan are seeing what they can get off the disk i said theyll contact me as soon as they know something meantime ill get a couple hours horizontal then start hitting my contacts go to the council and ask them for help that bunch of heartless gutless spineless old pricks she said i found myself smiling a little at my coffee are they going to give it to you murphy asked maybe its complicated i said are you going to get cpd to help me her eyes darkened maybe its complicated i spread my hands in a there you are gesture and she nodded she rose and paced over to the sink to put her cup down what can i do to help be nice if the police didnt lock me up for a while theyll realize that the explosives were around my office eventually she shook her head no promises ill do what i can thank you i want in she said youre both too involved in this youll need someone with perspective i started to snap back something nasty but shut my stupid mouth because she was probably right i put my own coffee cup in the sink to give me an excuse not to talk while i tried to cool down then i said i would have asked you anyway murph i need a good gun hand tiny murphy might be but shed survived more scrapes with the supernatural than any other vanilla mortal id ever met shed keep her head in a crisis even if the crisis included winged demons howling ghouls slavering vampires and human sacrifice shed keep anyoneby which i meant martinfrom stabbing me in the back shed keep her gun up and firing too id seen her do it harry she began i waved a hand wont ask you to break any of chicagos laws or us laws but i doubt were going to be in town for this one she absorbed that for a moment folded her arms and looked at the fire mouse watched her silently from where he sat near the couch she said im your friend harry never had a doubt youre going to take maggie back my jaw ached damn right i am okay she said im in i bowed my head my eyes abruptly burning the emotion clashing with the storm in my belly th i began my voice broke i tried again thank you karrin i felt her hand take mine for a moment warm and steady we will get her back she said very quietly we will harry im in chapter i didnt sleep long but i did it well when my old mickey mouse windup alarm clock went off at seven i had to fight my way up from a deep place on the far side of dreamland i felt like i could use another eighteen or twenty hours it was another instance of my emotions getting the better of me using soulfire on pure instinctive reflex was a mistakepotentially a fatal one the extramortal well of power that soulfire offered was formidable in ways i understood only imperfectly i dont know if it made my spells any more effective against the red courtthough i had a hunch that it sure as hedoublehockeysticks didbut i was dead certain that it had drawn upon my own life energy to do it if i pulled on it too much well no more life energy kinda means no more life and if that energy was indeed the same force that is commonly known as a soul it might mean oblivion depending on what actually happened when you got to the far side i guess i have no idea and no mortal or immortal creature i had ever met had sounded like he knew for sure either i did know that powerful emotions were an excellent source of additional energy for working magic sort of a turbocharger throw a destructive spell in the grip of a vast fury and youd get a lot more bang for your effort than if you did it while relaxed on a practice field the danger of course was that you could never really be sure how much effect such an emotion would have on a spellwhich meant that you ran a much higher risk of losing control of the energy guys operating on my level can kill others or themselves at the slightest mistake maybe the soulfire came from a similar place as the emotions maybe you couldnt have one without at least a little bit of the other maybe they were all mixed together like protein powder and skim milk in a health smoothie didnt matter really less than sixty seconds of action the night before left me exhausted if i didnt get a handle on the soulfire i could literally kill myself with it get it together harry i growled to myself i shambled out of bed and out into the living room to find that my apprentice molly had come in while i was sleeping and was profaning breakfast in my tiny kitchen she wore a simple outfitjeans and a black tshirt that read in very small white letters if you can read this youd better have bought me dinner her golden hair was longershed been letting it growand hung down to her shoulder blades in back shed colored it near the tips with green that darkened to blue as it went down im not sure if molly was bangin or slammin or hawt since the cultural catchphrase cycles every couple of minutes but if you picked a word meant to be a term of praise and adoration for the beauty of a young woman it was probably applicable for me the effect was somewhat spoiled because id known her since she was a skinny kid somewhere between the ages of training wheels and training bra but that didnt mean that i didnt have an academic appreciation for her looks when she paid any attention men fell all over her mouse sat alertly at her feet the big dog was very good about not taking food off the table or from the stove or the counter or on top of the refrigerator but he had drawn a line on the linoleum if any bits fell to the floor and he could get to them first they were his his brown eyes tracked mollys hands steadily from the cheerful wag of his tail she had probably already dropped things several times she was a soft touch where the pooch was concerned morning boss she chirped i glowered at her but shambled out to the kitchen she dumped freshly scrambled eggs onto a plate next to bacon toast and some mixed bits of fruit and pressed a large glass of oj into my hand coffee i said youre quitting this week remember we had a deal i make breakfast and you quit morning coffee i scowled at her through the coffeeless haze i dimly remembered some such agreement molly had grown up being interested in staying healthy and had gotten more so of late she was careful about what she ate and had decided to pass that joy on to me i hate morning people i said and grabbed my breakfast i stalked over to the couch and said dont feed mouse anything not good for him mouse didnt twitch an ear he just sat there watching molly and grinning i drank orange juice which i found a completely inadequate beginning to my day the bacon turned out to be made of turkey and the edges were burned i ate it anyway along with toast that was not quite done enough the grasshopper had talents but cooking was not among them things are up i said she stood at the sink scrubbing a pan and looked up at me interestedly oh what i grunted and thought about the matter carefully for a moment molly was not much for combat it just wasnt her field the next few days would certainly be hazardous for me and i could live with that but if molly got involved they might well be murderous id seen both sides of the ignorance is safety line of thinking in action id seen people die who wouldnt have if they hadnt been told about the supernatural and its hazards and id seen them die because theyd been forewarned and it just wasnt enough to really impress the scale of the threat upon them there was just no way to know what would happen and because i had no way to know what would happen id come to the conclusion that absent factors that might make me believe to the contrary i just wasnt wise enough to deny them the choice molly was a part of my life this would affect her strongly in one way or another the only responsible thing to do was to let her decide for herself how she wanted to live her life that included endangering it if that was what she felt was appropriate so much as i had for murphy i laid it out for the grasshopper by the time i was finished molly was kneeling on the floor next to where i sat at the sofa her blue eyes wide wow harry yeah i said wow you said that this changes everything i nodded how can i help i hoped that she hadnt just chosen to get herself killed you tell me whats the smart move padawan she chewed on her lip for a moment and then peered up at me we need information and we need backup edinburgh i drank the last swallow of my orange juice resented its healthiness and said bingo we took the ways to edinburgh taking advantage of the weird geography of the spirit world to cover a lot more physical distance in the material world only certain previously explored routes were safe and reliable and you had to have some serious supernatural juice to open the door so to speak between the real world and the nevernever but if you could do it the ways were darned handy the chicagotoedinburgh trip took us about half an hour the headquarters of the white council of wizards is a dull dim drafty sort of placenot unlike the insides of the heads of a great many people who work there its all underground a network of tunnels its walls covered in carvings of mystic runes and sigils of stylized designs and genuinely beautiful artistry the ceilings are kind of low for me in places some of the tunnels are pitchblack but most of them are bathed in a kind of ambient light without a visible source which is an awfully odd looksort of like one of those black lights that makes certain other colors seem to glow we passed two security checkpoints and walked for another five minutes before molly shook her head how big is this place her subdued voice echoed down the empty tunnels big i said almost as big as the city above and it has multiple levels way more than we actually use she trailed her fingers over an elaborate carving in the stone as we passed it a mural depicting a forest scene its edges and lines crisp and clean despite the smoke from occasional torches and the passage of centuries her fingers left little trails in the light layer of dust coating the wall did the council carve it out nah i said that would have been too much like work rumor has it that it used to be the palace of the lord of the daoine sidhe that the original merlin won it from him in a bet like merlin merlin she asked sword in the stone and so on same guy i said doubt he was much like in the movies wrote the laws of magic founded the white council was custodian of one of the swords and established a stronghold for the council too molly said he must have been something else he must have been a real bastard i said guys who get their name splashed all over history and folklore dont tend to be boy scout troop leaders youre such a cynic molly said i think cynics are playful and cute there was no traffic at all in the main corridor which surprised me i mean it was never exactly crowded but you usually bumped into someone i headed for warden country there was a large dormitory set up for the militant branch of the white council where i could generally be confident of finding a surly suspicious face it was also very possible that anastasia luccio captain of the wardens was there the cafeteria and the administrative offices were nearby so it was hands down the busiest part of the stronghold warden country and the cafeteria were both empty though there was a deck of cards spread out on a table in one of the lounges weird i muttered all the checkpoints are businessasusual or id think something was wrong molly frowned maybe someone got into the heads of the sentries nah theyre jerks but theyre not incompetent jerks no one around here is going to get away with mental buggery for a while buggery molly asked hey were in the united kingdom when in rome we went across the hall to administration and finally found someone a harriedlooking woman who sat at an old switchboardthe kind with about a million holes and plugs that had to be manually inserted and removed to run it she wore a pair of ancientlooking headphones and spoke into an old radio microphone no no we have no word at this time when we learn something you will be informed she jerked the wire out plugged it in under another flashing light and repeated her spiel i watched that half a dozen times before i literally waved a hand in front of her face to get her to notice us she stopped and blinked up at me she was a matronlylooking woman iron grey woven smoothly through her brown hair which meant that she could be anywhere between fortyfive and two hundred years old her eyes flicked over me and then molly and i saw her body tense she eased her rolling chair a few inches back from uslike most of the older crew of wizards she probably regarded me as a sociopath looking for a nice bell tower the switchboard lights blinked on and off steadily they were the old kind that made little clicking sounds as they did ah she said wizard dresden i am quite busy it looks like it i said wizard macfee right where is everybody she blinked at me again as though i had spoken in ewok why theyre in the senior councils residence hall it was the only place big enough for everyone who wished to witness it i nodded pleasantly and tried to remain calm witness what the ambassador macfee said impatience touching her voice she gestured at the switchboard you havent heard was sort of busy yesterday i said heard what why the red court of course she said theyve sent an ambassador plenipotentiary she beamed they want to change the ceasefire into a genuine peace theyve sent no less than duchess arianna ortega to ask for terms chapter i felt my stomach flutter around inside me the duchess was playing dirty as the red court envoy of course shed have some advance knowledge about her peoples intentions there was no way in hell that this was a coincidence it was too perfect if the red court was offering a return to the status quoand older wizards love status quo let me tell youand adding in something to sweeten it to boot the senior council would never authorize an action that would jeopardize such a peace not for some random little girland certainly not for the offspring of the white councils most famous maybepsychotic problem child harry dresden and a halfvampire terrorist plenty of the people on the council thought i should have been beheaded when i was sixteen it made the younger wizards think i was cool and dangerous which probably explained my popularity with them the older members of the council though held the lions share of its influence and authority that set would be happy to take any reasonable excuse to leave me hanging in the wind and duchess arianna clearly planned to give it to them she was cutting me off it wasnt until then that i noticed that while my brain had been calmly paddling down the stream of logic the raging cauldron in my belly had overflowed and i was walking with smooth swift strides down a hallway my staff in my left hand my blasting rod in my right and the runes and carvings of both were blazing with carmine light that was somewhat alarming someone was shaking my arm and i looked down to see that molly was hanging on to my left arm with both hands i was dragging her sneakers forward across the stone floor though she was clearly trying to stop me harry she said desperately harry you cant i turned my face away from her and kept walking harry please she all but screamed this wont help maggie it took me a few seconds to work out how to stop walking i did it and took a slow breath molly leaned her forehead against my shoulder panting her voice shaking she still held on tight please you cant you cant go in there like this theyll kill you i heard her swallow down a mouthful of terror if we have to do it this way at least let me veil you i closed my eyes and took more deep breaths concentrating on pushing my anger back down it felt like swallowing acid but when i opened my eyes the runes on the staff and rod were quiescent once more i glanced at molly she looked up at me her eyes reddened and afraid im okay i told her she bit her lip and nodded okay i leaned over and kissed her hair gently thank you molly she offered me a hesitant smile and nodded again i stood there for a moment more before i said gently you can let go of my arm now oh right she said releasing me sorry i stared down the hallway in front of me trying to order my thoughts okay i said okay harry molly asked this isnt the time or the place to fight i said um molly said yes i mean clearly dont start i told her okay so the duchess is here to play games i clenched my jaw fine game on i started forward again with a determined stride and molly hurried to keep up we proceeded to the white councils ostentatiatory i know that isnt a word but it should be if youd seen the quarters of the senior council youd back me up i strode down the hall and nodded to the squad of twelve wardens on guard outside the chambers of the senior council they were all from the younger generationapparently there were grownup things happening on the other side of the large double doors to which the children could contribute nothing but confusion for once the councils geriatocracy had worked in my favor if theyd left one of the old guard out here he would certainly have tried to prevent me from entering on general principles as it was several of the doorkeepers nodded to me and murmured quiet greetings as i approached i nodded back briskly and never slowed my steps no time guys i need to get in they hurried to open the doors and i went through them without slowing down and stepped into the chambers of the senior council i felt impressed upon entering as i always did the place was huge you could fit a little league baseball field in it and have room left over for a basketball court a rectangular central hall splayed out in front of me its floor made of white marble with veins of gold running through it marble steps at the far end swept up to a balcony that circled the entire place which was supported by corinthian columns of marble that matched the floor there was a quiet waterfall at the far end of the chamber running down into a pool surrounded by a garden of living trees and plants and the chirp of the occasional bird a platform stage had been erected in the middle of the room complete with stagelike lighting from a number of brightly glowing crystals plus another mounted on a wooden podium that would i took it provide amplified sound for anyone speaking near it the place was packed with wizards standing on the floor in a miniature sea of humanity with more of them lining the balcony above filling the place to its capacity all in all the ostentatiatory was so overdone that you couldnt help but be impressed which was the point and though my brain knew it was hundreds of feet underground my eyes insisted that it was lit by natural sunlight it wasnt though there was a vampire standing on the platform stage beside the newest member of the senior council wizard cristos he stood at the podium smiling and addressing the assembly the rest of the senior council resplendent in their black formal robes and purple stoles looked on with their hoods raised another example of how we must meet the future with our eyesand mindsopen to the possibility of change cristos said he had a great speaking voice a strong smooth baritone that rolled effortlessly through the enormous chamber he spoke in latin the official language of the councilwhich ought to tell you something about their mindset humanity is already beginning to move away from the cycle of unthinking violence and war learning to coexist with its neighbors in peace working together to find solutions to their mutual problems rather than allowing them to devolve into bloodshed he smiled benevolently a tall spare man with a mane of flowing gray hair a dark beard and piercing dark eyes he wore his formal robes open the better to display the designer business suit beneath it it is for this reason that i requested a telephone conference with the red king he continued he used the english word for telephone since there wasnt a proper latin noun for it it garnered a reaction from the assembled council watching the proceedings such things were not done and after speaking with him for a time i secured his support for a clearly defined binding and mutually acceptable peace creating the peace is in everyones best interests and it is for this reason that i am pleased to present to you wizards of the white council the duchess arianna ortega of the red court several wizards not far from cristoss position on the stage began clapping enthusiastically and it spread haltingly throughout the chamber eventually maturing into polite applause arianna stepped up to the podium smiling she was gorgeous i dont mean cutest girl at the club gorgeous i mean that she looked like a literal goddess the details almost didnt matter tall dark hair skin like milk like polished ivory eyes as blue as the twilight sky she wore a gown of red silk with a neckline that plunged gorgeously jewels touched her throat her ears her hair was piled up on her head occasional loose ringlets falling out hers was a beauty so pure that it was nearly painful to beholdathena heading out on a friday night it took me a good five or six seconds of staring to realize that there was something beneath that beauty that i did not like at all her loveliness itself i realized was a weaponsuch creatures as she had driven men literally insane with desire and obsession more to the point i knew that her beauty was only skindeep i knew what lurked beneath thank you wizard cristos the duchess said it is a very great honor to be received here today in the interests of creating a peace between our two nations and thereby finally putting an end to the abominable bloodshed between our peoples the applause squad started up again as arianna paused people picked up on the cue faster this time outside of the wizards who stood on the floor beneath the raised stage the applause was still polite and halfhearted i waited until it began to die before i released the door it closed with a quiet boom precisely in the moment of silence between the end of the applause and the duchesss next statement nearly a thousand faces turned my way silence fell i could suddenly hear the little waterfall and the occasional twitter of a bird i stared hard at arianna and said my voice carrying clearly i want the girl vampire she met my gaze with polite serenity for a moment then the hint of a smile touched her face bringing with it a shadow of mockery it made my blood boil and i heard my knuckles pop as they clenched harder at my staff wizard dresden cristos said in sharp rebuke this is neither the time nor the place for more of your warmongering idiocy i was so impressed with his authority that i raised my voice and said louder give back the child you took from her family arianna ortega kidnapper and thief or face me under the provisions of the code duello murmurs ran through the assembly like a rumble of thunder wizard dresden cristos cried aghast this is an ambassador of an accorded nation promised safe conduct while she is here on a mission of peace this is not done he looked around the room and pointed a finger at several greycloaked wizards standing not too far from me wardens escort this man from the chamber i shot a glance at them they were all old guard all dangerous all tough and they really didnt like me six sets of eyes with all the mercy and pity of a guns mouth locked onto me i heard molly gulp i looked back at them and said in english you sure you want it to be like this fellas it must have come out sounding more threatening than i thought it had because half a dozen white council hard cases stopped walking they traded looks with one another i turned from them back to the stage and addressed the vampire well thief arianna turned to cristos and gave him a rather sad and gentle smile im sorry about this disruption wizard cristos im not sure what this is about but its quite clear that wizard dresden feels that he has been badly wronged by my people bear in mind that whether justly held or not his feelings contributed to this wars beginning i apologize for this outrageous behavior wizard cristos said not at all arianna assured him i too have suffered personal loss in this conflict its always difficult to control the emotions arising from such thingsparticularly for the very young thats just one of the problems well need to overcome if we are to break the cycle of violence between your folk and mine the veterans of wars suffer horrible mental and emotional scars vampires and wizards alike i take no offense at wizard dresdens words or actions and do not hold him responsible for them she turned to me and said her voice compassionate i can sincerely say that i understand exactly how much pain youre in right now wizard dresden i had to force myself not to raise my blasting rod and burn that false empathy off of the duchesss face i gripped my gear with both hands to make sure they werent going to try anything without consulting me we can never regain the loved ones this war has taken from us she continued all we can do is end the fightingbefore even more of our loved ones get hurt im here to avert any more needless deaths dresden surely you can see exactly why i would do such a thing boy did i it wasnt enough for her simply to kill me she wanted to defeat me utterly first to have her cake and eat it too if she brought the fighting to a close this way she would garner massive credibility in the supernatural communityand if she did it while simultaneously sticking it to me it would only be that much more elegant a victory she smiled at me again with that same tiny shading of mockery so faint that no one who wasnt looking for it could possibly have seen it it was just enough to make sure that i could see the malice behind it to make sure that i damned well knew she was rubbing it in my face in front of the entire white council shed probably practiced it in a mirror im giving you a chance i said my voice harsh return the child and it ends were quits make me take her from you and ill play hardball she put long elegant fingers to her chest as if confused i dont know why youre so upset with me or what i have to do with this child sir arianna said but i understand your outrage and i wish that i could help you someone stepped up close to my side a little in front of me she was a young woman not particularly tall with curling brown hair and a heartshaped face that was appealing and likable if not beautiful her eyes were steady and hard harry said anastasia luccio captain of the wardens dont do this please i clenched my jaw and spoke in a heated whisper ana if you knew what shed done you are not going to restart the war and tarnish whatever honor the white council has left by attacking an ambassador visiting under a pledge of safe conduct she said evenly youre strong dresden but you arent that strong if you try it there are at least thirty wizards here who could take you alone working together they wouldnt just beat you theyd swat you down like a bugand then youd be imprisoned until they decided what to do with you three or four months from now my belly and chest felt like they were on fire i looked past anastasia to duchess arianna again she was watching mehell probably listening to me too vampire hearing being what it was her smile was a scalpel drawn slowly over my skin anastasia put her hand on my armvery gently not firmly she was making a request harry please behind me molly added this wont help maggie boss i wanted to scream i wanted to fight on the stage one of the hooded figures of the senior council reached up and drew back his hood my old mentor ebenezar mccoy was a stocky old man with broad hands and scarred knuckles bald except for a faint fringe of pale white hairs his blunt strong features were smooth and unreadable but he met my gaze and gave me a very small very precise nod the message was clear i could practically hear the old mans voice growling trust me hoss go with her i felt my lip lift up from my teeth in a silent snarl then i turned and stalked from the chamber my work boots thumping heavily on the floor my staff clenched in my hand anastasia walked with me her hand still on my arm making it clear that i was being escorted from the room even if shed used a gentler persuasion than cristos would have preferred the wardens closed the door behind me with a soft solid boom cutting me off from the assembled might of the white council chapter hey said one of the young wardens outside the ostentatiatory hey harry whats up man i owed carlos ramirez more than a quick shake of my head but i couldnt give it to him i didnt want to talk at all because i wasnt sure i could keep it from turning into furious shouting i heard molly turn quickly to him and say not now theres a problem were working on it and i promise to call you if theres something you can do to help but he said taking a few steps after us warden luccio said firmly remain at your post he must have obeyed we kept on walking and he didnt follow us luccio marched me down a tunnel i had never seen before took a few turns into the darker hallways lit only by light she called to hang in the air around us and then opened a door into a warm firelit room it looked like a den there was a large fireplace crackling several candles lit and a lot of comfortable furniture scattered around in solitary nooks and in groups so that one could have as much or as little conversational company as one wished there was also a bar a very large very wellstocked bar oh molly said as she came in behind me cozy anastasia let go of my arm and marched straight to the bar she got down a bottle of black glass and poured amber fluid into three shot glasses she brought them to a nearby table gestured for us to sit and then put all three glasses in the middle of the table leaving it to us to choose which we would drinktwo centuries of wardenlevel paranoia tends to sink into your bones i sat down at the table i took a glass and downed it the liquor left a scouring heat in my chest as it went down and i wanted it anastasia took hers and made it vanish without twitching an eyelash molly looked at her glass took a polite sip and said to the other womans amused glance somebody should be the designated not driver but sober person harry anastasia said turning to me what you did today was dangerous i could take the bitch i growled theres no way for us to know how old arianna is she contradicted because humanity hasnt had a written language for that long do you understand what im saying i pushed my empty glass away with my fingers and said i could take the prehistoric bitch i looked around the room for a moment and said what is this place anastasia leaned back in her chair and spread her hands palms up welcome to the worry room worry room huh she quirked an eyebrow didnt you see the bar molly giggled and suppressed it sorry anastasias voice turned faintly ironic its a place where we crusty old wardens can go when were sick of the softhearted wizards who are so lilylivered that they want us to permit wayward children with enough talent to go warlock to live instead of executing them like your apprentice here i guarantee you some drinks were poured in this room and bitter words said about how we would regret it after her trial i grunted were you pouring drinking or talking she shrugged if not for her then for plenty of others i was here when morgan drank himself into a stupor after your trial harry no wonder it feels so cozy she smiled tightly its likely the most private and secure room in the complex paranoia central is only likely free of spies you guys are getting sloppy dammit harry luccio shook her head youve done the warden job for a while or most of it you still think that the wardens never have a reason for acting as decisively as they sometimes do i sighed life is never simple i had railed against the wardens for years for killing children young men and women who had gone warlock lost control of their magical talents and their minds by indulging in black magic then i had seen the results of a few warlocks on a spree they were ugly ugly ugly ugly youve got good reason i said doesnt mean i have to like it doesnt make it right not everyone is so far over the edge they cant come back molly added softly sometimes people just just get lost they just need someone to show them how to come back yes and in the time it takes to make that distinction a lot of innocent people have died miss carpenter anastasia said her tone frank and gentle the human population has expanded with unthinkable speed in the past two centuries more and more wizardlevel talents are being born every time one of them goes warlock we have less and less time to confront the problemand nowhere near enough help prevention i said find them early and they dont go warlock resources she sighed wed had this talk before if the entire council did nothing but warden duty fulltime it still wouldnt be enough education i said use the paranet get the smaller talents to help identify the gifted she smiled at me and said im still building support for it its a good idea harry it might even work the problem is making some of the others in the council understand it they see it only as a security risk especially after peabody but its a good idea its time will comeeventually i grunted i was quiet for a moment and then i said familiar argument huh give me some routine calm me down is that it anxiety anger and agitation cloud the mind thats why the worry room is here she smiled faintly im well aware of what it looks like when a wizard has been pushed to the brink she poured the two of us another shot and said so why dont you tell me how the prehistoric bitch did it to you i took the glass without drinking she took a little girl vampires take a lot of children anastasia said what makes this one so special i said nothing silence reigned i looked up and met her eyes anastasia and i had seen each other for a while she knew me better than most she studied my face for maybe half a second and then took a deep breath harry she said dont say anything about this to anyone you dont trust with your life i gave her a small bitter smile and nodded knowledge was power anyone who knew maggie was my daughter might use her for leverage against me anastasia wouldnt not for any reasonbut others on the white council would oh theyd probably use softer gloves than arianna had i could just see being offered money to help support maggie give her access to nice schools a privileged upbringing and everything a father could want for his childso that the offer could be withdrawn if i didnt play ball after all these were the good guys but it could get worse i literally shuddered to think what nicodemus might do with the knowledgeor joyous thought mab yes that mab take it from me the stories dont do her justice id met some other real gems out there as well and none of them had reasons to like me on the other hand i thought with a shiver arianna was the devil i didnt know regardless it wouldnt be helpful to let knowledge of maggie become general i had never planned on making an open case of her blood relation to me before the council it wouldnt win sympathyonly interest the fewer people who knew i was maggies father the safer she would be and yes i am aware of the irony i kept looking at anastasia and asked can i count on you she put her hands flat on the table and looked down at them for a slow five count considering her words before she answered i am not what i was in a fight harry i ground my teeth so youll sit here where its safe for the first time since id arrived in edinburgh anastasia luccios dark eyes flashed with real anger and i suddenly remembered that this woman had been the captain of the wardens for decades the air between us grew literally physically hotter think carefully she said in a very quiet voice before you call me a coward since the stern ironhaired captain had been magically relocated to the body of a college grad student her powers had diminished significantlybut her savvy and experience hadnt i wouldnt care to fight luccio regardless of our relative strengths and hell it wasnt as if i hadnt seen her fight more than once since then the anger inside me wanted to spill out onto her but she deserved better than that from me i stuffed it back down and lifted the fingers of one hand in a gesture of mute apology anastasia luccio might be many things but she was no cowardand she was born and raised in a day and age where such an accusation might literally require a duel to be refuted no thank you she nodded mollified and some of the tension went out of her i was going to say that i would be of most use to you heregathering intelligence asking questions and digging up resources for you to use of course you should fightbut you cant do that until you find the girl and some of our own people will have an interest in making sure you dont disrupt the peace process if i am working from here i can circumvent them i glanced down at my hands suddenly embarrassed she was thinking more clearly than i was i didnt even think yeah im sorry ana she inclined her head its nothing it was unnecessary i scratched at my head you think you can sandbag the merlin she lifted both eyebrows hells bells im shocked he didnt rip off his hood and start screaming at me maybe challenge me right there no way hes going to sit on his ass when he can stick it to me inste i broke off speaking as i noticed that mollys eyes had gone very wide i turned to look behind me a painting on the wall had just finished sliding to one side revealing a doorway hidden behind it the door swung open soundlessly and a wizard who was the solemn movieposter version of old merlin himself came into the worry room arthur langtry was one of the oldest and the single most powerful wizard on the white council his hair and beard were long all snowy white with threads of silver and perfectly groomed his eyes were winter sky blue and alert his features long solemn and noble the merlin of the white council was dressed in simple white robes what i could think of only as a gunslingers belt of white leather hung at his hips it looked like it had been designed after tactical gear made for special forces operators but in an insignificant flash of insight i realized that if anything the opposite was likely to be true multiple vials probably potions rode in individual leather cases the leatherwrapped handle of an anemic rod or a stubby wand poked out of a holster several pouches were fastened closed and looked as though they would contain bits and pieces of the standard wizarding gear i habitually carried with me when i was working he also bore a long white staff a simple wooden pole made of an unfamiliar wood i stared at him for a moment then i said the peace talks are over of course not the merlin said goodness dresden we arent going to allow the entire senior council to stand on a stage within reach of a vampires claws are you mad i blinked at him wizard mccoy was the only actual senior council member on the stage he said and then grimaced aside from cristos of course who is unaware of the security measure the envoy might well be an assassin i worked my jaw a few times and said so you left him up there by himself while you played it safe the merlin shrugged one of us had to be there to handle any questions it was mccoys idea dresden he is an irritating arrogant and formidable man i scowled and mentally flogged my brain for slacking forcing myself to see past my emotionally driven hostile response you dont trust the vampires i said slowly you arent drinking the koolaid on this peace conference langtry looked at me patiently then he looked at luccio jonestown she provided the mass suicide last century he frowned at that and then nodded ah i see the metaphor no dresden we are not willing to simply accept them at their wordbut a great many people on the council do not concur cristos has garnered an enormous number of supporters who very much want to embrace the terms of peace if you dont want to call off the war i said then why the hell did you stop me captain luccio i could have fixed it for you right there you wouldnt have langtry said calmly you would have been knocked senseless and thrown in a hole a faint smile touched his lips as he spoke the words granted a pleasant notion but not a practical one next to me molly put her elbows on the table and propped up her chin in her hands staring at the merlin thoughtfully my brain kept chugging i think i can i think i can when it got to the top of the hill my eyes widened you arent planning to smoke the peace pipe youre expecting an attack he looked at me blandly and rested one hand on the hilt of his combat wand as if by pure coincidence egad what gave it away dresden i started to say something hot in reply merlin or no merlin but anastasia put a hand on my wrist our sources she said overriding my incipient insult have reported a great deal of activity in the red court camp theyre mobilizing i looked back and forth between them you figure theyre trying a trojan horse or some variant thereof langtry replied so were getting ready for it anastasia said as well as preparing the heaviest counterattack weve thrown at them yet um molly said what if theyre serious about making peace everyone looked at her and my apprentice visibly wilted beneath the merlins gaze it might happen she said langtry smiled faintly the leopard cannot change his spots miss carpenter sheep can befriend a hungry wolf only briefly the red court is all savagery and crocodile tears if they make peace it is only because they need the time to replenish themselves before fighting anew really old things get set in their ways i confirmed to molly my tone including langtry as a matter of course always hope for the best and prepare for the worst molly chewed her lip thoughtfully and nodded langtry eyed me and said need i explain why i have explained dresden maybe youd better i said i mean you didnt use illustrations or anything professor langtry inhaled briefly closed his eyes and then looked away from me um molly said frowning we want the red court to attack if that is their intention i told her we want the red court to think their trick is working we want them to be overconfident then when they hit us we hit them back so hard and fast that they dont know its coming until its over no langtry said so they never knew it was coming period we will no longer wage a war with that filth cold hot or otherwise were going to destroy them root and branch he lifted his chin slightly as his voice turned to frost were going to exterminate them silence followed the fire crackled cheerfully i felt my hands clench into fists but you need them to expose themselves first and that i whispered is why youre going to ask me to lay off duchess arianna dont be absurd langtry said in a calm quiet voice i am not asking you i am ordering you to desist warden dresden and let the child die i said in all probability the child is already dead or else turned langtry said and even if she still survives we must face a cold truth uncounted billions now living and yet to be born will be saved if we stop the red court from feeding on humanity ever again his voice became even colder no one life innocent or not is worth more than that i said nothing for several long silent seconds then i stood up i faced the merlin for a moment i could feel the obdurate adamant will that drove the man and made his power the greatest well of mortal magic on the face of the earth youve got it backward you know i told him quietly no life is worth more than that no merlin no life is worth less his expression never changed but his fingers tightened slightly on his staff his cold blue eyes touched lightly upon molly and then returned to me the threat was plain to see i leaned over close to his ear and whispered go ahead arthur try it then i straightened slowly away letting every emotion and every thought drain out of my expression the tension in the air was thick no one moved i could see molly trembling where she sat i nodded slowly at the merlin then i said in a quiet clear voice grasshopper molly stood up immediately i kept myself between the girl and langtry as we walked to the door he didnt offer any challenge but his eyes were arctic and absolute behind him luccio gave me a single tiny conspiratorial nod hells bells shed known who she would be working against all along molly and i left edinburgh behind and headed back home to chicago chapter i watched out for trouble all the way back to chicago but it didnt show up the trip from edinburgh would be a difficult one if limited by strictly physical means of transport wizards and jet planes go together like tornados and trailer parks and with similarly disastrous results boats are probably the surest means of modern transport available to us but its a bit of a ride from scotland to chicago so we do what a good wizard always does when the odds are stacked up against us we cheat the nevernever the spirit world exists alongside our own sort of like an alternate dimension but it isnt shaped the same way as the mortal world the nevernever touches upon places in the mortal world that have something in common with it a resonance of energies so if point a is a dark and spooky place in the nevernever it touches upon a dark and spooky place in the real worldlets say the stacks at the university of chicago but the space five feet away from point a in the nevernever point b is only dark and sad not really scary maybe point b attaches to a cemetery in seattle if youre a wizard you could then start at the stacks at uc open a doorway into the nevernever walk five feet open another doorway back to the real world and emerge into the cemetery in seattle total linear distance walked five or six feet total distance traveled better than seventeen hundred miles neat huh granted its almost never as little as five feet you walk in the nevernever and that stroll just might introduce you to some gargantuan tentacular horror so hideous that it drives you insane just by looking at it the nevernever is a scary place you dont want to go exploring without a whole lot of planning and backup but if you know the safe pathsthe waysthen you can get a lot of traveling done nice and quick and with a minimum incidence of spontaneous insanity once upon a time i would have refused even to enter the nevernever except in the direst of emergencies now the idea wasnt much more stressful to me than the thought of hitting a bus station things change we were back in chicago before lunchtime emerging from the nevernever into an alley behind a big old building that used to be a slaughterhouse id parked the blue beetle my beatup old volkswagen bug nearby we went back to my apartment susan and martin were waiting about two minutes after we got back there was a knock at the door and i opened it to find both half vampires standing on my doorstep martin carried a leather valise on a sling over his shoulder who is the girl martin asked his eyes calm and focused past me on molly its nice to see you again too man i said and dont mention it i save peoples lives all the time susan smiled at me giving molly the female onceovera process by which one woman creates a detailed profile of another woman based upon about a million subtle details of clothing jewelry makeup and body type and then decides how much of a social threat she might be men have a parallel process but its binary does he have beer if yes will he share with me harry susan said kissing me on the cheek i felt like a pine tree in cougar country id just have to hope territorial scoring of my bark wasnt next who is this my apprentice molly carpenter i said grasshopper this is susan rodriguez thats marvin someoneorother martin he corrected me unruffled as he entered can she be trusted every bit as much as you trust me i said well martins voice couldnt have been any drier but he tried thank goodness for that i know who they are harry molly said quietly theyre from the fellowship of st giles right vampire hunters close enough susan said standing right next to me well inside my personal space perimeter it was an intimate distance she touched my arm for a moment with feverhot fingers but never looked away from molly an apprentice wizard really whats it like molly shrugged averting her eyes frowning slightly a lot of reading a lot of boring practice with occasional flashes of pure terror susan looked from molly to me and seemed to come to some sort of conclusion she drifted out of my personal space again did you speak to the council a bit i said the duchess was at headquarters spoke to her too susan drew in a sharp breath what she hasnt left mexico in more than a hundred and eighty years call guinness she broke her streak good god she said what was she doing there being compassionate and understanding and forgiving me for challenging her to a duel in front of about a thousand fellow wizards martin made a choking sound susans eyes looked a little wide i wanted a piece of her right there i said but she was operating under a pledge of safe conduct council intelligence says theres all kinds of vampire activity starting up ive got feelers out for any other word but it will take a little time we already knew about the mobilization susan said the fellowship warned the council three days ago nice of the council to inform everybody i guess but ill get whatever else the council knows in the next few hours i said you guys turn up anything sort of susan said come on we went to the seating around the coffee table and martin plopped the valise down onto its surface he drew out a manila folder and passed it to me out of nearly a petabyte of information he began petawhat i asked one quadrillion bytes he clarified helpfully susan rolled her eyes and said several libraries worth of in formation oh okay martin cleared his throat and continued as if he hadnt been interrupted we retrieved fewer than three hundred files most of them were inventory records i opened the folder and found several sheets of printer paper covered with lists and several more that consisted of photographs of any number of objects accompanied by identification numbers the objects in this file susan said were all categorized as metacapacitors i grunted paging through the photos more slowly a stone knife an ancient notched sword a sootstained brick an urn covered in odd vaguely unsettling abstract designs yeah cant be sure without physically examining it but this stuff looks like ritual gear i frowned and started crossreferencing numbers on the lists and according to this they were all checked out of a secure holding facility in nevada and shipped as a lot i glanced up at susan when was maggie taken exactly a little less than twentyfour hours before i called you i frowned at the timing they shipped it the same day maggie was taken yes she said about three hours after the kidnapping shipped where thats the question she said assuming its connected with maggie at all odds are that it isnt martin said yeah your time would be better employed running down all those other leads we have marvin i spared him a glower and went back to studying the pages if i can figure out what this gear is used for maybe i can rule it out for all i know its meant for a rain dance i tapped the pages on my knee thoughtfully ill do that first while i do molly i want you to go talk with father forthill personallywe have to assume the phones arent safe forthill has some contacts down south tell him id like to know if any of them have reported anything unusual take mouse to watch your back i can look after myself harry its still daylight your weapons grasshopper i said in my yoda voice you will not need them she frowned at me in annoyance and said you know i believe it is possible to reference something other than star wars boss i narrowed my eyes in muppetly wisdom that is why you fail that doesnt even augh its easier just to do it she stood up and held out her hand i tossed her the keys to the blue beetle come on mouse mouse rose from his position in the kitchen and shambled to mollys side hold up a second kid susan i said something about this is making the back of my neck itch the bad guys knew where to find us last night they must have some kind of tail on one of us and we dont need to walk around with a target painted on our backs maybe you and martin could go see if you can catch our shadow theyll see us and pull a fade as soon as we leave the apartment martin said oh molly said abruptly her eyes brightening right i went out to get the mail and walk the dog around the little backyard while molly susan and martin under cover of one of mollys firstclass veils slipped out of the apartment i gave mouse five minutes then called him and went back down into the apartment molly had beaten me back inside after walking susan and martin out of the view of any observers who had a line of sight to my apartments door how was that she asked she tried for casual but by now i knew her well enough to spot when my answer mattered smooth i said did me proud she nodded but there was a little bit too much energy in it to be offhand agreement hells bells i remembered what she was feeling wanting so badly to prove my talent my discipline my skillmyselfto a teacher it took me nearly a decade for my hindsight to come into focus and to realize how inexperienced how foolish and how lucky i had been to survive my apprenticeship with both eyes and all my fingers intact i wasnt too worried about sending the kid on a solo mission it was pretty tame and forthill liked her molly wasnt much in a fight but she could avoid the hell out of them if she had an instants warningwhich was where mouse came in very little escaped the big dogs solemn notice if hostility loomed mouse would warn her and heypresto they would both be gone shed be fine dont take too long i said quietly eyes open play it safe she beamed her face alight you arent the boss of me i could all but taste the pride she felt at making her talents useful to my cause the hell im not i told her do it or i dock you a years pay you know you dont pay me anything right curses i said foiled again she flashed me another smile and hurried out bouncing eagerly up the steps mouse followed close on her heels his ears cocked alertly up his demeanor serious he grabbed his leather lead from the little table by the door as he went by molly had forgotten it but there were leash laws in town i suspected that mouse didnt care about the law my theory was that he insisted on his lead because people were more inclined to feel comfortable and friendly toward a huge dog when he was safely restrained unlike me hes a people person canine whatever i waited until the beetle had started and pulled out to close the door then i picked up martins printed pages tugged aside the rug that covered the trapdoor in the living room floor and descended into my laboratory my laboratory i said experimentally drawing out each syllable why is it that saying it like that always makes me want to follow it with mwoohahhahhahhahhhhhh you were overexposed to hammer films as a child chirped a cheerful voice from below i got to the bottom of the stepladder murmured a word and swept my hand in a broad gesture a dozen candles flickered to life my lab wasnt fancy it was a concrete box the buildings subbasement someone probably had neglected to backfill it with gravel and earth when the house was built tables and shelves lined the walls covered in wizardly bricabrac a long table ran down the middle of the room almost entirely occupied by a scale model of downtown chicago made of pewter right down to the streetlights and trees my apprentice had a workstation at a tiny desk between two of the tables though she had continued to add more and more of her own notes tools and materials as her training continued somehow she had kept the same amount of space open everything was neatly organized and sparkling clean the division between mollys work area and the rest of the room was as sharp and obvious as the lines on a map id upgraded my summoning circle which was set in the concrete floor at the far end of the little room a fivefoot hoop of braided copper silver and iron that had set me back three grand when i ordered it from a svartalf silversmith the materials werent all that expensive but it took serious compensation to convince a svartalf to work with iron each metal strand in the circles braid was inscribed with sigils and runes in formulae that harnessed and controlled magical energies to a far greater degree than any simple circle each strand had its own string of symbols work so tiny and precise that only svartalves and maybe intel could have pulled it off flickers of light like static discharge but more liquid slithered around each strand of metal red light blue and green dancing and intertwining in continuous spirals im still young for a wizardbut once in a while i can make something thats fairly cool one shelf was different from all the others in the room it was a simple wooden plank volcanic mounds of melted candle wax capped either end in the center of the shelf was a human skull surrounded by paperback romance novels as i watched orange flickering light kindled in the skulls empty eye sockets then swiveled to focus on me too many hammer films bob the skull repeated or possibly one too many nights at the rocky horror picture show janet brad rocky ugh i said dutifully i went to the shelf picked the skull up off of it wheee said bob and then carried it over to a mostly clean space on one of the worktables i set the skull down on top of a stack of notebooks and then put martins manila folder down in front of him need your take on something i said i opened up the folder and started laying out the photographs martin had given me bob regarded them for a moment and asked what are we looking at here metacapacitors i said thats weird cause they look like a bunch of ritual objects yeah i figure metacapacitor is code language for ritual object bob studied the pictures and muttered to himself under his breath he isnt actually a talking skullhes a spirit of intellect who happens to reside inside a specially enchanted skull hes been assisting wizards since the dark ages and if he hasnt forgotten more than i ever knew about the wide world of magic its only because he doesnt forget anything ever theyre traveling in a single group i need to get a ballpark estimate on what they might be used for tough to tell from twodimensional images bob said i start getting confused when there are any fewer than four dimensions he rattled the skulls teeth together a few times thoughtfully is there anything else descriptions or anything i opened the folder just the inventory list i put my finger on the picture of the stone knife and read flint blade i touched an old brick with crumbling edges brick well thats just blindingly useful bob muttered i grunted its possible that this is just miscellaneous junk if you dont think it has a specific purpose then i didnt say that bob interrupted sourly jeez harry ye of little faith can you tell me anything or not i can tell you that youre teetering on the edge of sanity sahib i blinked at that what bob didnt look up from the pictures your aura is all screwed up its like looking at an exploding paint factory crazy people get that way i grunted and considered bobs words for a moment then i shrugged im too close to this case maybe you need some time in a quiet place boss unkink your brains do mellow your vibe thank you doctor fraud i said ill take that under advisement can you tell me anything about those objects or what not without getting to examine them bob said i grunted super another bad inning for the wizard gumshoe sorry he said but all i can tell you from here is the trigger i frowned what do you mean oh those are objects of dark dangerous magic bob said i mean obviously look at the angles nothing is proportional and balanced theyre meant for something destructive disruptive deadly i grunted that tracks rumor has it that the war is going to rev up again soon i ran my fingers tiredly through my hair what did you say the trigger was again for something this dark bob asked only one thingll do i felt myself freeze my coffeeless gorge began to rise human sacrifice the skull chirped brightly the slaughter of an innocent chapter i leaned on a table with my eyes closed the red court was preparing a destructive act of high black magic the ritual whatever it was required a human sacrifice to succeed in my head i watched a movie of maggie being bled out like a slaughtered sheep within a ritual circle surrounded by an army of vampires beneath a nightmare sky there was a hideous elegance in it in a single stroke my daughter would die and her death would be used to lash out against the council it was bald guesswork but it fit what id seen of the duchess she could inflict the maximum amount of personal agony on me and launch a sorcerous attack simultaneously revenge and war would both be servedall while she smiled and smiled and offered promises of peace and understanding protected from me by the same idiots she was plotting to destroy i could try to warn them but few would listen ebenezar maybe and anastasia and some of the young wardensbut even if they listened and believed they would still have to convince others the freaking council never does anything quickly and i had a bad feeling that tempus was fugiting furiously so id just have to do it myself but to do that i needed information i looked at my summoning circle again and took a slow deep breath there were things i could do horrible things there were beings i could call up malicious mavens and entities of wicked wisdom who might make the unknowable as plain as daylight if i did there would be a terrible price i tore my eyes from the circle and shook my head i wasnt that desperate yet someone knocked loudly on my apartment door i went upstairs closed the lab and picked up my blasting rod i carried it to the door and looked out the peephole murphy stood outside her hands in her coat pockets her shoulders hunched couldnt use the phone she said when i opened the door she stepped in and i closed it behind her yeah we figure the red court might be tapping them she shook her head i dont know about that harry but internal affairs has got mine wired i blinked at her those ia idiots again cant rudolph just let it rest rudolph the brown nosed copcop as he was affectionately known at si had managed to kiss enough ass to escape si and get reassigned to ia he seemed to hold a grudge against his former coworkers irrationally blaming them for his now concluded exile among the proles of si apparently not murphy said hes making quite a name for himself over there murph youre a good cop im sure that she slashed a hand at the air and shook her head thats not important right now listen okay i frowned and nodded at her theres a fullscale investigation going into the bombing of your office building murphy said rudolph talked to the lead fbi agent and the local lead detective in charge of the case and convinced them that youre a suspicious character and good perpetrator material i groaned forensics will bear them out the explosives were on my floor some of them in the walls of my office murphy pushed her hair back with one hand the bags beneath her eyes had grown visibly darker theyre going to bring you in and question you in the next couple of hours theyll probably hold you for the full twentyfour more if they can find a charge to stick you with i dont have time for that i said then youve got to get scarce murphy said and ive got to go neither of us will be helped if were seen together son of a bitch i snarled i am going to throw rudolph halfway across lake michigan and see if the slimy little turd floats ill bring the lead weights murphy said she drew the amulet id made to let her past my apartments magical defenses from her shirt and showed it to me hopefully i wont be able to find you get in touch with me when you need my help huh murph i said if the authorities are getting set to come down on me you cant be around her eyebrows climbed a tiny fraction it was a danger signal excuse me she said politely its already going to look bad enough weve worked together so much if youre actually abetting me now they wont let you keep your badge you know they wont and they might do even more than that you could wind up in jail the subliminal angry tension in her abruptly vanished god dresden you are a simp i blinked at her if i go with you she said i could wind up in the ground that didnt seem to worry you well i said i i choose my battles dresden not you she looked up at me calmly let me put this in terms that will get through your skull my friend is going to save a child from monsters im going with him thats what friends do harry i nodded and was silent for several seconds then i said i know you karrin for you dying in a good fight would not be a terrible end youve known it was possible and youve prepared yourself for it i took a deep breath but if they took your shield away i know what your job means to you youd die by inches i dont think i could handle watching that happen so you get to choose to shut me out what i want doesnt count i dont know i said maybe and youre the one who decides i thought about it for a moment then i said no she nodded good answer she touched her fingertips to the shape of her amulet under her tshirt call i will maybe by messenger but i will its occurred to me that someone who wanted to make you suffer might start pulling the trigger on your friends how do i verify the message i shook my head the more i thought about it the more i was sure that even here in my own home i couldnt be too careful about being overheard my apartment was blanketed in protective magic but there were plenty of people and notpeople who were stronger more experienced or wilier than me if i have to send a messenger ill make sure you know who its from murphy watched me answer then she glanced slowly around the room as if looking for an unseen observer and nodded her understanding all right dont stay here long harry yeah i said dont worry about me murph she made a face im not worried about just you youve got at least one gun stashed here and im betting theres more illegal material in the lab if they like you for a suspect theyll get a warrant and the fbi as far as i know doesnt have any amulets to get them in here alive i groaned aloud murph was right i had a couple of illegal weapons in my apartment the swords were still in the lab too plus some miscellaneous material that the government probably wouldnt want me owning including depleted uranium dust for when the answer to who you gonna call turns out to be harry dresden the wards that protected my apartment were going to be an issue as well they wouldnt do anything if someone walked up and knocked on the door or even if they fiddled with the doorknobbut anyone who tried to force the door open was in for a shock about seventy thousand volts of shock in fact thanks to the defenses id put in place around my door the lightning was savage but it was only the first layer of the defense it hadnt been so terribly long since an army of zombies tore their way into my living room and i wasnt going to repeat the experience but my wards wouldnt have any way of differentiating between a zombie or a crazed vampire or a misguided fbi agent they simply reacted to someone forcing his way inside id have to deactivate the wards before someone got hurt then id have to remove any suspect gear from the house hells bells like i didnt have enough on my mind i rubbed my thumb against the spot between my eyebrows where the headache was forming i did not need this on top of everything else which is why she did it why who did what duchess arianna of the red court i said i filled murphy in on my day thats out of character isnt it murphy asked i mean for them to do something this obtrusive blowing up a building they did similar things several times during the war i said she was making a statement blowing up my place of business right in front of god and everybody the same way the wizards took out her husbands command post in honduras plus shes diverting my attention and energy yanking more potential support out from under me murphy shook her head shes so clever shes making a mistake yeah yeah if she was all that smart she would have blown you to pieces in your office i nodded yeah thats the most practical way so why didnt she figure she wants to inflict the maximum amount of pain she can before she gets rid of me murphy lifted her eyebrows for vengeance thats kind of like a bad movie script isnt it she put on a faint british accent no mr dresden i expect you to die i grunted murphy had a point duchess arianna almost couldnt have been the sort to enjoy indulging her sadistic side at the expense of practicality you dont survive millennia as a vampire without being deadly coldblooded which meant theres something else at work here i said some other game going on murphy nodded how sure are you that susan is being straight with you pretty sure i said it sounded a little hollow even to me murphys mouth twisted up into a bitter curl thats what i thought you loved her makes it easy to manipulate you susan wouldnt do that i said i hope not murphy replied but shes been gone awhile harry fighting a war from the sounds of it thats enough to change anyone and not for the better i shook my head slowly and said not susan murphy shrugged harry ive got a bad feeling that she scrunched up her nose choosing her words ive got a bad feeling that the wheels are about to come off what do you mean she shrugged just the building blowing up is all over the news you cant find an anchor talking about anything else people are screaming about terrorists the whole situation is gaining more attention from higher up in the government than anything else ive ever seen you say that most of the white council has been effectively placed under the control of this cristos person now the upper ranks of the red court are getting involved too and from what you tell me everyone is reaching for their guns she spread her hands its its like the cuban missile crisis everyones at the edge hells bells murphy was right the supernatural world was standing at the edgeand it was one hell of a long way down to the war of annihilation at the bottom i took a slow breath thinking then i said i dont care about that murphys golden eyebrows went up im not responsible for everyone else in the world murph im going to find a little girl and take her somewhere safe thats all the rest of the world can manage without me what if thats the last straw harry the little girl what will you do then i growled as a column of pure rage rose up my spine and made my voice rough i will make maggie safe if the world burns because of that then so be it me and the kid will roast some marshmallows murphy watched me thoughtfully for several empty seconds then she said very gently youre a good man harry i swallowed and bowed my head made humble by the tone of her voice and the expression on her face more than the words themselves not always rational she said smiling but youre the best kind of crazy thank you karrin she reached out and squeezed my arm once i should go call me i will she left a moment later and i began sanitizing my apartment for government scrutiny it would take me a little precious time but being locked in a cage would take even more i was still tucking away the last of my contraband when there was a knock at the door i froze after a moment the knock was repeated harry dresden called a mans voice this is special agent tilly of the federal bureau of investigation i have a warrant to search this property and detain its occupants for questioning regarding last nights explosion if you do not open this door we will be forced to break it down crap chapter i tore the rug from the trapdoor again id packed almost all of my questionable materials into a large nylon gym bag i slung it over my shoulder grabbed my duster staff and blasting rod and nearly killed myself trying to go down the ladder too quickly i stopped a couple of steps from the bottom and reached up to close the trapdoor again there was a pair of simple bolts on the lower side of the door so that i or the grasshopper could signal the other that something delicate was in progress and distractions might be dangerous i locked the door firmly whats going on blurted bob from his shelf bob i need the wards down now why dont you just because theyll come back up five minutes after ive used the disarming spell i need them down get off your bony ass and do it but that will knock them out for at least a week i know go do it and hurry you have my permission to leave the skull for that purpose ayeaye o captain my captain bob said sourly a small cloud of orange sparkling light flowed out of the skulls eye sockets and rushed upstairs through the cracks at the edge of the trapdoor i immediately started dumping things into my bag i was making a mess doing it too but there was no help for that less than half a minute later bob returned and flowed back into the skull again therere a bunch of guys in suits and uniforms knocking on the door harry i know why he asked whats going on trouble i said what do i have in here thats illegal do i look like an attorney these aint law books im surrounded by there was a heavy slam of impact from upstairs whoever was up there was trying a ram on the door good luck with that boys id had my door knocked down before i had installed a heavy metal security door that nothing short of explosives was going to overcome wheres the ghost dust i asked one shelf over two up cigar tin in a brown cardboard box bob said promptly thanks i said that section of rhino horn under the shelf to your left plastic storage bin so it went with bobs flawless memory speeding the process i wound up stuffing the bag full then i tore the paranet map off the wall and added it to the bag and tossed the directory of contact numbers for its members in next to it the last thing i needed was the fbi deciding that i was the hub of a network of terrorist cells bobs skull went in too i zipped the bag closed leaving just enough opening for bob to see out last i took the two swords at least one of which had been used in murders in the chicago area slipped them through some straps on the side of the bag and then hurriedly ducttaped them into place just to be sure i wouldnt lose them then i drew on my duster and slung the bags strap over my shoulder with a grunt the thing was heavy bangs and bumps continued upstairs there was a sudden sharp cracking sound i winced the door and its frame might be industrialstrength but the house they were attached to was a wooden antique from the previous turn of the century it sounded like something had begun to give i told you bob said you should have found out what was on the other side from here long before now and i told you i replied that the last thing i wanted to do was thin the barrier between my own home and the bloody nevernever by going through it and then attracting the attention of whatever hungry boogityboo was on the other side and you were wrong bob said smugly and i told you so there was a tremendous crash upstairs and someone shouted fbi at the same time someone else was shouting chicago pd an instant later someone let out a startled curse and a gun went off what was that screamed a rather highpitched voice a cat said agent tillys voice dripping with disdain you opened fire on a freaking cat and missed mister my heart pounded in my chest id forgotten all about him but true to his nature mister seemed to have taken care of his own daring escape there were chuckles from several voices it isnt funny snapped the other voice it was rudolph all right this guy is dangerous clear called a voice from another roomwhich meant my bedroom and bathroom since it was the only other room available nothing in here dammit rudolph said hes here somewhere are you sure your men spotted him through the window they saw someone moving around in here not five minutes ago doesnt mean it was him there was a pause and then agent tilly said or gee maybe hes down in the subbasement under that trapdoor over there you still have men in place at the windows rudolph asked yes tilly said wearily he raised his voice a bit as if speaking to someone on the far side of a large room this place is buttoned up theres nowhere for him to go lets just hope he shows himself and gives himself up quietly well be sure to respect all his rights and everything and if he cooperates this could be over pretty quickly i paused i had some choices to make i could still do as tilly suggested in the long run it was obviously the best choice for me id be questioned and cleared by anyone reasonable ie not rudolph i could even point them at the duchesss business interests and turn them loose to become a thorn in her side after that i would be back to the status quo of wary cooperation with the authoritiesbut that process would take precious time a couple of days at the very least i didnt have that kind of time agent tilly struck me as someone not entirely unreasonable but if i approached him now protesting my innocence and then vanished id be up for resisting arrest at the very least even if everything else in this mess panned out in my favor that could get me jail time which i wished to avoid besides there wasnt anything tilly could do for maggie and i had to admit it i was angry this was my home dammit you dont just break down the door of a mans home on the sayso of a snake like rudolph i had plenty of anger already stored up but hearing those voices in my living room added another large lump to the mound i doubted my ability to remain polite for very long so instead of stopping to talk i turned to the summoning circle stepped into it summoned up my will and whispered aparturum i waved my staff from left to right infusing the tool with my will and reality rolled up along it like a scroll soft green light began to emanate from the empty air in front of me in a rectangular area seven feet tall and half as widea doorway between my apartment and the nevernever i had no idea what was on the other side the bolts to the trapdoor began to rattle i heard someone call for a saw the door wasnt closely fitted theyd be able to slip a saw blade through the crack and slice those two bolts in seconds i gathered up my power into a defensive barrier around me running it through my shield bracelet and gritted my teeth my heart pounded against my chest it was entirely possible that walking through that doorway between worlds would take me to the bottom of a lake of molten lava or over the edge of a rushing waterfall there was no way to know until i actually stepped into it i told you so bob chortled an electric engine buzzed above me and then abruptly died someone made puzzled sounds then a slender steel blade slipped through the crack in the door and someone started cutting through the bolts by hand i stepped out of the real world and into the nevernever i was braced for whatever would happen freezing cold searing heat crushing depth of watereven utter vacuum the sphere of force around me was airtight and would keep me alive even in someplace like outer space at least for a few moments i emerged into the nevernever my shields at full strength my blasting rod ready to unleash hell as the invisible sphere of force around me slammed into a rather lovely bed of daisies my shields mashed them flat the entire bed in its little white planter immediately resembled a pressedflower collection i looked around slowly my body tight and ready my senses focused i was in a garden it looked like an italian number only a minority of the shrubs and flowers were planted in raised beds the others had been laid out to give the impression that they had grown naturally into the space they occupied grassy paths wound through the irregularly shaped garden twisting and turning this way and that a hummingbird the size of a silver dollar darted down and tucked its beak into a particularly bright flower and then vanished again a bee buzzed byjust a regular old bumblebee not some giant mutant monster thing dont laugh ive seen them over there i adjusted the shielding spell to allow air to pass through it and took a suspicious cautious sniff it might look like a nice place but for all i knew the atmosphere was laced with chlorine gas it smelled like autumn sunshine where the days might be balmy but the nights could carry a heavy nip letting the air in meant that sound had an easier time getting past my shield birds chirped lazily somewhere nearby there was running water bob started tittering look out look out for the vicious megasquirrel boss he said hardly able to speak clearly my gosh that ficus is about to molest you i glowered down at the skull and returned to watching my surroundings for a moment more then i carefully lowered the shields they burned a hell of a lot of energy if i tried to hold them up for more than a few moments id find myself too weary to function nothing happened it was just a sleepy afternoon in a very pleasant pretty garden you should have seen your face bob said still twitching with muffled laughter like you were going to face an angry dragon or something shut up i told him quietly this is the nevernever and its way too easy not every place in the spirit world is a nightmare factory harry bob scolded me its a universe of balance for every place of darkness there is also one of light i turned another slow circle checking for threats before i took my staff and waved it from left to right again shutting the gateway back to my laboratory then i returned to cautiously scanning the area stars and stones harry bob said merrily i guess wearing that grey cloak for so long rubbed off on you paranoid much i glowered and never stopped scanning way too easy five minutes later nothing had happened its difficult to stay properly intimidated and paranoid when there is no evident threat and when the surroundings are so generally peaceful okay i said finally maybe youre right either way we need to get moving hopefully we can find somewhere one of us recognizes that can get us back to the ways you want to leave a trail of bread crumbs or something bob asked thats what youre for i said remember how to get back here check he said which way are we going there were three paths one wandered among high grasses and soaring trees another was pebbled and ran uphill with plenty of large rocks figuring in the landscaping the third had greenish cobblestones and led through a field of nice low flowers that left lots of visibility around us i went with option three and started down the cobbled path after twenty or thirty paces i started to get uneasy there was no reason for it that i could see it was pure instinct bob i asked after a moment what kinds of flowers are these primroses the skull replied instantly i stopped in my tracks oh crap the earth shook the ground heaved around my feet and along the primrose path ahead of me the walking stones writhed and lifted up out of the soil they proved to be the gently rounded crowns of segments of exoskeleton said segments belonged to the unthinkably large green centipede that had just begun shaking its way loose from the soil as we spoke i watched in sickly fascination as the creature lifted its head from the soil fifty feet away from us and turned to look our way its mandibles clacked together several times reminding me of an enormous set of shears they were large enough to cut me in half at the waist i looked behind us and saw another fifty or sixty feet of the path ripping free and looked down to see that the walking stone i stood upon was also part of the creature albeit the last to unplant itself i fought to keep my balance as the stone ripped free but i wound up being dumped into a bed of primroses while the enormous centipedes head slithered left and right and rolled toward me at a truly alarming rate its enormous eyes glittered brightly and slime dripped from its hungrily snapping jaws its hundreds of legs each dug into the ground to propel its weight forward their tips like tent stakes biting the earth it sounded almost like a freaking locomotive i looked from the centipede down to the skull i told you so i screamed way too easy chapter yeah this was not what id had in mind when i got out of bed that morning the damned thing should have been slow by every law of physics by every right a centipede that big should have been slow dinosauric elephantine but this was the nevernever you didnt play by the same rules here physics were sort of a guideline and a very loose and elastic guideline at that here the mind and heart had more sway than the material and the big bug was fast that enormous predatory head shot at me like the engine of some psychotic locomotive its killer jaws spreading wide fortunately for me i was just barely faster i brought forth my left hand holding it out palm forth in a gesture of command and denial a universal pose meaning one thing stop intent was important in this place as the jaws closed i brought up my spherical shield to meet it the energy humming through my bracelets charms which burst into shining light as the magic coursing through them shone through the ephemeral substance of mere material metals the jaws closed with a crunch and a crash and my bracelet flared even brighter the shield exploded in more colors and shapes than a company of kaleidoscopes and turned aside the beasts jawsits strength after all was just one more bit of materially oriented power in an immaterial realm i brought my right hand out of my coat holding my blasting rod and with a shouted word loosed a sledgehammer of searing power it dipped down and then curled up an instant before it hit landing a sorcerous uppercut on what passed for the centipedes chin it flung the creatures head several yards up and its entire body rippled in agony which in retrospect probably shouldnt have caught me quite as off guard as it did the ground beneath my feet heaved and bucked and i went flying my arms whirling in a useless windmill i landed in a sprawl amid ranks of primroses which immediately began to move lashing out with tiny stemtendrils lined with wickedly sharp little thorns even as i struggled back to my feet tearing them away from my wrists and ankles i noticed that the flowers around me had begun to blush a deep bloodred you know what harry bob called i dont think this is a garden at all genius i muttered as the centipede recovered its balance and began reorienting itself to attack its body flowed forward following the motion of its head i decided that all those legs hitting the earth like posthole diggers in steady sequence made the giant bug sound less like a locomotive than a big piece of farm equipment churning by i ran at it focusing my will beneath me planted my staff on the earth and swung my legs up in a pole vaulters leap i unleashed my will beneath and behind me as i did and flew over the things back as it continued surging forward it let out a rumbling sound of displeasure as i went the head twisting to follow me forced to slow down enough to allow its own rearmost legs to get out of its way it bought me only a few seconds bigger doesnt mean better especially in the nevernever one second was time enough to turn focus another beam of fire into a far smaller area and bring it down like an enormous cutting torch almost precisely across the middle of the big bugs body an act of precision magic that id learned from luccio and which i was not at all confident i could have duplicated in the real world the beam no bigger around than a couple of my fingers sliced the creature in half as neatly and simply as if id used a paper cutter the size of a semi trailer it shrieked in pain a brazen bellowing sound that conveyed even from such an alien thing the depth of its physical agony its hindquarters just kept right on rolling forward as if they hadnt noticed that the head was gone the front half of the thing began to veer and waver wildly its limited brain perhaps overloaded by the effort of sending nerve impulses to bits of its anatomy that no longer existed it settled into a pattern of chasing its own retreating midsection rolling in a great circle that crushed the ranks of primroses on either side of the trail booya i shouted in pure triumph the adrenaline turning my manly baritone into a rather terrifiedsounding shriek what have you got for fiery beam of death huh you got nothing for fiery beam of death might as well go back to atari bugboy cause you dont got game enough for me it took me five or ten seconds to realize what was happening the wound id inflicted hadnt allowed for much bleeding cauterizing even as it slicedbut even that little bit of bleeding stopped on both severed halves of the monster the front halfs wounded rear end suddenly rounded out the second halfs wounded front end shuddered and suddenly warped in place and then with a wriggling motion a new head began to writhe free of the severed stump within seconds both halves had focused on me and then two of the freaking things rolled at me jaws clashing and snapping equally strong equally as deadly as before only they were going to come rushing at me from multiple directions now wow bob said in a perfectly calm matteroffact conversational tone that is incredibly unfair been that kind of day i said i swapped my blasting rod for my staff the rod was great for pitching fire around but i needed to pull off something more complicated than it was really meant to handle and my wizards staff was a great deal more versatile meant for handling a broad range of possibilities i called forth my will and laced it with the soulfire within me then thrust the staff ahead and called fuego murus fuego vellum energy rushed out of me and silverwhite fire rose up in a ring nearly sixty feet across three feet thick and three or four yards high the roar of the flames seemed to be somehow intertwined with an odd tone that sounded like nothing so much as the voice of a great bell the centipedes pluralhells bells i needed to stop being so arrogant rose up onto their rearmost limbs trying to bridge the wall in a living arch but they recoiled from the flames even more violently than when id slammed the original head with a cannonball of fire hey neat working bob said the soulfire is a nice touch the effort of managing that much energy caught up to me in a rush and i found myself gasping and sweating yeah i said thanks of course now were trapped bob noted and that wall is going to run out of juice soon you can keep chopping them up for a while then theyll eat you nah i said panting were in this together well both get eaten ah bob said youd better open a way back to chicago then back to my apartment i demanded the fbi is there just waiting to slap cuffs onto me then i guess you shouldnt have become a terrorist harry hey i never bob raised his voice and shouted toward the centipedes im not with him none of my options were good ones getting eaten by a supernaturally resilient centipededemon would be an impediment to my rescue effort getting locked up by the fbi wouldnt be much better but at least with the feds putting me in a cell id have a chance to walk out of itunlike the centipedes stomach stomachs but i couldnt walk back into my apartment with a bag full of nonos id have to hide them before i got thereand that meant leaving the bag here that wasnt exactly a brilliant idea but i didnt have much in the way of a choice i would have to take whatever precautions i could to hide the bag and hope that they were enough earth magic isnt my forte it is an extremely demanding discipline physically speaking you are after all talking about an awful lot of weight being moved around using magic doesnt mean you get to ignore physics the energy for creating heat or motion comes from a different source but it still has to interact with reality along the same lines as any other kind of energy that means that affecting tons of earth takes an enormous amount of energy and its damned difficultbut not impossible ebenezar had insisted that i learn at least one very useful if enormously taxing spell with earth magic it would be the effort of an entire day to use it in the real world but here in the nevernever i lifted my staff pointed it at the ground before me and intoned in a deep heavy monotone dispertius i unleashed my will as i did though i was already winded and the earth and stone beneath my feet cracked open a black gap opening like a stony mouth a few inches in front of my toes oh no no bob said you are not going to put me in it was an enormous effort to my swiftly tiring body but i pitched the bag with the swords bob and all into the hole it vanished into the dark along with bobs scream of youd better come back the furious hissing of the enraged centipedes sliced through the air i pointed my staff at the hole again and intoned resarcius more of my strength flooded out of me and as quickly as that the hole mended itself again with the earth and stone that the bag and its contents displaced being dispersed into a wide area resulting in little more than a very slight and difficulttosee hump in the ground the spell would make retrieval of the gear difficult for anyone who didnt know exactly where it was and i had put it deep enough to hide it from anyone who wasnt specifically looking for it i hoped bob and the swords were as safe as it was possible for me to make them under the circumstances and my wall of silver fire was steadily dwindling it was time to get going while i still could my legs were shaking with fatigue and i leaned hard on my staff to keep from falling over i needed one more effort of will to escape this prettily landscaped death trap and after that the ring of fire had fallen low enough that one of the centipedes arched up into the air forming a bridge of its own body and flowed over it and onto the ground outside its multifaceted eyes fixed upon me and its jaws clashed in hungry anticipation i turned away focused my thoughts and will and with a slashing motion of my hand cut a tiny slice into the air opening a narrow doorway a mere crack between the nevernever and reality then i threw myself at it i had never gone through such a narrow opening before i felt as if it were smashing me flat in some kind of spiritual trash compactor it hurt an instant of such savage agony that it seemed to stretch out into an hour all while my thoughts were compressed into a single impossibly dense whole a psychic black hole where every dark and leaden emotion id ever felt seemed to suffuse and poison every thought and memory adding an overwhelming heartache to the physical torment the instant passed and i was through the narrow opening i sensed a fraction of a second in which the centipede tried to follow but the slit id opened between worlds had healed itself almost instantaneously i tumbled through about three feet of empty air banged my hip on the side of the worktable in my lab and hit the concrete floor like a sack of exhausted bricks people started shouting and someone piled onto me rolling me onto my chest and planting a knee in my spine as they hauled my arms around behind my back there was a bunch of chatter to which i paid no heed i hurt too much and was too damned tired to care honestly the only thought in my mind at the time was a sense of great relief at being arrested now i could kick back and relax in a nice pair of handcuffs or maybe a straitjacket depending on how things went chapter they took me to the chicago division of the federal bureau of investigation on roosevelt a crowd of reporters was outside the place and immediately started screaming questions and snapping pictures as i was taken from the car and half carried into the building by a couple of patrolmen none of the feds said anything to the cameras but rudolph paused long enough to confirm that an investigation into the explosion was ongoing and that several persons of interest were being detained and that the good people of chicago had nothing to fear yadda yadda yadda a slender little guy in a fed suit with fish white skin and ink black hair strolled by rudolph put an arm around the other mans shoulder in a comradely fashion and almost hauled him off his feet and away from the reporters rudolph sputtered but slim gave him a hard look and rudy subsided i remember stumbling through a checkpoint and an elevator and then being plopped down into a chair slim took the cuffs off my wrists i promptly folded my arms on the table in front of me and put my head down i dont know how long i was out but when i came to a rather stiff dourlooking woman was shining a penlight into my eyes no evidence of concussion she said normal response i think hes just exhausted slim stood at the door to the little room which had a single conference table several chairs and a long mirror on the wall rudolph was standing there with him a young looking man in a suit more expensive than his pay grade with dark insanely neat hair and an anxious hunch to his shoulders hes faking it rudolph insisted he wasnt out of our sight for more than a few minutes how could he have worked himself to exhaustion in that time huh without sweating not even really breathing hard hes dirty i know it we shouldnt have given him an hour to come up with a story slim eyed rudy without any expression showing on his lean pale face then he looked at me i guess that makes you good cop i said slim rolled his eyes thanks roz the woman took a stethoscope from around her neck gave me a look full of disapproval and left the room slim came over to the table and sat down across from me rudolph moved around to stand behind me it was a simple psychological ploy but it worked rudolphs presence out of my line of sight was an irritant and a distraction my name is tilly said slim you can call me agent tilly or agent or tilly whatever youre most comfortable with okay slim i said he inhaled and exhaled slowly then he said why didnt you just answer the door mr dresden it would have been a lot easier for all of us i didnt hear you i said i was asleep down in the subbasement bullshit said rudolph slim looked from me to rudy and back asleep huh im a heavy sleeper i said keep a pad underneath one of the tables in the lab snooze down there sometimes nice and cool slim studied me for another thoughtful minute then he said nah you werent asleep down there you werent down there at all there was no open space large enough to have hidden you in that subbasement you were somewhere else where i asked him i mean not like its a big apartment living room bedroom bathroom subbasement you found me on the floor in the subbasement which only has one entrance where else do you think i was you think i just appeared out of thin air slim narrowed his eyes then he shook his head and said i dont know seen a lot of tricks saw a guy make the statue of liberty disappear once i spread my hands you think i did it with mirrors or something could be he said i dont have a good explanation for how you showed up all of a sudden dresden i get grumpy when i dont have good explanations for things then i go digging until i come up with something i grinned at him i couldnt help it i was asleep in my lab woke up when you guys started twisting my arms you think i came out of a secret compartment so well hidden that nobody found it in a full sweep of the room or maybe i appeared out of thin air which of those stories do you think will make more sense to the judge in the civil suit i bring against the cpd and the bureau yours or mine slims expression turned sour rudolph abruptly appeared to my right and slammed a fist down on the table tell us why you blew up the building dresden i burst out laughing i couldnt help it i didnt have a whole lot of energy but i laughed until my stomach was shaking im sorry i said a moment later im sorry it was just so ahhhh i shook my head and tried to get myself under control rudolph said slim get out you cant order me out i am a duly appointed representative of the cpd and a member of this task force youre useless unprofessional and impeding this deposition slim said his tone flat he turned his dark eyes to rudolph and said get out slim had a hell of a glare some men do they can look at you and tell you without saying a word that they are perfectly capable of doing violence and willing to demonstrate it that look doesnt convey any particular single emotion nor anything that can be easily put into words slim didnt need any words he stared at rudolph with some faint shadow of old death himself in his eyes and did nothing else rudolph flinched he muttered something about filing a complaint against the fbi and left the room agent tilly turned back to me his expression softened briefly into something almost resembling a smile and he said did you do it i met his eyes for a second and said no tilly pursed his lips then he nodded his head several times and said okay i lifted my eyebrows just like that i know when people lie he said simply and thats why this is a deposition not an interrogation its a deposition because rudolph lied his ass off when he fingered you to my boss tilly said now ive seen you for myself and bomber doesnt fit on you why not your apartment is one big pile of disorganized clutter disorganized bomb makers dont have much of a life expectancy my turn why is someone trying to tag you for the office building politics i think i said karrin murphy has pissed off a lot of money by wrecking some of their shadier enterprises money leans on politicians i get some spillover because shes the one who hired me as a consultant on some of it fucking chicago tilly said with real contempt in his voice the government in the whole state is about as corrupt as they get amen i said i read your file says you were looked at by my office before says four agents vanished a few days later he pursed his lips youve been suspected of kidnapping murder and at least two cases of arson one of which was a public building it wasnt my fault i said that building thing you lead an interesting life dresden not really just a wild weekend now and then to the contrary tilly said im very interested in you i sighed man you dont want to be tilly considered that a faint frown line appearing between his brows do you know who blew up your office building no tillys expression might have been carved in stone liar if i tell you i said you arent going to believe meand youre going to get me locked up in a psycho ward somewhere so no i dont know who blew up the building he nodded for a moment then he said what you are doing now could be construed as obstructing and interfering with an investigation depending on who was behind the bombing and why it might even get bumped up to treason in other words i said you couldnt find anything in my apartment to incriminate me or give you an excuse to hold me so now youre hoping to intimidate me into talking with you agent tilly leaned back in his chair and squinted at me i can hold you for twenty four hours for no reason at all and i can make them fairly unpleasant for you without coming close to violating any laws i wish you wouldnt do that i said tilly shrugged and i wish youd tell me what you know about the explosion but i guess neither of us is going to get what we want i propped my chin on my hand and thought about it for a moment i gave it even odds that someone in the supernatural scene probably the duchess had pulled some strings to send rudolph my way if that was the case maybe i could bounce this little hand grenade back to her off the record i asked tilly he stood up went out the door and came back in a moment later presumably after turning off any recording devices he sat back down and looked at me youre going to find out that the building was wired with explosives i said on the fourth floor and how do you know that someone i trust saw some blueprint files that showed where the charges had been installed presumably at the behest of the buildings owners i remember that a few years ago there were crews tearing into the walls for a week or so said they were removing asbestos the owners had hired them nuevo verita inc owns the building as insurance scams go this isnt a great one it isnt about insurance i said then what is it about revenge tilly tilted his head to one side and studied me intently you did something to this company i did something to someone far up the food chain in the corporate constellation that nuevo verita belongs to and what was that nothing illegal i said you might look into the business affairs of a man calling himself paolo ortega he was a professor of mythology in brazil he died several years ago ah tilly said his family is who is after you thats a reasonably accurate description his wife in particular tilly absorbed that taking his time the room was silent for several minutes finally tilly looked up at me and said i have a great deal of respect for karrin murphy i called her while you were resting she says shell back you without reservation considering the source that is a significant statement yeah i said considering the source it is frankly im not sure if i can do anything to help you im not in charge of the investigation and its being directed by politicians i cant promise that you wont be questioned againthough todays events should make it harder to get judicial approval to move against you im not sure i understand your meaning i said tilly waved a hand toward the rest of the building as far as theyre concerned youre guilty dresden theyre already writing headlines and news text now its just a matter of finding the evidence to support the conclusion they want they i said not you tilly said theyre a bunch of assholes and you arent im a different kind of asshole heh i said am i free to go he nodded but since theyve got nothing remotely like evidence that you were the one to plant the explosives theyre going to be digging into you your personal life your past looking for things to use against you theyll play dirty okay by me i said i can play too tillys eyes smiled sounds like yeah he offered me his hand good luck i shook it i felt the very very faint tingle of someone with a slight magical talent it probably augmented tillys ability to separate truth from fiction i got up and walked wearily toward the door hey tilly said just before i opened it off the record who did it i stopped looked at him again and said vampires his expression flickered with swiftly banished emotions amusement then realization followed by doubt and yards and yards of rationalization see i said to him i told you that you wouldnt believe me chapter i came out of the doors of the fbi building to find a ring of paparazzi surrounding it waiting with predatory patience to get more material for their stories a couple of them saw me and hurried toward me beginning to ask me questions thrust microphones toward me that sort of thing i winced i was still pretty tired but it was going to play merry hell with their gear if i got too close to it i looked around for a way to get down the sidewalks without messing up anybodys equipment and that was when they tried to kill me id been the target of a driveby attempt once before this one was considerably more professional than the first there was no roar of engines to give me a warning no wildly swerving vehicle the only tipoff i had was a sudden prickling of the hairs on the back of my neck and a glimpse of a dark sedans passenger window rolling down then something hit me in the left side of my chest and hammered me down onto the stairs stunned i realized that someone was shooting at me i could have rolled down the stairs and into the news crowd put them between myself and the shooter but i had no way of knowing whether the shooter wanted me bad enough to fire through a crowd in hopes of getting me so i curled into a defensive ball and felt two more heavy blows land against me one of them on my ribs the second on my left arm which id raised to cover my head there was an exclamation from below and then there were several people standing over me hey buddy said a potbellied cameraman in a hunting jacket he offered me a hand to help me up nasty fall there you still in one piece i just stared at him for a second the adrenaline coursing through me and realized that the cameramanall of the newsies in factdidnt even know what had just happened it made a creepy kind of sense i hadnt heard anything the assassin must have been using a suppressor there hadnt been any flashes so he must have done it right aiming at me through the car window while sitting far enough back to make sure the barrel of his gun didnt poke out suspiciouslyand that he never became a highly visible target i had helped too by denying the onlookers the subtle clue of a dead body with little holes in the front of it and big ones in the back no sound no sight and no victim why should they think that murder had just been attempted move i said hauling myself up by the cameramans paw i struggled to get higher to look over the crowd and get a plate off of the dark sedan it didnt take much more than stepping around a couple of people and standing on tiptoe to get a view of the shooters vehicle cruising calmly away without roaring engines without crashing up onto the sidewalk or running red lights it just vanished into the traffic like a shark disappearing into the depths i never got a clear look at the plates dammit i growled pain was starting to register on me now especially in my arm the protective spells id woven over my duster had held out against the bullets but the leather had been pulled pretty tight over my skin and as a result it felt like someone had smashed a baseball bat into my forearm the fingers of my left hand were tingling and refused to do more than twitch i felt similar throbs from the other two hits and ran my hands over the duster just to be sure none of them had gone through without my noticing i found a bullet caught in the leather of my left sleeve it hadnt penetrated more than maybe a quarter of an inch but it was trapped in the leather and deformed from the impact i pulled a handkerchief out of my pocket wrapped the bullet in it and put it back again managing to do the whole thing unnoticed while about a dozen people looked at me like i was a lunatic from the street came a wheezy little beepbeep the blue beetle came slowly down the street and stopped in front of the building molly was behind the wheel waving at me frantically i hurried down to the street and got in before the mismatched color scheme of my car sent the obsessivecompulsive federal personnel in the building behind me into a conniption as molly pulled away i buckled up then got a sloppy kiss on the face from mouse who sat in the backseat his tail going thumpthumpthump against the back of the drivers seat ick i told him my lips touched dog lips get me some mouthwash get me some iodine his tail kept wagging and he smooched me again before settling down and looking content i sagged back into my seat and closed my eyes maybe two minutes passed youre welcome molly said abruptly her tone frustrated no problem harry whatever i can do to help sorry padawan i said this has been a long day already i came back from the church and saw a bunch of guys and cops were going in and out of your apartment the door was broken down and the whole place looked like it had been ransacked she shuddered and clenched the wheel god i was sure you were dead or in trouble you were about ninety percent right i said someone told the feds i was the one who blew up the office building they wanted to talk to me mollys eyes grew wide what about the swords weve got to tell my dad right away or relax i said i stashed them they should be safe for now molly puffed out a breath and subsided in relief you look terrible she said after a minute did they beat you up or something i swept my eyes left and right as we went on searching giant centipede oh molly said drawing the word out as though i had explained everything what are you looking for id been scanning the traffic around us for a dark sedan id found about thirty of them so far being a master detective and all the car of the guy who just shot at me i produced the bullet a little copperjacketed round more slender than my pinkie and a little under an inch long what is that molly asked twotwentythree remington i said i think probably whats that mean that it could have been almost anybody its the round used in most nato assault rifles a lot of hunting rifles too a thought struck me and i frowned at her hey how did you know where to find me i let mouse drive thump thump thump i was tired it took my brain a second to sort out the humor in her tone it isnt funny when everyone does it molly not ready for the burden of constant wiseassery are you she grinned widely evidently pleased at having scored the point on me i used a tracking spell and the hair you gave me in case i ever needed to find you of course she had oh right welldone um she said im not sure where were driving as far as i know your apartment is still crawling with guys priorities grasshopper first things first she eyed me burger king huh im starving i said then back to the apartment they should be gone by the time we get there and its the only place where im sure susan and martin will be trying to make contact she frowned but the wards are down its not safe there anymore is it it never was i said calmly if someone really wants to come kill you its hard to stop them all you can do is make it expensive for them to try it and hope that they decide the price is too high well sure molly said but without the wards arent you kind of having a super discount sale kid had a point anyone who ever wanted to take a whack at me had a peachy opportunity now attention shoppers discount specials on harry dresdens life slightly used no refunds limit one per customer shop smart shop smart i leaned my head against the window closed my eyes and said whatd forthill tell you what he always says that he couldnt make any promises but that hed do whatever he could to help he said to call him back in a few hours and hed see what he could get from his peeps pretty sure that roman catholic priests dont have peeps i said gravely too trendy and ephemeral like automobiles and the printing press molly didnt return fire against my comments though id made them lightly she was conflicted on the whole issue of the church which i thought was probably a fine state for her mind to be in people who ask questions and think about their faith are the last ones to embrace dogmaand the last to abandon their path once theyve set out on it i felt fairly sure that the almighty whatever name tag he had on at the moment could handle a few questions from people sincerely looking for answers hell he might even like it harry she said we could talk to my father no i said in a calm and final tone that isnt even on the table maybe it should be maybe he could help you find maggie i felt a sharp stab of anger and pain go through mea vivid memory michael carpenter knight of the sword and unflagging friend had gotten his body torn and beaten to bits trying to help me with one of my cases bearing a sword melded to one of the nails of the crucifixion given him by an archangel he had been a bulwark against very real very literal forces of evil in the world it was incredibly comforting to have him on your side wed waded into all kinds of ridiculously lethal situations together and come out of them again except that last time he was retired now and happy walking only with the aid of a cane out of the evilsmiting business and spending his time building houses and being with his family the way hed always wanted to so long as he stayed retired i gathered that he had a certain amount of immunity against the powers of supernatural evil it would not surprise me at all if there were literally an angel standing over his shoulder at all times ready to protect him and his family like the secret service but with swords and wings and halos no i said again hes out of the fight he deserves to be but if i ask for his help hell give it and hell have chosen to accept the consequences only he cant protect himself or your family from them anymore molly took a very deep breath and then nodded her worried eyes focused on the road right she said okay its just yeah im used to him being there i guess knowing that if i need him hes there to help i guess i always had it in my head that if things ever went really truly bad hed show up she said putting gentle emphasis on the last words i didnt answer her my father had died when i was young before i learned that there was anything stronger than he was id been operating without that kind of support for my whole life molly was only now realizing that in some ways she was on her own i wondered if my daughter even knew that she had a father if she knew that there was someone who wanted desperately to show up you get yourself an apartment and your plumbing goes bad hell still be there i said quietly some guy breaks your heart hell come over with ice cream a lot of people never have a dad willing to do that stuff most of the time it matters a hell of a lot more she blinked her eyes several times and nodded yeah but i got what she didnt say but when you need someone to break down the door and commence kicking ass you really need it and michael couldnt do that for his daughter anymore tell you what molly i said you ever need a rescue ill handle that part okay she looked at me her eyes blurred with tears and nodded several times she clasped my hand with hers and squeezed tight then she turned her face back to the road and pressed down on the accelerator we hit a drivethrough and went on back to my apartment at the top of the stairs that led down to my door i felt myself starting to get angry theyd hammered the door flat there were some scuff marks on it but not much more than that tough door but the wooden frame around it was shattered there would be no way to get the door mounted again without extensive repairs that were probably beyond my skill level i stood there shaking with rage it wasnt like i lived in an ivory tower or bag end it was just a dingy little hole in the ground it wasnt much of a place but it was the only home i had and i was comfortable there it was my home and rudolph and company had trashed it i closed my eyes and took a deep breath trying to calm down molly touched my shoulder for a second its not so bad i know a good carpenter i sighed and nodded i already knew that when all this was over michael would be showing up for me just hope mister will be back soon might have to board him somewhere until the door is fixed i started down the stairs i just hope that mouse let out a sudden deep growl i had my blasting rod out and my shield up in less than two seconds mouse is not an alarmist ive never heard him growl outside the presence of danger of one kind or another i checked to my right and saw no molly standing there the grasshopper had vanished from view even more quickly than id readied my defenses i swallowed id heard many variants on my dogs snarl this one wasnt as threatening as it might have beenas it would be in the presence of dark threats his body posture was a balance of tension and relaxation simple wariness rather than the fighting crouch he had exhibited before hed smelled something that he thought was extremely dangerous but not necessarily something that had to be immediately attacked and destroyed slowly i went down the steps shield at the ready my left hand extended before me my fingers in a warding gesture my thumb pinkie and index fingers stiff and spread wide apart center fingers folded my right hand held the blasting rod extended before me seething scarlet power boiling out from the carved runes and the tendril of bright flame at its tip simultaneously ready to destroy and lighting my way mouse came down the stairs with me his shoulder against my right hip his growl was a steady tone like the engine of a welltuned car i came down the stairs and saw that there was a fire crackling in the fireplace between that and my blasting rod and the stray bits of afternoon sunlight i could see fairly well the fbi could have done worse to my apartment i supposed books had been taken off my bookshelves but at least they had been stacked in piles more or less rather than tossed on the floor theyd moved my furniture around including taking the cushions off but theyd put them back incorrectly but they were back similarly my kitchen had been dismantled with a kind of cursory courtesy but not destroyed all of that was secondary in my mind next to the pair of coffinsized cocoons of what looked like green silk one of the cocoons was stuck to my ceiling the other to the wall beside the fireplace susans face protruded from the second cocoon sagging in something near unconsciousness her dark hair hanging limply on the ceiling i could see only a mans mouth and part of his chin but i was pretty sure it was martin theyd come back to my apartment presumably after the feds left and been captured mouse i murmured you smell any cordite the dog shook his head as if to shed it of water and his tags jingled me neither i said so whatever had been done to them it had happened fast before an extremely quick susan or an extremely paranoid martin could employ a weapon one of my old recliners was faced away from the door as i stepped across the threshold it spun around completely ignoring the fact that it was neither meant to spin nor mounted on any kind of mechanism that would make such a thing possible and revealed in firelight and shadow an intruder and my cat she was tall and beyond beautifullike most of the sidhe are her skin was fair and flawless her eyes enormous slightly oblique orbs of emerald green in fact they almost mirrored misters eyes as he sat primly in the sidhe womans lap her lips were full and very red and her long red hair accented with streaks of pure white spilled down in silken coils and waves over her dress of emerald green when she saw me she smiled widely and it revealed neatly pointed canine teeth both dainty and predatory ah she said warmly harry its been such a long time since weve spoken i shivered and kept my blasting rod trained on the sidhe woman she was a faerie and id learned from long experience that the folk of faerie summer and winter alike were not to be underestimated only a fool would trust thembut on the other hand only a madman would offend them they set great store by the forms of courtesy etiquette and the relationship of guest to host one flouted the proper forms at peril of rather extreme reactions from the sidhe the lords of faerie so instead of opening up with fire and hoping i got in a sucker punch i lowered my blasting rod gave the leanansidhe a precise shallow bow without ever taking my eyes off of her and said indeed its been a while godmother chapter arent you pleased with me the leanansidhe said she gestured with one manicured hand to the two cocoons then went back to caressing mister i came upon these brigands ransacking your little cave and what is the word her smile widened i apprehended them i see i said as i understand mortal business she said next there is a trial followed by what is the word mortal law uses for murder ah an execution her redgold brows furrowed briefly or is it execution and then trial she shrugged la it seems largely a matter of semantics in any case harry would you prefer to be the judge the jury or the executioner i just stared the last time id seen my faerie godmother she had been ranting and raving in a couple of distinct personalities and voices while halfentombed in a sheet of ice at the heart of the winter court since i was sixteen shed pursued me relentlessly whenever i crossed into the nevernever apparently determined to transform me into one of her hounds for crying out loud now she was all smiles and bubbles protecting my apartment offering to play courtroom with me as if i were a child and martin and susan were a pair of dolls it isnt that i dont like to see you lea i said but i cant help but wonder what it is you want merely to ensure the wellbeing of your spiritual self she replied that is what a godmother is supposed to do is it not i was sort of hoping your answer would be a bit more specific she let out a musical laugh that rang like distant church bells over snow sweet child have you learned nothing of the fae does anyone ever her slender fingers stroked misters fur do you think it so impossible dont you think it is in what way is my opinion relevant to the truth are we going to stand around here all day answering each others questions with questions her smile widened would you like that i lifted a hand capitulating she inclined her head to me a gracious victor lea was better at that sort of wordplay than me having had several centuries to practice besides losing to the guest with grace was a traditional courtesy as well what i would like i said nodding toward the cocoons is for you to please release these two they arent robbers theyre guests and this is after all my home of course child she said agreeably no harm done she snapped her fingers and the cocoons seemed to sublimate into a fine green mist that quickly dispersed susan fell limply from the wall but i was waiting to catch her and lower her gently to the floor martin plummeted from the ceiling and landed on a threadbare throw rug covering the concrete floor nobody was there to catch him which was awful just awful i examined susan quickly she had no obvious wounds she was breathing she had a pulse and that was pretty much the length and breadth of my medical knowledge i checked martin too but was disappointed he was in the same condition as susan i looked up at my godmother mister was sprawled in her lap on his back luxuriating as she traced her long nails over his chest and tummy his purr throbbed continuously through the room what did you do to them i lulled their predator spirit to sleep she said calmly poor lambs they didnt realize how much strength they drew from it mayhap this will prove a useful lesson i frowned at that you mean the vampire part of them of course i sat there for a moment stunned if the vampire infection within half vampires like susan and martin could be enchanted to sleep then it was presumably possible to do other things to it as well suppress it maybe permanently it might even be possible to destroy it i felt a door in my mind open upon a hope i had shut away a long time ago maybe i could save them both i i shook my head i searched for a way to i spent more than a i shook my head harder i spent more than a year trying to find a way to i looked at my godmother how how did you do it she looked back at me her lips curled into something that wasnt precisely a smile oh sweet child information of that sort is treasure indeed what have you to trade for such a precious gem of knowledge i clenched my teeth its always about bargains with you isnt it of course child but i always live up to my end hence my protection of you protection i demanded you spent most of a couple of decades trying to turn me into a dog only when you strayed out of the mortal world she said as if baffled at why i would be upset child we had a bargain and you had not willingly provided your portion of it she smiled widely at mouse and dogs are so charming mouse watched her with calm wary eyes his body motionless i frowned but you sold my debt to mab precisely at an excellent price i might add so now all that remains twixt thou and i is your mothers bargain unless you would prefer to enter another compact of course i shuddered no thank you i finally lowered my shields the leanansidhe beamed at me i saw you in mabs tower i said something dark flickered through her emerald eyes and she turned her face slightly away from me indeed she said quietly you saw what it means for my queen to heal an affliction what affliction a madness had beset me she whispered robbed me of myself treacherous gifts she shook her head i can think on it no more lest it make me vulnerable once again suffice to say that i am much better now she stroked a fingertip over an icy white streak in her hair the strength of my queen prevailed and my mind is mine own ensuring the wellbeing of my spiritual self i murmured then i blinked the garden the one on the other side of this place its yours indeed child she said did you not think it strange that in your turmoilstrewn time here none of your foesnot oneever sought to enter from the other side never sent a spirit given form directly into your bed your shower your refrigerator never poured a basket of asps into your closet so that they sought refuge in your shoes your boots the pockets of your clothing she shook her head sweet sweet child had you walked much farther you would have seen the mound of bones of all the things that have attempted to reach you and which i have destroyed yeah well i nearly wound up there myself la she said smiling my guardians were created to attack any intruderincluding one that looked like you we couldnt have some clever shapeshifter slipping by now could we she sighed you took a terrible toll on my primroses honestly child there are elements other than fire you know you really ought to diversify now i have two gaping maws to feed instead of one ill be more careful next time i said i should appreciate such a thing she studied me quietly it has been true for your entire lifetime child i have followed you in the spirit world created guardians and defenses pon the other side to ward your sleep to stand sentinel over your home and you still have only the beginnings of an idea of how many have tried she smiled showing her delicately pointed canine teeth again tried and failed which also explained how she was always near at hand whenever i had entered the nevernever how she would be upon my trail in seconds whenever i went in because she had been there protecting me from everything but herself now then she said her tone businesslike you left a considerable trove of equipment in my garden for safekeeping it was an emergency i had assumed that she said i will of course safeguard it or return it as you wish and should you perish i will deliver it to an heir of your designation i let out a weary laugh you of course you will i eyed mouse what do you think boy mouse looked at me and then at lea then he sat downbut still kept watching her carefully yeah i said i think that too the leanansidhe smiled widely it is good that you have taken my lessons to heart child it is a cold and uncaring universe we live in only with strength of body and mind can you hope to control your own fate be wary of everyone even your protector i sat there for a moment thinking my mother had prepared protection for me with considerable foresight she had anticipated my eventually looking for and finding my half brother thomas had she prepared other things for me as well things i hadnt yet guessed at how would i pass on a legacy to my child if i knew that i wasnt going to be alive to see it happen what kind of legacy did i have other than a collection of magical gear that anyone could probably accumulate without help in time my only real treasure was knowledge ye gods and little fishes but knowledge was a dangerous legacy i imagined what might have happened if at the age of fifteen i had learned aspects of magic that had not come to me on their own until i was over thirty it would have been like handing a child a cocked and loaded gun a safety mechanism was neededsomething that would prevent the child from attaining said store of knowledge until she was mature enough to handle it wisely something simple but telling for a child a wizard child i smiled something like being able to admit ones own ignorance expressed in the simplest possible form asking a question and as i now knew my mother had not been called lefay for nothing godmother i asked calmly did my mother leave anything for you to give me when i was ready for it a book a map lea took a very slow deep breath her eyes luminous well she murmured well well well she did didnt she yes indeed but i was told to give you fair warning it is a deadly legacy if you accept it you accept what comes with it which is i asked she shrugged a shoulder it varies from one individual to the next your mother lost the ability to sleep soundly it might be worse for you or it might be nothing i thought about that for a moment and then nodded i want it lea never took her eyes off me she lifted her empty palm closed her fingers over it and opened them again a small gleaming ruby bright as a drop of blood carved in a pentagon lay in her hand it is the sum of her knowledge of the ways lea said quietly every path every shortcut every connection she developed enough skill at searching them out that she was eventually able to predict them ways may change from decade to decade but your mother knew where they were and where they would be very few of mine own kind can say as much she narrowed her eyes that knowledge is the burden i hold in my hand child mine own belief is that it will destroy thee the choice must needs be thine i stared at the gem for a long moment forcing myself to breathe slowly all the ways the ability to travel around the world without concern for geography knowledge like that could have won the war with the red court almost before it began whoever possessed that knowledge could regard laws with utter impunity avoid retribution from mortal authorities or supernatural nations alike go anywhere escape from damned near anything gather more information than anyone else possibly could hells bells that gleaming little gem was a subtle strength that had the potential to be as potent as any i had seen such power such temptation i wondered if id be able to handle it i am not a saint at the same time i had never seen a tool so obviously intended to help a man show up for his little girl no matter where she was i could go to her go to her and get away clean maggie i reached out and took the gem from my godmothers hand chapter harry molly called from up in the living room i think theyre waking up i grunted and lifted my pentacle necklace to examine it the little pentagonal ruby had been quite obviously cut for this particular piece of jewelry or it had been before id been forced to use the necklace as a silver bullet my little pentacle the fivepointed star within a circle had been warped by the extremes of stress id subjected it to id been straightening it out with the set of jewelers tools i used to update little chicago the jewel abruptly snapped into the center of the pentacle as if into a socket i shook the necklace several times and the gem stayed put but there was no point in taking chances i turned it over and smeared the whole back with a big blob of adhesive it might not look pretty from the front after it had dried but i was pressed for time thatll do pig i muttered to myself i looked up to bobs shelf where mister was sprawling using a couple of paperbacks for pillows while he amused himself dragging his claws through the mounded candle wax i reached up to rub his ears with my fingertips setting him to purring and promised myself i would get bob back soon for the time being he was like the swords too valuable and too dangerous to leave unguarded in leas bloodthirsty garden they were probably safer than they had been in my apartment in the first place i left my mothers amulet and the glittering ruby sitting on my worktable so that the glue could dry and padded up the stepladder i had hefted susan up onto the sofa and fetched a pillow for her head and a blanket molly had managed to roll martin onto a strip of camping foam and given him a pillow and a blanket too mouse had settled down on the floor near martin to sleep even though his eyes were closed and he was snoring slightly his ears twitched at every sound while i had been in the lab molly had been cleaning up she probably knew where all the dishes went better than i did or she was reorganizing them completely either way i was sure that the next time i just wanted to fry one egg i wouldnt be able to find the little skillet until after i had already used the big skillet and cleaned it off i hunkered down next to susan and as i did she stirred and muttered softly then she jerked in a swift breath through her nose her eyes suddenly opening wide as if she were panicked easy i said at once susan its harry youre safe it seemed to take several seconds for my words to sink in then she relaxed again blinked a few times and turned her head toward me what happened to me she asked you were mistaken for an intruder i said you were hit with a form of magic that made you sleep she frowned tiredly oh i was dreaming yeah i was dreaming that the curse was gone that i was human she shook her head with a bitter little smile i thought i was done having that one martin here martin slurred im all right but maybe not for long i said the apartments wards are down were naked here well martin said in an acidic voice i think we learned our lesson about where that leads susan rolled her eyes but the look she gave me a little hint of a smile and a level stare with her dark eyes was positively smoldering yeah that had been pretty good did you guys find out about our tail i asked tails as it turns out three different local investigative agencies martin supplied they were paid cash up front to follow us from the time we arrived they all gave a different description of the woman who hired them all of them were too beautiful to believe arianna i asked martin grunted probably the oldest of them can wear any flesh mask they wish and go abroad in daylight hidden from the sun in the shadow of their own mask i lifted my eyebrows that was news i wasnt even sure the wardens had that kind of information martin must have been a little groggy from his naptime how long were we out susan asked i got here about five hours ago suns down she closed her eyes for a moment as if bracing herself for something and nodded all right martin and i need to get moving where i asked the airport martin said we should be able to be in nevada by very late tonight or early tomorrow morning then we can move on the warehouse and look for more information we discussed it harry susan said quietly you cant take a plane and were counting the minutes a jet will get us there in about seven hours the car will take two days theres no time for that yeah i can see your reasoning i said martin stood up creakily and stretched entering the facility may require a reconnaissance period well have to determine its weaknesses patrol pacing and so on before we i interrupted him by slapping a piece of notebook paper down on the coffee table the storage facility is set into the side of a stone hill there are some portable units stored outside in a yard with a twelvefoot razorwire fence a road leads into the hill and down into what i presume to be caverns either created for storage space or appropriated after a mining operation closed i pointed at the notebook paper to different points on the sketch as i mentioned each significant feature there is a single watchtower with one guard armed with a longbarreled assault rifle with a big scope there are two men and a dog walking a patrol around the perimeter fence with those little assault rifles carbines molly said brightly from the kitchen and fragmentation grenades they arent in a hurry takes them about twenty minutes then they go inside for a drink and come back out there are security cameras here here and here and enough cars in the employee parking lot to make me think that the underground portion of the facility is probably pretty big and probably has some kind of barracks for their security team i nodded thats about it on the surface but theres no way we can get inside to scout it out ahead of time looks pretty straightforward we move up to it under a veil i shut down the communications we use a distraction to draw everyones attention and when the reinforcements come running out were in hopefully we can find a way to lock them outside after that its just a matter of i trailed off as i looked up to find martin and susan staring at me their jaws kind of hanging limply what i said how martin began where susan said molly burst out into a fit of giggles she didnt even try to hide how do i know i reached over to the table and held up an old set of binoculars id left sitting there i went over to take a look took me about fifteen minutes one way i could bring you if you want but its cool if you guys want to take the plane ill wait for you martin stared hard at me you susan began something like anger in her tone then she threw back her head and laughed you insufferable arrogant pig she said fondly i shouldnt have underestimated you you dont always perform gracefully when everything is on the linebut youre always there arent you i hope so i said quietly i stood up again better eat something ive got some things finishing up in the lab that might help us well go in one hour chapter we rolled out in fiftyfive minutes the blue beetle was full but we werent going more than a half dozen blocks the entry into the proper way was in an alleyway behind a brownstone apartment building in a fairly typical chicago neighborhood it was getting late so there wasnt much traffic and mouse ghosted along behind us staying mostly in the shadows and easily keeping pace with the car which speaks to my dogs mightiness and not to my cars wimpiness seriously molly pulled up to the mouth of the alley and stopped she looked nervously around as we unloaded from the car i gave susan a hand out of the tiny backseat and then held the door open as mouse jumped up into the passenger seat i ruffled his ears and leaned down to speak to molly go get coffee or something give us about an hour an hour and a half tops well be back by then what if you arent molly asked she reached one hand over to mouse in an unconscious gesture burying her fingers in his fur what do i do then if we dont show up by then go on back home to your folks place ill contact you there but what if molly i said firmly you cant plan for everything or you never get started in the first place get a move on and dont take any lip from the dog hes been uppity lately okay harry she said still unhappily she pulled out into the street again and mouse turned his head to watch us as she drove away poor kid susan said she doesnt like being left behind i grunted that kids got enough power to take all three of us down if she caught us off guard i said her strength isnt an issue im not talking about that obviously i grunted what do you mean susan frowned at me briefly and then her eyebrows rose dear god you dont realize it realize what she shook her head one corner of her mouth crooked into the same smile i remembered so well it made my heart twitch if such a thing is possible molly has it bad for you harry i frowned no she doesnt we settled that early on isnt happening susan shrugged a shoulder maybe you settled it but she didnt shes in love is not i said scowling she goes on dates and stuff i said she was in love not dead her expression went neutral or halfdead she stared after the vanished car for a moment and said can i share something with you that ive learned in the past few years i guess she turned to me her expression sober life is too short harry and theres nowhere near enough joy in it if you find it grab it before its gone it cost susan something to say that she hid it well but not as well as i knew her giving breath to those thoughts had caused her very real pain i was going to disagree again but hesitated then i said i never stopped loving you never wanted you to be gone she turned a little away from me letting her hair fall across her face as a curtain then she swallowed thickly and said her voice trembling slightly same here doesnt mean we get to be together no i said i guess not she suddenly balled her fists and straightened her spine i cant do this not right now weve got to focus i she shook her head and started walking she went to the end of the block to stand there taking deep slow breaths i glanced at martin who stood leaning against the wall of a building his expression of course bland what i snapped at him you think what youre feeling about your daughter is rage dresden it isnt he jerked his chin at susan that is she knew the mendozas the foster parents and loved them like family she walked into their house and found them she found their children the vampires had quite literally torn them limb from limb one of the mendozas four children was three years old two were near maggies age i said nothing my imagination showed me terrible pictures it took us half an hour to find all the pieces martin continued calmly we had to put them back together like a jigsaw puzzle and the whole time the blood thirst was driving us both mad despite the fact that she knew those people despite her terror for her daughter imagine that for a moment imagine susan standing there filled with the urge to rip into the bloody limb with her teeth even though she knew that little dismembered leg might have been her daughters picture that at that point i didnt think i could avoid it it was only when the puzzle was finished that we realized that maggie had been taken martin continued his words steady and polite shes barely holding on if she loses control people are going to die she might be one of them martins eyes went hard and absolutely cold so i would take it as a fucking courtesy if you wouldnt torture her by stirring up her emotions five minutes before we kick down the door of a highsecurity facility i looked over my shoulder at susan she was still facing away from us but she was in the act of briskly pulling her hair back into a tail i didnt know i said in this situation your emotions are liabilities martin said they wont help rodriguez they wont help the little girl i suggest you postpone indulging them until this is all over until what is all over susan asked returning uh the trip i said turning to lead them into the alley it wont take us longabout thirty seconds of walking down a level hallway but its dark and you have to hold your breath and nose the whole way why susan asked its full of methane gas and carbon monoxide among others if you use a light source you run the risk of setting off an explosion susans eyebrows rose what about your amulet i shook my head the light from that is actually glah its more complicated than you need to know suffice it to say that i feel there would be a very very small possibility that it might make the atmosphere explode like those static electricity warnings at the gas stations why take the chance ah susan said you want us to walk blind through a tunnel filled with poisonous gases that could explode at the smallest spark yeah and youre sure this is a good idea its a terrible idea i said but its the fastest way to the storage facility i lifted my fingertips to touch the red stone on my amulet as i neared the location of the way it was an old brickedover doorway into the ground level of the apartment building a voice with no apparent source began to speak quietlya womans voice throaty and calm my mothers voice she died shortly after my birth but i was certain as sure as i had been of anything in my life it was her voice it made me feel warm listening to it like an old favorite piece of music that you havent heard for years the hallway on the other side is full of dangerous levels of methane and carbon monoxide among other gases the mixture appears to be volatile and in the other side you can never be sure exactly which energies might or might not trigger an explosion fortytwo walking steps to the far end which opens on a ridge outside corwin nevada there was a moment of silence and then the same voice began to speak again panting shaking and out of breath notation the hallway is not entirely abandoned something tried to grab me as i came through she coughed several times notation secundus dont wear a dress the next time you need to go to corwin dummy some farmers going to get a show maybe it was a grue i murmured smiling what did you say susan asked nothing i said never mind i put a hand on the doorway and immediately felt a kind of yielding elasticity beneath my fingertips the separation between the world of flesh and spirit was weak here i took a deep breath laid out a fairly mild effort of will and murmured aparturum a circle of blackness began to expand from the center of my palm beneath my hand rapidly swelling overlaying the wall itself i didnt let it get too big the gate would close on its own eventually but smaller gates closed more quickly and i didnt want some poor fool going through it present company excluded of course i glanced back to susan and martin susan grab on to my coat martin you grab hers take a deep breath and lets get this done fast and quiet i turned to the way took a deep breath and then strode forward moms gem hadnt mentioned that it was flipping hot in there when id stepped into the hallway on the first trip i felt like i was inside about three saunas nested together like those russian dolls i found the righthand wall and started walking counting my steps i made them a bit shorter than normal and nailed the length of moms stride more accurately this time i hit the way out at fortythree another effort of will and a whispered word and i opened that gate as well emerging into a cold mountain wind and late twilight susan and martin came out with me and we all spent a moment letting out our pentup breaths we were in desert mountains covered with tough stringy plants and quick quiet beasts the gate behind me another circle stood in the air in front of what looked like the entrance to an old mine that had been bricked over a long time ago which way martin said half mile this way i said and set out overland it was an awfully good hideyhole i had to admit we were out so far in the desert hills that the commute to nowhere was a long one the facilities had been cut into a granite shelf at the end of a box canyon there was a single road in and the floor of the canyon was wide and flat and empty of any significant features like friendly rocks that one might try to take cover behind the walls of the canyon had been blasted sheer no one was coming down that way without a hundred yards of rope or a helicopter or a wizard all right i said the night was growing cold my breath steamed in the air as i spoke take these drink half of em save the rest i passed out test tubes filled with light blue liquid to martin and susan what is it susan asked a parachute i said technically a flight potion but i watered it down it should get us to the valley floor safely martin eyed his tube and then me harry susan began the last time i drank one of your potions it became awkward i rolled my eyes drop into a roll at the end then i drank away half of my potion and stepped off the edge of the cliff flight is a difficult thing for a wizard to pull off everyones magic works a little differently and that means that when it comes to flying the only way to manage it is by trial and error and since flying generally means moving very quickly a long way above the ground wouldbe aeromancers tended to cut their careers and lives short at the first error flying is hardbut falling is easy i dropped down accelerating for a second then maintaining a pace of somewhere around fifteen miles an hour it didnt take long to hit the desert floor and i dropped into a roll to spread out the impact energy i stood up dusting myself off susan and martin landed nearby and also rose nice susan said she bounced up in the air experimentally and smiled when her descent was slowed very cool then we drink more to climb out should make that slope a piece of cake i said but well need to move fast potion will last us maybe twenty minutes susan nodded adjusting the straps on the small pack she wore got it get close to me i said i cant veil all three of us unless were all within arms reach they did and after a few seconds of focus and concentration i brought up a veil around us that should hide us from view and disperse our heat signature as well it wouldnt be perfect wed still show up on a nightvision scope to one degree or another i was counting on the fact that men guarding a building that isolated could not possibly deal with problems on a regular basis theyd have a very comfortable reliable routine which was exactly the sort of thing to take the edge off a sentrys wariness thats just human nature i beckoned and the three of us began approaching the facility there was no fluttering from shadow to shadow or camouflage face paint the veiling spell took care of that we just walked over the uneven ground and focused on staying close together that part may have been more fun if martin werent there we got to within thirty yards of the fence and i paused i lifted my staff pointed it at the first sentry camera and whispered hexus i wasnt used to holding something as demanding as a veil in one hand while performing another working with the othereven such an easy spell as a technology hex for a second i thought id lose the veil but then it stabilized again the lights on the camera had gone out we moved around the perimeter while i hexed the other two cameras into useless junk but just as id taken down camera number three susan gripped my arm and pointed the foot patrol was moving by on their sweep the dog will get our scent susan said martin drew a short pistol from beneath his jacket and screwed a silencer to its end no i half growled i fished in the pocket of my duster and found the second potion id made while preparing for the trip it was in a delicate round globe of glass about as thick as a piece of paper i flipped the globe toward the path of the oncoming dog and heard it break with a little crackle the two patrolmen and the dog went by the area where id left my surprise and the dog snuffled the new scent with thorough interest at a jerk of the lead the dog hurried to catch up to the guards and all three of them went by without so much as glancing at us dogll have his senses of smell and hearing back in the morning i murmured these guys are just doing a job we arent going to kill them for that martin looked nonplussed he kept the pistol in his hand we circled around to where the fence met the canyon wall opposite the large parking lot susan got out a pair of wire cutters she opened them and prepared to cut through when martin snatched her wrist preventing her from touching the fence electricity he whispered dresden i grunted now that hed pointed it out i thought i could feel it toothe almost inaudible hum of current on the move making the hairs on my arms stand up hexing something with a microchip in it is simple impeding the flow of electricity through a conductive material is considerably more difficult i pitched my best hex at the wiring where it connected to a power line and was rewarded with the sudden scent of burned rubber martin reached out and touched the fence with the back of his hand no electricity burned him all right susan whispered as she began clipping us a way in cutting a wire only when the gusting wind reached a crescendo and covered the sound of the clippers at work then waiting for the next gust wheres that distraction i winked at her lifted my blasting rod thrust it between links of fence in front of us and aimed carefully then i checked the tower guard to be sure he was looking away and whispered fuego fuego fuego fuego tiny spheres of sullen red light flickered out across the compound and into the parking lot opposite my aim had been good the little spheres hissed and melted their way through the rear quarter panel of several vehicles and burned on into the fuel tanks beneath the results were predictable a gas tank explosion isnt as loud as an actual bomb going off but when youre standing a few yards away from it it could be hard to tell there were several hollow booming sounds and light blazed up from the cars that had been hit as flames roared up and consumed them the guard in the tower started screaming into a radio but apparently could get no reply no surprise the second camera had been positioned atop his tower and the hex that took it out probably got his radio too while he was busy susan martin and i slipped through the opening in the fence and made our way into the shadows at the base of one of the portable storage units a car parked between two flaming vehicles went up with another whump of ignition and it got even brighter a few seconds later red lights started to flash at several points around the facility and a warning klaxon began to sound the giant metal door to the interior of the facility began to roll upward just like a garage door the two patrollers and their temporarily handicapable german shepherd came running out first and were followed in a moment by nearly a dozen other guys in the same uniforms or at least in portions of them it looked like some of them had hopped out of bed and tossed on whatever they could reach several were dragging fire extinguishers as if they were going to be useful against fires that large good luck with that boys the moment the last of them was past our position and staring agog at the burning automobiles i hurried forward putting everything i had into the veil trusting that martin and susan would stay close they did we went through the big garage door and down a long ramp into the facility go ahead martin said he hurried to a control panel on the wall and whipped out some kind of multitool ill shut the door as long as we can get it open on the way out i muttered yes dresden martin said crisply id been doing this for sixty years before you were born better drop the invisibility thing harry susan said what were looking for might be on a computer so so ill hold off on the magic until we know got it we went deeper into the facility the caves ran very deep back into the stone and wed gone down maybe a hundred yards after moving about four hundred yards forward on a spiraling ramp the air grew colder to the ambient underground average more than that though it gained a definite spiritual chill malevolent energy hovered around us slow and thick like half frozen honey there was a gloating miserly quality to it bringing to my mind images of old smaug lying in covetous slumber upon his bed of treasure that then was the reason the red court had hidden its dark treasures here ambient energy like this wasnt directly dangerous to anyonebut with only the mildest of efforts it would protect and preserve the magical implements jealously against the passing of time the ramp opened up into a larger area that reminded me of the interior corridors of a sports stadium three doors faced us one was hanging slightly open and read quarters the other was shut and read administration the last a large steel vault door was labeled storage a concrete loading dock with its edges painted in yellow and black caution stripes stretched before us doubtless at just the right height to make use of the large transport van parked nearby oh and there were two guards standing in front of the vault door with some hostilelooking black shotguns susan didnt hesitate she blurred forward with nearly supernatural speed and one of the guards was down before he realized he was in a fight the other had already spun toward me with his weapon and opened fire in his rush to shoot he hadnt aimed people make a big thing about shotguns hitting absolutely everything you point them at but it aint so it still takes considerable skill to use a shotgun well under pressure and in his panic the guard didnt have it pellets buzzed around me like angry wasps as i took three swift steps to my left and threw myself through the open barracks door carrying me out of his line of fire from outside there was a crack of something hard maybe the butt of a gun hitting a skull and susan said clear i came out of the emptied barracks nonchalantly the two guards lay unconscious at susans feet god im good i said susan nodded and tossed both guns away from the unconscious men best distraction ever i went to her and eyed the door how we getting through that we arent she said she produced a small kit of locksmith tools and went to the administration door ignoring the vault completely we dont need their treasures we just need the receipts id learned a little bit about how to tickle a lock but susan had obviously learned more enough so that she took one look at the lock pulled a lock gun from her kit and went through it damned near as fast as if shed had a key she swung the door open and said wait here and dont break anything i put my hands behind my back and tried to look righteous a smile lit her face fast and fierce and she vanished into the office i walked over to the barracks my guns had been riding with the rest of my contraband when it got buried in leas garden and i didnt like going unarmed on general principles magic is pretty damned cool when things get rowdy but there are times when theres no replacing a firearm they are excellent if specialized tools two seconds of looking around showed me a couple of possibilities and i picked up a big semiautomatic and a couple of loaded clips i tucked them into a pocket of the duster then i picked up the assault rifle from its rack and found that two spare magazines were being held in this socklike device that went over the rifles stock rifles werent my forte but i knew enough to check the chamber and see that no round was in it i made sure the safety was on and slung the assault rifle over my shoulder on its nylonweave strap then i went back over to administration and waited outside susan was cursing in streaks of blue and purple and vermilion inside she appeared a moment later and spat nothing someone was here first they erased everything related to the shipment less than three hours ago what about the paper copy i asked harry susan said have you ever heard of the paperless office yeah i said its like bigfoot someone says he knows someone who saw him but you dont ever actually see him yourself i paused though i suppose i actually have seen bigfoot and he seems like a decent guy but the metaphor still stands remember who owns this place you think someone like the duchess is a computer whiz trust me you get to be over a couple of hundred years old you get copies of everything in triplicate susan arched an eyebrow and nodded okay come on then we went in and ransacked the office there were plenty of files but we had the identification number of the shipment of magical artifacts if it matters and it was possible to flick through them very rapidly we came up all zeroes again whoever had covered up the back trail had done it well dammit susan said quietly her voice shook easy i said easy we arent out of options yet this was the only lead we had she said i touched her arm briefly and said trust me she smiled at me a little i could see the strain in her eyes come on i said lets get out of here before the cavalry arrives oh here i passed her the assault rifle thats thoughtful of you she said smiling more widely her hands went over the weapon checking the chamber as i had only a lot more smoothly and quickly i didnt get you anything i turned and eyed the moving van then went back to its cargo doors here open this door for me she got out her tools and did it in less time than it took to say it there were several long boxes in the van standing vertically and i realized after a moment that they were garment boxes i opened one up and and found a long mantled cloak made from some kind of white and green feathers hanging from a little crossbar in the top of the garment box it was heavy easily weighing more than fifty pounds i found a stick studded with chips of razorsharp obsidian in there too its handle carved with pictographs i couldnt read this particular form of writing very well but i recognized itand recognized that it was no ancient artifact either it had been carved in the past few decades this is mayan ceremonial costume i murmured frowning why is it loaded up on the next truck out the answer jumped at me i turned to susan and we traded a look that conveyed her comprehension as well she went to the front of the van and popped it open she started grabbing things shoving them into a nylon gym bag that she had apparently found in the truck what did you get i asked later no time she said we hurried back up the ramp to martin the big door looked like it was having a tugofwar with itself it would shudder and groan and try to rise and then martin would do something with a pair of wires in the dismantled control panel and it would slam down again i saw guards trying to stick their guns beneath the door for a quick shot but they wound up being driven back by martins silenced pistol finally martin said as we came up to him theyre about to get through damn i said i figured theyd be firefighting longer than that i looked around the barren tunnel i was tired and shaking if i were fresh i would have no trouble with the idea of slugging it out with a bunch of guys with machine gunsprovided they were all in front of me but i was tired and then some the slightest wavering in concentration and a shield would become porous and flexible id be likely to take a bunch of bullets the duster might handle most of them but not forever and i wasnt wearing it over my head plan b i said okay right we need a plan b if we only had a wheelbarrow that would be something susan let out a puff of laughter and then i turned to her my eyes alight we have a great big truck susan said then why didnt you list that among our assets i said in a bad british accent go susan vanished back down the tunnel moving scaryfast martin i said get behind me he did as i lifted my left arm and brought up a purely physical shield and within five or six seconds the door had lifted two feet off the ground and a couple of prone shooters opened up on the first thing they sawme i held the shield against the bullets as the door continued to rise and they exploded into concentric circles of light spread across the front of the shields otherwise invisible surface the strain of holding the shield grew as more of the guards opened fire i saw one poor fellow take a ricochet in the belly and go down but i didnt have the time or the attention to spare to feel sorry for him i ground my teeth and hung on to the shield as the guards kept a constant pressure on it then there was a roar of large engines and susan drove the cargo truck forward like some kind of berserk bison charging the group of guards blocking the road out men screamed and sprinted trying to avoid the truck they made it i didnt need martin to tell me to move as the truck slammed into a turn throwing its rear end in a deadly skidding arch we both sprinted for it in the confusion and flung ourselves up into the cargo compartment which susan had thoughtfully left open one of the more alert guards tried the same trick but martin saw him coming aimed the little pistol and shot him in the leg the man screamed and fell down as the truck picked up speed susan stomped the pedal flat and metal and razor wire screamed as she drove through a section of the fencing and out onto the open valley floor she immediately turned it toward our escape point and the truck began to bounce and rattle as it raced away from the facility after that it was simple we went back to our ascension point drank our watereddown flying potions and bounded up the rocky face of the valley wall like mountain goats or possibly squirrels either way it made the eightydegree incline feel about as difficult to handle as a long stairway harry susan said panting as we reached the top would you burn that truck for me my pleasure i said and dealt with the cargo truck the same way i had the cars in the parking lot thirty seconds later it huffed out its own explosion and susan stood there nodding okay she said good hopefully that makes it harder for them to do whatever theyre going to do what did you find martin asked mayan ceremonial gear i said not focus items but the other stuff the props they were on the truck to be shipped out next susan rustled in the nylon bag and held up a sheet of paper bill of lading she said shipment number the next outgoing package after the original shipment and it was initiated two days after the focus items went out martin narrowed his eyes thinking if it was going to the same place as the first shipment it means that we can make a pretty good guess that wherever its going its within two days drive i said that gives the vampires time enough to get the first shipment realize that some things got left out and call in a second shipment to bring in the missing articles martin nodded so where are they susan was going through the contents of the bag shed appropriated mexico she said she held up a us passport presumably falsified since most people dont tote their passports around in manila envelopes along with a wallet full of newlooking mexican cash they were planning on taking those cloaks and things to mexico i grunted and started walking back to the way martin and susan fell in behind me harry will destroying that gear ruin what theyre doing itll inconvenience them i said quietly not much more than that the actual magic doesnt need the costumes its the people performing it who need them so any replacement sixtypound cloak of parrot feathers will doand if they want it badly enough they can do the ritual even without replacing them theyll know who was here martin said too many men saw us interior cameras might have gotten something too good i said i want them to know i want them to know that their safe places arent safe susan made a growling sound that seemed to indicate agreement even martins mouth turned up into a chilly little smile so other than somewhat discomfiting the sleep of some of the red court what did we actually accomplish here we know where theyre going to do their ritual susan said i nodded mexico well martin said i suppose its a start chapter mrs spunkelcrief was a fantastic landlady she lived on the ground floor of the old house she rarely left her home was mostly deaf and generally didnt poke her nose into my business as long as my rent check came inwhich it pretty much always did these days on time or a bit early a small army of crazystrong zombies had assaulted my home without waking her up probably because theyd had the grace to do it after her bedtime which was just after sundown but i guess the visit from the cops and the fbi had been even louder than that because as molly pulled the blue beetle into the little gravel parking lot i saw her coming up the stairs from my apartment one at a time leaning heavily on her cane she wore a soft blue nightgown and a shawl to ward against the october chill in the night and her bright blue eyes flicked around alertly there you are she said irritably ive been calling your house all evening harry sorry mrs s i said ive been out i dont think she could make out the words very well but she wasnt stupid obviously youve been out she said what happened to your nice new door its wideopen if we get another one of those freak thunderstorms the rain will pour right in and well have mold climbing up the walls before you can say jack robinson i spread my hands and talked as loudly as i could without actually shouting there was a mixup with the police no she said the lease is quite clear you are responsible for any damages inflicted on the apartment while you are a tenant i sighed and nodded ill fix it tomorrow oh not so much sorrow as surprise harry youre a good boy generally she peered from me to molly susan and martin most of the time and you help out so when the weather is bad i smiled at her in what i hoped was an apologetic fashion ill take care of the door maam good she said i thought you would ill come check in a few days mouse emerged from the darkness not even breathing very hard from running to keep up with the beetle he immediately went over to mrs spunkelcrief sat and offered her his right paw to shake she was so tiny and the dog so large that she hardly had to bend down to grip his paw she beamed broadly at mouse shook and then patted his head fondly you can tell a lot about a man from how he treats his dog she said mouse walked over to me sat down panting happily and leaned his shoulders against my hip affectionately all but knocking me down mrs spunkelcrief nodded satisfied and turned to walk away then she paused muttered something to herself and turned back around again she dug into her robes pocket and produced a white envelope i almost forgot this was lying on your stairs boy i took it from her with a polite nod thank you maam welcome she shivered and wrapped her shawl a little more tightly around her what is the world coming to people breaking down doors i shot a glance at molly who nodded and immediately went to mrs spunkelcriefs side offering an arm for support my landlady beamed up at her saying bless you child my cane arm got tired on the way down molly began helping her back up the little ramp to her apartments front door mouse immediately went to the bottom of the stairs his nose questing then he turned back to me tail fanning the air gently no surprises lurked in my apartment i went on down into it waving the candles and fireplace to life with a murmur and a gesture tearing open the envelope as i went to the fireplace to open it inside was a piece of folded paper and another smaller envelope upon which was written in luccios flowing writing read me first i did if you are receiving this letter it is because someone has rendered me unable to contact you you must presume that i have been taken out of play entirely the bearer of this note is the person i trust the most among every warden stationed at edinburgh i cannot know the particulars of my neutralization but you can trust his description implicitly and i have found his judgment to be uncommonly sound in subjective matters good luck harry a i stared at the note for a moment then i unfolded the second piece of paper very slowly this one was written in blocky letters so precise that they almost resembled a printed font rather than handwriting hullo dresden luccio wnted me to bring this note to you in the event something happened to her no idea what her note says but im to give you whatever information i can im afraid it isnt good news the council seems to have gone quite mad after your appearance at cristoss grandstand a number of ugly things happened several young wardens were caught debating amongst themselves about whether or not they should simply destroy the duchess in edinburgh to ensure that the war continuedafter all they reasoned the vampires wouldnt be suing for peace if they could still fight on cristoss orders they were arrested and detained by older members of the council none of whom were wardens in order to prevent them from destabilizing diplomatic deliberations ramirez heard about what had happened and i suspect you can guess that his spanishbywayofamerica reaction was more passionate than rational he and a few friends only one of whom had any real intelligence hammered their way into the wing where the wardens were being detainedat which point every single one of them except for the genius naturally was captured and similarly imprisoned its quiet desperation here no one can seem to locate anyone on the senior council except cristos who is quite busily trying to save us from ourselves by sucking up to duchess arianna the wardens chain of command is a smashing disaster at the moment captain luccio went to cristos to demand the release of her people and is at this time missing as are perhaps forty percent of the seniormost wardens she asked me to tell you dresden that you should not return to edinburgh under any circumstances until the senior council sorts this mess out she isnt sure what would happen to you she also wanted me to tell you that you were on your own i will send dispatches to you as events unfoldassuming i dont vanish too steed pswhy yes i can in fact capitalize any words i desire the language is english i am english therefore mine is the opinion which matters colonial heathen i read over the letter again more slowly then i sat down on the fireplace mantel and swallowed hard steed was an appellation id stuck on warden chandler who was a fixture of security in edinburgh one of the white councils home guards and once i had thought upon it one of the guys who id always seen operating near anastasia and in positions of trust standing as the sole sentinel at a post that normally required half a dozen brewing the wardens and their captain their tea he and i had been the only ones present at the conversation where id tacked that nickname on him thanks to the natty suit and bowler hed been wearing and the umbrella hed accessorizedor maybe it was accessorised in englandwith so the signature itself served as his bona fides the flippant tone was very like chandler as well i also knew anastasias handwriting and besides the paper on which her letter was written was scented with one of the very gentle very subtle perfumes she preferred the message was as legitimate as it was likely to get under the circumstances which meant we were in real trouble the white council carried a fearsome reputation not simply because of its capability of engaging in direct action against an enemy but because it wielded a great deal of economic power i mean it doesnt take a genius to get rich after two hundred and fifty years of compounded interest and open trading there was an entire brigade of economic warriors for the white council who constantly sought ways to protect the councils investments against hostile economic interests sponsored by other longlived beings like vampires money like that could buy a lot of influence not only that but the council could make the world a miserable place for someone who had earned their displeasure in about a million ways without ever throwing magic directly at someone there were people in the council who could play dirty with the most fiendish minds in history taken as a whole it seemed like a colossus an institution as fixed and unmoving as a vast and ancient tree filled with life with strength its roots sunk deep into the earth a survivor of the worst storms the world had offered it but all of it the power the money the influence revolved around a critical core conceptevery member of the white council acted in concert or at least that was the face that was supposed to be presented to the outside world and it was mostly true we might squabble and doubledeal one another in peacetime but when there was an enemy at hand we closed ranks hell theyd even done that with me and most of the council thought that i was the nextbest thing to darth vader but at the end of the day i think a lot of them secretly liked the idea of having vader on the team when the monsters showed up they didnt love me never would and i didnt need them to love me to fight beside them when things got hairy the council moved together except now we werent doing it i looked at the folded letter in my hands and had the sudden instinctive impression that i was watching an enormous tree begin to fall slowly at first made to seem so by its sheer sizebut falling nonetheless to the ruin of anything sheltered beneath its boughs i was pretty tired which probably explained why i didnt have any particular emotional reaction to that line of thought it should have scared the hell out of me for a laundry list of reasons but it didnt susan came over to stand near me harry what is it i stared at the fire the white council cant help us find maggie i said quietly there are things happening theyll be of no use to us after all they had wrongly inflicted upon me after all the times i had risked my neck for them when i needed them truly needed their help they were not there i watched my hands crush the letters and envelopes without telling them to do it i threw them into the fire and glowered as they burned i didnt notice that the fire in the fireplace had risen to triple its normal height until the bluewhite brightness of the flames made me shade my eyes against them turning my face slightly away was like twisting the spigot of a gas heaterthe fire immediately died back down to normal size control moron i warned myself control youre a loaded gun no one spoke martin had settled down on one of the sofas and was cleaning his little pistol on the coffee table molly stood at the woodburning stove stirring a pot of something susan sat down next to me not quite touching and folded her hands in her lap what do we have left persons i said quietly i dont understand susan said as a whole people suck i replied but a person can be extraordinary i appealed to the council i told them what arianna was doing i went to that group of people looking for help you saw what happened so next i talk to individuals who she asked me quietly persons who can help i felt her dark eyes on me serious and deep some of them arent very nice i think very few of them in fact i said she swallowed i dont want you to endanger yourself this situation wasnt of your making if theres a price to be paid i should be the one to pay it doesnt work like that i said hes right martin confirmed for example you paid the price for his failure to sufficiently discourage you from investigating the red court i made my choice susan said but not an informed one i said quietly you made assumptions you shouldnt have because you didnt have enough information i could have given it to you but i didnt and that situation wasnt of your making she shook her head her expression resigned theres no point in all of us fighting to hold the blame stick i guess martin began to run a cleaning patch through his pistols barrel on a short ramrod and spoke in the tone of a man repeating a mantra stay on mission susan nodded stay on mission where do we start harry not we i said me im going down to the lab while you four stay up here and watch for trouble make sure you warn me when it shows up when it shows up susan asked been that kind of day molly turned from the stove her expression worried what are you going to do boss i felt as if my insides were all cloying black smoke but i summoned up enough spirit to wink at molly i gotta make a few longdistance calls chapter i went to my lab and started cleaning off my summoning circle id knocked a few things onto it in the course of sweeping up anything incriminating the fbi or rudolph had added a bit to the mess i pushed everything away from the circle and then swept it thoroughly with a broom when you use a circle as a part of ritual magic its integrity is paramount any object that falls across it or breaks its plane would collapse the circles energy dust and other small particles wouldnt collapse a circle but they did degrade its efficiency after i was done sweeping i got a new shop cloth and a bottle of cleaning alcohol and wiped it down as thoroughly as if i were planning to perform surgery upon it it took me about twenty minutes once that was done i opened an old cigar box on one shelf that was full of river rocks all but one of them were decoys camouflage i pawed through it until i found the smooth piece of firerounded obsidian and took it out of the box i went to the circle and sat in it folding my legs in front of me i touched the circle with a mild effort of will and it snapped to life in a sudden curtain of gossamer energy the circle would help contain and shape the magic i was about to work i put the black stone down on the floor in front of me took a deep breath straightened my back and then began to draw in my will i remained like that relaxed breathing deeply and slowly as i formed the spell in my head this one was a fairly delicate working and probably would have been beyond my skill before i had begun teaching molly how to control her own power now though it was merely annoyingly difficult once the energy was formed in my mind i took a deep breath and whispered voce voco vocius i waited a few seconds and then repeated myself voce voco vocius that went on for a couple of minutes while i sat there doing my impression of a roman telephone i was just starting to wonder whether or not the damned rock was going to work when the lab around me vanished replaced by an inky darkness the circles energy field became visible a pale blue light in the shape of a cylinder stretching from the floor up into the infinite overhead space its light did not make my surroundings visible as if the glow from the circle simply had nothing to reflect from uh i said and my voice echoed strangely hello hold on to your horses said a grumpy distant voice im coming a moment later there was a flash of light and a cylinder like my own appeared directly in front of me ebenezar sat in it legs folded the same way mine were a black stone that was a twin to my own sat in front of him ebenezar looked tired his hair was mussed his eyes sunken he was wearing only a pair of pajama bottoms and i was surprised at how much muscle tone he had kept despite his age of course hed spent the last few centuries mostly working on his farm that would put muscle on anyone hoss he said by way of greeting where are you my place i said situation my wards are down ive got backup but i dont want to stay here for long the police and fbi have gotten involved and the reds have swung at me twice in the past two days where are you ebenezar grunted best if i dont say the merlin is preparing his counterstrike and were trying to find out how much they already know about it when you say we i assume you mean the grey council the grey council was the appellation that had stuck to our little rogue organization inside the white council itself it consisted of people who could see lightning hear thunder and admit to themselves that wizards everywhere were increasingly in danger of being exterminated or enslaved by other interestssuch as the vampire courts or the black council the black council was mostly a hypothetical organization it consisted of a lot of mysterious figures in black robes with delusions of ringwraithhood they liked to call up the deadly dangerous demons from outside of reality the outsiders and to infiltrate and corrupt every supernatural nation they could get to their motivations were mysterious but theyd been causing trouble for the council and everyone else for quite a while i had encountered members of their team but i had no hard proof of their existence and neither did anyone else cautionary rumors of their presence had been met with derision and accusations of paranoia by most of the white council until last year when a black council agent had killed more than sixty wizards and infiltrated the edinburgh facility so thoroughly that more than percent of the staff and security team had gotten their brains redecorated to one degree or another even the senior council members had been influenced the traitor had been stopped if just barely and at a heavy cost and after that the council as a whole believed that there might be a faceless nameless organization running amok in the worldand that any number of them could actually be members of the white council itself operating in disguise paranoia and mistrust they had been steadily growing within the white council whose leader the merlin still refused to admit that the black council was real for fear that our own people would start going over to the bad guys out of fear or ambition his decision had actually had the opposite effect on the frightened nervous wizards of the white council instead of throwing the clear light of truth on the situation the merlin had made it that much more murky and shadowy made it easier for fear to prey upon his fellow wizards thoughts enter the grey council which consisted of me and ebenezar and unspecified others organized in cells in order to prevent either one of the other councils from finding out about us and wiping out all of us at once we were the ones who were trying to be sane in an insane time the whole affair could backlash on us spectacularly but i guess some people just arent any good at watching bad things happen they have to do something about it yes ebenezar said that is who i mean i need the grey council to help me i said hoss were all sitting under the sword of damocles waiting for it to fall the events unfolding in edinburgh right now could mean the end of organized restrained wizardry the end of the laws of magic it could drive us back to the chaos of an earlier age unleash a fresh wave of warlockdriven monsters and faux demigods upon mankind for some reason sir i always feel a little more comfortable when im sitting under that sword must be all the practice ebenezar scowled hoss i need information i said my voice hard theres a little girl out there someone knows something about where she is and i know that the council could dig something up the white council already shut the door in my face i thrust out my jaw what about the grey ebenezar sighed and his tired face looked more tired what youre doing is good and right but it aint smart and its a lesson you havent learned yet what lesson sometimes hoss he said very gently you lose sometimes the darkness takes everyone sometimes the monster escapes to kill again another day he shook his head and looked down sometimes hoss the innocent little ones are murdered and theres not one goddamned thing you can do about it leave her to die i snarled thats what you want me to do i want you to help save millions or billions of little girls boy he said his own voice dropping into a hard hard growl not throw them away for the sake of one i am not going to leave this alone i snapped she ebenezar made a gesture with his right hand and my voice box just stopped working my lips moved i could inhale and exhale freelybut i couldnt talk his dark eyes flashed with anger an expression i had seldom seen upon his face dammit boy youre smarter than this dont you see what youre doing youre giving arianna exactly what she wants youre dancing like a puppet on her strings reacting in precisely the way she wants you to react and it will get you killed i told you long ago that being a real wizard means sacrifice it means knowing things no one else does he said still growling i told you that it meant that you might have to act upon what you knew and knew to be right even though the whole world set its hand against you or that you might have to do horrible necessary things do you remember that i did vividly i remembered the smell of the campfire wed been sitting beside at the time i nodded heres where you find out who you are he said his voice harsh and flat theres a lot of work to do and no time to do it let alone waste it arguing with you over something you should know by now he closed his eyes for a moment and took a deep breath as if bringing himself back under control meet me at the toronto safe house in twelve hours he spoke in a voice of absolute authority something id heard from him only a handful of times in my life he expected his order to be obeyed i turned my head from him in the edge of my vision i saw him scowl again reach down and pick up his own black stoneand suddenly i was sitting on the floor of my lab again i picked up my sending stone wearily and slipped it into my pocket then i just lay back on the floor breaking the circle as i did and stared up at the ceiling for a little while i turned my head to my left and spotted the green extrathick threering binder where i stored all my files on entities i could summon from the nevernever no i looked away from the book when you call things up for information youve got to pay their price its always different its never been pleasant and the thought frightened me this would be the time those beings had been waiting for when my need was so dire that i might agree to almost anything if it meant saving the child for her i might make a deal i would never consider otherwise i might even call upon i stopped myself from so much as thinking the name of the queen of air and darkness for fear that she might somehow detect it and take action she had been offering me temptation passively and patiently for years i had wondered sometimes why she didnt make more of an effort to sell me on her offer she certainly could have done so had she wished now i understood she had known that in time sooner or later there would come a day when i would be more needful than cautious there was no reason for her to dance about crafting sweet temptations and sending them out to ensnare me not when all she had to do was wait awhile it was a cold logical approachand that was very much in her style but there were other beings i could question in the light blue binder sitting on top of the green onebeings of less power and knowledge with correspondingly lower prices it seemed unlikely that i would get anything so specific from them but you never knew i reached for the blue book rose and set about calling creatures into my lab to answer a few questions after three hours of conjuring and summoning i came up with absolutely nothing i had spoken with nature spirits in the shape of a trio of tiny screech owls and with messenger spirits the couriers between the various realms within the nevernever none of them knew anything i plucked a couple of particularly nosy ghosts who lived around chicago out of the spirit world and summoned servants of the tylwyth teg with whose king i was on good terms i asked spirits of water what they and their kin had seen regarding maggie and stared into the flickering lights of creatures of sentient flame whose thoughts were revealed in the images quivering inside them one of the fire spirits showed me an image that lasted for no more than three or four secondsthe face of the little girl in susans picture pale and a little grubby and shivering with fear or cold reaching out to warm her hands over the fluttering lights of a fire in profile she looked a lot like her mother with her huge dark eyes and slender nose shed gotten something of my chin i think which gave her little face the impression of strength or stubbornness she was much paler than susan too more like her father than her mother that way but then the image was gone that was as close as i got i sat down on my stool after three hours of work and felt more exhausted than at any time i could easily recall id gotten nothing that would tell me where she was nothing that would tell me what was in store for her except for the single flicker of knowledge that maggie was still alive id gotten nothing but even that might be enough she was still breathing hang in there kid dads coming i sat there on the stool for a moment wearily then i reached for a piece of paper an old pencil and wrote ivy i need your help its for a little girl who is being held by bad people please contact me harry dresd before id gotten finished writing my name the phone rang id just made contact with the archive with the magically constructed catalog of every bit of knowledge mankind has ever written down it resided in the head of a teenager the sum of human learning in the hands of a girl who should have been going to ninth grade this year knowledge is power and a couple of years before the archive had proved it as a child not much older than maggie she had pitted her magic against the skills of beings with centuries of experience and come out for the most part ahead she was an unwholesomely powerful child and while she had always comported herself with the gravity of a woman of forty i had seen flashes of the child supporting the vast burden of the archive i knew what would happen if that child ever decided to take control of how the archive was administered it would probably look a lot like that episode of the twilight zone with the monstrous little kid with superpowers the phone rang again i shivered and answered it wed run a long line down into the laboratory and the old rotary phone sat near mollys desk benefiting from being on the fringes of such a wellorganized place hello its kincaid said a mans baritone kincaid was ivys driver bodyguard cook and all around teddy bear he was the single deadliest gunman i had ever had the terror of watching and one of a relatively few number of people who i both disliked and trusted he had once described the method he would use to kill me if he had to and i had to admit that he had an excellent chance of succeeding he was tough smart skilled and had a mercenary sense of honorwhoever held his contract was his charge body and mind and he never abrogated a contract once he had signed it dresden i replied this line probably isnt clear i know kincaid replied what do you want i need to find a child she was taken by the red court a few days ago we believe her to be somewhere in mexico somewhere in mexico kincaid said and i could hear his grin you tried walking around and yelling her name really loud yet im getting there i said look does she know anything or not kincaid muffled the phone with something probably his hand i heard his low buzzing voice as he asked a question i might have heard a light soprano voice answering him kincaid returned to the phone and said ivy says she cant get involved that the business youre on is deadly she dares not unbalance it for fear of changing the outcome i made a growling sound goddammit kincaid she owes me one remind her who came and took her away from those fucking denarian lunatics kincaids voice became quieter more sober believe me she remembers dresden but she isnt free to share her knowledge like you or me when she says she cant tell you shes being literal she physically cannot let such information leave her head i slammed the heel of my hand into a wall and leaned on it closing my eyes tell her i said that this is information i must have if she cant help me ill be taking it up with other sources the ones in my green notebook kincaid spoke with someone again this time i definitely heard ivys voice answering him she cant tell you where the girl is kincaid said there was a hint of steel in his voice warning me not to push too hard but she says she can tell you someone who might any help would be greatly appreciated i said exhaling she says to tell you that before you try the green book theres something else you might consider the last man you want to see might have useful information i understood what she was talking about at once and groaned dammit i muttered dammit i dialed another number a receptionist asked me how she could direct my call this is harry dresden i said quietly put me through to mr marcones personal line please chapter i dont like it molly said scowling you sure you dont want me to go in there with you hes got people definitely not i said calmly i dont want you showing up on his radar id like to see him try something molly said clenching one hand into a fist and thumping the blue beetles steering wheel for emphasis id eat him for breakfast no molly i said in a firm tone of voice you wouldnt marcone might be vanilla mortal but hes dangerous most men have limits he doesnt never forget that if hes so dangerous why are you talking to him because he also has rules i said and besides i just had to see him here keep your eyes open for a third party interfering ill worry about marcone okay okay molly said nodding her eyes intent in a spectacular bid for the do as i say not as i do award she took a long pull from an energy drink in a can the size of a milk carton okay i got out of the blue beetle and walked into my meeting with gentleman johnnie marcone the undisputed gang lord of chicago burger king had just opened its dining area but it was already halffull i ignored marcone upon coming in and got in line a sausage biscuit and cup of coffee later i went to the back corner where marcone sat and his retinue stood hendricks was there of course in an extralarge suit and a redhaired buzz cut maybe hed been working out because he looked like hed put on a few more pounds if he got any bigger hed need a building permit miss gard stood a little apart from hendricks covering the angles the big man couldnt she was just as blond and athletic and amazonian as ever her suit and tie muting her curves without reducing her appeal marcone sat in the booth as if at a boardroom table he wore a silk suit probably worth more than my car and sat with his elbows on the table his fingertips pressed together into a steeple he looked like a man in his mature prime neat and precise from his haircut to his polished leather shoes he watched me come over to the table and slide my plastic tray into place before me i dumped four or five packets of sugar into my coffee and stirred it with a little stick youre not eating he looked at his watch and then at me he had pale green eyes the color of old bills but less personal his stare was unsettling and he met my eyes without concern we had already taken the measure of each others souls it was why i knew precisely how dangerous the man sitting across the table from me could be and why i insisted upon treating him in as cavalier a fashion as possible one doesnt show dangerous predators weakness or fear it makes them hungry i savored a bite of the biscuit which was only a reminder of how good a real homemade biscuit and sausage was but for the sake of my audience i made sounds of enjoyment as i chewed and swallowed you sure i slurped some more coffee youre missing out on ambrosia here dresden marcone said this is aggravating even for you yeah i said smiling and took another bite of sausage hendricks made a growling sound i finished chewing and said you sure about that big guy hendricks marcone said hendricks subsided i nodded then i said you have information i want undoubtedly marcone said what information are you after and what do you offer for it im not here to trade baseball cards with you marcone i said and i am not a charity organization dresden he replied i take it this has something to do with your office building exploding he shook his head in a gesture of faint regret right i said youre all broken up over the destruction i didnt order it i made no money on it i failed to profit financially or politically from its destruction and you survived it was a complete waste hendricks made another growling sound that might have been gorilla for a laugh maybe its got something to do with the building how much do you know about its owners marcones smile was a wintry thing that they are a part of the organization whose servitors have been attempting to intrude upon my business i lifted an eyebrow someones muscling in on your territory briefly marcone said but incessantly then we might have a common problem marcone looked at me as though i were a rather slow child yes hence this meeting i grunted and finished the biscuit the red court is on the move trouble is being stirred up between them and the council my interest in the matter is an eightyearold girl the reds took her from her home i believe that theyre holding her somewhere in mexico i need to know where marcones stare went on for several seconds before he said somewhere in mexico thats as specific as you can be its as much as i know i said for what purpose was she brought there why does it matter if she was taken to be used as a sexual object she would be in a different place than if she was going to be used as slave labor or harvested as an organ donor i clenched my teeth and looked away briefly treated to a number of delightful images by his words marcones eyes narrowed who is she to you dresden my clients kid i said struggling to keep my voice level and calm i think theyre going to use her in some sort of sacrificial ritual then that narrows things considerably marcone said as i understand the process rituals such as the one you mention need to happen at a place of power he glanced up at miss gard who nodded and immediately left the restaurant heading for her car i suspect i can narrow it down even further for you dresden lets talk price im going to use the information to put a major hurting on the people trying to take your territory away from you marcone i said thats more than payment enough and if i do not agree marcone asked then we throw down right here and after i toss your attack dogs over the top of the sears building i hurt you until you give me the information anyway that cold smile returned is that how you think it would happen i shrugged a shoulder and kept my expression bland i think theres only one way to find out i leaned forward a little and pitched my voice in a conspiratorial murmur but just between you and me i dont think the terrain favors you here he stared across his steepled fingers at me for a time then he said it certainly doesnt favor me in the manner i would prefer he laid his hands flat on the table and leaned back slightly theres no sense in making a confrontation out of this and i have never yet regretted it when i allowed you to rid me of an enemy i didnt do it as a favor to you he shrugged your motivations are immaterial the results are what matter just remember that youre on my list marcone soon as i get done with all the other evils in this town you wont be the lesser of them anymore marcone stared at me with halflidded eyes and said eek you think its funny i am not unduly concerned by dead men dresden i bristled is that a threat hardly one day probably soon youll get yourself killed thanks to that set of irrational compulsions you call a conscience long before my name tops your list i neednt lift a finger he shrugged giving you information seems an excellent way to accelerate that process it will also tax the resources of my enemies marcone mused for a moment and then said and i believe i have no objection to contributing against any organization which would victimize children so i glowered at him partly because he was probably right and partly because hed once again shown the flash of humanity that prevented me from lumping him in with every other evil hungry predatory thing lurking in the wild world for his own reasons marcone would go to extreme lengths to help and protect children in chicago any adult was fair game for his businesses any child was offlimits rumor had it that he had vanished every single one of his employees who had ever crossed that line gard reappeared frowning and walked over to our table marcone glanced at her well gard hesitated and then said he wont speak of it over the line he says that you have incurred no debt with him for asking the question he will only speak to dresden personally marcone lifted his eyebrows interesting i thought so gard said ahem i said who wants to meet me my employer gard said donar vadderung ceo of monoc securities chapter gard and i went to oslo it sounds like it would be a long trip but its a hell of a lot faster when you dont have to worry about boarding clearing security going through customs or actually moving a linear distance gard opened a way into the nevernever down near the zoo simply cutting at the fabric of reality with a runeetched dagger the way took us on a short hike through a dark wood of dead trees and ended when we emerged in what she said was iceland it sure as hell was cold enough a second way took us across the surface of a frozen lake to stop before the roots of a vast old tree whose trunk could have contained my apartment with room to spare for a garage from there we emerged into what seemed like a cold damp basement and i found myself facetoface with two dozen men wearing body armor and pointing sleek looking hightech assault rifles at the end of my nose i did absolutely nothing carefully one of the men with guns said something a short phrase in a language i didnt understand gard answered in what i presumed to be the same tongue and gestured to me the leader of the guards eyed us both suspiciously for a moment then said something quietly and all the rifles stopped pointing at me two guards returned to stand on either side of a doorway two more took up a station facing gard and me evidently cautious about getting more company through the same way wed just used the rest returned to a couple of card tables and a few sleeping cots gard shook her head and muttered einherjar give them a little sip of renewed mortality and four thousand years of discipline go right out the window i recognize some of these guys i said i nodded toward a trio playing cards those three they were some of the mercenaries marcone brought to that party in the raith deeps gard glanced at the three and then rolled her eyes yes and and theyre just available for hire i asked if you can afford them gard said smiling so that her teeth showed though be warned that prices may vary this way dresden i followed her out into a hallway and past several rooms filled with enough weaponry to win a minor war in a century of ones choice racks of ashwood spears stood side by side with old boltaction mausers which stood next to modern assault rifles katanastyle swords shared a room with flintlocks and maxim guns one shelving unit housed an evolutionary progression of grenades from powderfilled crockery with ignitable fuses to the most modern miniature flashbang grenades judging from the variety of the places contents it was like looking at a museumbut from the quantities present it could only be an armory we got to an elevator whose walls were a simple metal grid so that we could see out of them as we went up i stopped counting after seeing seven floors of similarly equipped armories go by guess your boss believes in being prepared i said gard smiled its one of his things yes its a little extreme isnt it she looked at me with an arched brow then she said one can have only as much preparation as he has foresight i considered that for a moment and decided that as cryptic statements went it was all kinds of bad the elevator kept going up and up and up brief views of various floors went by one floor looked like an enormous gym and was filled with sweating men and women working out another looked like an expensive legal office another was all done in antiseptic white bathed with just a bit too much light and smelled of disinfectant another was lit by candles and the murmuring of voices chanting still another was obviously some kind of enormous chemical laboratory still another level was filled with cells whose occupants could not be seen as anything other than shadowy presences and so on i shook my head hells bells its like some kind of demented theme park the difference being that nothing you see here is meant to entertain gard said and dont bother asking questions i wont answer them ah weve reached the ground floor the elevator continued to rise up through an enormous atrium that housed ten or twelve stories of what looked like highend corporate offices each floor was open to the atrium and between the plants decorative trees the waterfall and all the windows plus the skylights far above the entire building looked like a single massive garden the sounds of office activity and equipment birds and the flowing waterfall all blended together into an active whole that formed a white noise bustling with life variety and movement we soared up through the atrium and our opensided elevator vanished into a short tunnel a moment later the door opened on a rather novel reception area it had all the things such offices always did a prominent desk several seats in a waiting area a coffee machine and a table laden with magazines in this office however all of those materials were made of stainless steel so were the floors so were the walls as was the ceiling even the lamps and the coffeepot were made of stainless steel the magazines alone stood out as shapeless softlooking blobs of garish color the logo for monoc securities stood out upon one wall in basrelief and somehow reminded me more of a crest upon a shield than a corporate marketing symbol a thick round circle bisected by a straight vertical line emerging from either side of the circle it might have been a simplified abstract representation of an eye being cut from its socket by some kind of bladei have some of that symbol written in scar tissue on my own face where a cut had run down from eyebrow to cheekbone but had barely missed my eye it might have been simple abstract symbology representing the female and the male with round and straight shapes suggesting wholeness and balance or heck it could have been overlaid greek lettering omega and iota on top of each other omegaiota the last detail the final detail maybe it meant something more like every last little thing or maybe it combined all of those things the blind eye that sees all yeah that felt right two women sat behind the big desk at computer monitors consisting of small clouds of very fine mist wherein were contained all the drifting images and letters of the company cyberreality floating like the wispiest of illusions sufficiently advanced technology i suppose the women themselves were apparently identical twins both had ravendark hair cut in closefitting caps and it matched the exact shade of their identical black suits both had dark eyes that sparkled with intensity and intelligence they were both pale and their features were remarkable if not precisely beautiful they would stand out in any crowd and not in an unpleasant way eitherbut they would never be mistaken for cover models the twins rose as the elevator doors opened and their eyes looked very intent and very black as they stared at us ive looked down the barrel of a gun before this was like looking down four of them at once they stood there inhumanly motionless both wore headsets but only one of them murmured into hers i started to step out of the elevator but gard put out a cautionary hand dont until youre approved she said theyll kill you maybe me too like their receptionists tough in these parts huh it would be wiser not to joke she said quietly they dont miss anythingand they never forget the receptionist who had spoken into her mike flexed one hand slowly closed and open her nails peeled up little silver curls from the stainlesssteel desk i thought about making a manicure joke and decided not to go go gadget wisdom do you do oranges too asked my mouth without checking in with the rest of me what about sharpening table knives and scissors and lawn tools my landladys lawn mower blade could use a hand job from a girl like y dresden gard hissed her eyes both furious and wide with nearpanic both of the receptionists were focused on me intently now the one who had remained silent shifted her weight as though preparing to take a step come on sigrun i said to my companion im trying to be diplomatic the wisdom of my ass is wellknown if i didnt lip off to them after shooting my mouth off to faerie queens and vampire courtsplural courtsdemigods and demon lords they might get their feelings hurt gard eyed me for a moment more before her uncertain blue eyes gained a gleam of devilmaycare defiance it looked a lot more natural on her than fear perhaps your insults and insolence are not the valued commodities you believe them to be heh i said good one the chatty twin tilted her head slightly to one side for a moment then said right away sir she pointed her fingernail at me you are to enter the office through the doors behind me she aimed her nail at gard next you are to accompany him and make introductions gard nodded shortly and then tilted her head in a come along sort of gesture we walked out of the elevator and past the twins to the door behind them they turned their heads as i went by tracking my every movement it was downright creepy on the other side of the door was a long hallway also made of stainless steel there were multiple ports or hatches of some kind in a row along the walls all closed they were about the size of dinner plates i got a feeling that any visitors who tried the hors doeuvres served up from those plates would not be asking for the recipe later in the evening at the end of the hall was another set of steel doors which gave way soundlessly before us revealing another room done all in stainless steel holding only a massive desk behind which was seated a man donar vadderung sat with his chin propped on the heel of his hand squinting at a holographic computer display and the first thing my instincts did was warn me that he was very very dangerous he wasnt all that imposing to look at a man in good shape maybe in his early fifties lean and spare in the way of longdistance runners but too heavy in the shoulders and arms for that to be all he did his hair was long for a man and just a bit shaggy it was the color of a furious thundercloud and his eye was ice blue a black cloth patch over the other eye combined with a vertical scar similar to my own made me think that id been right about the corporate logo he kept a short neat beard he was a strikinglooking rogue particularly with the eye patch and looked like the sort of person who might have served thirty years of a triple life sentence and managed to talk the parole board into setting him freeprobably to their eventual regret sigrun he said his tone polite gard went down to one knee and bowed her head there was no hesitation whatsoever to the womans movementsthe gesture was not simply a technicality she had to observe she believed that vadderung merited such obeisance my lord gard said ive brought the wizard as you commanded well done the greyhaired man said and made a gesture to indicate that she should rise i dont think she saw it with her head bowed like that but she reacted to it anyway and stood up maybe theyd just had a few hundred years to practice my lord may i present harry dresden wizard and warden of the white council of wizards i nodded to vadderung wizard this is donar vadderung ceo of monoc secur i think ive got a pretty good idea what hes in charge of i said quietly the old mans mouth turned faintly up at the corners when i spoke he gestured to a steel chair across the desk from him please sit down i pointed at the holographic display you sure you want to put that at risk if i stand too close to it vadderung turned his face up to the ceiling and barked out a laugh of genuine amusement ill take my chances suits me i said i walked over to the desk and sat down in the steel chair across from vadderungs it didnt have a cushion or anything but it was surprisingly comfortable nonetheless coffee he asked me something to eat i paused for a breath to think before answering duties such as this involved the obligations and responsibilities of guest to host and vice versa if vadderung was who i thought he was he had been known from time to time to go forth and test people on how well they upheld that particular traditionwith generous rewards for the faithful and hideous demises for the miserly callous or cruel in the supernatural world such obligations and limits seem to be of vital importance to the overwhelming number of supernatural beings im not sure why maybe it has something to do with the thresholds of protective energy that form around a home only if it isnt too much trouble i said and something to eat vadderung told gard she bowed her head and said my lord then she padded out though the big man hadnt stood up i realized that he was big damned near a giant really standing hed have more than a couple inches on me and his shoulders made mine look about as wide as the spine of a book he rested his chin on the heel of his hand again and studied me with his bright blue eye well he said i take it you believe you know who i am ive got a few guesses i said i think theyre good ones sigrun was kind of a tipoff but honestly thats got nothing to do with why im here today the blue eye wrinkled at the corners doesnt it i frowned at him and tilted my head how so he lifted a hand palm up as he explained someone with enough foresight might for example arrange to be in a position to assist a hotheaded young wizard of the white council one day perhaps who i am is directly responsible for why i am here yeah i guess that could be it i said its technically possible that your motives for assisting me are altruistic on the other hand its also technically possible that you are speaking with a forked tongue and that all youre really trying to do is find some way to take advantage of me when im under pressure i shrugged no offense intended but theres kind of a shortage of altruism out there so cynical for one so young he looked me up and down but you would be you would be ive got questions i said granted they arent as profound as who am i or why am i here but theyre a lot more important to me at the moment vadderung nodded youre looking for your daughter i felt my body go rigid how he smiled rather wolfishly i know things dresden and if i dont know something i can find out like yourself it is what i do i stared at the man for most of a minute then i said do you know where she is no he said in a quiet firm voice but i know where she will be i looked down at my hands whats it going to cost me to find out chichén itzá vadderung said i jerked my head up in surprise i stared at the man for a moment i dont understand vadderung asked it isnt complicated im on your side boy i raked my fingers back through my hair thinking why there the red king and his inner circle the lords of outer night have got some big juju to brew up they need a site of power to do it for this theyll use chichén itzá why there theyre enacting a sacrifice like in the old days a snarl of anger touched his voice and made it suddenly frightening theyre preparing a bloodline curse a what death magic he said focused upon the bloodline from the sacrifice the child to her brothers sisters and parents from the parents to their brothers sisters and parents and so on spreading up the family tree until theres no one left a chill hit my guts ive never even heard of death magic on that kind of scale the energy required for that its enormous i stopped for a moment and then said and its stupid susan was an only child and shes already lost her parents same with me vadderung arched an eyebrow at me is it they like to be thorough those old monsters i smoothed my expression over trying not to give away anything this spell they were doing would kill me if they pulled it off it could also kill my only family my half brother thomas how does it work i asked him my voice subdued it tears out the heart vadderung said rips it to bits on the way out too sound familiar hells bells i said quietly it had been years since i had even thought about victor sells or his victims they had featured in my nightmares for quite a while until i upgraded vadderung leaned toward me his blue eye very bright its all connected dresden the whole game and youre only now beginning to learn who the players are he settled back into his seat letting silence add emphasis to his statement before he continued the sorcerer who used the spell in chicago before didnt have strength enough to make it spread past the initial target the red court does no one has used power on this scale in more than a millennium and theyre pointing it at me they say you can know a man by his enemies dresden he smiled and laughter lurked beneath his next words never quite surfacing you defy beings that should cow you into silence you resist forces that are inevitable for no more reason than that you believe they should be resisted you bow your head to neither demons nor angels and you put yourself in harms way to defend those who cannot defend themselves he nodded slowly i think i like you i arched an eyebrow and studied him for a moment then help me vadderung pursed his lips in thought in that you may be disappointed i am not what i was my children are scattered around the world most of them have forgotten our purpose once the jotuns retreated he shook his head what you must understand is that you face beings such as i in this battle i frowned you mean gods mostly retired gods at any rate vadderung said once entire civilizations bowed to them now they are venerated by only a handful the power of their blood spread out among thousands of offspring but in the lords of outer night even the remnants of that power are more than you can face as you are ive heard that one before i said vadderung just looked at me then he said let me help you understand and a force like a hundred anvils smashed me out of the chair and to the floor i found myself on my back gasping like a landed fish i struggled to move to push myself up but i couldnt so much as lift my arms from the ground i brought my will into focus with the idea of using it to deflect some of that force from me and and suddenly sharply felt my will directly in contention with another the power that held me down was not earth magic as i had assumed it to be it was the simple raw brute application of the will of donar vadderung thunders father the father and king of the aesir father odins will held me pinned to the floor and i could no more escape it or force it away than could an insect stop a shoe from descending in the instant that realization came to me the force vanished evaporating as if it had never been i lay on the floor gasping it is within my capabilities to kill you young wizard vadderung said quietly i could wish you dead especially here at the center of my power on midgard he got up came around the desk and offered me his hand i took it he pulled me to my feet steady as a rock you will be at the center of their power there will be a dozen of them each nearly as strong as i am he put a hand on my shoulder briefly you are bold clever and from time to time lucky all of those are excellent qualities to have in battles like yours but against power such as this you cannot prevail as you are even if you are able to challenge the red king at chichén itzá you will be crushed down as you were a moment ago youll be able to do nothing but watch as your daughter dies he stared at me in silence for a time then the door to his office opened and one of the receptionists leaned in sir she said you have a lunch appointment in five minutes indeed vadderung said thank you m she nodded and retreated again vadderung turned back to me as gard returned to the room carrying a covered tray she set it down on the big steel desk and stepped back unobtrusively youve defied fate dresden vadderung said youve stood up to foes much larger than you for that you have my respect do you think i could swap in the respect for i dunno half a dozen valkyries a receptionist and a couple of platoons of dead heroes vadderung laughed again he had a hearty laugh like santa claus must have had when he was young and playing football i couldnt do without my receptionists im afraid he sobered and those others would be less strong at the center of the red kings power he shook his head like it or not this is a mortal matter it must be settled by mortals youre not going to help i said quietly he went to a steel closet and opened the door removing an overcoat he slipped into it and then walked over to me again ive been in this game for a long long time boy how do you know i havent given you exactly what you need vadderung took the lid off the covered tray nodded to me pleasantly and left i looked at the tray a cup of tea steamed there three empty paper packets of sugar beside it the tea smelled like peppermint a favorite next to the cup of tea was a little plate with two cake doughnuts on it both of them covered in thick white frosting and unmarred by sprinkles or any other edible decorations i looked up in time to see vadderung walk by trailed by the pair of receptionists and saw them all simply vanish presumably into a way well gard asked me are you ready to go just a minute i said i sat back down and i drank the tea and ate the doughnuts thoughtfully chapter i needed sleep i rode back to my place with molly in the midmorning mouse came padding up the stairs from the apartment as we got out of the car his alert wary stance relaxing into the usual waving of a doggy tail and enthusiastic sniffs and nudges of greeting i shambled on into my apartment calmly all was obviously well susan and martin were both inside both busy as mister looked on from his lordly peak atop the highest bookshelf susan had been shaking out all the rugs and carpets that cover the floor of my living room and was now rolling them back into place probably not in the same order as they had been before she picked up one end of a sofa with a couple of fingers of one hand to get an edge into place martin was alphabetizing my bookshelves they used to kill men for sacrilege like that i suppressed my twitches as best i could and told myself that they thought they were helping success susan said or at least a little of it our people found out exactly who is tailing us up here yeah i asked who the eebs she said molly came in and frowned severely at what they were doing granted the place was kind of a mess after the fbi and cops got done but still she was probably as used to the place as i was sounds like the scoobies only less distinctive martin shook his head esteban and esmerelda batiste he clarified one of the husbandwife teams the red court uses for fieldwork one of i asked couples traveling together attract less attention susan said theyre often given the benefit of the doubt in any kind of judgment call made by various officers of the law it smooths things out a little more than they would be otherwise hence you and martin i said yes said martin obviously esteban and esmerelda are notorious susan said theyre unorthodox difficult to predict which is saying something when youre talking about vampires theyll throw away their personnel too if that is what it takes to get results personally i think its because they have some kind of gruesome variation of love for each other makes them more emotional they have complementary insanities martin said dont dignify it with anything more the one you said got away harry susan said esteban probably he rabbits early and often which probably explains why hes still alive esmerelda would have been the spotter on top of a nearby buildingalso the one who probably triggered the explosives gotta figure theyre behind the hit outside the fbi building too i said tinted windows on the car shooter was way back inside the backseat away from the window maybe sure susan said theyll suit up in allover coverage and head out in the daytime if they think its really necessary i grunted so esteban and esmerelda eebs susan said firmly so the eebs arent really fighters theyre planners fair to say very much so said martin there might have been a faint note of approval in his voice i nodded so they and their vampire gang were supposed to follow you only when they saw you heading into the data center they were forced to do more than shadow you they tried to protect the data all rational susan began to frown and then nodded at me of course martin said difficult to predict but never stupid so why i said if they were here operating under orders from the duchess to foil your efforts would they take the trouble to try an assassination on me martin opened his mouth and then closed it again frowning i mean arianna wants to see me suffer right thank god for clichéd mindsets by the way i cant do that if im dead i go early it cheats her of the fun theres division in the ranks of the red court susan murmured its the only thing that would explain it countervailing interestsand at the summit of their hierarchy too or martin said it was not thehe sighedeebs who made the attempt but i havent seen any of the other people who want to kill me lately i said i saw the eebs just the other night theyre the simplest explanation martin tilted his head slightly in allowance but remember that what you have is a theory not a fact you are not blessed with a shortage of foes dresden um harry molly asked i turned to her i dont know if im supposed to jump in with this kind of thing or not but if theres some sort of internal schism going on inside the red court what if the kidnapping and so on is like a cover for something else shes doing inside her court i mean maybe it isnt all about you or at least not only about you i stared at her blankly for a moment but for that to be true i said i would have to not be the center of the universe molly rolled her eyes good thought grasshopper i said something to keep in mind maybe were the diversion does it matter susan asked i mean as far as our interests go i shrugged well have to see i guess she grimaced if the eebs are working for a different faction than arianna then there goes our only lead i was hoping i could convince them to tell us where maggie was being held worth a try in any case martin said if we can catch them we could do that i said or we could make sure weve got chichén itzá staked out and grab her when the reds bring her there for their übermagic shindig susan whirled to face me her eyes wide what theyre pulling off their big ceremony at chichén itzá i said i met susans eyes and nodded i found her shell be there and well go get her susan let out a fiercely joyful cry and pounced upon me clear from the other side of the room the impact drove my back up against one of the bookshelves susans legs twined around my waist and her mouth found mine her lips were feverhot and sweet and when they touched mine silent fire spread out into my body and briefly consumed all thought my arms closed around heraround susan so warm and real and and so very very here my heart lurched into double time and i started to feel a little dizzy mouses growl rolled through the room sudden and deep in his chest rodriguez martin barked his voice tense susans lips lifted from mine and when she opened her eyes they were solid black all the way acrossjust like a red vampires my lips and tongue still tingled at the touch of her mouth a very faint echo of the insidious venom of one of the reds bright red tattoos showed on her face her neck and winding down one arm she stared at me for a moment dazed then blinked slowly and looked over her shoulder at martin youre close he said in a very quiet very soothing voice you need to back down you need to take some time to breathe something like rage filled susans face for an instant then she shuddered glancing from martin to me and back and then began disentangling herself from me suns out and its warm martin said taking her elbow gently come on well get some sun and walk and sort things out sun susan said her voice still low and husky with arousal right some sun martin shot me a look that he probably hoped would kill me and then he and susan left the apartment and walked up into the mornings light molly waited until they were well away from the front door and said well that was stupid of you both i looked over my shoulder at her and frowned call it like i see it my apprentice said quietly you know she has trouble controlling her emotions her instincts she shouldnt have been all over you and you shouldnt have kissed her back her mouth tightened someone could have gotten hurt i rubbed at my stilltingling lips for a moment and suppressed a flash of anger molly i get it she said i do look you care about her okay maybe even loved her maybe she loved you but it cant be like that anymore she spread her hands and said as messed up as that is its still the reality you have to live with you cant ignore it you get close to her and theres no way for it to come out good boss i stared hard at her all the rage inside me coming out in my voice despite the fact that i tried to hold it in be careful molly molly blanched and looked away but she folded her arms and stood her ground im saying this because i care harry you care about susan i asked you dont even know her not susan she said you i took a step toward her you dont know a goddamned thing about me and susan molly i know that you already blame yourself for what happened to her she said spitting out the words think about what itll be like for her if she gets lost in a kiss with you and realizes later that she ripped your throat open and drank your blood and turned herself into a monster is that how you want your story susan and harry to end the words made me want to start screaming i dont know what kept me from lashing out at the girl other than the fact that she would never believe me capable of such a thing and she was right that might have something to do with it so i took a deep breath and closed my eyes and fought down the rage again i was getting tired of that when i spoke a moment later my voice sounded raw study with a wizard has made you manipulative she sniffed a couple of times and i opened my eyes to see her crying silently nno she said that was my mom i made a sound of acknowledgment and nodded she looked at me and made no move to wipe the tears from her face you look awful i found out some things i said she bit her lip its bad isnt it i nodded i said real bad were i shook my head without the councils support i dont see how it can be done theres a way she said theres always a way thats sort of the problem i said i looked at the hopelessly organized bookshelf nearest me i think id like to be by myself for a while i said molly looked at me her posture that of someone being careful as if theyre concerned that any move might shatter a delicate object youre sure mouse made a little whining noise in his throat im not going to do anything desperate i told her not yet anyway i just need some time okay she said come on mouse mouse watched me worriedly but padded out of the apartment and up the stairs with molly i went to my shower started it up stripped and got under the cold water i just stood there with it sheeting over me for a while and tried to think mostly i thought about how good susans mouth had felt i waited for the cold water to sluice that particular thought down to a bearable level then i thought about vadderungs warning about the red court ive taken on some tough customers in my time but none of them had been godlike beingsor the remnants of them or whatever the lords of outer night and the red king were you couldnt challenge something like that in a direct confrontation and win i might have powers sure hell on a good day id go along with someone who said that i was one of the top twenty or thirty wizards on the planet in terms of sheer magical muscle and my finesse and skill continued to improve give me a couple of hundred years and i might be one of the top two or three wizards on the planet of course if marcone was right id never make it that high and the boss predator of the concrete jungle was not stupid in fact id say that there was an excellent chance i wouldnt live another two or three days i couldnt challenge the masters of the red court and win but they had my little girl i know it shouldnt matter that she was my little girl in particular i should have been just as outraged that any little girl was trapped in such monstrous hands but it did matter maggie was my child and it mattered a whole hell of a lot i stood in the shower until the cold water had muted away all the hormones all the emotion all the mindless power of blood calling to blood after thinking about it for a while i decided that three courses lay open to me the enemy was strong so i could show up with more muscle on my side i could round up every friend every ally every shady character who owed me a solid enough assistance could turn the tide of any battleand i had no illusions that it would be a battle of epic proportions the problem was that the only people who would show up to that kind of desperate fight were my friends and my friends would die i would literally be using them to shield myself against the crushing power of the red king and his court and i had no illusions of what such a struggle would cost my friends would die most of them hell probably all of them and me with them maybe i could get to the kid and get out while my friends gave their lives to make it possible but after that then what spend my life running with maggie always looking over my shoulder never stopping in one place for longer than a few days the second thing i could do was to change the confrontation into something else find some way to sneak up close enough to grab the girl and vanish skipping the whole doomedstruggle part of option one that plan wouldnt require me to get my friends killed of course to pull it off id have to find some way to get more clever and sneakier than beings with millennia of practice and experience at just such acts of infiltration and treachery you didnt survive for as long as they had among a nation of predators without being awfully smart and careful i doubted it would be as simple as bopping a couple of guards over the head then donning their uniforms and sneaking in with my friends the cowardly lion and the tin woodsman i had cast myself as the scarecrow in that one if i only had a brain id be able to come up with a better plan so the standup fight with an allstar team was a bad idea it probably wouldnt work the sneaky smashandgrab at the heart of red court power was a bad idea it probably wouldnt work either and that left option three which was unthinkable or had been a few days ago before i knew i was a father my career as a wizard has been very active ive smacked a lot of awfully powerful things in the kisser ive mostly gotten away with it though i bear the scars physical and otherwise of the times i didnt a lot of the major players looked at me and saw potential for one kind of mayhem or another some of them had offered me power a lot of power i mean if i went out right now and gathered together everything i couldregardless of the price tag attached to itit would change the game it would make me more than just a hotshot young wizard it would give my power an intensity a depth a scope i could hardly imagine it would give me the chance to call upon new allies to fight beside me it would place an almost unlimited number of new weapons at my disposal open up options that could never otherwise exist but what about after i wouldnt have to go on the run with maggie to protect her from the monsters id be one maybe not that day maybe not that week but one day before too long the things i had taken into me would change me and i probably wouldnt mind even if i bothered to notice it happening that was the nature of such power you didnt feel it changing you there is no sensation to warn you when your soul turns black option three shared one commonality with options one and two i wouldnt survive it not as the man i was the one who tried to make the world a little brighter or more stable the one who tried to help and who sometimes screwed things up the one who believed in things like family like responsibility like love but maggie might survive it if i did it rightonly to be orphaned again in one way or another i felt so tired maybe there isnt a way whispered a voice in the back of my head i snapped the water off and reached for a towel screw that kind of thinking dresden i ordered myself theres a way through this theres a way youve just got to find it i dried myself off and stared intently at my stark scarred unshaven face in the mirror it didnt look like the kind of face a child would love kid would probably start crying when she got a good look at me but it might be the kind of face that belonged to a man who could pull her safely out of a mob of bloodthirsty beasts it was too early to throw in the towel i had no idea what i was going to do i just knew that i couldnt give up chapter i called murphys cell phone murphy here heya murph how you doing this line isnt i know i said i know mine either hello fbi guys dont you get bored doing this stuff all the time murphy snorted into the phone whats up im thinking about getting a brokendown doormat to go with my brokendown door and the broken frame around it i said thank you fbi guys dont make demons of the bureau murphy said they arent much more inept than anyone else theres only so much they can do when theyre given bad intelligence what about your place i asked they came they searched they left rawlins and stallings and a dozen other guys from si were here assisting the bureau dusted and took out my trash after they were done i barked out a laugh the boys at si got away with that murphy sounded decidedly smug they were there at the request of the new agent in charge tilly you met him huh did and glad to spoke well of you hes an aikidoka murphy said ive been to his dojo a few times to teach some practical application classes hes come out to dough joes to teach forms and some formal weapons classes oh right hes the guy who taught you staff fighting thats him we started off in the same class many moons ago i grunted shame to meet him this way the bureau generally arent a bad bunch this is all about rudolph or whoever is giving rudolph his marching orders a thought struck me and i went silent for a moment harry you still there yeah sorry was just about to head out for a steak sandwich interested sure twenty twenty murphy hung up and i said to the stillopen line hey if youve got someone watching my place could you call the cops if anyone tries to steal my star wars poster its an original then i vindictively hung up on the fbi it made my inner child happy twenty minutes later i walked into mcanallys it was too early for it to be properly crowded and murphy and i sat down at a corner table the one farthest from the windows and therefore from laser microphones in case our federal pursuers had doubled up on their paranoia meds i began without preamble who said rudolph was getting his orders from his direct superiors or from anyone in chicago at all she frowned and thought about it for a moment i waited it out patiently you dont really think that she said do you i think its worth looking at he looked shaky when i saw him yeah murphy said thoughtfully at my place too i filled her in on the details of what shed missed at my apartment and the fbi building and by the time i was done she was nodding confidently go on we both know that ladder climbers like rudolph dont usually get nervous rushed and pressured when theyre operating with official sanction they have too much fun swaggering around beating people over the head with their authority club dont know if all of them do that she said but i know damned well that rudolph does yeah but this time he was edgy impatient desperate i told her about his behavior in general and specifically at my place and in the interrogation room downtown tilly said that rudolph had lied his ass off to point the fbi at me and you believe that murphy asked dont you she shrugged point but that doesnt mean hes being used as some kind of agent i think it does i said hes not operating with the full authority of his superiors someone else has got to be pushing himsomeone who scared him enough to make him nervous and hasty maybe that works murphy said why would he do it someone wanted to make sure i wasnt involved in the search for maggie so maybe they sent rudolph after me then when tilly turns me loose they take things to the next level and try to whack me outside the fbi building murphys blue eyes were cold at the mention of the assassination attempt could they have gotten someone into position that fast i tried to work it through in my head after tilly sent rudolph out of the room it didnt take long for me to get out ten minutes fifteen at the most time enough to call in his failure and for his handler to send in a hit you think murphy thought about it herself and then shook her head slowly only if they were very very close and moved like greased lightning but harry that hit was too calm too smooth for something thrown together at the last possible moment i frowned and we both clammed up as mac came over to our table and put a pair of brown bottles down he was a spare man bald and had been ever since i knew him dressed in dark clothes and a spotless white apron we both murmured thanks and he withdrew again okay she said and took a pull from the bottle maybe rudolphs handler had already put the assassin in place as a contingency measure in case you got loose despite rudolphs efforts i shook my head it makes more sense if the assassin was already there positioned to remove rudolph once he had served his purpose whoever his handler was they would need a safety measure in place a link they could cut out of the chain so that nothing would lead back to them only once rudy calls them and tells them he isnt able to keep me locked up they have the shooter switch targets which meant i had taken three bullets meant for rudolph harry murphy asked why are you laughing i heard a joke yesterday i said i just got it she frowned at me you need some rest you look like hell and youre obviously tired enough to have gotten the giggles wizards dont giggle i said hardly able to speak this is cackling she eyed me askance and sipped her beer she waited until i had laughed myself out before speaking again you find out about maggie yet sort of i said abruptly sobered i think i know where she will be in the next few days i gave her what we had learned about the duchesss intentions leaving out the parts where i committed a bunch of crimes like theft trespassing and vandalism so right now i concluded everyones checking their contacts in mexico while im talking to you susan she asked and father forthill i said between them they should be able to find out whats going on at chichén itzá murphy nodded and asked casually hows she holding up i took another pull from the bottle and said she thinks molly has the hots for me murphy snorted wow she must have used her vampire superpowers to have worked that one out i blinked at murphy she stared at me for a second and then rolled her eyes oh come on harry really are you really that clueless uh i said still blinking apparently murphy smirked down at her beer and said its always staggering to run into one of your blind spots you dont have many of them but when you do theyre a mile wide she shook her head you didnt really answer my question you know i nodded susans a wreck maybe more so because of the whole vampire thing i dont know harry from what youve said i dont think youd need to look any further than the whole mommy thing could be i said either way shes sort of fraying at the edges like you murphy said i scowled at her what she lifted an eyebrow and looked frankly at me i started to get angry with her but stopped to force myself to think am i she nodded slowly did you notice that youve been tapping your left toe on the ground for the past five minutes i frowned at her and then down at my foot which was tapping rapidly to the point that my calf muscles were growing tired i no im your friend harry she said quietly and im telling you that you arent too stable yourself right now monsters are going to murder my child sometime soon murph maybe tonight maybe tomorrow night soon i dont have time for sanity murphy nodded slowly then sighed like someone setting down an unpleasant burden so chichén itzá looks like cool when do we hit them i shook my head we cant go all wild bunch on these people theyll flatten us she frowned but the white council wont be joining us i said i couldnt keep a bit of the snarl out of my voice and to answer your question were not sure when the ritual is supposed to take place ive got to come up with more information rudolph murphy said thoughtfully rudolph someone who is a part of this probably someone from the red court is leaning on him i plan on finding that someone and then poking him in the nose until he coughs up something i can use i think id like to talk to rudolph too well start from our ends and work toward the middle again then sounds like a plan i waved at mac and pantomimed holding a sandwich in front of me and taking a bite he nodded and glanced at murphy you want a steak sandwich too i thought you didnt have time to be sane i dont i said i dont have time to be hungry either chapter how does a police detective afford a place like this molly asked we were sitting in the blue beetle on a quiet residential street in crestwood it was late afternoon with a heavy overcast the houses on the street were large ones rudolphs place whose address id gotten from murphy was the smallest house on the blockbut it was on the block it backed right up to the cook county forest preserve too and between the old forest and the mature trees it gave the whole area a sheltered pastoral quality he doesnt i said quietly you mean hes dirty molly asked maybe i said or maybe his family has money or maybe he managed to mortgage himself to the eyeballs people get real stupid when it comes to buying homes pay an extra quarter of a million dollars for a place because its in the right neighborhood buy houses they damned well know they cant afford to make the payments on i shook my head they should make you take some kind of iotaofcommonsense quiz before you make an offer maybe it isnt stupid molly said everybody wants home to mean something maybe the extra money they pay creates that additional meaning for them i grimaced id rather have my extra meaning come from the ancient burial ground under the swimming pool or from knowing that i built it with my own hands or something not everyone puts as low a value on the material as you do boss molly said for them maybe the extra material value represented by a higher price tag is significant i grunted its still stupid from your perspective molly said its really all about perspective isnt it and from the perspective of those in need that extra quarter of a million bucks your material person spent on the prestige addition for his house looks like an awful lot of lifesaving food and medicine that could have existed if the jerk with the big house in the suburbs hadnt blown it all to artificially inflate his sociogeographic penis heh molly said and their house is much nicer than your house and that i said mouse grumbled quietly in his sleep from the backseat and i turned to reach back and rub his ears until he settled down again molly sat quietly for almost a minute before she said what else do we do other than sit tight and watch i asked this is a stakeout molly its what you do on a stakeout stakeouts suck molly said puffing out a breath that blew a few strands of hair out of her eyes how come murphy isnt doing this part how come we arent doing magic stuff murphy is keeping track of rudolph at work i said im watching his home if his handler wanted him dead this would be a logical place to bushwhack him and were not doing magic because what do you suggest we do tracking spells for rudolph and maggie she said promptly you got any of rudolphs blood hair fingernail clippings no she said so no tracking spell for him i said but what about maggie she said i know you dont have any hair or anything from her but you pulled a tracking spell for me using my mothers blood right couldnt you use your blood for that i kept my breathing steady and prevented the flash of frustration i felt from coming out in my voice first thing i tried right after i got off the phone with susan when this all started molly frowned why didnt it work i dont know i said maybe its because theres something more than simple blood relation involved maybe there has to be a bond a sense of family between the parent and child that the tracking spell uses to amplify its effects maybe the red court is using some kind of magic that conceals or jams tracking spellsgod knows they would have been forced to come up with some kind of countermeasure during the war i shook my head wearily or maybe it was simple distance ive never tracked anything more than a couple of hundred linear miles away ive heard of tracking spells that worked over a couple of thousand miles but not from anyone who had actually done it gimme some credit grasshopper of course i tried that i wouldnt have spent half a day summoning my contacts if i hadnt oh molly said she looked troubled yeah sorry i sighed and tipped my head back and closed my eyes no problem sorry kid im just tense just a little she said um should we be sitting out here in broad daylight i mean were not hiding the car or anything yeah i said we want to be visible why im gonna close my eyes i told her just for a bit stay alert okay she gave me a look but said okay i closed my eyes but about half a second after i had molly nudged me and said wake up harry we have company i opened them again and found that the grey late afternoon had settled into the murk of early evening i looked up into the rearview mirror and spotted a white sports car coming to a halt as it parked on the street behind us the running lights went off as the driver got out took him long enough i muttered molly frowned at me what do you mean asked him to meet me here didnt know where to find him molly peered through the back window and even mouse lifted his head to look around oh molly said understanding as mouses tail thumped hesitantly against the back of my seat i got out of the car and walked to meet my half brother the vampire thomas and i were a study in contrasts i was better than six and a half feet tall and built lean he was a hair under six feet and looked like a fitness model my hair was a muddy brown color generally cut very short on the sides and in back a little longer on top it tended to stick up any which way within a few minutes of being ordered by a comb thomass hair was black naturally wavy and fell to touch his shoulders i wore jeans a tshirt and my big black leather duster thomas was wearing customfitted pants made from white leather a white silk shirt and a coarser silk jacket also in white decorated with elaborate brocade he had the kind of face that belonged on billboards mine belonged on wanted posters we had the same contour of chin and our eyes resembled each others unmistakably in shape if not in color mom gave them to us thomas and i had finally met as adults hed been right there next to me in some of the worst places id ever walked he saved my life more than once id returned the favor but that had been when he decided to fight against his hunger the vampiric nature native to the vampires of the white court hed spent years maintaining control of his darker urges integrating with chicagos society and generally trying to act like a human being wed had to keep our kinship a secret the council would have used him to get at the white court if they knew ditto for the vampires getting at the council through me then something bad happened to him and he stopped trying to be human i might have seen him for a total of two even three minutes since hed been knocked off the life forcenibbling wagon and started taking big hearty bites again thomas swaggered up to me as if wed been talking just yesterday looked me up and down and said you need an image consultant stat little brother i said guess what youre an uncle thomas let his head fall back as he barked out a little laugh what no hardly unless one of fathers byblows actually survived which essentially just doesnt happen among he stopped talking in midsentence and his eyes widened yeah i said oh he said still wideeyed apparently locked into motionlessness by surprise it was a little creepy human beings still look like human beings when theyre standing still thomass pale skin and bright blue eyes went still like a statue oh i nodded say oilcan thomas blinked what you get to be the tin woodsman what never mind not important i sighed look without going into too many details i have an eightyearold daughter susan never told me duchess arianna of the red court took her um said thomas if id known that maybe i would have been here sooner couldnt say anything on the phone the fbi and the cops are involved having been made into roadblocks to slow me down i tilted my head down the street the cop who lives in that house at the end of the street has been coerced into helping whoever is trying to stop me im here hoping to nab either his handler or his cleaner and grab every bit of information i can thomas looked at me and said im an uncle i ran the palm of my hand over my face sorry he said i just thought this was going to be another chat with you all worried that the evil white court had been abusing me i need to take a moment make it a short moment i said were on the clock thomas nodded several times and seemed to draw himself back into order okay so youre looking for whats her name maggie my brother paused for a couple of heartbeats and bowed his head briefly thats a good name susan thought so so youre looking for maggie he said and you need my help i dont know the exact date but i know shes going to be brought to chichén itzá probably tonight tomorrow night at the latest why thomas asked he then added and how does this have anything to do with me theyre using her in a bloodline curse i said when they sacrifice her the curse kills her brothers and sisters then her parents then their brothers and sisters and so on wait maggie has brothers and sisters since when have you ever gotten that busy no dammit i half shouted in frustration thats just an illustration for how the bloodline curse works his eyebrows shot up oh crap youre saying that its going to kill me too yes that is exactly what im freaking saying you tool um thomas said im against that his eyes widened again wait what about the other raiths are they in any danger through me i shook my head i dont know empty night he muttered okay you know where shes going to be you want me to saddle up and help you get maggie back like we did with molly not unless theres no other choice i dont think we would survive a direct assault on the red king and his retinue on their home turf well maybe you and i couldnt naturally but with the council behind y way behind me i interrupted my voice harsh with anger so far behind me you wouldnt know they were there at all my brothers deep blue eyes flashed with an angry fire those assholes seconded motion carried i agreed so what do you think we should do i need information i said get me whatever you can any activity at chichén itzá or a nearby red stronghold sightings of a little girl surrounded by reds anything theres got to be something somewhere that will show us a chink in their armor if we find out where theyre holding her we can hit the place if i can learn something about the defensive magic around the site maybe i can poke a hole in it so that we can just grab the girl and go otherwise yeah thomas said otherwise we have to take them on at chichén itzá which would suck its a couple of miles beyond suck thomas frowned what about asking lara for help she can command a lot of firepower from the other houses of the white court why would she help me i asked selfpreservation shes big on that i grunted im not sure if the rest of your family is in any danger you arent sure they arent either thomas said and anyway if you dont know lara wont dont be too sure i said no if i go to her with this shell assume its a ploy motivated by desperation thomas folded his arms a lame ploy at that but youre missing another angle oh thomas lowered his arms and then brought them up to frame his own torso the way vanna white presents the letters on wheel of fortune incontestably im in danger shell want to protect me i looked at him skeptically thomas shrugged i play for the team now harry and everyone knows it if she lets something bad happen to me when i ask for her help its going to make a lot of people upset and not in the helpful i sure dont want to mess with her kind of way for that to work as leverage the stakes would have to be known to the rest of the court i said theyd have to know why you were in danger from a bloodline curse aimed at me then theyd all know about our blood relation not just lara thomas frowned over that for a moment then he shrugged still it might be worth the effort to approach her shes a resourceful woman my sister his expression smoothed over into neutrality quite gifted when it comes to removing obstacles she could probably help you normally i slap down suggestions like that without a second thought this time i had the second thought lara probably knew the red court as well as anyone shed been operating arm in arm with them to one degree or another for years she was the power behind the throne of the white court which prided itself on its skills of espionage manipulation and other forms of indirect strength if anyone was likely to know something about the reds it was lara raith the clock just kept on ticking maggie was running out of time she couldnt afford for me to be squeamish i would prefer not to i said quietly i need you to find out whatever you can man what happens if i cant find it if that happens i shook my head if i do nothing my little girl is going to die and so is my brother i cant live with that thomas nodded ill see what i can do dont see it do it it came out harsh enough that my brother flinched though it was a subtle motion okay he said lets his head whipped around toward rudolphs house what i asked he held up a hand for silence turning to focus intently breaking glass he murmured a lot of it harry molly called i turned to see the beetles passenger door swing open molly emerged hanging on to mouses collar with both hands the big dog was focused on rudolphs house as well and his chest bubbled with the deep tearing snarl id heard only a handful of times and always when supernatural predators were nearby someones there for rudolph i said and launched myself forward lets go chapter i looked like a cool guy leading the charge for about a second and a half and then my brother and my dog left me and molly eating their dust if i hadnt been a regular runner molly would have done the same albeit more gradually by the time i had covered half the distance thomas and mouse had already bounded around to the back one around either side of rudolphs house get gone grasshopper i called and even as we ran forward molly vanished behind her best veil it took us another quarter of a minute to cover the distance and i went around the side of the house thomas had taken i pounded around the back corner to see that a large glass sliding door leading from a wooden deck into the house had been shattered i could hear a big thumping beat as if from a subwoofer pounding away inside the house i took the stairs up to the deck in a single jumping stride and barely avoided a sudden explosion of glass wood drywall and siding that came hurling toward me i had an instant to realize that the projectile that had just come through the wall was my brother and then something huge and black and swift came crashing through the same wall expanding the hole to five times its original size the whateveritwas stood within a step or two and i was already sprinting i kept doing it i slapped one hand down and vaulted the railing on the far side of the deck i barely jerked my hand from the rail before the thing smashed it to kindling with one huge blindingly fast talon that deep beat grew louder and faster as i landed and i realized with a shock that i could hear the things rising heart rate as clearly as if it had been pounding on a drum i was kidding myself if i thought i could run from something that fast i had a step or two on the creature but it reclaimed them within half a dozen strides and swiped at my head with terrible speed and power i whirled desperately drawing my blasting rod and letting out a burst of flame but i stumbled and fell during the spin the fire hammered into the creature and for all the good it did me i might as well have hit it with a rubber chicken i thought i was done foruntil mouse emerged from the house onto the back deck bathed in a faint nimbus of blue light he took a single bounding thirtyyard leap that ended at the attacking creatures enormous malformed shoulders mouses claws dug into the things hide and his massive jaws closed on the back of its thick almost indistinguishable neck the creature arched up in pain but it never made a sound it tripped over me too distracted to actually attack but the impact of so much mass and power sent up flares of agony from my ribs and from one thigh mouse rode the creature down into the dirt tearing and worrying it his claws digging furrows in the flesh of its back his snarls reverberated in the evening air and each shake and twist of his body seemed to send up little puffs of glowing blue mist from his fur mouse had the thing dead to rights but nobody seemed to have told the creature that it twisted lithely bouncing up from the ground as if made of rubber seized mouses tail and swung the huge dog in a single complete arc mouse hit the ground like a twohundredpound sledgehammer drawing a highpitched sound of pain from him i didnt think i lifted my blasting rod again filling it with my will and with all the soulfire i could shove in screaming get off my dog white fire slammed out of the rod and drew a line on the creature from hip to skull digging into flesh and setting it ablaze once again it convulsed in silent agony and the boombox beat of its heart ratcheted up even higher it fell unable to hold on to mouse and writhed upon the ground i tried to get up but my injured leg wouldnt support me and the sudden surge of weariness that overtook me made my arms collapse too i lay there panting and helpless to move mouse staggered slowly to his feet his head hanging his tongue dangling loosely from his mouth behind me i heard a groan and twisted awkwardly to see thomas sit up one shoulder hanging at a malformed angle his clothes had been ripped to shreds there was a piece of metal protruding from his abdomen just next to his belly button and half his face was covered in a sheet of blood a little too pale to belong to a human thomas i shouted or tried to shout the acoustics were odd in this tunnel within which i was suddenly sprawled get up man he gave me a blank concussed stare the creatures movements had slowed i turned to see it beginning to relax its body shuddering the drumbeat of its heart steadying and i got a better look at it than i had before it was huge easily the size of a fullgrown bull and it carried a stench with it that was similar in potency or maybe that was because i had just overcooked it its body was odd seemingly able to move on two legs or four with equal efficiency its flesh was a spongy blackness much like the true skin of a red vampire and its head was shaped like something mixing the features of a human being a jaguar and maybe a crocodile or wild boar it was pitchblack everywhere including its eyes its tongue and its mouth and despite the punishment i had just dealt out it was getting up again thomas i shouted or wheezed the creature shook its head and its deadblack eyes focused on me it started toward me pausing briefly to swat my stunned dog out of its path mouse landed in a tumble seemingly struggling to find his balance but unable to do so i lifted my blasting rod again as it came on but i didnt have enough juice left in me to make the rod do anything but smoke faintly and then a stone sailed in from nowhere and struck the creature on the snout hey called mollys voice hey captain asphalt hey tar baby over here the creature and i turned to see molly standing maybe twenty yards away in plain sight she flung another rock and it bounced off the creatures broad chest its heartbeat began to accelerate and grow louder again lets go gorgeous molly called you and me she turned sideways to the thing rolled her hips and made an exaggerated motion of swatting herself on the ass come get some the thing tensed and then rushed forward covering the ground with astonishing speed molly vanished the creature smashed into the earth where shed been standing with its huge talons balled into furious fists slamming them eight inches into the earth there was a peal of mocking laughter and another rock bounced off of the thing this time from the left furious it whirled to rush molly againand again she vanished completely once more it struck at empty ground once more molly got its attention with a rock and a few taunts only to vanish from sight as it came at her each time she was a little closer to the creature unable to match its raw speed and each time she led it a little farther away from the three of us a couple of times she even shouted toro toro olé thomas i called get up my brother blinked his eyes several times each time a little more quickly then he swiped a hand at the bloodied side of his face shook his head violently to get the blood out of his eyes and looked down at the section of metal bar sticking out of his stomach he clenched it with his hand grimaced and drew it slowly out revealing a sixinch triangle that must have been a corner brace in the wall hed gone through he dropped it on the ground groaning in pain and his eyes rolled briefly back into his head i saw his other nature coming over him his skin grew paler and almost seemed to take on its own glow his breathing stabilized immediately and the cut along his hairline where hed been bleeding began to close he opened his eyes and their color had changed from a deep contented blue to a hungry metallic silver he got up smoothly and glanced at me you bleeding nah i said im good a few feet away mouse got to his feet and shook himself his tags jingling molly had gotten as far as the street again and there was an enormous crashing sound this time we do it smart thomas said he turned to mouse instead of me im going to go in first and get its attention go for its strings i think youll have to hit two limbs to really cripple it mouse woofed evidently an affirmative let out a grumbling growl and once more very faint very pale blue light gathered around him thomas nodded and picked up a section of ruined deck that had scattered around where he landed he shouldered a corner post a section of fourbyfour about a yard and a half long and said dont sweat harry well be back for you in a minute go team dresden i wheezed the two of them took off zero to cheetah speed in about a second then they were out of sight i heard thomas let out a highpitched cry that was a pretty darn good bruce lee impersonation and there was a thunder crack of wood striking something hard an instant later mouse let out his battle roar there was a flicker of strobing colors of light as molly pitched a bit of dazzling magic at the creature it wouldnt hurt the thing but the kid could make eyesearing light in every color imaginable burst from empty air accompanied by a variety of sounds if she so chose she called it her onewoman rave spell and during the last independence day she had used it to throw up a fireworks display from her parents backyard so impressive that evidently it had caused traffic problems on the expressway it was hard to lie there twisted halfway around at the waist to see only the occasional flash of light or to hear the thumps and snarls of combat i tried my leg again and had no luck so i just settled down and concentrated on not blacking out or breathing too hard the creature had definitely cracked at least one of my ribs that was when i noticed the two sets of glowing red eyes staring at me from the forest staring with the unmistakable fixation of a predator and coming slowly steadily silently closer i suddenly realized that everyone around who might have helped me was sort of distracted at the moment oh i breathed oh crap chapter the eyes rushed toward me and something dark and strong struck me across the jaw i was already close to losing consciousness the blow was enough to ring my bells thoroughly i was aware of being picked up and tossed over someones shoulder then there was a lot of rapid sickening motion it went on long enough for me to throw up i didnt have enough energy to aim at my abductor a subjective eternity later i was thrown to the ground i lay still hoping to fool my captor into thinking i was barely conscious and weak as a kitten which should be easy since i was ive never really had much ambition as a performer we dont like it said a womans voice its power smells foul we must be patient replied a mans voice it could be a great asset it is listening to us the woman said we know that replied the man i heard soft footsteps cushioned by pine needles and the woman spoke again more slowly and lower she sounded hungry poor thing so battered we should give it a kiss and let it sleep it would be merciful and he would be pleased with us no our love he would be satisfied with us there is a difference have we not come to understand this simple fact she shot back acid in her voice never will he name us to the circle no matter how many prizes we bring into the court we are interlopers we are not of the first maya many things can change in the span of eternity our love we will be patient you mean that he might fall she let out a rather disconcerting giggle then why arent we currying favor with arianna we shall not even consider it he replied his voice hard should we even think of it too often he might know he might act do we understand we do she said her tone petulant then someone grabbed my shoulder in ironstrong fingers and flipped me onto my back the dark shapes of trees spun above me nothing more than black outlines against the lights of chicago reflecting from the overcast there was barely enough light to let me see the pale delicate features of a tiny woman no larger than a child seriously she might have been fourfootsix though her proportions seemed identical to those of any adult she had very pale skin with a light dusting of freckles and looked as if she might be nineteen years old her hair was light brown and very straight her eyes were extremely oddlooking one was pale icy blue the other deep dark green and i had an immediate instinct that whatever creature lurking behind those mismatched eyes was not a rational being she was wearing a gown with long flowing sleeves and some kind of sleeveless robe and corset over that she was barefoot though i knew because i could feel her cold little foot when she planted it on my chest and leaned over to peer down at me were too late look its starting to go bad nonsense said the male voice its a perfectly appropriate specimen mortal wizards are supposed to be worn and tough our love i looked up and saw the other speaker he was perhaps fivefootsix with a short brush of red hair a black beard and skin that looked darkened and bronzed by the sun he wore black silk clothing and looked like hed just come from a dress rehearsal of hamlet aha i said you must be esteban and esmerelda ive heard about you we are famous hissed the little woman beaming up at the man he gave her a stern look sighed and said aye we are here to stop you from allowing arianna to proceed with her design i blinked what esmerelda leaned closer her hair brushed my nose and lips are its ears broken if the ears are defective can we detach them and send them back peace our love esteban said he hunkered down on his heels and eyed me it isnt its fault it doesnt even realize how arianna is manipulating it what are you talking about i said look folks no one wants to stop arianna more than me esteban waved a vague hand yes yes it feels it must rescue its spawn it will try to take her back from the very heart of his realm placing it at the center of vast moving powers where it might tip balances any number of ways it hardly looks large enough esmerelda sniffed its just a ragged dirty creature esteban shrugged we know by now that the outside hardly matters what lies within is what holds importance would you agree ragged wizard i licked my lips i really didnt feel up to bantering with a couple of insane vampires but it was probably my best course of action anything that lives long enough tends to lose track of passing time rather easily on the minutetominute scale after a few thousand years have gone by an hour doesnt really rate if my brother and company were successful in their fight they would realize i was gone within a few minutesand i didnt think the eebs had carried me far enough away to let them evade mouse as far as i can tell mouse can follow a scent trail from space talk to them stall that depends upon the nature of the subject and observer i said but if you are using the metaphor in its simplest form then yes the true nature of any given being supersedes its outer appearance in terms of importance i tried a smile this is quite pleasant treatment by the way i said i had expected something entirely different we wanted to eat you and kill you or kill you then eat you esmerelda said smiling back hers was a lot crazier looking than mine i hoped and might still obviously you had something else in mind though i said apparently you wish to talk im more than willing to listen excellent esteban said we are pleased that you can address the matter rationally to which matter do you refer specifically the matter of your involvement with ariannas plan esteban said we wish you to discontinue your participation that could be problematic since if she does what she intends to do its going to kill me along with the childs mother the two vampires traded a long silent glance their facial expressions shifting subtly i got the impression that a lot of communication got done esteban turned back to me how did you learn of this ragged wizard its what i do i said oooo said esmerelda she slid her body on top of mine straddling my hips with hers she was so tiny that i could hardly feel her weight on me she smelled wrong like formaldehyde and mildew it is arrogant we adore arrogance its so sweet to watch arrogant little things succumb do you like our pretty eyes ragged wizard which color do you like more look closely and carefully you dont look vampires in the eyes everyone knows that one even so id had a couple of encounters with the stare of one of the red court and never had a problem shutting them out it wasnt even particularly difficult but evidently those vampires had been noobs ice blue and deep sea green swirled in my vision and it was only at the very last instant that i realized what was happening slamming closed the vaults of my mind leaving only the hard fortified places to attack a castle of idea and memory ready to withstand an assault stop that please i said quietly a moment later the conversation isnt getting anywhere like this the little vampire pursed her lips her head tilted as if she were deciding whether to be upset or amused she went with amused she giggled and wriggled her hips around a little lovely lovely lovely we are well pleased you do have options esteban said if he was put out by esmereldas behavior it didnt show hell he hadnt even seemed to notice by all means i said enumerate them i suppose the simplest means to solve our problem would be for you to take your own life he said if you are dead arianna has no reason to harm your spawn aside from the beingdead part there are some minor problems with that idea by all means esteban said enumerate them what confirmation would i have that the child was safe and returned to her mother what security would i have to make me believe that arianna might not do the same thing a month from now a contract could be drafted esteban said witnessed and signed arbitrated by one of the neutral parties of the accords for security we suppose we could ask our lord if he would give his word upon it that your mate and spawn were free of the cycle of vengeance a possibility worth consideration i said though the part where i die seems to be something of a flaw understandably esteban said we might also offer you an alternative to death the roll of esmereldas hips became slower more sensuous ive been abused by red court vampires in the past i still have nightmares sometimes but the prettyseeming girl atop me had that feminine mystique that defies description and definition being so close to her was making me nauseous but my body was reacting to her with uncomfortable intensity alternative she said in a breathy little voice in this day that means fashionable and we do so love showing little mortals how to be fashionable you would make me like you i said quietly esmerelda nodded slowly her mouth drawing up into a lazy sensual smile her hips still circling maddeningly against mine her fangs were showing it would offer you several advantages esteban said even should arianna complete the vengeance rite the transformation of your blood would insulate you against it and of course you would not be killed captured or tortured to death as the white council will be over the next six months or so it certainly bears consideration as well i said very practical are there any other paths you think feasible one more esteban said gift your spawn to our lord the red king if id had the strength to take a swing at him i would have so it was probably a good thing that i didnt and what would that accomplish he would then take possession of the spawn she would in fact be under his protection until such time as he deemed her unfit unworthy or unneeding of such care esmerelda nodded rapidly she would be his he does so dote on his little pets we think it quite endearing she opened her mouth in a little o like a schoolgirl caught in the midst of a whispered conference about forbidden subjects oh my would arianna be upset she would howl for centuries we could provide chattel in exchange to sweeten the deal dresden esteban said we would be willing to go as high as seven young women you could select them from our stock or from their natural habitat and we would see to their preparation and disposition i thought about it for a long moment and rubbed lightly at my chin then i said these are all very rational suggestions but i feel that i do not understand something why does the red king not simply order arianna to desist both of the eebs drew in breaths of scandalized surprise because of her mate dresden said esteban slain by the wizard of the black stick said esmerelda a blood debt sacred blood holy blood esteban shook his head not even our lord can interfere in the collection of a blood debt it is ariannas right esmerelda nodded as it was biancas to collect from you in the opening days of the war though many wished that she would not have done what she did it was her right even as a very very young member of the court as her progenitor ariannas mate took up that debt as arianna now has done herself she looked at esteban and beamed we are so happy with the ragged wizard it is so civil and pleasant completely unlike those other wizards might we keep it for our own business our love esteban chided business first esmerelda thrust out her lower lipand abruptly turned all motion ceasing to focus intently in one direction what is it our love esteban asked quietly the ikkuox she said in a distant puzzled voice it is in pain it flees it she opened her eyes very wide and suddenly they flooded in solid black just as the creatures had been oh it cheated her face turned down to mine and she bared her fangs it cheated it brought a demon of its own a mountain ice demon from the land of dreams if you dont exercise them theyre impossible i said philosophically the constable esteban said did it kill the constable esmerelda returned to staring at nothing for a moment and then said no it was attacked only seconds after entering his home she shivered and looked up at esteban the ragged wizards demon comes this way and swiftly esteban sighed we had hoped to work out something civilized this is your last chance ragged wizard what say you to my offer go fuck yourself i said estebans eyes went black and flat kill him esmereldas body tightened in what looked like a sexual fervor and she leaned down teeth bared letting out a low sound filled to the brim with erotic and physical need during the last few moments the fingers of my right hand had undone the clasp on my mothers amulet as the little vampire leaned into me she met the silver pentacle necklace the symbol of what i believed a fivepointed star representing the four elements and the spirit bound within a circle of mortal control will and compassion im not a wiccan im not big on churches of any kind despite the fact that ive spoken facetoface with an archangel of the almighty but there were some things i believed in some things i had faith in and faith isnt about perfect attendance to services or how much money you put on the little plate it isnt about going skyclad to the holy rites or meditating each day upon the divine faith is about what you do its about aspiring to be better and nobler and kinder than you are its about making sacrifices for the good of otherseven when theres not going to be anyone telling you what a hero you are faith is a power of its own and one even more elusive and difficult to define than magic a symbol of faith presented with genuine belief and sincerity is the bane of many an otherworldly predatorand one of the creatures most strongly affected were vampires of the red court i dont know how it works or why i dont know if some kind of powerful being or being must get involved along the line i never asked for one of them to do thatbut if so one of them was backing me up anyway the pentacle flared into brilliant silver light that struck esmerelda like a sixfoot wave throwing her off of me and tearing the flesh mask she wore to shreds revealing the creature inside it i twisted and presented the symbol to esteban but he had already backed several paces away and it only forced him to lift his hand to shade his eyes as he continued retreating there was a hissing serpentine sound from esmerelda and i saw a gaunt blackskinned creature stand up out of the ruins of gown and flesh mask alike it was just as small as she was but its limbs were longer by at least a third than hers had seemed long and scrawny a flabby black belly sagged down and its face would make one of those really ugly south american bats feel better about itself she opened her jaws baring fangs and a long writhing tongue that was pink with black spots her allblack eyes were ablaze with fury shadows shifted as a pale blue light began to grow nearer and the woods suddenly rang out with mouses triumphant hunting howl he had found my scentor that of the vampiresand was closing in esmerelda hissed again and the sound was full of rage and hate we mustnt esteban snarled he dashed around me with supernatural speed giving the glowing pendant a wide berth he seized the little vampire woman by the arm they both stared at me for an instant with their cold empty black eyesand then there was the sound of a rushing wind and they were gone i sagged onto the ground gratefully my racing heart began to slow my fear to subside my confusion as to what was happening remained though maybe it was so tangled and impossible because i was so exhausted yeah right mouse let out a single loud bark and then the big dog was standing next to me over me he nudged me with his nose until i lifted a hand and scratched his ears a little thomas and molly arrived next i was glad thomas had let mouse do the pursuit while he came along more slowly so that my apprentice wouldnt be alone in the woods his eyes were bright silver his mouth set in a smug line and there was broken glass shining in his hair the left half of mollys upper body was generously coated in green paint okay i slurred im backward whats that molly asked kneeling down next to me her expression worried backward m a detective supposed to find things out i been working backward the more i look at it the more certain i am that i have no idea whats going on can you stand thomas asked leg i said ribs might be broken cant take the weight ill carry him thomas said find a phone okay my brother picked me up and carried me out of the woods we went back to the car the cars remains i stared dully at the mess it looked as though something had taken thomass white jag and put it in a trash compactor with the blue beetle the two cars together had been smashed down into a mass about four feet high liquids and fuel bled out onto the street below them thomas gingerly put me down on my good leg as i stared at my car there was no way the beetle was going to resurrect from this one i found myself blinking tears out of my eyes it wasnt an expensive car it wasnt a sexy car it was my car and it was gone dammit i mumbled hmmm thomas asked he looked considerably less broken up than me my staff was inna car i sighed takes weeks to make one of those laras going to be annoyed with me thomas said thats the third one this year i rolled my eyes yeah i feel your pain what happened with the big thing the fight thomas shrugged bullfighting tactics for the most part when it tried to focus on one the other two would come at its back mouse did you rather proud the big dog wagged his tail cheerily paint i asked oh the thing threw a fivegallon bucket of paint at her either trying to kill her with it or so it could try to see her through the veil worked for about five seconds too but then she fixed it and was gone again she did fairly well for someone so limited in offense thomas said let me see if i can salvage anything from my trunk excuse me i just sat down on the street in front of the car and mouse came up to sit with me offering a furry flank for support the blue beetle was dead i was too tired to cry much i called a cab molly said reappearing it will meet us two blocks down get him and ill veil us until it arrives yeah thomas said and picked me up again i dont remember being awake for the cab ride chapter thomas supported most of my weight as my injured leg began to buckle and settled me in one of the chairs in the living room we cant be here long he said those two reds know hes injured and exhausted theyll be back looking for an opening or trying to pick one of us off when were vulnerable right right molly said how is he he crouched down in front of me and peered at me his irises looked like polished chrome still punchy shock maybe hes in a lot of pain i was oh i was that might explain the way i wasnt talking i guessed god molly said her voice shaking ill get some of his things this isnt right thomas said get bob molly sounded confused get what his expression flickered with surprise and then went neutral again sorry lips disconnected from my brain get the swords they arent here molly said moving around her voice came from my bedroom he moved them hid them along with his ghost dust and a bunch of other illegal things thomas frowned at that and then nodded okay itll have to do where do we take him molly appeared in my field of vision and knelt down to peer at me she took one of my hands in hers wherever is good i guess thomas took a slow breath his silver eyes grew even brighter it was creepy as hell and fascinating i was hoping you knew a good spot i sure as hell cant take him to my place mollys voice sharpened i dont even have a place she said i still live at my parents house less whining thomas said his voice cool more telling me a place to take him where he wont be killed i am molly began then she closed her eyes for a second and moderated her tone i am sorry im just she glanced up at thomas im just scared i know thomas said through clenched teeth um molly said she swallowed why do your eyes do that there was a lengthy pause before thomas answered they arent my eyes miss carpenter theyre my demons eyes the better to see you with demon molly said she was staring youre hungry like the vampire way after a fight like that thomas said im barely sane both of them should have known better every time a wizard looks another person in the eyes he runs the risk of triggering a deeper seeing a voyeuristic peep through the windows of someone elses soul you get a snapshot of the true nature of that person and they get a peek back at you it was only the second time id ever seen a soulgaze happen to someone else there was an instant where both of them locked their eyes on each others mollys eyes widened suddenly like a frightened does and she jerked in a sharp breath she stared at him with her chin twisting to one side as if she were tryingand failingto look away thomas went unnaturally still and though his eyes also widened it reminded me more of a cat crouching down in anticipation just before pouncing on its prey mollys back arched slightly and a soft moan escaped her her eyes filled with tears god she said god no no youre beautiful god you hurt so much need so much let me help you she fumbled for his hand thomas never moved as her fingers touched his not a muscle his eyes closed very slowly miss carpenter he whispered do not touch me please no its all right molly said its all right im here thomass hand moved too quickly to be seen he caught her wrist in his pale fingers and she let out a short gasp he opened his eyes and focused on hers and molly began to breathe harder the tips of her breasts showed against her shirt and her mouth opened with another soft moan i think i made a quiet sound of protest neither of them heard it he leaned closer the motion feline and serpentine at the same time molly began trembling she licked her lips and began to slowly lean forward toward him their lips met and her body quivered tensed and then went rigid a breathless sound escaped her as her eyes rolled back in her head and thomas was suddenly pressed against her mollys hips rocked against his her hands came up and began clawing at his shirt tearing the buttons from the silk so that her palms could flatten against his naked chest mouse hit thomas like a wrecking ball the big dogs charge tore my brother away from my apprentice and slammed him into the brick of the fireplace thomas let out a sudden snarl of pure surprised rage but mouse had him by the throat before he could recover the big dogs jaws didnt snap closedbut the tips of his teeth sank into flesh and he held thomas there a growl bubbling from his chest my brothers hand flailed reaching for the poker that hung beside the fireplace mouse took note of it and gave thomas a warning shake his teeth sinking a tiny bit deeper my brother didnt quit reaching for the weapon and i saw the tension gathering in the big dogs body i came rushing back into myself all at once and said weakly thomas he froze mouse cocked an ear toward me thomas i croaked dont hes protecting the girl thomas let out a gasping pained sound then i saw him grimace and force himself to relax to surrender his body slowly eased away from its fighting tension and he held up both hands palms out and lifted his chin a little higher okay he rasped okay its okay now show me your eyes i said he did they were a shade of pale pale grey with only flecks of reflective hunger dancing through them i grunted mouse mouse backed off slowly gradually easing the pressure of his jaws gently taking his teeth out of thomass throat he took a pair of steps back and then sat down head lowered to a fighting crouch that kept his own throat covered he kept facing thomas made no sound and didnt move it looked odd and eerie on the big dog cant stay here thomas said the bite wounds in his throat looked swollen angry their edges were slightly blackened as if the dogs teeth had been redhot not with her like that he closed his eyes i didnt mean to sorry i looked at molly who was curled into a fetal position and shaking still breathing hard get out i said how will you thomas i said and my voice was slightly stronger hot with anger you could have hurt molly you could have killed her my only defense is down here babysitting you instead of standing guard get out youre no good to me like this mouse let out another warning growl im sorry thomas said again im sorry then he eased around mouse and departed his feet making little sound as he went up the stairs i sat there for a moment hurting in practically every sense my entire body tingled with unpleasant pinpricks as though it had gone to sleep and was only now feeling the return of circulation the soulfire i must have pushed too much of it through me terror adrenaline must have kept me rolling for a little while but after that id collapsed into pure passivity terror on behalf of my brother and molly had given me back my voice my will but it might not last it hurt to sit upright it hurt to breathe moving anything hurt and not moving anything hurt so i supposed i might as well be moving i tried to get up but my left leg wasnt having any of it and i was lucky not to end up on the floor without being told mouse got up and hurried into my room i heard some heavy thumping as he rustled around under my bed which had required him to lift it onto his massive shoulders he came out a moment later carrying one of my crutches left over from injuries past in his teeth whos a good dog i said he wagged his tail at me and went back for the other one once i had them both i was able to get up and gimp my way over to the kitchen tylenol is good stuff but it is also illegal stuff to have without a prescription if you arent canadian so it was currently buried in my godmothers insane garden i took a big dose of tylenol the original since i didnt have my tylenol or its lesserknown shortlived cousin tylenol two the pain strikes back i realized that i was telling mouse all of this out loud as i thought it which had the potential to become awkward if it should become a habit once that was done and id drunk a third glass of water i moved over to molly and checked her pulse it was steady her breathing had slowed her eyes were slightly open and unfocused i muttered under my breath the damned girl was going to get herself killed this was the second time shed come very close to being fed upon by a vampire though admittedly the first had been in a vicarious fashion still it couldnt be good for her to be hit with it again and if thomas had actually begun to feed on her there was no telling what it might do to her molly i said then louder molly she drew in a sudden little breath and blinked up at me youre smearing paint all over my rug i said wearily she sat up looking down at herself and at the green paint smeared all over her she looked up at me again dazed what just happened you soulgazed thomas you both lost perspective he nearly ate you i poked her with a crutch mouse saved you get up right she said right she stood up very slowly wincing and rubbing at one wrist um is is thomas all right mouse nearly killed him i said hes scared ashamed half out of his mind with hunger and gone i thumped her leg lightly with my crutch what were you thinking molly shook her head if youd seen i mean if youd seen him seen how lonely he was felt how much pain he was in how empty he feels harry she teared up again ive never felt anything so horrible in my life or seen anyone braver apparently you figured youd help him out by letting him rip the life out of you she faced me for a moment then flushed and looked away he it doesnt get ripped out it gets she blushed i think the only phrase that works is licked away like licking the frosting off of a cake or or the candy coating off of one of those lollipops except that as soon as you find out how many licks it takes him to get to your creamy center youre dead i said or insane which is somewhat chilling to consider given the things you can do so i repeat i thumped her leg with the tip of my crutch on each word what were you thinking it wont happen again she said but i saw her shiver as she said it i grunted skeptically staring down at her molly wasnt ready not for something like we were about to do she had too much confidence and not nearly enough sound judgment it was frustrating by the time i had been her age i had finished my apprenticeship in private investigation and was opening my own business and i had been living under the doom of damocles for the better part of a decade of course i had an experience advantage on molly i had made my first dark compact with my old master justin dumorne when i was ten or eleven though i hadnt known what i was getting into at the time id made a second one with the leanansidhe when i was sixteen and id wound up under roundtheclock observation from the paranoid warden morgan it had been a brief lifetime for me at that point but absolutely chockfull of lessons in the school of hard knocks i had made plenty of dumb decisions of my own by then and somehow managed to survive them but i also hadnt been dallying around in situations as hot as this one was a troll under a bridge or an upset spirit or two was as bad as it got it had prepared me for what i faced today molly was facing it cold shed been burned once before but it had taken me more than one attempt to learn that lesson she might not survive her next test she looked up at me and asked what we need to move i said i met the eebs while you three were playing with the ikk with the ikkookookachoo i scrunched up my nose trying to remember the name of the creature and couldnt with the ick i said and they were charming in an entirely amoral murderous sort of way thomas was right theyll be after me looking for an opening were going where st marys i said the red court cant walk on holy ground and susan knows ive used it as a fallback position before she and martin can catch up to me there and ive got to get some rest she rose nodding okay okay ill get you a change of clothes all right call a cab first i said and pack the tylenol and some of mouses food right okay i leaned on my crutches and stayed standing while she bustled around the room i didnt want to risk sitting down again the tylenol had taken the worst edge off the pain and my thoughts though tired and sluggish seemed to be firmly connected to my body again i didnt want to risk relaxing into lassitude say that five times fast i murmured and tried it was something to do that i couldnt screw up too badly a while later mouse made a whuffing sound from the top of the stairs outside and molly plodded up them wearily cabs here harry she called i got myself moving stairs on crutches isnt fun but id done it before i took my time moving slowly and steadily look out she yelled a bottle smashed against the top interior wall of the stairwell and its contents splashed all over the place fire spreading over them as they did ye olde molotov cocktail still a formidable weapon even after a century of use theres more to one of those things than simple burning fuel fire that hot sucks the oxygen out of the air around it especially when it has a nice dank stairway to use as a chimney and you neednt get splattered by the spilling fuel to get burned when a fire is hot enough itll burn exposed flesh from inches or feet away turning the atmosphere around it into an oven i was only on the second or third step up from the bottom but i staggered back before anything could get roastedbeen there done that not going back i tried to fall onto my uninjured side figuring that it deserved a chance to join in the fun too i landed more or less the way i wanted to and it hurt like hell but at least i didnt faint i screamed though a number of vitriolic curses as fire roared above me leaping from my little stairwell to the rest of the house chewing into the old wood like a hungry living thing harry molly called from somewhere beyond the flames harry mouse let out a heartsicksounding bay and i saw fire beginning to climb the sides of the house the fire was starting from the outside by the time it started setting off fire alarms it would be too late to escape at this time of night somewhere up above me mrs spunkelcrief was asleep and unaware of the danger and on the second floor my elderly neighbors the willoughbys would be in similar straits and all because they were unlucky enough to live in the same building as me id dropped one of my crutches up on the stairs and one end had caught on fire there was no way i was pulling much in the way of magic out of my hat not until id had food and some rest hells bells for that matter i didnt know if i could stand up on my own but if i didnt do something three innocent peopleplus myselfwere going to die in a fire come on harry i said you arent halfcrippled youre halfcompetent the fire roared higher and i didnt believe myself for a second but i put my hands on the ground and began heaving myself upright do or die dresden i told myself fiercely and firmly ignored the fear pounding in my chest do or die the dying really did seem a lot more likely chapter i looked up at my apartments ceiling hobbling along on my crutch i found the spot i thought would be the middle of mrs ss living room and noted that one of my old sofas was directly beneath it using the crutch as a lever i slipped one end of it behind one of my big old bookcases and heaved the bookcase shuddered and then fell in a great crash of paperback novels and hardwood shelves smashing down onto my couch i grunted in satisfaction and climbed up onto the fallen bookcase using its back as a ramp i crawled painfully up to the end of the ramp lifted my right hand and triggered one of the rings i wore there they were magical tools created to retain a little bit of kinetic energy every time i moved my arm and when they were operating at capacity they packed one hell of a lot of energyand i had freshly charged them up on the punching bag when i cut loose with the ring invisible force struck my ceiling blowing completely through it and through the floor of the room above tearing at faded carpeting the color of dried mustard i adjusted my aim a little and blew the entire charge out of the ring on the next finger and another one after that each one blasting the opening wider until it was big enough that i thought i ought to fit through it i hooked the padded end of my crutch over the broken end of a thick floor joist and used it to haul myself up to my good leg then i tossed the crutch up through the hole and reached up to pull myself through mister let out a harsh worried meow and i froze in place my cat was still in my apartment i looked wildly around the room for him and found him crouching in his usual favorite spot atop the highest bookshelf his hair stood on end and every muscle on him seemed tight and strained id already tossed the crutch through if i went back for him i might not be able to stand once id made it back to the ramp i had no idea how id hold him while climbing up assuming i could do it at all mister weighs the nextbest thing to thirty pounds thats one hell of a handicap on a pullup for that matter if the fire spread as quickly as i thought it would the extra time it took might mean that i wound up trapped with no exit and there would be no one to help mr s and the willoughbys i loved my cat he was family but as i stared at him i knew that i couldnt help him unless you use your flipping brain harry i snapped at myself duh never quit never quit the sunken windows around my apartment were too small to be a means of escape for me but mister could clear them with ease i took aim used a single charge from my ring and shattered the sunken window closest to the cat mister took the hint at once and prowled down the tops of two bookcases it was a fivefoot leap from the top of the shelf to the window well but mister made it look casual i felt myself grinning fiercely as he vanished through the broken window and into the cool air of the october night stars and stones at least id accomplished one positive thing that day i turned reached up into the opening with my arms straight over my head and hopped as hard as i could with one leg it wasnt much of a leap but it was enough to let me get my arms through and my elbows wedged against either side of the opening my ribs were on fire as i kicked and wriggled my way up through the hole and hauled myself into mrs spunkelcriefs living room it had last been decorated in the seventies judging by the mustard yellow carpet and the olive green wallpaper and it was full of furniture and knickknacks i dragged myself all the way through the hole knocking over a little display stand of collectors plates as i did the room was dimly lit by the growing flames outside i grabbed my crutch climbed to my feet through screaming pain and hobbled farther into the apartment i found mrs s in the apartments one bedroom she was sleeping mostly sitting up propped on a pile of pillows her old television was on sans volume with subtitles appearing at the bottom of the screen i gimped over to her and shook her gently she woke up with a start and slugged me with one tiny fist i fell backward onto my ass more out of pure surprise than anything else and grimaced in painfrom the fall not the punch i shook it off and looked up again to find the little old lady holding a little revolver probably a in her hands it looked magnumsized she held it like she knew what she was doing too in two hands peering down at me through the guns sights mr dresden she said her voice squeaky how dare you fire i said mrs s theres a fire a fire well i wont fire if you just sit still she said in a querulous tone she took her left hand off the gun and reached for her phone im calling the police you hold real still or i gotta shoot you no bluff this here is a grandfathered gun legal and proper i tried to point toward the bedroom door without moving my body indicating it with my fingertips and tilts of my head are you on drugs boy she said punching numbers on the phone without looking you are acting like a crazy junkie coming into an old womans she glanced past me where there was some fairly bright light flickering wildly in the hallway outside the bedroom i kept wiggling my fingers and nodding toward it desperately mrs ss eyes widened and her mouth dropped open fire she said abruptly theres a fire right there i nodded frantically she lowered the gun and started kicking her way clear of covers and pillows she wore flannel pajamas but grabbed at a blue robe in any case and hurried toward the door come on boy theres a fire i struggled desperately to my feet and started hobbling out she turned to look at me apparently surprised that she was moving faster than i was you could hear the fire now and smoke had begun to thicken the air i pointed up at the ceiling and shouted the willoughbys willoughbys she looked up lord god almighty she turned and hurried down the hall coming within ten feet of a wall that was already becoming a sheet of flame she grabbed at something cursed then pulled her robe down over her hand and picked up something using the material as an oven mitt she hurried over to me with a ring of keys come on the front doors already going up out the back we both hurried out the back door of the house and into its minuscule little yard and i saw at once that the entire front side of the house was aflame the stairs up to the willoughbys place were already on fire i turned to her and shouted ladder wheres the ladder i need to use the ladder no she shouted back you need to use the ladder good grief okay i shouted back and gave her a thumbsup she hustled back to the little storage shed in the backyard she picked a key and unlocked it i swung the door open and seized the metal extending ladder i used to put up and take down christmas lights every year i ditched my crutch and used the ladder itself to take some of the weight i went as fast as i could but it seemed to take forever to position the ladder under the willoughbys bedroom windows mrs spunkelcrief handed me a loose brick from a little flower planters wall and said here i cant climb this thing my hip i took the brick and dropped it in my duster pocket then i started humping myself up the ladder taking a grip with both hands then hopping up with a painful little jump repeat each time growing more painful more difficult i clenched my teeth over the screams and then there was a window in front of me i got the brick out of my pocket hauled off and shattered the window black smoke bellowed out catching me on the inhale i started coughing viciously my voice strangled as i tried to shout mr and mrs willoughby fire youve got to get out fire come to the window and down the ladder i heard two people coughing and choking they were trying to say help something maybe the little propane tank on mrs spunkelcriefs grill exploded with a noise like a dinosaursized watermelon hitting the ground the concussion knocked mrs s downand kicked the bottom of the ladder out from under me i fell it was a horrible helpless feeling my body twisting uselessly as i tried to land wellbut id had no warning at all and it was a futile attempt the small of my back hit the brick planter and i achieved a new personal best for pain oh god in heaven mrs spunkelcrief said she knelt beside me harry somewhere sirens had begun to wail they wouldnt get there in time for the willoughbys trapped i choked out as soon as i was able to breathe again theyre up there calling for help the fire roared louder and grew brighter mrs s stared up at the window she grabbed the ladder and wrestled it all the way back up into position though the effort left her panting then she tried to put a foot up on the first step she grasped the ladder began to shift her weightand groaned as her leg buckled and she fell to the ground she screamed agony in her quavering voice oh god in heaven help us a young black man in a dark kneelength coat hurdled the hedges at the back of the yard and bounded onto the ladder he was built like a professional lineman moved more quickly than a linebacker and started up the ladder like it was a broad staircase the planets only knight of the cross flashed me a quick grin on the way up dresden sanya i howled two therere two of them in the bedroom da two he replied his deep voice booming the curving saber blade of esperacchius rode at his hip and he managed it with thoughtless instinctive skill as he went through the window he was back a moment later with mrs willoughby draped over one shoulder while he supported most of mr willoughbys staggering body with the other sanya went first the old woman hanging limply over his shoulder so that he could help mr willoughby creep out the window and onto the ladder they came down slowly and carefully and as sanya carefully laid the old woman out onto the grass the first of the emergency response crews arrived god in heaven mr s said weeping openly as she put her hand on sanyas arm he must have sent you to us son sanya smiled at her as he helped mr willoughby lower himself to the ground then he turned to my landlady and said his russian accent less heavy than the last time i had seen him it was probably just a coincidence maam i dont believe in those said mrs spunkelcrief bless you son she said and hugged him hard her arms couldnt have gotten around half of him but sanya returned the hug gently for a moment maam he said you should direct the medical technicians to come back here thank you thank you she said releasing him but now i have to go get those ambulance boys over here she paused and gave me a smile and thank you harry such a good boy then she hurried away mouse came racing around the side of the house where mrs s had just gone and rushed to stand over me lapping at my face molly wasnt far behind she let out a little cry and threw her arms around my shoulders oh god harry she shouldered mouse aside and squeezed tight for several seconds she looked up and said sanya what are you doing here hey hey i said take it easy molly eased up on her hug sorry sanya i said nodding to him thanks for your help part of the job da he replied grinning glad to help all the same i said my voice rough thank you if anything had happened to them oh harry molly said she hugged me again easy padawan easy i said quietly think you should be careful she drew back with a frown why i took a slow breath and said very quietly i cant feel my legs chapter it didnt take me long to talk sanya and molly out of taking me to the hospital the eebs as it turned out had shown up pitched their firebomb from a moving car and kept going a modus operandi that was consistent with the earlier attempt on my life except this time theyd been identified mollys description of the thrower was a dead ringer for esteban i had to admit the vampire couple had a very practical longterm approach to violencestriking at weakness and harassing the victim while exposing themselves to minimal risk if id been a couple of steps higher up when that molotov hit id be dead or covered in thirddegree burns individually their attempts might not enjoy a high success ratebut they needed to get it right only once it would be consistent with that practical coldblooded style to keep an eye on the hospitals in order to come finish me offduring surgery for example or while i was still in recovery afterward sanya though had emt training of some kind he calmly stole a backboard out of an open ambulance while its techs were seeing to the willoughbys and they loaded me onto it in a procedure that sanya said would protect my spine it seemed kind of too little too late to me but i was too tired to rib him over it i couldnt feel anything below the waist but that apparently didnt mean that the rest of me got to stop hurting i felt them carrying the board out and when i opened my eyes it was only to see nearly a third of the building give way and crash down into the basementinto my apartment the building was obviously a lost cause the firemen were focusing on containing the blaze and preventing it from spreading to the nearby homes they loaded the backboard into the rental minivan sanya had by happy coincidence been given at the airport when he arrived at no additional fee in order to substitute for the subcompact hed reserved but couldnt have as it drove away during the confusion and before the cops could lock everything down i got to watch my home burn down through the back window of the van even after we were several blocks away i could see the smoke rising up in a black column i wondered how much of that smoke was made of my books my secondhand guitar my clothes my comfy old furniture my bed my blankets my mickey mouse alarm clock the equipment in my lab that id worked so hard to attain or createthe efforts of years of patient effort endless hours of concentration and spellcraft gone fire is as destructive spiritually as it is materially a purifying force that can devour and scatter magical energy in a fire that large everything id ever built including purely magical constructs would be destroyed dammit dammit but i hated vampires id had one hell of a day all in all but practically the only thing i had left to me was my pride i didnt want anyone to see me crying so i just kept quiet in the back of the van while mouse lay very close to me at some point sorrow became sleep i woke up in the utility room at st mary of the angels where father forthill kept several spare folding cots and the bedding to go with them id visited several times in the past st marys was a surprisingly stout bastion against supernatural villains of nearly any stripe the ground beneath it was consecrated as was every wall door floor and window blessed by prayers and stately rituals masses and communions over and over through the decades until that gentle positive energy had permeated the ground and the very stone from which the church was built i felt safer but only a little vampires might not be able to set foot on the holy ground but they knew that and someone like the eebs would certainly take that into account hired human killers could be just as dangerous as vampires if not more so and the protective aura around the building couldnt make them blink an eye and i supposed they could always just set it on fire and burn it down around me if they really really wanted to get me i tried to imagine myself a century from now still dodging vampires and getting my home burned to the ground on an irregular basis no way in hell was i gonna accept that id have to deal with the eeb problem and then i remembered my legs i reached a hand down to touch my thigh i felt nothing absolutely nothing it felt like touching the limb of someone else entirely i tried to move my legs and nothing happened maybe id been too ambitious i pulled at my blanket until i could see my toes i tried wiggling them i failed i could feel the backboard beneath me and the band around my head that kept me from moving it to look around i gave up on my legs with a sharp surge of frustration and lifted my eyes to the ceiling there was a piece of paper taped to it directly over my head mollys handwriting in black marker was scrawled in large letters across it harry dont try to get up or move your neck or back were checking in on you several times an hour someone will be there soon there was a candle burning nearby on a folding table it was the rooms only light i couldnt tell how long it had been burning but it looked like a fairly longlived candle and it was nearly gone i breathed in and out steadily through my nose and caught some halfremembered scents perfume of some kind maybe or maybe just the scent of new leather still barely tinged with the harsh aroma of tanning compounds and the gummy scent of dye plus i could smell the dusty old room the church had only recently begun to use its heating system for the winter i could smell the warm scent of singed dust that always emerges from the vents the first time anyone turns on a heater after its been unneeded for a while i was glad that i wasnt cold i wouldnt have been able to do anything about it otherwise the candle guttered out and left me alone in the dark in my memories a bloody old caricature of a man his skin more liver spots than not leered at me in mad satisfaction and whispered die alone i shivered and shook the image away cassius was thoroughly dead i knew that an outcast member of the society of demented freaks known as the knights of the blackened denarius cassius had thrown in with an insane necromancer in order to get a chance to even a score with me hed come within a hairbreadth of dissecting me i was able to take him down in the endand hed uttered a death curse as he croaked such a curse a spell uttered in the last instants of life could have hideous effects upon its victim his curse for me to die alone was pretty vague as such things went it might not even have had enough power or focus to take sure maybe it hadnt hello i said to the darkness is anyone there there wasnt die alone stop that i snapped out loud control yourself dresden that sounded like good advice so i started taking deep steady controlled breaths and tried to focus my thoughts focus forethought reason sound judgment that was what was going to get me through this fact one my daughter was still in danger fact two i was hurt maybe badly maybe forever even the efficient resilience of a wizards body had its limits and a broken spine was quite likely beyond them fact three susan and martin could not get the girl out on their own fact four there wasnt a lot of help forthcoming maybe with sanya along the suicidal mission could be considered only mostly suicidal after all the knights of the cross were a big deal three of them were apparently enough knights to protect the whole world for the past few years the darkskinned russian had been covering all three positions and apparently doing it well which made a vague amount of sense i supposesanya was the wielder of esperacchius the sword of hope we needed hope right now at least i did fact five i had missed the rendezvous with ebenezar many hours ago id never intended to go and there was nothing i could do about the fact that he was going to be upsetbut my absence had probably cost me the support of the grey council such as it was fact six sanya susan martin and whatever other scanty help i could drum up couldnt get to chichén itzá without meand i sure as hell couldnt get there in the shape i was in according to the stored memories in my mothers jewel the way required a swim fact seven i was going to show up for my daughter and to hell with what it would cost and there were only so many options open to me i took the least terrifying one i closed my eyes steadied my breathing and began to picture a room in my mind my nowruined improved summoning circle was in the floor candles were lit at five equidistant points around it the air smelled of sandalwood incense and burned wax it took a few minutes to picture it all in perfect detail and to hold it in my mind as rock solid to my imagination as the actual room the construct was replacing that took considerable energy and discipline magic doesnt require props to function thats a conceit that has been widely propitiated by the wizarding community over the centuries it helped prove to frightened villagers inquisitions and whoever else might be worried that a person was clearly not a wizard otherwise hed have all kinds of wizardly implements necessary to his craft magic doesnt require the props but magic is wrought by people and people need them each prop has a symbolic as well as a practical reason for being a part of any spell simple stuff lighting candles and the like could be accomplished neatly in the mind eventually becoming a task as easy and thoughtless as tying ones shoe once you got into the complicated stuff though you had an enormous number of things to keep track of in your mind envisioning flows of energy their manipulation and so on if you have the real props they serve as a sort of mnemonic device you attach a certain image to the prop in your head and every time you see or touch that prop the image is packaged along with it simple except that i didnt have any props i was winging the whole thing pure imagination pure concentration pure arrogance really but i was at a lower rock bottom than normal in my thoughts i lit the candles walking slowly around the circle in a clockwise fashionor deosil as the fairy tales celtic songs and certain strains of wicca refer to itgradually powering up the energy it required to operate i realized that i had forgotten to make the floor out of anything specific in my head and the notional floor space from horizon to horizon suddenly became the linoleum from my first ratty chicago apartment hideous stuff green lines on a grey background but simple to envision i imagined performing the spell without ever moving my body envisioned every last detail everything from the way the floor dug unpleasantly into my knees as i began to the slight clumsiness in the fingers of my left hand which always seemed to be a little twitchy whenever i got nervous i closed the circle i gathered the power and then when all was prepared when i held absolutely everything in my imagination so vividly that it seemed more real than the room around me i slid power into my voice and called quietly uriel come forth for a second i couldnt tell whether the soft white light had appeared only in my head or if it was actually in the room then i realized that it stabbed at my eyes painfully it was real i kept the spell going in my head easier now that it was a tableau i just had to keep my concentration focused i squinted into the light and saw a tall young man there he wore jeans and a tshirt and a farmers duck coat his blond hair fell over his eyes but they were blue and bright and guileless as he looked around the room he stuck his hands into his coat pockets and nodded slowly i was wondering when id get this call you know whats happening then i asked yes yes he answered with perhaps the slightest bit of impatience in his tone he turned his gaze to me and frowned abruptly he leaned forward slightly peering at me i carefully fortified and maintained the image of the restraining magical circle in my imagination when an entity was called forth the circle was the only thing protecting the caller from its wrath please dresden the archangel uriel said its a very nice circle but you cant honestly think that its any kind of obstacle to me i like to play it safe i said uriel let out a most unangelic snort then he nodded his head and said ah i see see what he paused and said why you called me of course your back i grunted it was more effort than usual how bad is it broken he said its possible that as a wizard your body might be able to knit the ends back together over forty or fifty years but theres no way to be sure i need it to be better i said now then perhaps you shouldnt have climbed that ladder in your condition i let out a snarl and tried to turn toward him i just sort of flopped a little my body never left the surface of the backboard dont uriel said calmly it isnt worth getting upset over not upset i demanded my little girl is going to die you made your choices uriel told me one of them led you here he spread his hands thats a fair ball son nothing to do now but play it out but you could fix me if you wanted to my wishes have nothing to do with it he said calmly i could heal you if i were meant to do so free will must take precedence if it is to have meaning youre talking philosophy i said im telling you that a child is going to die uriels expression darkened for a moment and i am telling you that i am very limited in terms of what i can do to help you he said limited in fact to what i have already done yeah i said soulfire just about killed myself with that one thanks no one is making you use it dresden its your choice i played ball with you when you needed help i said and this is how you repay me uriel rolled his eyes you tried to send me a bill you want to set a price feel free i said ill pay it whatever it takes the archangel watched me his eyes calm and knowing and sad i know you will he said quietly dammit i said my voice breaking tears started from my eyes the colors and lines in my imagination began to blur please uriel seemed to shiver at the sound of the word he turned his face from me clearly uncomfortable he was silent please i said again you know who i am you know id rather have my nails torn out than beg and i am begging you i am not strong enough to do this on my own uriel listened never quite looking at me and then shook his head slowly i have already done what i can but youve done nothing i said from your point of view i suppose thats true he stroked his chin with a thumb frowning in thought though i suppose it isnt too much of an imbalance for you to know my eyes were starting to cramp from looking to one side so fiercely without being able to move my head i bit my lip and waited uriel took a deep breath and looked as if he were considering his words with care your daughter maggie is alive and well for now my heart skipped a beat my daughter hed called her my daughter i know you wanted susan to be the woman you loved and remembered wanted to be able to trust her but even if you werent admitting it to yourself you had to wonder on some level i dont blame you for it he said especially after those tracking spells failed its natural but yes he met my eyes flesh of your flesh and bone of your bone your daughter why tell me that i asked him because i have done all that i can he said from here it is up to you you are maggies only hope he started to turn away then paused and said consider vadderungs words carefully i blinked you know od vadderung of course were in similar fields of work after all i exhaled wearily and stopped even trying to hold the spell i dont understand uriel nodded thats the difficult part of being mortal of having choice much is hidden from you he sighed love your child dresden everything else flows from there a wise man said that uriel said whatever you do do it for love if you keep to that your path will never wander so far from the light that you can never return and as quickly as that he was gone i lay in the darkness shivering with weariness and the effort of the magic i pictured maggie in my head in her littlegirl dress with ribbons in her hair like the picture for you little girl dads coming it took me less than half a minute to restore the spell and not much longer than that to build up the next wave of energy i would need until the last second i wondered if i could actually go through with it then i saw a horrible image of maggie in her dress being snatched up by a red court vampire and my whole outraged being seemed to fuse into a singularity a single whitehot pinpoint of raw unshakable will mab i called my voice steady mab queen of air and darkness queen of the winter court mab i bid you come forth chapter the third repetition of her name hung ringing in the air and deafening silence came after as i awaited the response when you trap something dangerous there are certain fundamental precautions necessary to success youve got to have good bait something to draw your target in youve got to have a good trap something that works and works fast and once the target is in the trap youve got to have a net or a cage strong enough to hold it get any of those three elements wrong and you probably wont succeed get two of them wrong and you might be looking at a result far more disastrous than mere failure i went into this one knowing damned well that all i had was bait mab for her own reasons had wanted to suborn me into her service for years i knew that calling her by her name and title would be enough to attract her interest though the mechanism of my improved summoning circle would have been a fine trapif it still existed i meanthe cage of my will had always been the weakest point in any such endeavor bottom line i could get the tiger to show up once it was there all i had was a really good chalk drawing of a pit on the sidewalk and nice kitty i wasnt going into it blind and ignorant though i was desperate but not stupid i figured i had the advantage of position mab couldnt kill a mortal she could only make him desperately wish he was dead instead of enduring her attentions i didnt have a lot to lose she couldnt make me any more useless to my daughter than i was already i waited in perfect darkness for the mistress of every wicked fairy in every dark tale humanity had ever whispered in the night to put in an appearance mab didnt disappoint me surprise me yes but she didnt disappoint stars began to appear in front of my eyes i figured that was probably a really bad thing for a moment but they didnt spin around in lazy dizzy motion like the kind of stars that mean your brain is smothering they instead burned steady and cold and pure above me five stars like jewels on the throat of lady night seconds later a cold wind touched my face and i became conscious of a hard smoothness beneath me i laid my hands carefully flat but i didnt feel the cot and the backboard under me instead my fingers touched only cold even stone a planar surface that seemed level beneath my entire body i wriggled my foot and confirmed that there was stone beneath it there too i stopped and realized that i could feel my foot i could move it my whole body was there and it was naked i wavered between yelping at the cold suddenly being visited upon my ass and yelling in joy that i could feel it at all i saw land to one side and scrambled to get off the cold slab beneath me crouching down and hanging on to the edge of the slab for balance this wasnt reality then this was a dream or a vision or something that was otherwise in between the mortal world and the spiritual realm that made sense my physical body was still back in st marys lying still and breathing deeply but my mind and my spirit were here wherever here was my eyes adjusted to the darkness and i saw gentle mist and fog hanging in the air boiling clouds let a flash of moonlight in and it played like a spotlight over the hilltop around me and upon the ancient table of stone beside me the moons touch made deeply carved runes all around the tables edge dance with flickers of illumination writing done in some language i did not know then i understood mab had created this place for our meeting it was known as the valley of the stone table it was a broad bowlshaped valley i knew though the mist hid most of it from me in its exact center stood a mound maybe fifty feet across and twelve feet high at its center atop the mound stood the massive slab of stone held up on four stumpy pillars other stones stood in a circle around it some tumbled down some broken only one remaining in stonehengelike lintel the stones all shed faint illumination in shades of blue and purple and deep deep green cold colors winter colors yeah it was after the equinox so that tracked the table was in winters domain it was an ancient conduit of power transferred in the most primitive atavistic fashion of allin hot blood there were grooves and whorls in the tables surface coated with ancient stains and it squatted on the hill patient and hungry and immovable like a snapping turtle waiting for warm vital creatures to wander too close the blood spilled upon this table would carry the power of its life with it and would flow into the well of power in the control of the winter queen a movement across the table from me drew my eye a shadow seemed to simply congeal from the mist forming itself into a slender feminine shape draped in a cloak and cowl glittering green candle flames flickered in what looked like two eyes within the cowls hood my throat went dry it took me two tries to rasp queen mab the form vanished a low feminine laugh drifted through the mist to my right i turned to face it a furious cat squall erupted from the air six inches behind me and i nearly jumped out of my skin i spun to find nothing there and the womans laugh echoed around the top of the misty mound this time more amused youre enjoying this arent you i said my heart pounding in my throat you told me so didnt you whispering voices hissed among the stones around me none of them intelligible i saw another flicker of mocking green eyes ththis is a limitedtime offer i said trying to make my voice sound steady its been forced by circumstance if you dont get off your royal ass and jump on it im walking i warned you said a calm voice behind me never let her bring you here my godchild i carefully kept myself from letting out a shriek it would have been unwizardly instead i took a deep breath and turned to find the leanansidhe standing a few feet away covered in a cloak the color of the last seconds of twilight the deep bluepurple fabric hiding her completely except for her pale face inside the hood her green cat eyes were wide and steady her expression solemn but im here i said quietly she nodded another shadow appeared beside her green eyes burning queen mab i presumed and noted that she was actually a couple of inches shorter than my godmother of course especially in a place like this mab could be as gargantuan or lilliputian as she chose probablymab stepped closer still covered in shadows despite the fact that she was nearer to me than my godmother was her eyes grew brighter so many scars said my godmother and her voice had changed subtly growing cold and precise your scars are beautiful things within and without the shadowed figure stepped behind one of the fallen stones and emerged from behind another on the opposite side of the circle yes said the cold voice coming from the leanansidhes lips i can work with this i shivered because it was really cold and i was naked im sure i looked from the dark figure to my godmother and back and asked youre still using a translator for your sake said the cold voice as a shadowed figure stepped behind the next menhir and appeared atop another walking deosil clockwise mab was closing the circle around me whwhy for my sake i asked the cold voice laughed through the leanansidhes lips this conversation would quickly grow tedious if you kept falling to your knees screaming in agony and clawing at your bleeding ears my wizard yeah but why i asked why would your voice hurt me because she is angry answered the leanansidhe in her natural voice because her voice is a part of her power and her rage is too great to be contained i swallowed mab had spoken a few words to me a couple of years back and id reacted exactly as she described id lost a few minutes of time during the episode her words had provoked as well rage i asked about what the shadowed figure let out a spitting hiss another feline sound that made me flinch and cringe away from it as if from the lash of a whip my godmother jerked sharply to one side she straightened only slowly and as she did i saw that a long fine cut had been drawn across one of her cheeks blood welled up and dripped down slowly my godmother bowed her head to mab and the cold voice came from her mouth again it is not for my handmaiden to judge or question me nor to speak for me upon her own account lea bowed her head to mab again and not a flicker of either anger or chagrin showed in her features again mab moved from one stone to another without crossing the space in between it should have been getting easier to deal with due to repetition it wasnt each time she did it i realized that she could just as easily have reappeared behind me with foul intentions and there wouldnt be anything i could do about it there are ancient proprieties to be honored mabs voice said her tone measured and somehow formal there are words which must be said rites which must be observed speak your desire mortal man now i really was shivering with the cold i folded my arms and hunched in on myself it didnt help power i said the shadowed figure froze in place and turned to stare at me the burning green eyes tilted slightly as if mab had cocked her head to one side tell me why i fought to keep my teeth from chattering my body is badly injured but i must do battle with the red court this you have done many a time this time im fighting all of them i said the red king and his inner circle the fire of her eyes intensified tell me why i swallowed and said theyve taken my daughter the shadowed figure shuddered and her disembodied voice breathed a sigh of pleasure ahhh yes not for your own life but for your childs for love i nodded jerkily so many terrible things are done for love mabs voice said for love will men mutilate themselves and murder rivals for love will even a peaceful man go to war for love man will destroy himself and that right willingly she began walking in a physical circle now though her movements were so touched with unexpected motions and alien grace that it almost seemed that there must be something else beneath the shrouding cloak you know my price mortal speak it you want me to become the winter knight i whispered a laugh both merry and cold bubbled beneath her response yes i will i said with a condition speak it that before my service begins you restore my body to health that you grant me time enough to rescue my daughter and take her to safety and strength and knowledge enough to succeed and you give me your word that you will never command me to lift my hand against those i love the figure kept its eerie pace as she circled me again and the temperature seemed to drop several degrees you ask me to risk my knight in a place of dire peril to no gain for my land and people why should i do this i looked at her steadily for a moment then i shrugged if you dont want to do business ill go elsewhere i could still call lasciels coin to me in a heartbeatand nicodemus and the denarians would be more than happy to help me i am also one of the only people alive who knows how to pull off kemmlers darkhallow so if nicky and the nickelheads dont want to play i can damned well get the power for myselfand the next time i call your name i wont need to be nearly so polite mab let out a mirthless laugh through my godmothers lips you are spoiled for choices my wizard what reason have you to select me over the others i grimaced please dont take this as an insult but youre the least evil of my options the cold voice told me nothing about her reaction explain the denarians would have me growing a goatee and gloating malevolently within a few years if i didnt break and turn into some kind of murderous tardbeast first and id have to kill a lot of people outright if i wanted to use the darkhallow i swallowed but ill do it if i have no other way to get my child out of their hands ill do it silence reigned for an unbroken minute on the mound yes mused mabs voice you will wont you and yes you know that i do not kill indiscriminately nor encourage my knight to do so she paused and murmured but you have proven willing to destroy yourself in the past you won your last confrontation with my handmaiden in just such a fashion by partaking of the death angel what prevents you from taking a similar action to cheat me of my prize my word i said quietly i know i cant bluff you i wont suicide im here to deal in good faith mabs burning eyes stared at me for a long moment then she began to walk again more slowly on this her third traversing of the circle around me you must understand wizard once you are my knight once this last quest of yours is complete you are mine you will destroy what i wish you to destroy kill whatsoever i wish you to kill you will be mine blood bone and breath do you understand this i swallowed yes she nodded slowly then she turned to stare at the leanansidhe lea bowed her head again and snapped her fingers six cloaked figures appeared out of the mists small misshapen things that might have been kobolds or gnomes or any of a half dozen other servitor races of the sidhe i couldnt tell because the cloaks had rendered them faceless without identity but i knew the man they were carrying strapped to a plank like me he was naked he had been shorter than me but more athletic heavier on muscle but that had been years ago now he was a wasted shell of a human being a charcoal sketch that had been smudged by an uncaring hand his eyes were missing gone but neatly gone as if removed surgically there were tattoos covering his entire face particularly his sunken eyelids all of them simply a word in different languages and styles of lettering traitor his mouth was partly open and his teeth had been inscribed with whorls and celtic design then stained with something dark and brown turning his mouth into living scrimshaw his entire body in fact was adorned with either tattoos or artistic ritually applied scars he was held to the plank with seven lengths of slender silken cord but his emaciated limbs looked like they would never have the strength to overcome even those frail bonds he was weeping sobbing softly the sound of it more like an animal in horrible pain than anything human jesus i said and looked away from him i am somewhat proud of this mabs cold voice said to be sure the white christ never suffered so long or so terribly as did this traitor three days on a tree hardly enough time for a prelude when it came to visiting agony the romans were hobbyists the servitors slid the plank up onto the stone table positioning slate in its center then they bowed toward mab and retreated in measured silence for a moment the only sounds were those of a cold gentle wind and slates sobs for a time i was contented to torment him to the edge of sanity then i set out to see how far over the edge a mortal could go her eyes glittered merrily in the shadows a pity that so little was left and yet he is the winter knight young wizard the vessel of my power amidst mortals and consort to the queens of winter he betrayed me see where it has taken him the thing that used to be lloyd slate made quiet hopeless sounds i trembled afraid the dark shape came closer and a pale hand emerged from the folds of cloth something glittered coldly in the strange light and landed in the thick grass at my feet i bent to take it up and found an ancient ancient knife with a simple leafblade design set into a wooden handle and wrapped with cord and leather it was i thought made of bronze its double edge had a wickedly sharp shine to it and its needle point looked hungry somehow energy surged through the little blade power that was unfettered and wild that mocked limits and scoffed at restraint not evil as suchbut hungry and filled with the desire to partake in its portion of the cycle of life and death it thirsted for bloodshed while lloyd slate lives and breathes he is my knight said mabs voice take medeas bodkin wizard take his lifes blood i stood there holding the knife and looking at lloyd slate the last time id heard him speak he had begged me to kill him i didnt think hed be capable of even that much now if you would be my knight then this is the first death i desire of you mab said her voice almost gentle she faced me across the stone table send his power back to me and i will render it unto thee i stood in the cold wind not moving what i did with the next moments would determine the course of the rest of my life you know this man mab continued her voice still gentle you saw his victims he was a murderer a rapist a thief a monster in mortal flesh he has more than earned his death that isnt for me to judge i whispered quietly indeed not i was tempted to hide behind that rationale just for a momentjust until it was done lie to myself tell myself that i was his lawful rightful executioner but i wasnt i could have told myself that i was ending his pain that i was putting him out of his hideous misery in an act of compassion necessarily an act of bloodshed but it would be quick and clean nothing should suffer as much as lloyd slate had i could have sold myself that story but i didnt i was a man seeking power for good reasons maybe but i wasnt going to lie to myself or anyone else about my actions if i killed him i would be taking a life something that was not mine to take i would be committing deliberate calculated murder it was the least evil path i told myself whatever else i might have done would have turned me into a monster in truth because of lloyd slate i knew that whatever mab might say she did not control her knight completely slate had defied her power and influence and look where it got him a little voice whispered inside my head the full round moon emerged from behind the clouds and bathed the whole valley of the stone table in clear cold light the runes upon the table and the menhirs blazed into glittering cold light wizard whispered mabs appropriated voice seemingly directly into my ear the time has come my heart began pounding very hard and i felt sick to my stomach harry blackstone copperfield dresden mabs voice said almost lovingly choose chapter i stared at the broken man it was easy enough to envision my own mutilated face looking blindly up from the tables surface i took one step toward the table then two then i was standing over lloyd slates broken form if it was a fight i wouldnt think twice but this man was no threat to me he was no threat to anyone anymore i had no right to take his life and it was pure overwhelming nihilistic arrogance to say otherwise if i killed slate how long would it take for my turn to come i could be looking at myself months or years from now i couldnt any more than i could cut my own throat i felt my hand drop back to my side the knife too heavy to hold before me mab suddenly stood at the opposite end of the stone table facing me her right hand moved in a simple outward motion and the mists over the table suddenly thickened and swirled with color and light for a few seconds the image was hazy then it snapped into focus a little girl crouched in the corner of a bare stone room there was hay scattered around and a wool blanket that looked none too clean she had dark hair that had been up in pigtails but wasnt anymore one of the little pink plastic clips had evidently been lost or stolen and now she had only one pigtail her face was red from crying shed evidently been wiping her nose on the knees of her little pink overalls her shirt white with yellow flowers and a big cartoon bumblebee on it showed stains of dirt and worse she crouched in the tiniest ball she could make of her body as if hoping that if something should come for her she might be overlooked her big brown eyes were quietly terrifiedand i could see something familiar in them it took me a moment to realize they reminded me of my reflection in a mirror other features showed themselves to me muted shapes that maturity would bring forth eventually the same chin and jawline thomas and i shared the same mouth as her mothers susans straight shining black hair her hands and her feet looked a little too large for her like a puppys paws dimly as if from a great distance i heard the cry of a red court vampire in its true form and she flinched and started crying again her entire body trembling in terror maggie i remembered when bianca and her minions had kept me prisoner i remembered the things they had done to me but it didnt look like they had harmed my childyet yes said mabs cold voice empty of emotion the image began to slowly fade away it is a true seeing of your child as she is even now i give you my word no tricks no deceptions this is i looked through the translucent image to where mab and my godmother waited leas face was somber mabs eyes were narrowed to glowing green slits within her hooded cloak i faced them both for a moment the cold wind gusted over the hilltop and stirred the cloaks of the two sidhe i stared at them at ancient eyes full of the knowledge of dark and wicked things i knew that neither the child in the image nor the man on the table meant anything to them i knew that if i went forward with mabs bargain i would probably end up on the table myself of course that was why mab had shown me maggie to manipulate me no there was a distinction in what she had done she had shown me maggie to make perfectly clear exactly what choice i was about to make certainly it might influence my decision but when a stark naked truth stares you in the face shouldnt it im not sure its possible to manipulate someone with candor and truth i think you call that enlightenment and as i stared at my daughters fading image my fear vanished if i wound up like slate if that was the price i had to pay to make my daughter safe so be it if i was haunted for the rest of my life because maggie needed me to make hard choices so be it and if i had to die a horrible lingering death so that my little girl could have a chance to live so be it i tightened my grip on the hideous weight of the ancient bronze knife i put one hand gently on lloyd slates forehead to hold him still and then i cut his throat it was a quick clean death which made it no less lethal than if id hacked him up with an ax death is the great equalizer it doesnt matter how you get there just when and why he never struggled just let out a breath that sounded like a sigh of relief and turned his head to one side as if going to sleep it wasnt neat but it wasnt a scene from a gorefest slasher movie either it looked more like the kind of mess youd see in a kitchen when preparing a big bunch of steaks most of his blood ran into the carved indentions on the table and seemed to become quicksilver once there running rapidly outward through the troughs and down the lettering carved in the sides and the legs the blood made the letters reflect the eerie light around us giving them a sort of flickering fire of their own it was a terrible beautiful sight power hummed through that blood the letters the stone and the air around me were shaken by its silent potency i sensed the two sidhe behind me watching with calm predatory eyes as the knight who had betrayed his queens died i knew when it was over the two of them let out small sighs of appreciation i suppose i couldnt think of any other phrase that fit they recognized the significance of his death while in no way actually feeling any empathy for him a life flowed from his broken body into the stone table and they held the act in a respect akin to reverence i just stood there blood dripping from the bronze knife in my hand onto the earth beneath my feet i shivered in the cold and stared at the remains of the man id murdered wondering what i was supposed to feel sadness not really hed been a son of a bitch of the first order and id gladly have killed him in a straightup fight if i had the chance remorse none yet i had done him a favor when i killed him there was no getting him out of what hed gotten himself into joy no none of that either satisfaction precious little except that it was over the deed done the dice finally cast mostly i just felt cold a minute or an hour later the leanansidhe lifted a hand and snapped her fingers the cloaked servitors appeared from the mist as silently as theyd left and gathered up what was left of lloyd slate they lifted him in silence carried him in silence and vanished into the mist there i said quietly to mab my part is done time for you to live up to yours no child said mabs voice through leas lips your part is only begun but fear not i am mab the stars will rain from the sky before mab fulfills not her word she tilted her head slightly to one side toward my godmother and said i give thee this adviser for thy final quest sir knight my handmaiden is among the most powerful beings in all of my winter second only to myself leas warmer more languid voice came from her lips as she asked my queen to what degree am i permitted to act i thought i saw the fell light gleam on mabs teeth as leas lips said you may indulge yourself leas mouth spread into a wide dangerous smile of its own and she bowed her head and upper body toward the queen of winter and now my knight mabs voice said as her body turned to face me exclusively we will see to the strength of your broken body and i will make you mine i swallowed hard mab lifted a hand a dismissive gesture and the leanansidhe bowed to her i am no longer needed here child lea murmured i will be ready to go with thee whenever thou dost call my throat was almost too dry to get any words out ill want the things i left with you as soon as you can get them to me of course she said she bowed to me as well and took several steps back into the mist until it swallowed her whole and i was alone with queen mab so i said into the silence i guess theres theres a ceremony of some kind to go through mab stepped closer to me she wasnt an enormous imposing figure she was considerably shorter than me slender but she walked with such perfect confidence that the role of predator and prey was clear to both of us i edged back from her it was pure instinct and i could no more stop from doing it than i could have stopped shivering against the cold going to be hard for us to exchange oaths if you cant talk huh i said my voice sounded thin and shaky even to me um maybe its paperwork or something pale hands slipped up from the dark cloak and drew her hood back she shook her head left and right and pale silken tresses whiter than moonlight or lloyd slates dead flesh spilled forth my voice stopped working for a second my bare thighs hit the stone table behind me and i wound up sitting on it mab kept pacing toward me one slightly swaying step at a time the cloak slid from her shoulders down down down yyou uh i said looking away you mmust be cold a throaty little laugh bubbled up out of her frozenberry lips mabs voice touched with anger could cause physical damage to living flesh her voice filled with simmering desire did other things and the cold was suddenly the least of my concerns her mouth closed on mine and i gave up even trying to speak this wasnt a ceremony so much as a rite and one as ancient as beasts and birds earth and sky my memory gets shaky after the kiss i remember her body gleaming brightly above me cold soft feminine perfection i dont have the words to describe it inhuman beauty elfin grace animal sensuality and when her body was atop mine our breaths mingled cold sweetness with human imperfection i could feel the rhythm of her form her breath her heart i could feel the stone of the table the ancient hill of the mound the very earth of the valley around us pulsing in time to mabs rhythm clouds raced over the sky and as she moved more quickly she grew brighter and brighter until i realized that the eerie luminescence around us all evening had been nothing but a dim muffled reflection of mabs loveliness veiled for the sake of the mortal mind it could have unmade she did not veil it as her breathing mounted and it burned me it was so pure what we did wasnt sex regardless of what it appeared to be you cant have sex with a thunderstorm an earthquake a furious winter gale you cant make love to a mountain a lake of ice a freezing wind for a few moments i saw the breadth and depth of mabs powerand for a fleeting instant the barest tiniest glimpse of her purpose as well as our entwined bodies thrashed toward completion i was screaming i had been for a while then mabs cry joined mine our voices blending together her nails dug into my chest chips of ice sliding beneath my skin i saw her body drawn into an arch of pleasure and then her green cat eyes opened and bored into her mouth opened and her voice hissed mine absolute truth made my body vibrate like the plucked string of a guitar and i jerked into a brief violent contortion mabs hands slid down my ribs and i could suddenly feel the fire of the cracked bones again until those icy hands tightened as again she said mine again my body bowed into a violent bow every muscle trying to tear its way off of my bones mab hissed in eagerness as her hands slid around my waist covering the numb spot where my spine had probably been broken i felt myself screaming and struggling with no control whatsoever over my body mabs feline eyes captured my own gaze trapping my attention within their frozen beauty as again a jolt of terrible sweet cold flowed out from her fingertips and she whispered her voice a velvet caress mine again screamed a voice i vaguely recognized something cold and metallic pressed to my chest clear shouted the voice a lightning bolt hit my chest an agonizing ribbon of silver power that bent my body into a bow i started screaming and before my hips had come down i shouted hexus spewing out power into the air someone shouted and someone else cursed and sparks exploded all around me including from the lightbulb above which seemed to overload and shatter into powder the room was dark and quiet for a few seconds ddid we lose him asked a steady elderly mans voice forthill oh god said mollys quavering voice hharry im fine i said my throat felt raw what the hell are you doing to me yyour heart stopped said a third voice the familiar one i felt my chest and found nothing there or around my neck my fingers quested out and touched the bed and the backboard beneath me and found my necklace there the ruby still fixed in place by an ugly glob of rubber i gripped the chain and slipped a little of my will into it and cold blue light filled the room so i did what any good mortician would butters continued hit you with a bolt of lightning and tried to reanimate you he held up two shock paddles whose wires had evidently been melted right off them they werent attached to anything now he was a wiry little guy in hospital scrubs with a shock of black hair narrow shoulders and a thin restless body he held up his hands and mimed employing the shock paddles then he said in a goofy voice that was probably meant to sound hollow its alive alliiiiiivve after a beat he added youre welcome butters i sighed who called you into i stopped and said molly never mind harry she said we couldnt be sure how badly you were hurt and if you couldnt feel you couldnt know either and i thought we needed a real doctor but the only one i knew you trusted was butters so i got him instead hey butters said i pushed the straps off of my head and kicked irritably at the straps on my legs whoa there tiger butters said the little medical examiner threw himself across my legs hold your horses big guy easy easy forthill and molly meant well they joined in and the three of them flattened me to the backboard again i snarled out a curse and then went limp i sat there not resisting for a moment until i thought theyd be listening then i said we dont have time for this get these straps off of me dresden you might have a broken back butters said a pinched nerve broken bones damage to the organs in your lower abdomenfor gods sake man what were you thinking not going to a hospital i was thinking that i didnt want to make an easy target of myself i said im fine im better good lord man sputtered forthill be reasonable your heart wasnt beating three minutes ago molly i said my voice hard unfasten the straps do it now i heard her sniffle but then she sat up and came up to where she could see my eyes um harry are you still you know you i blinked at her for a second impressed the grasshoppers insight was evidently serving her well im me i said looking back at her eyes that should be verification enough if someone else had come back behind the wheel of my car so much change to my insides and a look like that would certainly trigger a soulgaze and reveal what had happened for now at least molly bit her lip then she said okay okay let him up butters sat up from my legs and then stood scowling wait a minute this is just this is all moving a little too fast for me the door behind him opened and a heavyset man in street clothes lifted a gun and put two rounds into butterss back from three feet away the sheer sound of the shots was incredible deafening butters dropped like a slaughtered cow the gunmans eyes were tracking toward the rest of us before butters hit the floor i knew who he was looking for when his eyes swept over me and locked on he didnt talk didnt bluster didnt hesitate a professional there were plenty of them in chicago he raised the gun to aim at my headwhile i lay there strapped to a board from the hips down and unable to move and as i lifted my left wrist i noted that my shield bracelet was gone of course they must have removed it so that the defibrillators charge wouldnt have gotten any ideas just as theyd taken the metal necklace from around my throat and the rings from my fingers they were being helpful clearly this was just not my day chapter i was tied down but my hands werent i flexed the fingers of my right hand into the mystic position of attackholding them like a pretend gunand snapped arctis the spell tore the heat from all around the gun and drew water from the air into an instant thick coating of ice heaviest around the weapons hammer the shooter twitched in reaction to the spell and pulled the trigger the encrusting ice held the hammer back and prevented it from falling the gunman blinked and tried to pull the trigger several more times to no avail forthill hit him around the knees both men went down and the gun came loose from the gunmans coldnumbed fingers as they hit the floor and went spinning across the room it struck a wall cracked the ice around its hammer and discharged harmlessly into the wall with another roar the gunman kicked forthill in the face and the old priest fell back with a grunt of pain molly threw herself at him in pure rage knocking him flat again and began pounding her fists into him with elemental brutality and no technique whatsoever the gunman threw an elbow that got her in the neck and knocked her back then rose his eyes searching the floor until he spotted his weapon he started for it i killed the light from the amulet he tripped and fell in the sudden darkness i heard him scuffling with the dazed forthill then there was a single bright flash of light that showed me the gunman arching up in pain then it was gone and there was the sound of something large falling to the floor several people were breathing heavily i got my fingers onto my amulet again and brought forth light into the room forthill sat against one wall holding his jaw looking pale molly was in a crouch one hand lifted as if shed been about to do something with her magical talents the way she should have at the first sound of the shots if shed been thinking clearly the gunman lay on his side and began to stir again butters wheezed clear and touched both ends of the naked wires in his hands to the gunmans chest the wires ran back to the emergency defib unit when theyd been melted off the paddles it had left several strands of pure copper naked on the ends of both of them the current did what current does and the gunman bucked in agony for a second and sagged into immobility again jerk butters wheezed he put a hand on the small of his back and said ow ow ow ow ow butters molly croaked and hugged him urgckh butters said ow but he didnt look displeased at the hug grasshopper dont strain him until we know how bad it is i said dammit i started fumbling with the straps getting them clear of my upper body so i could sit up and work on my legs forthill are you all right father forthill said something unintelligible and let out a groan of pain then he heaved himself to his feet and started helping me with the buckles his jaw was purple and swollen on one side hed taken one hell of a hit and stayed conscious tough old guy even though he looked so mild i got off the backboard onto my feet and picked up the gun im all right butters said i think his eyes went wide and he suddenly seemed to panic oh god make sure im all right he started clawing at his shirt that maniac freaking shot me he got the scrubs top off and turned around to show molly his back he was wearing an undershirt and on top of that he was wearing a kevlar vest it was a light underclothing garment suitable only for protection against handgunsbut the gunman had walked in with a nine millimeter hed put both shots onto the centerline of butterss lower back and the vest had done its job the rounds were still there flattened and stuck in the ballistic weave im hit arent i butters stuttered im in shock i cant feel it because im in shock right was it in the liver is the blood black call emergency services butters i said look at me he did his eyes wide polka i said will never die he blinked at me then he nodded and started forcing himself to take slower deeper breaths im all right the magic underwear worked i said youre fine then why does my back hurt so much somebody just hit it twice with a hammer moving about twelve hundred feet per second i said oh he said he turned to look at molly who nodded at him and gave him an encouraging smile then he shuddered and closed his eyes in relief i dont think im temperamentally suited for the action thing yeah since when are you the guy in the bulletproof vest i asked him butters nodded at molly i put it on about ten seconds after she called me and said you needed help he said he fumbled a small case from his pocket and opened it see i got chalk and holy water and garlic too i smiled at him but felt a little bit sick the gunman had put butters down for the simple reason that he had been blocking the shooters line of sight to the room if hed been trying for butters the two shots to clear his sight line would have included a third shot to the back of butterss head of course if butters hadnt been in the way my head wouldnt have fared any better than his were all so damned fragile footsteps sounded outside the door and i raised the gun to cover it taking a grip with both hands my feet centered i was lining up the little green targeting dots when sanya came through the door carrying a platter of sandwiches he stopped abruptly and lifted both eyebrows then beamed broadly dresden you are all right he looked around the room for a moment frowning and said did i miss something who is that i dont think theres anything broken butters told forthill but youd better get an xray just to be sure mandibular fracture isnt anything to play around with the old priest nodded from his chair in the living quarters of the churchs residents and wrote something down on a little pad of paper he showed it to butters the little guy grinned youre welcome father molly frowned and asked should we take him to the emergency room forthill shook his head and wrote on his notepad things to tell you first now i had a pair of guns id swiped from bad guys the security guards caliber and the gunmans ninemillimeter i was inspecting them both on the coffee table familiarizing myself with their function and wondering if i should be planning to file off the serial numbers or something mouse sat next to me his flank against my leg and his serious brown eyes watching me handle the weapons you found out something i asked forthill in a way he wrote back there are major movements afoot throughout south and central america the red courts upper echelon uses human servitors to interface with mortals many of these individuals have been sighted at airports in the past three days all of them are bound for mexico does chichén itzá have any significance to you i grunted donar vadderungs information seemed to have been solid then yeah it does forthill nodded and continued writing there is a priest in that area he cannot help you with your fight but he says he can offer you and your people sanctuary care and secure transportation from the area when you are finished it seems like begging for trouble to plan for our victorious departure before we know if we can get there in the first place i said i can get us to the general area but not into the ruins themselves i need to know anything he can find out about the security the red court will be setting up in the area forthill frowned at me for a moment then he wrote ill ask him but ill need someone to talk for me i nodded molly youre with the padre get a little sleep as soon as you can might not get a chance to before we move out otherwise she frowned but nodded instead of trying to talk me out of it its nice how brushes with violent death can concentrate even the most stubbornly independent apprentices better judgment forthill held up a hand then he wrote first i need to know how it is that you are back on your feet dr butters said that you would be too injured to get out of bed magic i said calmly as if that should explain everything forthill eyed me for a moment then wrote i hurt too much to argue with you will make the calls thank you i said quietly he nodded and wrote god go with you thank you i repeated what about me butters asked there were equal measures of dread and excitement in his voice hopefully we wont need any more of your help i said might be nice if you were standing by though just in case right butters said nodding what else i clenched a hand and resisted the urge to tell him that he would be better off hiding under his bed he knew that already he was as frightened as a bunny in a forest full of bears but he wanted to help i think father forthill has a car yes father he started to write something then scratched it out and held out his hand in a simple thumbsup stay with them i said i slapped magazines into both guns confident that i knew them well enough to be sure theyd go bang when i pulled the trigger soon as forthill is done get him to an emergency room emergency room butters said check forthill frowned and wrote are you certain we shouldnt turn our attacker over to the police nothing in life is certain father i said rising i stuck a gun in either pocket of my duster but if the police get involved theyre going to ask a lot of questions and take a long time trying to sort everything out i cant spare that time you dont think this gunman will go to the authorities and tell them what i asked that he got kidnapped off the street by a priest from st marys that we beat him up and took his illegal weapon away i shook my head he doesnt want the cops involved any more than we do this was business to him hell make a deal to fess up to us if it means he gets to walk and we let a murderer go free its an imperfect world father i said on the other hand you dont hire professional killers to take out nice old ladies and puppy dogs most of the people this guy has an appointment with are underworld typesi guarantee itmostly those who are going to turn states evidence on their organization sooner or later one of them gets lucky and no more hit man live by the sword die by the sword forthill wrote exactly he shook his head and winced as the motion caused him discomfort it will be hard to help a man like that i snorted its a noble sentiment padre but a guy like him doesnt want any help doesnt see any need for it i shrugged some men just enjoy killing he frowned severely but didnt write down any response just then someone rapped on the door and sanya opened it and poked his head in dresden the knight said hes awake i rose and mouse rose with me cool maybe get started on those calls padre forthill gave me another thumbsup rather than nodding i walked out mouse stolid at my back and went to the utility closet with sanya to talk to our guest i suppose the blocky hit man lay on the backboard strapped down to it and further secured in a cocoon of duct tape stand him up i said sanya did so rather casually lifting the gunman backboard and all and leaning it back at a slight angle against the wall the gunman watched me with calm eyes i picked up a wallet from the little folding card table we had set up and opened it steven douglas i read from the license that you stevie d he said heard of you i said you did torelli a couple of years back he smiled very slightly i dont know any torelli yeah i figured i said how is he stevie d asked who the little guy fine i said wearing a vest stevie d nodded good i lifted an eyebrow professional killer is happy he didnt kill someone had nothing against him wasnt getting paid for him dont wanna do time for hitting the wrong guy isnt professional but everything i heard about you said i shouldnt dick around waiting to get the shot off so i had to get him out of the way stevie i said this can go a couple of different ways the simplest is that you give me who hired you and i let you go his eyes narrowed no cops i gestured at his bound form with one hand does it look like we want cops all over this spill and youre loose as fast as we can take the tape off he thought about it for a moment then he said nah no he made a motion that might have been a shrug did that for you i might never work again people get nervous when a contractor divulges personal information about their clients i gotta think longterm i nodded i can respect that honoring a bargain and all he snorted softly so we can go to option two im going to go call marcone im going to tell him what happened im going to ask him if hes interested in talking to you stevie im sure hell want to know who is purchasing hits in his territory too what impact will that have on your longterm productivity do you think stevies nerve cracked he licked his lips um he said whats option three sanya stepped forward he beamed at stevie d picked the backboard up off the floor without too much trouble and in his lowest voice and thickest russian accent said i pick up this board break in half and put both halves into incinerator stevie d looked like a man who suddenly realizes he is sitting near a hornets nest and is trying desperately not to run away screaming he licked his lips again and said half of what i hear about you says marcone wants you dead that you hate his guts the other half says you work for him sometimes kill the people he thinks need killing i wouldnt pay much attention to rumors if i were you stevie i said which is it he asked find out i said dont tell me anything sanya put him back down again i stood facing him expectantly okay he said finally a broad woman huh who no name paid cash describe her stevie nodded fivenine long legs brown eyes he said some muscle on her weighed maybe one fifty long dark hair had these tattoos on her face and neck my heart just about stopped in my chest i closed down every doorway and window in my head to shut out the gale that was suddenly whipping up in my heart i had to stay focused i couldnt afford to let the sudden tide of emotion drown my ability to think clearly i reached into my pocket and drew out my own wallet id kept a picture of susan in there for so long that when i pulled it out some of the images colors stuck to the plastic sleeve i showed him the picture the hit man squinted and nodded yeah he said thats her chapter give me the details i said quietly she said youd be here gave me twenty thousand up front twenty more held in escrow until delivery was confirmed mouse made a soft uncomfortable noise that never quite became a whine he sat watching my face intently when i asked last night i stared at him for a moment then i tossed stevies wallet back onto the folding card table and said cut him loose walk him to the door sanya let out what seemed like a disappointed sigh then he produced a knife and began cutting stevie free i walked down the hall back toward the living area with my head bowed thinking furiously susan had hired a gunman to kill me why i stopped walking and leaned against a wall why would she hire someone to kill me or hell more to the pointwhy would she hire a gunman to kill me why not someone who stood a greater chance of success granted a gunman could kill even a wizard if he were taken by surprise but pistols had to be fired at dangerously short ranges to be reliable and stevie d had a reputation as a brazen sidearm specialist it meant that the wizard would have more time to see something bad coming as opposed to being warned only when a highpowered rifle round hit his chest and would have an easier time responding with hasty defensive magic it was hardly an ideal approach if susan wanted me dead she wouldnt really need to contract it out a pretext to get me alone and another one to put us very close to each other would just about do it and id never see that one coming something about this just wasnt right id have called stevie a liar but i didnt think he was one i was sure he believed what he was saying so either stevie was lying and i was just too dim to pick up on it or he was telling the truth if he was lying given what kind of hot water i could get him into he was also an idiot i didnt think he was one of those if he was telling the truth it meant it meant that either susan really had hired someone to kill me or else someone who could look like susan had done business with stevie d if susan had hired someone to kill me why this guy in particular why hire someone who didnt have better than even chances of pulling it off that was more the kind of thing esteban and esmerelda would come up with that worked a lot better esmereldas blue and green eyes could have made stevie remember being hired by mister snuffleupagus if that was what she wanted but how would she have known where to find me had they somehow managed to tail sanya back to the church from my apartment without being noticed by mouse and just where the hell were susan and martin theyd had more than enough time to get here so why werent they someone was running a game on me if i didnt start getting some answers to these questions i had a bad feeling that it was going to turn around and bite me on the ass at the worst moment imaginable right then i guessed that meant it was time to go get some answers paranoia is a survival trait when you run in my circles it gives you something to do in your spare time coming up with solutions to ridiculous problems that arent ever going to happen except when one of them does at which point you feel way too vindicated for instance i had spent more than a couple of off hours trying to figure out how i might track someone through chicago if i didnt have some kind of object or possession of theirs to use as a focus basic tracking magic is completely dependent upon having a sample of whoever it is you want to follow hair blood and nail clippings are the usual thing but lets say you dont have any of those and you still want to find someone if you have a sample of something in their possession a piece snipped from their clothing the tag just torn out of their underwear whatever you can get them that way too but lets say things are hectic and crazy and someone has just burned down your house and your lab and you still need to follow somebody thats when you need a good clear photograph and minions lots of minions preferably ones who dont demand exorbitant wages theres a pizza spress less than two blocks from st marys sanya and i went straight there i ordered i do not see how this helps us sanya said as i walked out from the little shop with four boxes of pizza youre used to solving all your problems the simple way i said kick down the door chop up everybody who looks fiendish save everyone who looks like they might need it yeah it is not always that simple sanya said rather stiffly and sometimes i use a gun which i applaud you for very progressive i said but the point is you do your work directly you pretty much know where youre going or get shown the way and after that its just up to you to take care of business da sanya said as we walked i suppose my work is sort of the same i said except that nobody ever points the way for me you need to know where to go sanya said yes and you are going to consult four large pizzas for guidance yes i said the big man frowned for a moment then he said there is i think humor here which does not translate well from english into sanity thats pretty rich coming from the agnostic knight of the cross with a holy sword who takes his orders from an archangel i said gabriel could be an alien being of some kind sanya said placidly it does not change the value of what i donot to me and not to those whom i protect whom i said with as much russian accent as i could fit into one word someones been practicing his english sanya somehow managed to look down his nose at me despite the fact that i was several inches taller i am only saying that i do not need the written code of a spiritual belief to act like a decent human being you are way kookier than me man i said turning into an alley and i talk to pizza i laid out the four pizza boxes on top of four adjacent trash cans and glanced around to be sure no one was nearby it was getting near to lunch break and it wasnt the best time for what i was about to do but it ought to work i turned to look up and down the alley as best i could drew a breath and then remembered something hey sanya stick your fingers in your ears the big russian stared at me what your fingers i said wiggling all of mine in your ears i pointed to mine i understand the words obviously as i am someone who has been practicing his english why because im going to say something to the pizza and i dont want you to hear it sanya gave the sky a single longsuffering glance then he sighed and put his fingers in his ears i gave him a thumbsup turned away cupped my hands around my mouth so that no one could lipread and began to murmur a name over and over again each utterance infused with my will i had to repeat the name only a dozen times or so before a shadow flickered overhead and something the size of a hunting falcon dropped out of the sky blurred wings humming and hovered about two feet in front of me bozhe moi sanya sputtered and esperacchius was halfway from its sheath by the time he finished speaking i couldnt stop myself from saying theres some real irony in your using that expression o knight of maybe go ahead piped a shrill voice like a shakespearean actor on helium draw your sword knave and we will see who bleeds to death from a thousand tiny cuts sanya stood there with his mouth open and his sword still partly in its sheath it is he shook his head as if someone had popped him in the nose it is a domovoi da the little faerie in question stood nearly fifteen full inches in height appearing as a slender athletic youth with the blurring wings of a dragonfly standing out from his shoulders and a tuft of hair like lavender dandelion fluff he was dressed in garments that looked like theyd been thugged from someones oldschool gi joe doll an olivedrab jumpsuit with the sleeves removed and holes cut through it for his wings he wore a number of weapons about his person most of them on nylon straps that looked like theyd been lifted from convention badges he was carrying one letter opener shaped like a long sword at his side and two more crossed over each other on his back id given him the letter opener set last christmas advising him to keep half of them stashed somewhere safe as backup weapons domovoi the little faerie shrilled furious oh no you didnt easy there major general i said sanya this is major general toottoot minimus the captain of my house guard toot this is my boon companion sanya knight of the cross who has faced danger at my side hes okay the faerie quivered with outrage hes russian and he doesnt even know the difference between a domovoi and a polevoi when he sees one two feet away toottoot let out a blistering string of words in russian shaking a finger at the towering knight sanya listened in bemusement at first but then blinked slid his sword away and held up both hands he said something that sounded somber and very formal and only then did toots ire seem to abate he said one or two more harshsounding words toward sanya added a flick of his chin that screamed so there and turned back to me toot i said how is it that you speak russian he blinked at me harry he said as if the question made no sense at all you just speak it dont you i mean come on he gave me a formal bow and said how may i serve you my liege i peered at him a bit more closely why is half your face painted blue because were winter now my liege toot said his eyes darted to the side and down several times and say that doesnt mean we have to eat the pizza cold does it of course not i said toot looked relieved oh good um what were we talking about i have a job for you i said and for everyone you can get to help i nodded at the pizza standard rates very good my liege toot said saluting his eyes slid down again maybe someone ought to check the pizza you know for poison and things it would look real bad if someone poisoned your vassals you know i eyed him askance then i held up a finger and said all right one piece and afterack toot hit the pizza box like a great white shark taking a seal he slammed into it one bright sword slashing the top off of the box then he seized the largest piece and began devouring with a will sanya and i both stood there fascinated it was like watching a man try to eat a pizza slice the size of a small car pieces flew up and were skewered on his blade sauce got everywhere and it gave me a gruesome little flashback to the stone table harry sanya asked are you all right will be soon i said this creature serves you sanya asked this one and about a hundred smaller ones and five times that many parttimers i can call in once in a while i thought about it it isnt so much that they serve me as that we have a business arrangement that we all like they help me out from time to time i furnish them with regular pizza which they love sanya said toot spun in a dizzy delighted circle on one heel and fell onto his back with perfectly unselfconscious enthusiasm his tummy sticking out as far as it could he lay there for a moment making happy gurgling sounds well i said yes sanyas eyes danced though his face was sober you are a drug dealer to tiny faeries shame i snorted what was that he said about winter sanya asked harrys the new winter knight toottoot burbled which is fantastic the old winter knight mostly just sat around getting tortured he never went on adventures or anything he paused and added unless you count going crazy i guess toot i said im kind of trying to keep the winter knight thing lowprofile okay toot said why i glanced from the little faerie to sanya look i uh its personal okay and because every creature in faerie got to see the ceremony toot said proudly mab made sure of it it was reflected in all the streams and ponds and lakes and puddles and every little drop of water i stared at the engorged faerie at something of a loss for words um i said oh how very very disturbing did it hurt when you kissed mab toot asked because i always thought her lips looked so cold that they would burn like streetlamps in winter toot sat up suddenly his eyes wide ooooooh did your tongue get stuck to her like on that christmastime show okayyyyy i said with forced cheer clapping my hands way way too personal um the job i have a job for you toottoot leapt up to his feet his stomach was already constricting back toward its normal size yes my liege where the hell did he put it all i mean it just wasnt possible for him to eat that much pizza and then i shook my head now wasnt the time i produced my picture of susan this human is somewhere in chicago i need your folk to find her shes probably accompanied by a human man with blond hair about the same size she is toot took to his wings again and zoomed down to the picture he picked it up and held it out at arms length studying it and nodded once may i have this my lord to show the others yeah i said be careful with it though i want it back yes my liege toot said he brandished his sword with a flourish sheathed it and zipped straight up into the october sky sanya stood looking steadily at me i coughed i waited so he said mab i grunted vaguely in reply you hit that sanya said i did not look at him my face felt red youhe scrunched up his nose digging in his memorytapped that ass presumably it was phat sanya he let out a low rolling laugh and shook his head i saw her once mab beautiful beyond words yeah i said and dangerous yes i said with emphasis and you are now her champion he said everybodys gotta be something right he nodded joking about it good you will need that sense of humor why do you say that because she is cold dresden she knows wicked secrets time himself has forgotten and if she chose you to be her knight she has a plan for you he nodded slowly laugh whenever you can keeps you from killing yourself when things are bad that and vodka that some kind of russian saying i asked have you seen traditional folk dances sanya asked imagine them being done by someone with a bottle of vodka in them laughter abounds and you survive another day he shrugged or break your neck either way it is pain management his voice sounded almost merry though the subject matter was grim as hell if not more so i had expected him to try to talk me out of it or at least to berate me for being an idiot he didnt do either there was a calm acceptance of terrible things that was part and parcel of sanyas personality no matter how bad things got i didnt think anything would ever truly faze him he simply accepted the bad things that happened and soldiered on as best he could there was probably a lesson for me in there somewhere i was quiet for a while before i decided to trust him i get to save my girl first i said that was the deal ah he said he seemed to mull it over and nodded that is reasonable you really think that he lifted both eyebrows the child is your blood is she not i nodded and said quietly she is he spread his hands as if it were a selfevident fact that needed no further exploration as horrible fates go that is a good one he said worthwhile save your little girl he clapped me on the shoulder if you turn into a hideous monster and i am sent to slay you i will remember this and make it as painless as i can out of respect for you i knew he was joking i just couldnt tell which part of it he was joking about uh i said thanks it is nothing he said we stood around quietly for another five minutes before he frowned looking at the other pizza boxes and asked is there some purpose for the rest of th a scene out of the birds descended upon the alley there was a rush of wingbeaten wind and hundreds of tiny figures flashed down onto the pizza here and there i would spot one of the pizza lords guard recognizable thanks to the orange plastic cases of the box knives they had strapped to their backs the others went by in twinkles and flashes of color muted by the daylight but beautiful all the same there were a lot of the little folk involved if id been doing this at night it might have induced a seizure or something the little folk love pizza they love it with a passion so intense that it beggars the imagination watching a pizza being devoured was sort of like watching a plane coming apart in midair on those old wwii gun camera reels bits would fleck off here and there and then suddenly in a rush bits would go flying everywhere each borne away by the individual fairy who had seized it it was over in less than three minutes seriously where do they put it toot came to hover before me and popped a little fistful of pizza into his mouth he gulped it down and saluted well major general i asked found her my liege toot reported she is a captive and in danger sanya and i traded a look where i asked him toot firmly held up the picture still in one piece and two strands of dark hair each curled into its own coil of rope in his tiny hands two hairs from her head my liege or if it is your pleasure i will guide you there sanya drew his head back a little impressed they found her that quickly people underestimate the hell out of the little folk i said calmly within their limits theyre as good as or better than anything else i know for getting informationand there are a lot of them around chicago who are willing to help me out occasionally hail the pizza lord toottoot shrilled hail the pizza lord answered a score of piping voices that came from no apparent source the little folk can be all but invisible when they want to be major general minimus keep this up and im making you a full general i said toot froze why is that bad what did i do its good toot thats higher than a major general his eyes widened theres higher oh yeah definitely and youre on the fast track for the very top i took the hairs from him and said well get the car lead us to her toot yes sir good sanya said grinning now we know where to go and have someone to rescue this part i know how to do chapter admittedly sanya said a few minutes later normally i do not storm headquarters buildings of the federal bureau of investigation and in broad daylight too we were parked down the block from the fbis chicago office where toot had guided us crouched on the dashboard and demanding to know why sanya hadnt rented one of the cars that could fly instead of the poky old landbound minivan he had instead toot hadnt taken the answer that cars like that are imaginary seriously either he had muttered a few things in russian that only made sanyas smile wider damn i said staring at the building toot was martin with her the yellowhair toot sat on the dashboard facing us waving his feet no my liege i grunted i dont like that either why wouldnt they have been taken together which floor is she on toot there toot said pointing i leaned over and hunkered down behind him so that i could look down the length of his little arm to the window he was pointing at fourth i said that was where tilly was talking to me sanya reached down to produce a semiautomatic hed hidden beneath the seat of the minivan and cycled a round into the chamber his eyes glued to the outside mirror company a bald slightly overweight bum in a shabby overcoat and castoff clothing shambled down the sidewalk with vacant eyesbut he was moving a little too purposefully toward us to be genuine i was watching his hands with my shield bracelet ready to go expecting him to pull a weapon out from beneath the big coat and it wasnt until he was a few steps away that i realized it was martin he stopped on the sidewalk next to the passenger window of the van and wobbled in place he rapped on the glass and held out his hand as if begging a handout i rolled down the window and asked him what happened the fbi did its legwork he said they tracked our rental car back to my cover id got my picture put it on tv one of the detectives we shook down confirmed my presence and told them id been seen at your place and they were waiting there when we came back to get you susan created a distraction so that i could get away and you left her behind huh he shrugged her identity is genuine and while they know she arrived with me and was seen with me they cant prove that shes done anything ive been operating long enough that the red court has seen to it that im on multiple international lists of wanted terrorists if i were caught both of us would have been taken i grunted what did you find out the last of the red kings inner circle arrived this morning theyll do the ceremony tonight he said midnight or a little after if our astronomers assessment is solid crap martin nodded how fast can you get us there i touched a fingertip to my mothers gem and doublechecked the way there this one doesnt have a direct route three hops a couple of walks one of them in bad terrain should take us ninety minutes gets us to within five miles of chichén itzá martin looked at me for a long moment then he said i cant help but find it somewhat convenient that you are suddenly able to provide that kind of fast transport to exactly the places we need to go the red court had their goodies stashed near a confluence of ley lines i said a point of ample magical power chichén itzá is at another such confluence only a lot bigger chicago is a crossroads both physically and metaphysically there are dozens of confluences either in the town or within twentyfive miles the routes i know through the nevernever mostly run from confluence to confluence so chicagos got a direct route to a lot of places sanya made an interested sound like the airports in dallas or atlanta or here travel nexuses exactly martin nodded though he didnt look like he particularly believed or disbelieved me that gives us a little more than nine hours he said the church is trying to get us information about local security at chichén itzá meet me at st mary of the angels i handed him the change scrounged from my pockets tell them harry dresden said you were no stevie d well leave from there you he shook his head a little you got the church to help you hell man i got a knight of the cross driving me around sanya snorted martin studied sanya with eyes that were a little wide i see a certain energy seemed to enter him as he nodded and i knew exactly what he was feelingthe positive upswing in his emotions an electricity that came with the sudden understanding that not only was death not certain but that victory might actually be possible hope is a force of nature dont let anyone tell you different martin nodded what about susan ill get her out i said martin ducked his head in another nod then he took a deep breath and said simply thank you he turned and shambled away drunkenly clutching his coins seems a decent fellow sanya said his nostrils flared a little halfvampire you say fellowship of st giles yeah like susan i watched martin vanish into chicagos lunchtime foot traffic and said im not sure i trust him i would say the feeling is mutual sanya said when a man lives a life like martins he learns not to trust anyone i grunted sourly stop being reasonable i enjoy disliking him sanya chuckled and said so what now i took the guns out of my duster pockets and stowed them beneath the minivans passenger seat you go back to st marys i go in and get susan and meet you there sanya lifted his eyebrows you get her from in there sure he pursed his lips thoughtfully then shrugged okay i suppose it is your funeral da i nodded firmly da i walked into the building and through the metal detectors they went beep i stopped and dropped all the rings and the shield bracelet into a plastic tub then tried again they didnt fuss at me the second time i got my stuff back and walked up to a station in the center of the floor that looked like an information desk i produced one of my cards the ones that called me a private investigator i had only half a dozen of them left the rest had been in my desk drawer at the office i need to speak to agent tilly about his current investigation the woman behind the desk nodded matteroffactly called tillys office and asked if hed see me she nodded once and said yes sir and smiled at me youll need a visitors badge here please make sure it is displayed at all times i took the badge and clipped it to my duster thanks i know the drill fourth floor she said and nodded at the person in line behind me i walked down to the elevators rode them up to four and walked to tillys office which turned out to be right across the hall from the interrogation room tilly small dapper and quicklooking stood in the doorway looking at a file in a manila folder he let me see that there was a picture of susan paperclipped to the inside cover before he closed the file and tucked it under his arm so he said its mr known associate just as well i needed to talk to you again anyway im a popular guy this week i said youre telling me tilly said he folded his arms frowning so we got a car rented by a mystery man using a bogus identity right outside a building that blows up we got sworn testimony from two local snoops that this leggy looker named susan rodriguez was seen in his company we got a pancaked volkswagen bug belonging to harry dresden and seventy thousand dollars worth of property damage near the house of a local crooked ia cop who lied his ass off to point me at you we got a file that says that susan rodriguez was at one point your girlfriend eyewitnesses that place both her and the mystery man at your apartmentwhich seemed to be a little too clean of anything that could implicate you but before we could go back and take a real hard close look at it for trace evidence it burns to the ground fire chief is still working on the investigation but his first impression is arson tilly scratched his chin thoughtfully i dont know if youre current on investigative technique but when there are this many connections between a relatively small number of people and events it can sometimes be an indicator that they might be up to something nefarious nefarious huh i asked tilly nodded good word isnt it he scrunched up his nose disappoints me because my instincts said you were playing it level with me close to the chest but level i guess you can always run into someone better at lying than you are at catching them huh probably i said but you didnt at least not with me he grunted maybe maybe he glanced back into his office what do you think i think youre playing with dynamite again tilly said murphys voice murph i said relieved i leaned around tilly and waved at her she looked at me and shook her head dammit dresden cant you ever do anything quietly and in an orderly fashion no way i said its the only thing keeping tilly here from deciding im some kind of bomb maker murphys mouth twitched up at one corner briefly she asked soberly are you okay they burned down my house murph i said mister got out but i dont know where hes at i mean i know that a lost cat isnt exactly a priority right now but i shrugged i guess im worried about him if he misses his feeding murphy said wryly im more worried about me mister is the closest thing to a mountain lion for a few hundred miles hell be fine tilly blinked and turned to murphy seriously murphy frowned at him what you still back him tilly said despite all the flags hes setting off yeah murphy said tilly exhaled slowly then he said all right dresden step into my office i did tilly shut the door behind us okay he said tell me whats going on here you dont want to know murphy said shed beaten me to it thats funny tilly said i just checked in with my brain about an hour ago and at that time it told me that it did want to know murphy exhaled and glanced at me i held up both hands i hardly know the guy your call murphy nodded and asked tilly how much do you know about the black cat case files tilly looked at her for a moment then he looked at his identification badge clipped to his jacket funny for a second there i thought someone must have changed it to say mulder im serious till murphy said his dark eyebrows climbed um they were the forerunner to special investigations right sixties seventies i think they got handed all the weirdo stuff the files make some claims that make me believe several of those officers were having fun with all the wonderful new psychotropic drugs that were coming out back then what if i told you they werent stoned till murphy asked tilly frowned is that what youre telling me they werent stoned murphy said tillys frown deepened si handles all the same stuff the black cats did its just been made real clear to us that our reports had better not sound like a drug trip so the reports provide an explanation they dont provide much accuracy youre standing there right in front of me telling me that when dresden told me it was vampires he was being serious completely murphy said tilly folded his arms jesus karrin you think im lying to you she asked you arent he said but that doesnt mean there are vampires running around out there it just means that you believe its true maybe im just gullible murphy suggested tilly gave her a reproachful look or maybe the pressure is getting to you and you arent seeing things objectively i mean if you make some comment even obliquely alluding to menstruation or menopause and its effect on my judgment murphy interrupted i will break your arm in eleven places tilly pressed his lips together sourly dammit murphy can you hear yourself vampires for christs sake what am i supposed to think murphy spread her hands im not sure harry whats actually happening i laid out the last couple of days focusing on the events in chicago and leaving out everything but the broadest picture of the white council and the red court and their involvement this vampire couple murphy said you think theyre the ones who got to rudolph stands to reason they could put pressure on him a lot of different ways they wanted to remove him before he could squeal and sent their heavy to do it i cant believe what im hearing here tilly said so when are you moving murphy asked me ignoring him tonight no one is moving anywhere until i get some answers tilly said to his credit he didnt stick any bravado into the sentence he made it as a statement of simple fact dont know how many of those i can give you man i said quietly theres not much time and my little girl is in danger this isnt a negotiation tilly said agent i said sighing theres still a little time im willing to talk with you my voice hardened but not for long please believe me when i say that i can take susan out of this building with or without your cooperation harry murphy said as if id just uttered something unthinkably rude for which i ought to be ashamed ticktock murph i answered if he pushes me i cant afford to stand here and smile now im curious tilly said bristling almost visibly i think id like to see you try that till murphy said in exactly the same voice mother of god boys would it kill either of you to behave like adults please i folded my arms scowling tilly did the same but we both shut up thank you murphy said till do you remember that tape that was on the news a few years back after the deaths at special investigations the werewolf thing tilly asked yeah blurry badly lit out of focus and terrible effects the creature didnt look anything like a werewolf only suddenly the tape mysteriously vanishes so it cant be verified by anyone secondhand versions are probably on the internet somewhere he mused and said the actress they had playing you was pretty good though that wasnt an actress till murphy said quietly i was there i saw it happen the tape was genuine you have my word tilly frowned again he ducked his head down slightly dark eyes focused on his thoughts as if he were reading from a report only he could see look man i said quietly think about it like this what if youd never heard me say the word vampire what if id said drug cartel or terrorists instead and i told you that this group of terrorists was financed by shady corporations and that one of them had blown the office building to prevent their illegal data from being stolen and exposed to the world what if i had told you that because id pissed them off a bunch of terrorists had taken my daughter that they were going to cut her head off and put the video on the internet that susan and the mystery man were spooks from an organization i was not at liberty to divulge trying to help me find and recover the girl would it still sound crazy tilly cocked his head for a second then he said in a subdued voice it would sound like the plot of a cheesy novel he shrugged but the logic would hold up i mean they dont call those assholes extremists for nothing okay i said gently then maybe we can just pretend i said it was terrorists and go from there its my daughter man tilly looked back and forth from me to murphy he said quietly either youre both crazyor i amor youre telling me the truth he shook his head and im not sure which of the possibilities disturbs me more you got a piece of paper i asked him bemused he opened his drawer and got out a pad i grabbed a pen and wrote on it susan tell him everything harry i tore off the page folded the note and said i guess susan hasnt said much to you tilly grunted nothing in fact literally nothing which is fairly hardcore in my experience she can be stubborn i said go give her this you know i havent seen her in hours get her story off the record see how well it matches up he took the note and looked at it then back at me hard to know who to trust i said talk to her try to take the story apart see if it stands up he thought about it for a moment and said keep him here murphy okay tilly left there were two chairs and neither looked comfortable i settled down on the floor and closed my eyes how bad is it she asked me pretty bad i said quietly um i need to ask you a favor sure if look i have a will in a lockbox at the national bank on michigan if something should happen to me id appreciate it if youd see to it youre on the list of people who can open it listed as executor harry she said granted theres not much to have a will about at the moment i said everything was in my house or office but there are some intangibles and i felt my throat tighten and cut short my request take care of it for me there was silence and then murphy moved and settled down next to me her hand squeezed mine i squeezed back sure she said thanks theres theres nothing in there about maggie obviously i said but if i cant be there to i want her in a good home somewhere safe hey emo boy she said time to take a gloom break right you arent dead yet as far as i can tell i snorted quietly and opened my eyes looking up at her youll take care of her yourself when this is done i shook my head slowly i cant murph susan was right all i can offer her is a life under siege my enemies would use her shes got to vanish go somewhere safe really safe not even i can know where she is i swallowed on a choking sensation in my throat father forthill at st marys can help mouse should go with her hell help protect her murphy looked at me troubled you arent telling me something it isnt important for now i said if you could find mister molly might like to have him around just so long as hes taken care of jesus harry murphy said im not planning a suicide run if thats what youre thinking i said but theres a possibility that i wont come back from this if that happens i need someone i can trust to know my wishes and carry them out in case i cant ill do it murphy said and let out a short laugh for crying out loud ill do it just so we can talk about something else i smiled too and rudolph entered tillys office and found us both on the floor grinning everyone froze no one looked certain of how to react well rudolph said quietly i always figured this for what it was but boy did you have everyone at your headquarters fooled murphy hi rudy i said youve got a beautiful home rudolph gnashed his teeth and drew an envelope out of his pocket he flicked it to the floor near murphy for you a ceaseanddesist order specifying that you arent allowed within two hundred yards of this case or anyone involved in the active investigation until your competence and noncomplicity have been confirmed by a special tribunal of the chicago police board also a written order from lieutenant stallings specifying that you are to have nothing to do with the investigation into the explosion and relieving you of duty forthwith if you do not comply his eyes shifted to me you i havent forgotten you shame i said id almost forgotten you but youve ruined that walking into the room and all this isnt over dresden i sighed yeah ive been having that kind of week murphy opened the envelope and read over a pair of pages then she looked at rudolph and said what did you tell them you have your orders sergeant rudolph said coldly leave the building before i relieve you of your weapon and your shield you mosquitodicked weasel she said her voice coldly furious that remark is going into my report for the tribunal murphy rudolph said there was a vicious satisfaction in his voice and once they read the rest youre done with your record they arent paying you any more slack bitch youre gone something dark and ugly stirred in my chest and the sudden image of rudolph pinned to the wall by a ton of crystalline ice popped into my brain bitch murphy said rising whoa i said drawing out the word as i came to my own feet and speaking as much to myself as to the furious woman murph dont play his game here game rudolph said youre a menace murphy and a disgrace you belong behind bars once youre out itll happen too you and this clown both clown i said in the exact same tone murphy had used and the lights went out there was a sudden hush all around us as fbi headquarters was plunged into powerless darkness after several seconds the emergency lights still hadnt come on harry murphy said her tone annoyed i felt the hairs on the back of my neck crawling around i lowered my voice and said that wasnt me where are the emergency lights rudolph said ththeyre supposed to turn on within seconds right heh i said into the darkness heh heh rudy old buddy do you remember the night we met tillys office was adjacent to the elevator and i distinctly heard the hunting scream of a red court vampire echoing around the elevator shaft it was followed by a chorus of screams more than a score of individual hunting cries lots of vampires in an enclosed space that was bad the heavy throbbing beat of a hideous heart underlay the screams audible four stories up and through the wall i shuddered lots of vampires and the ick in an enclosed space that was worse what is that rudolph asked in a squeaky whisper i willed light into my amulet prepared my shield bracelet and drew my blasting rod out of my coat beside me murphy had already drawn her sig she tested the little flashlight on it found it functional and looked up at me with the serene expression and steady breathing that told me that she was controlling her fear whats the play she asked get susan and get out i said if im not here and shes not here theyve got no reason to attack what is it rudolph asked again what is that noise huh murphy leaned her head a bit toward rudolph questioning me with a quirked eyebrow dammit i sighed youre right well have to take him with us too tell me rudolph said near panic you have to tell me what that is do we tell him i asked sure murphy and i turned toward the door weapons raised and spoke in offhanded stereo terrorists chapter by the time murphy and i had moved into the hall gunfire had erupted on the floors below us it didnt sound like muchsimple staccato thumping soundsbut anyone whod heard shots fired in earnest would never mistake them for anything else i hoped that nobody was carrying rounds heavy enough to come up through the intervening floors and nail me there just arent any minor injuries to be had from something like that those screams murphy said red court right yeah wheres susan interrogation room that way she nodded to the left and i took the lead i walked with my shoulder brushing the left hand wall murph after dragging the sputtering rudolph out of the office walked a step behind me and a pace to my right so that she could shoot past me if she had to wed played this game before if something bad came for us id stand it off long enough to give her a clean shot that would be critical buying her the extra second to place her shot vampires arent immune to the damage bullets cause but they can recover from anything but the most lethal hits and they know it a red court vampire would almost always be willing to charge a mortal gunman knowing how difficult it is to really place a shot with lethal effect especially with a howling monster rushing toward you you needed a hit square in the head severing the spine or in their gut rupturing the blood reservoir to really put a red court vampire downand they could generally recover even from those wounds with enough time and blood to feed upon murphy knew exactly what she was shooting at and had proved that she could be steady enough to deal with a redbut the other personnel in the building lacked her knowledge and experience the fbi was in for a real bad day we moved down the hall quick and silent and when a frightenedlooking clerical type stumbled out of a break room doorway toward us i nearly sent a blast of flame through him murphy had her badge hanging around her neck and she instructed him to get back inside and barricade the door he was clearly terrified and responded without question to the tone of calm authority in murphs voice maybe we should do that rudolph said get in a room barricade the door theyve got a heavy with them i said to murphy as i took the lead again big strong fast like the loupgarou its some kind of mayan thing an iksomethingorother murphy cursed how do we kill it not sure but daylight seems a pretty good bet we were passing down a hallway that had several offices with exterior windows the light of the autumn afternoon reduced by the occasional curtain created a kind of murky twilight to move through and one that my ambient blue wizard light did little to disperse eerier than the lighting was the silence no air ducts sighed no elevators rattled no phones rang but twice i heard gunshotsthe rapid bangbangbang of practically useless panic fire vampires shrieked out their hunting cries several different times and the thubdub of the icks bizarre heartbeat was steady omnipresentand slowly growing louder maybe we need a lot of mirrors or something murphy said bring a bunch of daylight in way harder to do than it looks in the movies i said i figure ill just blow open a hole in the side of the building i licked my lips crud uh which way is south thatll be the best side to do it on youre threatening to destroy a federal building rudolph squeaked gunshots sounded somewhere closemaybe on the third floor directly below us maybe on the other side of the fourth floor muffled by a lot of cubicle walls oh god rudolph whimpered oh dear sweet jesus he just started repeating that in a mindlessly frightened whisper aha i said as we reached the interrogation room we have our cowardly lion cover me dorothy remind me to ask what the hell youre talking about later murphy said i started to open the door but paused tilly was armed presumably smart enough to be scared and it probably wasnt the best idea in the world to just open the door of the room and scare him so i moved as far as possible to one side reached way over to the door and knocked in code even shave and a haircut there was a lengthy pause and then someone knocked on the other side of the door two bits i twisted the knob and opened the door very very slowly tilly i said in a hoarse whisper susan the interrogation room didnt have any windows and it was completely dark inside tilly appeared in the doorway holding up a hand to shield his eyes dresden yeah obviously i said susan im here she said from the darkness her voice shaking with fear im cuffed to the chair harry weve got to go working on it i said quietly you dont understand that thing that drumming sound its a devourer you dont fight them you run and pray someone slower than you attracts its attention yeah already met the ick i said id rather not repeat the experience i held out a hand to tilly i need cuff keys tilly hesitated clearly torn between his sense of duty and order and the primal fear that had risen in the building he shook his head but it didnt seem like his heart was in it tilly murphy said she turned to him her expression ferociously determined and said trust me please just do it people are going to die as long as these three are in the building he passed me the keys i took them over to susan who was sitting in the same chair i had during my chat with the feds she wore her dark leather pants and a black tshirt and looked oddly vulnerable just sitting there during a situation like this i went to her and started unfastening the cuffs thank you she said quietly i was getting a little worried there they must have come in through the basement somehow i said she nodded theyll work their way up floor by floor kill everyone they can its how they operate remove the target and leave a message for everyone else tilly shook his head as if dazed thats what thats how some of the cartels operate in colombia venezuela but susan gave him an impatient look and shook her head what have i been telling you for the last fifteen minutes a vampire let out a hunting scream one not interdicted by floors theyre here susan whispered as she rubbed at her newly freed wrists we have to move i stopped for a moment then i said quietly theyll just keep on killing until they find the target floor by floor i said susan nodded tightly i bit my lip so if we run theyll keep going all the way up murphy turned her head to look at me then jerked her eyes back out to the hallway wary fight we wont win i said certain not here on their timing theyve got all the advantages but we cant just abandon all those people either she took a deep breath and let it out slowly no we cant murphy said so what are we going to do does anyone have an extra weapon susan asked no one said anything and she nodded turned to the heavy conference table and flipped it over with one hand she tore off a heavy steel leg as if it had been attached with a kindergartners glue rather than highgrade steel bolts tilly stared his mouth open then he said very quietly ah susan whirled the table leg once testing its balance and nodded it will do i grunted then i said heres the plan were going to show ourselves to the vampires and the ick were going to hit whoever they have out front with everything we have and squash them flat that should make sure we have the attention of the entire strike team yes murphy said in a dry tone thats brilliant i made a face at her once theyre good and interested you tilly and rudolph are going to split off from the rest of us and hit the nearest emergency exit if it comes down to it you probably have better odds of surviving a jump out the window than you do staying in here you with me murphy frowned what about you susan me and your stunt doubles are going to jump over into the nevernever and try to draw the bad guys after us stunt doubles murphy asked we are susan asked alarmed sure i need your mighty thews to protect me you being superchick and all okay susan said eyeing me as if she thought i was losing my mindwhich hey i admit totally possible whats on the other side no clue i said and a touch to my mothers gem told me that she hadnt ever actually been in this building on her dimensionhopping jaunts well hope it isnt an ocean of acid or a patch of cloud five thousand feet above a big rock susans eyes widened slightly and then she shot me a wolfish smile i love this plan thought you would i said meanwhile you three get out does this place have an exterior fire escape rudolph just rocked back and forth making soft moaning noises tilly still looked stunned at what he had just seen from susan murphy cuffed him lightly on the back of the head hey barry tilly shook his head and looked at her fire escape no find a stairwell then i told murphy go quiet and fast in case some of them were too stupid to follow me murphy nodded and gave tillys shoulder a little shake hey tilly youre in charge of rudolph all right keep him moving and out of any lines of fire the slender little man nodded slowly at first and then more rapidly as he seemed to take control of himself okay im his nanny got it murphy gave him part of a grin and a firm nod right i said is this a great plan or what im point murph youve got my six susan you ride drag got it susan said the faint constant drumbeat of the icks throbbing heart got fractionally louder go i said and hit the hallways again at my request tilly steered us toward the central staircase running parallel to the elevator shafts because i figured it would make sense for most of the strike team to use the central stairwell while the others were covered by maybe a single guard we ran into another handful of people who were hovering uncertain of what to do and who looked at me in a manner that suggested they would find my advice less than credible tilly i said half pleading tilly nodded and started speaking in a calm authoritative tone theres some kind of attack under way tammy you and joe and mickey need to get to one of the offices with a window you got that a window take the curtains down let the light in barricade the door and sit tight he looked at me and said helps on the way i swapped a look with murphy who nodded confidently at me tilly had gotten the supernatural shoved in his face pretty hard but hed rebounded with tremendous agility or maybe hed simply cracked i guessed wed see eventually the federal personnel scurried to obey tilly running down the hall wed just come from if wed been about ten seconds slower the vampire would have found them first instead of us i heard a scream shrill and terrible meant to send a jolt of terrorized surprise through the prey so that the vampire could close upon it it really said something about the red court that simple tactic animals would never have been startled into immobility that way it takes a thinking mind trying to reason its way to what was happening to fall for a psychological ploy like that one and it probably said something about me that it completely failed to startle me or maybe it wasnt that big a deal as the scarecrow i felt that i had amply proven that i didnt have much of a brain with which to be messed so instead of finding a helpless target waiting for him the red court vampire found a field of adamant invisible power as i brought my shield up and while it might have supernatural strength that didnt increase its mass it bounced off my shield like any other body would if abruptly meeting someones front bumper at fifty or sixty miles an hour there was a flash of blue light and i released the shield with a little english on it tossing the vampire to sprawl on the ground on the righthand side of the hallway squarely in murphys line of fire and started moving forward again murphy calmly put two bullets into the vampires head which made an unholy mess of the wall behind it she put two more into its bloodgorged belly on the way by and as susan passed i heard an ugly moist sound of impact tilly stood there staring for a second frozen then susan nudged him into motion again the agent grabbed rudolph and dragged him after murphy and me we found the first human body several steps later a glassyeyed young woman covered in her own blood beyond her a man in a suit lay sprawled on his face in death and the corpses of two more women lay within a few feet of him there was the most furtive of sounds from a darkened supply closet near an intersection of hallways its doorway gaping wide open i didnt let on that id heard it you know what i said quietly to no one in particular that makes me mad i turned with my blasting rods runes blazing into sudden life and roared fuego a spear of whitehot fire erupted from the rod blowing through the interior wall in a concussive chorus of shattering materials i slewed it along the length of the closet at waist height cutting through the wall like an enormous buzz saw a surprised scream of inhuman agony greeted my efforts and i spun in place at once bringing up the shield again a second vampire bounded around the intersection ahead running on all fours along the wall and threw itself at me at the same time another of the rubbery black creatures exploded out of an air vent i would have sworn was too tiny to contain it coming down from almost straight overhead i rebounded the first vamp from my shield as i had only moments before and murphys gun began to bark the instant it bounced off the wall and to the floor i couldnt get my shield up in time to stop the one plunging down from overhead it landed on me a horrible squishy weight and with the crystalline perceptions of surging adrenaline i saw its jaws dropping open nightmarishly wide unhinging like a snakes its fangs gleamed black claws on all four limbs were poised to rake and its twofootlong tongue lashed at me as well seeking exposed skin in order to deliver its stupefying venom i went down to the floor on my face hurriedly covering my head with my arms the vampire raked at me furiously but the defensive spells on my duster held and prevented its claws from scoring the vampire shifted tactics quickly tossing me over like a rodeo cowboy taking down a calf the writhing slimy tongue lashed at my face now vulnerable susans hand closed on that tongue in midmotion and with a twist of her wrist and shoulders she ripped it out of the vampires mouth the vamp threw its head back and shriekedand my exsweeties improvised mace smashed its skull down into its torso the vampire in the closet still out of sight continued to wail its agony as i rose again and checked around me to make sure everyone was there anyone hurt wwere fine tilly said for a guy whod just had a couple of close encounters with imaginary creatures he seemed to be fairly coherent rudolph had retreated to his happy place and just kept on rocking crying and whispering what about you dresden peachy murphy turned toward the closet her face grim her gun in her hand i shook my head at her no let it scream itll draw the others to us and away from anyone else murphy looked at me for a moment frowning gently but nodded god thats cold harry i lost my warm fuzzies for the reds a long time ago i said the wounded vampire just wouldnt shut up fires tough on them their outer layer of skin is combustible my attack had probably left it in two pieces or otherwise pared down its body mass it would be a smoldering lump of agony writhing on the floor in so much pain that it could literally do nothing but scream and that suited me just fine we arent just standing here are we tilly asked a pair of particularly loud simultaneous shrieks came through the vents and shafts ululating over and under each other they were particularly strident and piercing and went on for longer than the others a chorus of lesser shrieks wailed briefly in reply the eebs as generals sending orders to the troops it had to be coordinating the raid and directing it toward the injured member of the team indeed we are not all right folks murph tilly rudolph get scarce follow murphy and do whatever the hell she tells you to do if you want to get out of this alive murphy grimaced at that be careful dresden you too i said see you at the church she gave me a sharp nod beckoned tilly and the two of them started off down another hallway to one of the side stairwells with any luck the eebs had just sent everyone they had running toward me even if murphy and tilly werent lucky i figured theyd probably have only a single sentry to deal with at the most i gave murphy even odds of handling that a percent chance of survival wasnt real encouraging but it was about percent higher than if theyd stayed susan watched them go and then looked at me you and murphy never hooked up youre asking this now i demanded should i fix us both a nice cup of tea in our copious free time i rolled my eyes and shook my head no we havent why not she asked a lot of reasons bad timing other relationships you know i took a long deep breath and said keep an eye out ive got to pull off something hard here right susan said she went back to watching the gloom her club held ready i closed my eyes and summoned up my will time for some real razzledazzle stuff illusions are a fascinating branch of magic there are two basic ways to manage them one you can create an image and put it in someone elses head theres no actual visible object there but their brain tells them that its there big as lifea phantasm its walking real close to the borders of the laws of magic to go that way but it could be very effective the second method is the creation of an actual visible object or creaturea kind of hologram those things are much harder to produce because you have to pour a lot more energy into them and while a phantasm uses a foes own mind to create consistency within the illusion youve got to do it the hard way with holomancy murphs image was easy to fix in mind as was rudolphs though i admit that i might have made him look a bit skinnier and slouchier than he might actually have been my holomancy my rules the hardest was tilly i kept getting the image of the actor from the x files confabulated with the actual tilly and the final result was kinda marginal but i was in a rush i pictured the images with as much clarity as i could and sent my will including a tiny bit of soulfire into creating the mirages soulfire isnt really a destructive force its sort of the opposite actually and while i used it in fights to enhance my offensive spells it really shone when creating things i whispered lumen camerus factum and released energy into the mental images the holograms of murphy tilly and rudolph shimmered into existence so absolutely reallooking that even i thought they might have been solid matter theyre coming susan said abruptly she turned to me and practically jumped out of her shoes upon seeing the illusions then she waved a hand at tillys image and it flickered straight through she let out a low whistle and said time to go the thunder of the icks heart grew abruptly louder a vibration i could feel through the soles of my shoes vampires boiled out of the central stairwell a sudden tide of flabby rubbery black bodies and allblack eyes of spotted pink tongues and gleaming fangs at their center in their fleshmasked forms were esteban and esmerelda and looming behind them was the ick susan and i turned and sprinted the three illusions did the same thing complete with the sounds of running footfalls and heavy breathing with a group howl the vampires came after us i ran as hard as i could drawing up more of my will i should have been feeling some of the strain by now but i wasnt go go gadget faustian bargain i gathered my will shouted aparturum and slashed at the air down the hallway with my right hand id used a lot of energy to open the way and it tore wide a diagonal rip in the fabric of space crooked and off center to the hallway it hung there like some kind of oddly geometric cloud of mist and i pointed at it shouting wordlessly to susan she shouted something back nodding while behind us the vampires gained ground with every second we both screamed in a frenzy of wild fear and rampant adrenaline and hit the way moving at a dead run we plunged throughinto empty air i let out a shriek as i fell and figured id finally taken my last desperate gamblebut after less than a second my flailing limbs hit solid stone and i dropped into a roll i came back up to my feet and kept running through what appeared to be a spacious cavern of some kind and susan ran beside me we didnt run far a wall loomed up out of the blackness and we barely stopped in time to keep from braining ourselves against it jesus susan said panting have you been working out i turned blasting rod in hand and ready to wait for the first of the pursuing vampires to appear there were shrieks and wails and the sound of scrabbling clawsbut none of them emerged from the shadows which just couldnt have been good susan and i stood there a solid wall to our backs unsure of what to do next and then a soft green light began to rise it intensified slowly coming from nowhere and everywhere at the same time and within a few seconds i realized that we werent in a cave we were in a hall a medieval dining hall to be precise i was staring at a double row of trestle tables that stretched down the length of the hall easily better than a hundred yards leaving an open aisle between them seated at the tables were things there was a curious similarity among them though no two of the creatures were the same they were vaguely humanoid they wore cloth and leather and armor all of it inscribed with odd geometric shapes in colors that could only with difficulty be differentiated from black some of them were tall and emaciated some squat and muscular some mediumsized and every combination in between some of the creatures had huge ears or no ears or odd saggy chins none of them carried the beauty of symmetry their similarity was in mismatchedness each individuals body at aesthetic war with itself one thing was the same they all had gleaming red eyes and if ever a gang looked evil these beings did they had one other thing in common they were all armed with knives swords axes and other crueler implements of battle susan and i had come in sprinting down the center aisle between the tables we must have startled our hosts who reacted only in time to catch the second batch of intruders to come throughand catch them they had some of the largest of the beings easily weighing half a ton themselves had piled onto the ick and held it pinned to the earth nearby the mob of vampires were lumped more or less together each one entangled in nets made out of some material that i can only describe as flexible barbed wire only esteban and esmerelda stood on their feet back toback between the ick and the netted minions there was blood on the floor near them and two of the native creatures were lying still upon the stone floor jesus susan whispered what are those things i i swallowed i think theyre goblins you think ive never seen one before i replied but they match the descriptions ive heard shouldnt we be able to handle like a million of them i snorted you liked those movies too huh her reply was a smile one touched with sadness yeah i said i was thinking of you when i saw them too i shook my head and no this is a case of folklore getting it wrong these guys are killers theyre sneaky and theyre smart and theyre ruthless like ninjas from krypton look what they did susan stared at the downed red court strike team for a moment i watched the wheels turn in her head as she processed what had happened to the vampires and the ick in a handful of seconds in complete darkness and in total silence um i guess wed better make nice then huh susan asked she slipped her club around behind her back and put on her old reporters smile the one she used to disarm hostile interviewees and then i had a thought a horrible horrible thought i turned slowly around i looked at the wall id been standing against and then i looked up it wasnt a wall exactly it was a dais a big one atop it sat a great stone throne and upon the throne sat a figure in black armor covered from head to toe he was huge nine feet tall at least and had a lean athletic look to him despite the armor his helm covered his head and veiled his face with darkness and great savagely pointed antlers rose up from the helmet though whether they were adornment or appendage i couldnt say within the visor of that helmet was a pair of steady red eyes eyes that matched the thousands of others in the hall he leaned forward the lord of the goblins of faerie leader of the wild hunt nightmare of story and legend and peer of the queen of air and darkness mab herself well murmured the erlking well well well isnt this interesting chapter i stared up at the erlking and with my typical pithy brilliance said uhoh the erlking chuckled a deep sound it echoed around the hall resonating from the stone amplified into subtle music if id had any doubts that i was standing at the heart of the erlkings power that laugh and the way the hall had responded in harmony took care of them for me it seems my kin that we have guests more chuckles rose up from a thousand throats and evil red eyes crinkled with amusement i confess the erlking said that this is a unique event we are unaccustomed to visitors here i trust you will be patient whilst i blow the dust from the old courtesies again the goblins laughed the sound seemed to press directly against whatever nerve raised the hairs on my arms the erlking rose smooth and silent despite his armor and his mass and descended from the dais he walked around to loom over us and i took note of the huge sword at his side its pommel and hilt bristling with sharp metal protrusions that looked like thorns he studied us for a moment and then did two things i hadnt really expected first he took off his helmet the horns were evidently fixed to the dark metal i braced myself to view something horrible but the lord of goblins was nothing like what i had expected upon his face the hideous asymmetries of the goblins of his hall were all reflected and somehow transformed though he too shared the irregular batch of features upon him their fundamental repulsiveness was muted into a kind of roguish distinction his crooked nose seemed something that might have been earned rather than gifted old faint scars marred his face but only added further grace notes to his appearance standing there before the erlking i felt as if i were looking at something handcrafted by a true master perhaps carved from a piece of twisted driftwood given its own odd beauty and then patiently refined and polished into something made lovely by its sheer unique singularity there was power in that face too in his simple presence you could feel it in the air around him the tension and focus of a pure predator and one who rarely failed to bring down his prey the second thing he did was to bow with inhuman elegance take susans hand and bend to brush his lips across the backs of her fingers she stared at him with wide eyes that were more startled than actually afraid and she kept her smile going the whole time lady huntress he said the scent of fresh blood hangs upon you well does it become your nature he looked at me and smiled showing his teeth which were white and straight and even and i had to fight to keep from flinching from his gaze the erlking had a score to settle with me i had better come up with a plan and fast or i was a dead man and the new knight of winter he continued i nearly had thee at arctis tor when the ogres caught up to thee upon the slopes hadst thou departed but threescore heartbeats later he shook his head thou art an intriguing quarry sir knight i bowed to the erlking in what i hoped was a respectful fashion i do thank thee for the compliment o king i said though it is chance not design that brought me hither i am humbled by thy generosity in accepting us into thine home as guests mine host the erlking cocked his head slightly to one side and then his mouth turned up into another amused smile ah caught out by mine own words twould seem courtesy is not a close companion unto me so perhaps it is meet that in a duel of manners thou wouldst have the advantage and this hall honors cleverness and wisdom as much as strength a murmur of goblin voices ran through the hall at his words because id just done something impossibly impudent id dropped myself into the dinner hall of the greatest hunter of faeriepractically thrown myself onto a plate with an apple in my mouth in factand then used an idle slip of his tongue to claim the ancient rights of protection as his guest thus obligating him as host to uphold those responsibilities to me ive said it before the customs of host and guest are a big deal to these people its insane but its who they are i bowed my head to him respectfully rather than saying anything like gee its not often one of the fae gets outwitted by a lowly human which should be proof enough for anyone that im not entirely devoid of diplomatic skills i should not wish to intrude upon your hospitality any longer than is absolutely necessary lord of hunters with your goodwill we will depart immediately and trouble you no more do not listen to it o erlking called a womans clear soprano it was easy to recognize esmerelda it speaks honeyed words with a poisoned tongue full intent upon deceiving you the erlking turned to regard the pair of vampires still on their feet despite the efforts of the goblins who had initially attacked them he studied them in complete silence for several seconds and then after a glance at the fallen goblins near them inclined his head hunters of the red court i bid ye continue i listen pray tell me more wiley game indeed this wizard kin said esteban it was well treed and out of tricks but for this shameful bid to escape the rightful conclusion of the hunt with full intent did the wizard bring us here into your demesne intending to use you o erlking to strike down his own foes when hunting a fox one must be wary not to follow it into the great bears lair the erlking replied this is common sense for any hunter by my reckoning wellspoken goblin king esmerelda said but by this action the wizard seeks to draw you into the war betwixt its folk and ours for we hunt it upon the express wishes of our lord and master as part of our rightly declared war the erlkings red eyes narrowed and flicked back over to me i could hear a low and angry undertone to his next words i desire naught of any other being save to pursue my hunts in accordance with the ancient traditions without interference i tell thee this aright sir knight should this hunters words prove true i will lay a harsh penalty upon thee and thineone which the powers will speak of in whispers of dread for a thousand years i swallowed i thought about it then i lifted my chin and said calmly i give thee my word as knight of the winter court that i had no such intention when coming here it was chance that brought this chase to thy hall o erlking i swear it upon my power the ancient fae stared hard at me for several more seconds his nostrils flaring then he drew back his head slowly and nodded once so i am given a riddle by my most thoughtful visitors he said his voice rumbling he looked from the eebs and company back to susan and me what to do with you all for i wish not to encourage visits such as this one his mouth twisted in distaste now i am reminded why i do not indulge in courtesy as do the sidhe such matters delight them i find that they pall swiftly a very large very powerfullooking goblin near the front of the hall said my king render blood judgment upon them all they are intruders in your realm place their heads upon your gates as a warning to any who would follow a rumble of agreement ran through the crowd of goblins the erlking seemed to muse on the idea for a moment or i offered such an act might invite more interference the express servants of the king of the red court would surely be missed should they not return the white council of wizards would i assure you have very strong feelings about my own disappearance to say nothing of course of mabs reaction im still quite new and she hasnt yet tired of me the erlking waved a hand nay nay the knight caught my words fairly guests they are lord ordulaka and i will not cheapen my honor by betraying that ancient compact he narrowed his eyes mmmm guests they are perhaps i should treat them most courteously perhaps i should insist that you remain my guests to be cared for and entertained for the next century he gave me a chilly little smile after all you are all but the first visitors to my realm i could understandably find it greatly insulting were you not to allow me the opportunity to honor you appropriately the eebs looked at each other and then both bowed sinuously to the erlking generous host esteban said you honor us greatly we should be pleased to stay as your guests for whatever length of time you feel appropriate harry susan hissed tensing she didnt need to explain it to me a delay of even a few hours might mean maggies death honored host i said such a path would be no less than your due given the unanticipated nature of our visit but i would beg you only to consider my obligations to my lady mab i pursue a quest that i may not lay aside and which she has bidden me complete it hinges upon things that occur in mortal time and were you to insist upon your rights as host it could compromise my own honor something i know that you as mine host would never wish to do the erlking gave me a look that blended annoyance with amusement and said few winter knights have had swords as swift as your tongue boy but i warn thee name your lady a third time and you will not like what follows i hadnt even thought of that hells bells he was right speaking mabs name here in the nevernever could indeed summon her at which point not only would she be an intruder in another rulers domain perhaps vulnerable to his power or influence but she would be extremely annoyed with one overtaxed wizard for having brought her the clashing of such powers in simple proximity could prove dangerous even deadly i bowed my head again and said of course mine host a goblin about five feet tall and so slender that it looked like a stiff wind might blow him down appeared from the shadows and diffidently took the erlkings helmet he began to turn to carry it away paused and suggested in a spidery whispering unpleasant voice we are all predators here my lord let it be settled in a trial of blood the erlking spread his hands as if he felt the suggestion should have been selfevident to everyone present of course rafforut again thou hast given excellent service the wispy goblin bowed at the waist and retreated to the shadows his mouth curling up in a small smile oh i said oh crap what susan asked i turned to speak quietly to her in a whisper pitched to register only to her morethanhuman hearing and hoped that the goblins didnt hear even better than that the erlking cant harm us or allow us to come to harm while we are his guests ditto for the reds but since we have competing claims that must be settled he can establish a trial by combat to see who is corrector at least most committed to his version of the story susans eyes widened as she understood if we wont fight for our side of the story he decides against us and for the eebs i nodded at which point he can declare that we have abused his hospitality i said and he will be free to kill us probably without repercussion but you just said mthe winter queen doesnt feel a thing for me i said she might be annoyed but this time next week shell barely remember me but the council i said they would feel strongly about it i said i never said theyd be upset susans eyes got a little wider a trial of skill then the erlking said a match the knight and the lady huntress versus two of your own red hunters choose which will stand for your side of the issue he clapped his hands once a sound like a small cannon going off prepare the hall goblins leapt to obey and cleared the long trestle tables outward with great energy and efficiency others began to rip at the stone with their bare blacknailed hands they tore it like wet earth swiftly gouging out a great ring in the floor a trench six inches wide almost that deep and thirty or forty yards across were hardly armed properly for such a trial mine host i said whilst the red hunters are fully equipped for battle as they are the erlking spread his hands again ah but they are armed with what they deemed necessary to them for the hunt and a true hunter never leaves himself unprepared for what the world may bring to face him do you say perhaps that you are no hunter after all no susan said at once of course not the erlking looked at her and gave her a nod of approval i am glad you find yourselves appropriately armed he glanced over at the eebs who were discussing matters in furious whispers probably employing a nonstandard use of pronouns sooth boy you were quick enough at wordplay that i would fain feed thee and send thee on thy way had you come here unpursued but i will not rouse the wrath of the lords of outer night lightly a war with them would be a waste of dozens of excellent hunting moons he shrugged so prove yourselves worthy and you may be on your way i cleared my throat and our fellow visitors the erlking didnt smile or otherwise change his expression but i suddenly got creeped out enough to have to fight to keep from stepping away from him my hall is fully furnished to receive all manner of outsiders there are rooms in these caves filled with clever devices meant for the amusement of my kin and lacking only the appropriate participants what happens if we lose susan asked if fortune is kind you will have clean deaths in the trial if not he shrugged certain of my kinrafforut for exampleare most eager to give purpose to all the rooms of my hall you would amuse them for as long as you could respond which might be a very very long time susan eyed the erlking then she said lets do it then i too have promises to keep he inclined his head to her as you wish lady huntress sir knight lady please enter the circle i started toward it and susan walked beside me how should we do it she asked fast and hard her voice turned wry how did i know youd want it like that i let out a short bark of genuine laughter i thought i was supposed to be the one with one thing on his mind oh when we were younger certainly she replied now though our roles have reversed meaning you want it fast and hard too she gave me a sly and very heated look with her dark eyes from beneath her dark lashes lets just say that theres something to be said for that once in a while she spun the table leg in a few circles i watched she stopped and glanced at me arching an eyebrow inquisitively my godmother might have tipped me off to a cure a way to free susan of the creature that had devoured half of her being and thirsted for me something the fellowship of st giles had been tryingand failingto do for hundreds of years it was possible that with a bit more work i could make it happen for her give her back control of her life but even if i did we couldnt be together not now mab was bad enough and hells bells i hadnt even thought about it id been so busy but mabs understudy maeve the winter lady was arguably more psychotic than mab herself and she was unarguably pettier more vicious and more likely to want to play games with anyone close to me i wondered how long it would take me to lose myself weeks months neither mab nor maeve would want me to remain my own man i wondered if when i was what they wanted me to be it would bother me to remember what i had been what others had meant to me all i said was i miss you she looked down and away blinking then she gave me a rather hesitant smile as a tear fellas if it were something she hadnt done in a while and was still remembering how to accomplish it i miss joking with you how could you do it i asked quietly how could you not tell me about her by tearing out a piece of myself she said quietly i know it was wrong i knew it was wrong when i did it and that that i was going to regret it someday but i had to keep her safe im not asking you to forgive just just understand i thought about that moment of stillness and choice at the stone table yeah i said i lifted a hand and touched her face with my fingertips then i leaned over to kiss her forehead i do understand she stepped closer and we hugged she felt surprisingly slender and fragile in my arms we stayed that way for a little while both of us feeling the fear of what was coming we tried to ignore the hundreds of red eyes watching us we more or less succeeded another cannon clap of sound echoed around the vast hall and the erlking said red hunters let your chosen champions enter the circle or else forfeit the trial okay i said the eebs will be tough but theyre doable they rely on stealth tactics and this is going to be as straight up as you can get im going to hit them with something that should give you enough time to close take whichever one is on the left move too far to the right and youll be in my line of fire so dont you smash one i burn the other and we go get some custom coffee mugs to memorialize the occasion later susan said i stopped drinking coffee you know the caffeine i looked at her with mock disgust you heathen fine esmerelda said from the far side of the circle she pointed a finger at one of the vampires trapped beneath the goblins nets you you do it impatiently the tiny woman went to the trapped vampire hideous and inhuman in its true form and sliced through the odd material of the net with her nails freeing the captive without ceremony she pitched the vampire into the circle one of her foot soldiers okay this might be easier than id thought esteban appeared then walking calmly forward the slowly accelerating lubdub sound of the devourers unsettling heartbeat came with him the devourer loomed over esteban horrible and hungrylooking and at a command from the vampire it shambled forward into the circle its allblack eyes staring at us with unnerving intensity i might have been projecting or something but it seemed to me that the ick was spoiling for some payback oh crap susan said in a very small voice when the circle is closed said the erlkings deep baritone the trial begins it will conclude when one party has been neutralized do the champions of the red hunters stand ready all of the vampires let out wailing shrieks and even the ick emitted a hissing burble like an overfull teakettle what are we going to do susan whispered frantically i had no idea you take the scrub my mouth said ill handle the devourer right she said her eyes wide right the erlking appeared halfway between the two parties standing outside the circle sir knight do you and the lady huntress stand ready we both nodded sharply though our eyes were fixed upon our opponents not the erlking i began drawing in my will and power seethed in my belly and chest and became an odd pressure behind my eyes the erlking drew his sword and held it high and every goblin in the place began roaring fire licked up the blade of the sword wreathing it in green flame and then he dropped the sword thrusting its tip into the trough in the stone the goblins had dug green goblin fire flared up with a howl and clouds of foul smoke it raced around the exterior of the circle in both directions until the two tongues of flame met at the point opposite where they had begun susan screamed i screamed the vampire screamed the ick did that teakettle thing and then we all started trying to kill one another chapter vampires and icks are fast but id dueled their like before like the apocryphal loki my previous opponents had learned that no matter how quick you are on your feet you arent faster than thought the spell id been holding ready lashed out before either of our opponents had moved more than a couple of feet naked force howling out from my outstretched hand to seize not the ick but in a sudden flash of inspiration i directed it at the vampire beginning to bound along beside and a little behind it clearly maybe even wisely the vamp was hoping to stand in the devourers shadow when the hurt started flying i cried out forzare and my raw will hammered the vampire down and at an oblique angledirectly in front of and beneath the feet of the ick if you have no weapons with which to fight the enemy find a way to make your enemy be your weapon if you can pull it off it makes you look amazing the vampire went under the icks feet with a wailing squeal and a crunchysounding splatter of vile fluids the collision tripped up the massive hunting creature as its legs tangled with the vampires rubbery sinuous limbs and the ick came crashing to the ground its unnatural drumbeat heart thudding loud and furious swiping and smashing in fury at the entanglement without ever bothering to consider what it might be destroying susan adjusted almost instantly to what had happened and closed on the sprawling ick with incredible speed her arm blurred as the ick began recovering its balance smashing her club straight down onto its skull and driving its head down to rebound from the floor the ick took the hit like it was a love tap slashing at susan with its clawsbut she had already bounded into the air jerking her knees up to avoid the grabbing claws and flying clear over the devourer to a roar of approval from the watching goblins she landed in a baseball players slide and shot forward over the goresmeared stone snapping one hand back to grab the throat of the downed vampire as she did the battered body came free of the icks limbs minus a limb or two of its own and thrashed weakly slowing susans slide and stopping her forward motion a bare inch before her feet would have slid into the green flame surrounding the fighting ring the ick whirled around as it staggered to its feet again preparing to pursue her when i lifted my blasting rod snarled fuego and hammered it with all the power i could shove through the magical focus bluewhite fire blindingly bright against the rather dim green flames of the erlkings will drew a group scream of surprise and discomfort from the gathered goblins the fire struck the ick and gouged a chunk of black rubbery flesh the size of a watermelon out of the massive muscles of its back its head whipped back so sharply that the top of its head practically touched its own spine and it lost its balance for another second or two slipping on the gore the first vampire had provided as it turned toward me i dimly took note of susan as this happened the halfcrushed halfdismembered vampire flailed wildly with its remaining claws and fangs putting up an insanely desperate vicious fight in an attempt to hang on to its life susan took a hard blow to the side of the head and when she turned back her lip was bloodied her teeth bared in a snarl and the dark swirls and points of her tattoos began to spread over her face like black ink dripped upon water she dropped the improvised club got both hands on the vampires throat and with calm precise strength thrust its head into the green fire there was a bloody explosion as that fire devoured the vampire and though its heat had seemed no greater than any campfires the temperature within that fire had to be something as hot as the sun as the vampires skull entered it it simply disintegrated with a howl of vaporized liquids spattering tiny bits of bone like shrapnel and covering susan and the dying vampire both in an enormous dark foulsmelling cloud susan i shouted and darted over to one side so that i wouldnt be loosing blasts of fire blindly into that cloud if i missed i hit the devourer gouging out a small trough in one of its arms missed with the third blast and scored with a fourth burning a scorch mark as wide as my thigh across its hip the drumbeat of its heart was a huge pounding rhythm by now like the double bass drums of a speedmetal band the hits seemed only to make it more furious and it shifted into a controlled forward rush meant to crowd me into the outer ring of fire or else leave me unable to escape its grasping claws but either the blow on the noggin or one of the blasts id unleashed had slowed the ick down i sprinted for the angle on its approach for the path that would let me evade the devourer and its outstretched claws and got clear of its attack beating the monster out on footwork and keeping from being trapped against the circles perimeter as it came at me i found a fierce smile spreading over my lips as i moved i kept hurling blasts at its legs as i ran attempting to slow it even more i didnt hit with more than a quarter of them i think but the missed bolts of fire splashed against the erlkings green fire in sizzling bursts of light the adrenaline made my senses crystalline bringing me every sight and sound with a cold purity and i suddenly saw where the devourer was weakest though it was hard to tell with its alien movement i realized that it was favoring one side ever so slightly i darted in for a better look nearly got my head ripped off by a flailing fist and saw that the icks leg was wounded low on the back of its thigh where the black flesh was twisted and mangled had it been mortal skin and tissue i would have thought it the result of a severe burnas long as whatever had done the burning had been moltenmetal hot and shaped like mouses teeth the foo dog had gotten to the ick during its encounter with thomas with a wound that had threatened to cripple it that was why it had been forced to withdraw if it stayed and mouse had managed another such strike it would have been entirely immobilized good luck this time big guy i heard myself say youve got nowhere to run the part of my mind that was still mostly sane thought the statement was utterly crazy maybe stupid too the ick was still chasing me after all if it hit me once with one of those enormous clawed hands it would liquefy the bones under whichever part of my body it hit with the possible exception of my head i maintain that all evidence seems to point to the fact that someone did one of those adamantium upgrades on my skull when i wasnt looking i was scrambling and blasting away for all i was worth and i couldnt keep up a pace like that forever i was scoring on the ick maybe slowing it even more but i wasnt even close to killing it it all came down to a simple question was the ick better at taking it than i was at dishing it out if so then i was living on borrowed time and the continuing onslaught of magic i threw at the thing amounted to an extremely high rate of interest before i could find out the fight changed the ick made a painfullooking surge of effort and got close enough to hit me i barely got out of the way in time almost fell turned it into several spinning steps instead and recovered my balance the ick turned to follow and susan burst out of the cloud of greasy smoke the instant it turned its back her tattoos had flushed from black to a deep deep crimson and she moved with perfect grace and in perfect silence so when she gracefully silently swung that steel table leg at the side of the icks knee jointon its unmarred leg no lessit took the monster entirely off guard there was a sharp terrible crack a sound that i would have associated only with falling timber or possibly smallcaliber gunfire if id heard it somewhere else the steel bar smashed the icks knee unnaturally inward until it made an angle of nearly thirty degrees it bellowed in agony and one arm swept back toward its attacker the ick hit susan and though it had been off balance startled and falling when it did so it still knocked her ten feet backward and to the ground her club bounced out of her hand with a chiming metallic clang and tumbled ringing like a tinny gong into the circling flames the heat within the green fires sliced off half the table leg as neatly as any hightemperature torch possibly could have done the colors of the flame briefly striated with tendrils of amber violet and coppery red the severed end rolled free of the fire and its edge was glowing whitehot i noticed it in the periphery of my heightened vision susan had landed on the ground with her back twisted at an impossible angle the ick lurched toward me as i stood there frozen in shock for the briefest of instants it was more than enough time for the devourer to close rake at me with its claws and bat me twenty feet across the circle all at the same time again the spells on my coat withstood the brute power of the icks claws but this hadnt been a glancing blow or incidental damage collected when it had tripped over me this was a fullon sledgehammer slam of the kind that had probably tossed the blue beetle onto thomass sports car du jour it was exactly what i had dreaded and as my body hit the ground a kind of resolved calm washed over me along with howls of goblin excitement i was a dead man simple as that the only question was whether or not i would survive long enough to feel the pain that the shock of impact was delaying and of course where to aim my death curse my limp arms and legs slowed my tumble and i wound up on my back with my hips twisted to one side as the ick threw back its head and let out a burbling teakettle scream its heart pounded like surreal thunder and my body suddenly felt awash with cold as if id landed in a pool of icy water the ick came at me pain showing in its movements now it howled and lifted both arms above its head ready to smash them down onto my skull i didnt have much time to use my death curse said the little sane voice in my head and then another voice in my head one far louder and more furious screamed denial my few glimpses of maggie whirled through my mind along with images of her deathor worseat ariannas hands if i died here there would be no one to take her out of darkness i had to try i thrust both fists at the icks least injured leg and let go with every energy ring i had left i guess from the outside it must have looked like one of those kung futype double fist strikes though the only thing my actual fists were doing was collecting a new round of bruises and little scars the energy released from the rings though kicked the icks leg so hard that it swept out parallel to the floor the ick toppled i rolled desperately and escaped being crushed by its bulk by a hairbreadth it landed in whistling agony and i suddenly saw a way to kill it that would never have been visible to me if i hadnt been flat on my back and looking up i raised the blasting rod to point at the ceiling above deeply shadowed but still barely visible it was a natural cavern roof the floor might have been carved and polished smooth to host the erlkings hall but stalactites the size of city buses hung from the ceiling like some behemoths grim teeth i checked to be sure that susan was on the far side of the circle as far away as possible from what i was about to bring down then i hurled my fear and rage at the base of a great stone fang that was almost directly overhead and put almost everything i had left into it bluewhite fire screamed through the blasting rod so intense that the runecarved implement itself exploded into a cloud of glowing splinters it hit the far above stalactite with a thunderous concussion beside me the ick rose up and reached for my skull with one enormous hand i threw up my hands hissed aparturum and with the last of my will ripped open the veil between the erlkings hall and the material world tearing open a circular opening maybe four feet acrossand floating three feet off the ground and parallel to the floor oriented so that its entry point was on its upper side then i curled up into a fetal position beneath that opening and tried to cover my head with my arms tons and tons of stone tumbled down with slow deadly grace the devourers heartbeat redoubled its pace then there was an incredible noise and the whole world was blotted away i lay there on my side for several moments not daring to move stone fell for a while maybe a couple of minutes before the sounds of falling rocks slowly died away like the pops from a pan of popcorn just before it starts to burn only you know rockier only then did i allow myself to lift my head and look around i lay in a perfectly circular fourfootacross tomb that was maybe five feet deep the sides of the tomb were perfectly smooth though i could see from all the cracks and crevices that they were made from many mismatched pieces of rock ranging from one the size of my fist to a boulder half as big as a car above me the open way glowed slightly all the stone that would have fallen on me had instead plunged through the open way and back into the material world i took a deep breath and closed it again i hoped that no one was hanging around wherever it was that way emptied out maybe in the fbi cafeteria no way to know except to go through and look i didnt want to face the collateral damage of something like that my sane brain pointed out that there was every chance that we werent talking about falling stones at all as matter from the spirit world they would transform to simple ectoplasm when they reached the material world unless ongoing energy was provided in order to preserve their solidity i certainly hadnt been trying to pump any energy into the stones as they hit the way so odds were that i just dumped several dozen tons of slime onto a random spot in the fbi buildingand slime that would evaporate within moments it would grossly reduce the chances of inflicting injuries on some hapless fbi staffer i decided that my sanity and i could live with that i closed the way with a wave of my hand and an effort of will and slowly stood up as i did i realized that i felt a bit creaky and that i was shaking with fatigue but what i didnt feel was pain i tried to dust myself off and get a good look at my injuries i should have broken ribs ruptured organs i should be bleeding all over the place but as far as i could tell i didnt even have whiplash was that mabs power running through me wrapped around me i didnt have any other explanation for it hell when susan and i had run from the fbi building she had been the one to get winded first while i felt no more need to breathe heavily than i would have had walking out to my mailbox for that matter id outrun the devourer during this fight i thought i should probably feel disturbed by the sudden increase in my physical speed and toughness but given what id had to pay for them i couldnt feel anything but a certain sense of satisfaction i would need every advantage i could get when i went to take maggie away from the red court i looked up as the green fire of the fighting circle began to die away and as it did the goblins of the hall erupted into an earsplitting spinechilling symphony of approving howls i climbed out of the hole then over and around a couple of dump trucks worth of rubble and hurried over to susans side on the opposite end of the ring she lay limp and still there were small cuts and bruises all over her her leather pants had hundreds of little holes in themthe shards of bone from the exploding vampire skull i guessed her spine was bent and twisted i couldnt tell how bad it was i mean susan had always been fairly limber and i had more reason to know than most with her entire body limp like that it was hard to say she was breathing and her tattoos were still there now bright scarlet her pulse was far too slow and i wasnt sure it was steady i leaned down and peeled back one eyelid her eyes were black all the way through i licked my lips the tattoos were a warning indicator the fellowship used as susans vampire nature gained more influence over her actions the tattoos appeared solid black at first but lightening to bright red as the vampire within gained more control susan wasnt conscious but if she had been she would have been insane with bloodlust shed nearly killed me the last time it had happened it was sort of what had started this whole mess in fact her body was covered in injuries of various sizes and i thought i knew what was happening it was instinctively drawing upon the vampire portion of her nature to restore her damaged fleshbut as she had not provided that nature with sustenance it could offer her only limited assistance she needed blood but if she got it woke up and decided that she just had to have more yikes her breathing kept slowing it caught for a moment and i nearly panicked then i shook my head took my penknife from my dusters pocket and opened a cut in my left palm in an area where the old burn scars were thickest and which still didnt have a lot of sensitivity i cupped my hand while i bled into my palm then very carefully i reached down and tipped my palm to carefully spill a few drops into susans mouth you would have thought id just run a current of electricity through her body she quivered went rigid and then arched her back into a bow strange popping sounds came from her spine her empty black eyes opened and she gasped then stared blindly trying to find my hand again with her mouth the way a suckling baby finds its meals i held my hand over her mouth and let the blood trickle in slowly she surged in languid motion beneath my hand savoring the blood as if it were chocolate a massage good sex and a new car all rolled into one two minutes of slow dreamy arching motion later her eyes suddenly focused on me and then narrowed she snatched at my arm with her handsand i drove my right fist into her face i didnt pull the punch either if her darker nature was allowed to continue it would destroy her killing me as a byproduct of the process her head snapped back against the ground and she blinked her eyes stunned i stood up took a few steps back and stuffed my injured hand into my pocket i was tired and feeling shocky my whole arm felt cold i didnt stop falling back until i was sure i could shield in time to hold her off if she came at me i recognized it when susan checked back in her breathing slowed becoming controlled and steady it took her four or five minutes of focus to push her darker self away from control but eventually she did she sat up slowly she licked at her bloodstained lips and shuddered in slow ecstasy for a second before dashing her sleeve across her mouth and forcing herself to her feet she looked around wildly a terrible dread in her eyesuntil she spotted me she stared at me for a moment and then closed her eyes she whispered thank god i nodded to her and beckoned for her to stand at my side i waited until she reached me then we both turned to face the erlking off to one side the members of the red court remained where they had beensave that esteban and esmerelda had been trapped in the goblins nets as well i had apparently been too intent on susan to hear the sound of any struggle in the aftermath of the duel but i could guess what had happened as soon as the ick had begun to falter they must have made a run for it this time though they hadnt had the advantage of showing up in a totally unexpected place with the goblins intent upon their meals this time the goblins had taken them probably before they had actually begun to flee both of the eebs were staring at susan and me with raw hatred written on their snarling faces the erlking looked at the captured vampires for a moment and smiled faintly well fought he said his deep voice resonant we both bowed our heads slightly to him then he lifted his hand and snapped his fingers once it echoed like the report of a firearm screams went up from the entire helpless red court crew as several hundred violenceamped goblins fell on them in a wave i watched for a moment in sickened fascination but turned away i hate the red court but there are limits the erlkings kin had none what about the red king i asked him the lords of outer night his red eyes gleamed his majestys folk failed to prove their peaceful intentions the trial established their deception to the satisfaction of law and custom let him howl his fury if he so wills it should he begin a war over this matter all of faerie will turn upon him in outrage and his people will make fine hunting beneath the screams of the red courtesmereldas were especially piercinga ragged chuckle ran through the hall the sound danced with its own echoes it was like listening to the official sound track of hell a goblin wearing thick leather gloves appeared holding what was left of susans club as if it were redhot the touch of iron and its alloys is an agony to the creatures of faerie susan accepted the steel calmly nodding to the gloved goblin i presume then i said quietly that we are free to go if i did not release you now the erlking said his tone almost genial how should i ever have the pleasure of hunting you myself some fine bright evening i hoped my gulp wasnt audible the lord of the hunt turned and gestured idly with one hand and a way shimmered into being behind us the green light that had let us see began to darken rapidly may you enjoy good hunting of your own sir knight lady huntress please convey my greetings to the winter queen my sane brain fell asleep at the switch and i said i will it was a pleasure erl maybe he didnt get it he just tilted his head slightly the way a dog does at a new sound we all bowed to one another politely and susan and i stepped through the way careful not to take our eyes off of our host until the world shimmered and that hall of horrors was gone it was replaced with an enormous rusticstyle building that appeared to be filled from the basement to the ceiling with everything you might possibly need to shoot catch find stalk hook clean skin cook and eat pretty much anything that ran slithered hopped or swam what the hell susan said looking around in confusion heh i said this is the bass pro in bolingbrook i think makes sense i guess i didnt mean that she said and pointed look i followed her gaze to a large clock on the far wall of the big store it said that the time was currently nine thirty pm thirty minutes after our departure time how can that be susan demanded we were there for half an hour at the most look my watch says its two my heart began to beat faster hells bells i didnt even think of it of what i started walking susan ditched her club behind a shelf and followed me we must have made a charming sight both of us all scuffed up torn ragged and wounded a few late shoppers stared but no one seemed willing to approach us time can pass at a different rate in the nevernever than it does here i said all those stories about people partying with the fae overnight and waking up in a new century thats why it happens the next link in the logic chain got forged and i said oh oh dammit what susan said its a threehour trip to chichén itzá i said quietly we cant get there by midnight lead ingots began to pile up in my belly and on my shoulders and the back of my neck i bowed my head my mouth twisting bitterly were too late chapter no susan said fiercely no this isnt set up on greenwich mean time harry these creatures arent performing their ceremony based on a clock theyre using the stars we only know an approximate time it could happen after midnight it could happen half an hour before midnight i thought but i didnt say that to susan instead i nodded she was right what she was saying just didnt feel right but i knew in my head that she was on target i forced myself to ignore that little whispering voice of defeat in my ear right i said keep going maximum speed we need to get back to st marys and pick up everyone there susan nodded and said half an hour back if theres no traffic and if you have a car i said which we dont susans mouth twitched into a smile good thing theres a whole parking lot full of them then i opened the front door for susan followed her out onto the sidewalk and nearly got run over by an emerald green stretch limousine its tail fins elongated hood and shining chrome grille marking it as something created in the extravagant years subsequent to the second world war the limo screeched to a halt and the driver dressed in a nononsense black suit got out and hurried around to the door nearest us he was medium height thin young and goodlooking enough to be acting or modelingso much so in fact that i decided immediately that he wasnt human almost as soon as i had the thought i suddenly saw the young sidhe lord as he truly appeareddressed in an emerald green tunic and tights each with accents of deep violet his sunny hair was bound back into a tight braid that fell past his waist and his feline catslitted amber eyes were piercing he saw me staring and gave me a mocking little bow that only barely moved his head and chest then opened the limos door the leanansidhe leaned over from the far side of the passenger compartment an exasperated look on her face and here thou art at last child what madness possessed thee to pay a social call upon the hunter he has a grudge against thee know you not what that means susan tensed and took a step back from her my godmother noticed it and favored her with a toothy smile fear not half child ive no reason to restrain thee againunless of course thou wouldst like to see where it leads she glanced up at the night skymostly hidden behind all the light pollutionand said granted we would be forced to indulge such curiosity another time godmother i said staring what a big car you have she shook a finger at me the better to take you to the house of the weeping mother so that we may embark upon our quest child glenmael help them in if you please we race against time the young sidhe gestured gallantly toward the rear of the limo and offered me a supporting arm i scowled at him provoking another smiling bow of his head and helped susan into the car i got in without help of my own and in short order we found ourselves seated facing the rear of the vehicle and my godmother as the young sidhe pulled out of the lot and headed for i ridiculous lea said staring at me in disapproval you look utterly ridiculous i blinked at her and then down at myself okay well granted id been smeared with ichor and then rolled around in dirt and debris and i had a bleeding cut on one hand which does not for neatness make my jeans were a wreck my tshirt was beyond repair and going to get cut up for rags and even my duster looked dirty and strained susan wasnt in much better condition im not going to a state dinner godmother i said her voice turned wry that depends upon who wins the battle methinks she looked me up and down and shook her head no no it wont do at all my queen has a certain reputation to maintain after all your first engagement as the winter knight calls for something a bit less postapocalyptic she studied susan with a critical expression mmmm and your concubine cannot be allowed to bring any shame upon you and by extension upon the queen i sputtered susan arched an eyebrow his concubine his lover the mother of his child yet to whom he is not wed i believe the term applies dear she waved a hand words la let us see she rested a fingertip thoughtfully upon the end of her nose staring at me then she said let us begin with silk she murmured a word passed her hand over me and my clothes started writhing as if theyd been made out of a single flat organism and one that hadnt yet had the courtesy to expire it was the damnedest feeling and i hit my head on the roof of the limo as i jumped in surprise a few seconds later clenching my head i eyed my godmother and said i dont need any help harry susan said in a strangled voice she was staring at me i looked down and found myself garbed in silken clothing my shirt had become a billowing affair of deep grey silk fitted close to my torso by a rather long vest of midnight black seeded in patterns of deep amethysts greenblue opals and pale exquisite pearls the tights were also made of silk closely fit and pure white while the leather boots that came up to my knees were the same deep grey as the shirt i stared at me then at susan wow susan said you you really do have a fairy godmother and ive never been able to indulge lea said studying me absently this wont do she waved her hand again perhaps a bit more my clothing writhed again the sensation so odd and intrusive that i all but banged my head on the roof again we went through a dozen outfits in half as many minutes a victorian suit and coat complete with tails was nixed in favor of another silk outfit this one inspired by imperial china by then susan and lea were actively engaged in the project exchanging commentary with each other and ignoring absolutely every word that came out of my mouth by the seventh outfit i had given up trying to have any say whatsoever in how i was going to be dressed i was given outfits drawing inspiration from widely diverse cultures and periods of history i lobbied for the return of my leather duster stridently but lea only shushed me and kept speaking to susan which outfit is really going to get that bitchs goat susan asked her finally leas mouth curled up into a smile and she said perfect my clothes writhed one more time and i found myself dressed in ornate gothic armor of the style used in western europe in the fifteenth century it was black and articulated with decorated shoulder pauldrons and an absurdly ornate breastplate gold filigree was everywhere and the thing looked like it should weigh six hundred pounds cortés wore armor in just this style lea murmured she studied my head and said though it needs a weight suddenly enclosed my head i sighed patiently and reached up to remove a conquistadors helmet decorated to match the armor i put it down on the floor of the limo and said firmly i dont do hats poo lea said arianna still hates the europeans with a vengeance you know it was why she took a conquistador husband i blinked ortega of course child lea said love and hate are oft difficult to distinguish between she won ortegas heart changed him wed him and spent the centuries after breaking his heart over and over again calling for him and then sending him away giving in to him and then reversing her course she said it kept her hatred fresh and hot explains why he was working in bloody brazil i said indeed hmmm she flicked a hand and added a romanstyle cloak of dark grey to my armorbroadened shoulders its ties fastened to the front of the breastplate another flick changed the style of my boots slightly she added a deep hood to the cloak then she thoughtfully wrought all the gold on the armor into a spectrum that changed from natural gold to a green that deepened along the color gradient to blue and then purple the farther it went from my face giving the gold filigree a cold eerily surreal look she added front panels to the cloak so that it fell like some kind of robe in the front belted to my waist with a sash of deep dark purple a final adjustment made the armor over my shoulders a bit wider and thicker giving me that football shoulderpad profile i remembered from friday nights in high school i looked down at myself and said this is ridiculous i look like the games workshop version of a jedi knight susan and lea blinked at me then at each other i want my duster back dammit i clarified that old rag lea said you have an image to maintain and im gonna maintain it in my duster i said stubbornly harry susan said she might have a practical point here i eyed her then my outfit practical appearances and first impressions are powerful things she said used correctly theyre weapons in their own right i dont know about you but i want every weapon i can get lea murmured indeed okay i dont see why my image cant wear my duster we need to be quick too this getup is going to be binding and heavier than hell leas mouth curled up at one corner oh i scowled at her then i shook my shoulders and twisted about a bit there was a kind of springy flexibility to the base material of the armor that steel would never match more to the point now that i was actually moving about i couldnt feel its weight at all i might as well have been wearing comfortable pajamas no mortal could cut through it by strength of mundane arms she said calmly it will shed blows from even such creatures as the vampires of the red courtfor a time at least and it should help you to shield your mind against the wills of the lords of outer night should i asked what do you mean should they are an ancient power godchild lea replied and gave me her cats smile again i have not had the opportunity to match my new strength against theirs she looked me up and down one more time and nodded satisfied you look presentable now child she said turning to susan let us see what we might do for you susan handled the whole thing a lot better than i had i got distracted while they were working i looked out the window and saw us blowing past a highway patrol car as if it were standing still instead of racing down the highway with its bulbs flashing and its siren wailing we had to be doing triple digits to have left him eating our dust so quickly the patrolman didnt react to our passage and i realized that glenmael must be hiding the car behind some kind of veil he was also i noticed weaving and darting through the traffic with entirely impossible skill missing other motorists bumpers and fenders by inches with them apparently none the wiser not only that but i couldnt feel the motion at all within the passenger compartment by all rights we should have been bouncing off the windows and the roof but it didnt feel as if the car were moving at all long story short he got us to st marys in less than fifteen minutes and gave me several dozen new grey hairs in the process we pulled up and glenmael was opening the door to the rear compartment at seemingly the same instant that the cars weight settled back against its parking brakes i got out the dark grey cowl covering my head my shadow on the sidewalk in front of me looked friggin huge and scary irrationally it made me feel a little better i turned to help susan out and felt my mouth drop open a little her outfit was um freaking hot the golden headdress was the first thing i noticed it was decorated with feathers with jade carved with sigils and symbols like those i had seen on the stone table and with flickering gems of arctic green and blue for a second i thought her vampire nature had begun to rise again because her face was covered in what i mistook for tattoos a second glance showed me that they were some kind of precisely drawn design sort of like henna markings but far more primitive and savagelooking in appearance they were also done in a variety of colors of black and deep dark red the designs around her dark brown eyes made them stand out sharply under that she wore a shift of some material that looked like simple soft buckskin split on the sides for ease of movement and her feet were wrapped in shoes made of similar material also decorated with feathers the moccasins and shift both were pure white and made a sharp contrast against the dark richness of her skin and displayed the smooth tight muscles of her arms and legs tremendously well a belt of white leather had an empty holster for a handgun on one of her hips with a frog for hanging a scabbard upon it on the other and over all of that she wore a mantled cloak of feathers not too terribly unlike the ones we had seen in nevadabut the colors were all in the rich cool tones of the winter court glacial blue deep sea green and twilight purple she looked at me and said im waiting for you to say something about a vegas showgirl it took me a moment to reconnect my mouth to my brain you look amazing i said her smile was slow and hot with her dark eyes on mine um i said but it doesnt look very practical lea accepted glenmaels hand and exited the limo she leaned over and murmured something into susans ear susan arched an eyebrow but then said okaaay she closed her eyes briefly frowning and she vanished like completely not behind a hardtopierce veil just gone my godmother laughed and said the same as before but red child okay said susans voice from empty air and suddenly she was back again smiling broadly wow the cloak will hide you from the eyes and other senses as well child my godmother said and while you wear those shoes your steps will leave no tracks nor make the smallest sound um right i said but id feel better if she had some kevlar along or something just in case glenmael said my godmother the chauffeur calmly drew a ninemillimeter pointed it at susans temples from pointblank range and squeezed the trigger the gun barked susan jerked her head to one side and staggered clapping one hand to her ear ow she snarled rising and turning on the young sidhe you son of a bitch those things are loud that hurt i ought to kick your ass up between your ears for you in answer the sidhe bent with consummate grace and plucked something from the ground he stood and showed it to susan and then to me it was a bullet the nose was smashed in flat until it vaguely resembled a small mushroom our eyes got kind of wide lea spread her hands and said calmly faerie godmother i shook my head stunned it had taken me years to design create and improve my leather dusters defensive spells and even then the protection extended only as far as the actual leather lea had whipped up a wholebody protective enchantment in minutes i suddenly felt a bit more humble it was probably good for me but then i tilted my head frowning the power involved in my godmothers gifts was incrediblebut the universe just doesnt seem to be willing to give you something for nothing that was as true in magic as it was in physics i could with years of effort probably duplicate what leas gifts could do the sidhe worked with the same magic i did though admittedly they seemed to have a very different sort of relationship still that much power all in one spot meant that the energy cost for it was being paid elsewhere like maybe in longevity godmother i asked how long will these gifts endure her smile turned a little sad ah child i am a faerie godmother am i not such things are not meant to last dont tell me midnight i said of course not i am not part of summer she sniffed rather scornfully noon and that made more sense my dusters spells lasted for months and i thought id worked out how to make them run for more than a year the next time i laid them down leas gifts involved the same kind of power output created seemingly without toilbut they wouldnt last like the things i created would my selfimage recovered a little lea i asked did you bring my bag glenmael opened the trunk and brought it over to me the swords in their scabbards were still strapped to the bags side i picked it up and nodded thanks he bowed smiling i was tempted to tip him just to see what would happen but then i remembered that my wallet had been in my blue jeans and was now presumably part of the new outfit maybe it would reappear at noon tomorrowassuming i was alive to need it i mean i will wait here lea said when you are ready to travel to the first way glenmael will take us there right i said lets go princess of course sir knight susan said her eyes sparkling and we went into the church chapter sanya was guarding the door he swung it open wide for us and studied susan with a grin of appreciation there are some days he said when i just love this job come on i said walking past him we dont have much time sanya literally clicked his heels together took susans hand and kissed the back of it gallantly the big stupidhead you are beyond lovely lady thank you susan said smiling but we dont have much time i rolled my eyes and kept walking there was a quiet conversation going in the living room it stopped as i came through the door i paused there for a second and looked around at everyone who was going to help me get my daughter back molly was dressed in her battle coat which consisted of a shirt of tightly woven metal links fashioned by her mother out of titanium wire the mail was then sandwiched between two long kevlar vests all of that was in turn fixed to one of several outer garments and in this case she was wearing a mediumbrown firemans coat her hair was braided tightly against the back of her headand back to its natural honey brown colorand a hockey helmet sat on a table near her she had half a dozen little focus items id shown her how to create none of which were precisely intended for a fight her face was a little pale and her blue eyes were earnest mouse sat next to her huge and stolid and rose to his feet and padded over to give me a subdued greeting as i came in i knelt down and roughed up his ears for a moment he wagged his tail but made no more display than that and his serious brown eyes told me that he knew the situation was grave next came martin dressed in simple black bdu pants a longsleeved black shirt and a tactical vest all of which could have been purchased from any military surplus or gun store he was in the midst of cleaning and inspecting two sets of weapons assault rifles tactical shotguns and heavy pistols he wore a machete in a scabbard on his belt a second such weapon rested in a nylon sheath on the table next to a bladesharpening tool kit he never looked up at me or stopped reassembling the pistol hed finished cleaning a small chess set had been set up on the other end of the coffee table from molly next to martins war gear my brother sat there with martin and once he had finished greeting me mouse between himself and the girl he was wearing expensivelooking silk pants and a leather vest both white a gun belt bearing a largecaliber handgun and a sword with an inwardcurving blade an old spanish falcata hung over the corner of the couch casually discarded he lay lazily back on the couch his eyes mostly closed watching the move of his opponent murphy was decked out in black tactical gear much like martins but more worn and better fitting they dont generally make gear for people murphs size so she couldnt shop off the shelf very often she did have her own vest of kevlar and mail which charity had made for her for christmas the previous year in thanks for the occasions when murphy had gone out on a limb for them but murph had just stuck the compound armor to her tac vest and been done she wore her automatic on her hip and her oddlooking rectangular little submachine gun the one that always made me think of a box of chocolates was leaned against the wall nearby murph was hunched over the chessboard her nose wrinkled as she thought and moved one of her knights into a thicket of enemy pieces before she turned to me she took one look at me and burst out giggling that was enough to set off everyone in the room except martin who never seemed to realize that there were other people there mollys titters set off thomas and even mouse dropped his jaws open in a doggy grin hah hah hah i said coming into the room so that susan and sanya could join us no one laughed at susans outfit i felt that the injustice of that was somehow emblematic of the unfairness in my life but i didnt have time to chase that thought down and feed it rhetoric until the lightbulb over my head lit up well murphy said as the laughter died away im glad you got out all right went shopping after did you not so much i said okay listen up folks time is short what else did we manage to find out about the site murphy told thomas mate in six took a file folder from beneath her chair and passed it to me you wish thomas drawled lazily i eyed him and opened the folder there were multiple pages inside color aerial and satellite photos of the ruins good grief i said how did you get these internet murphy said calmly weve got an idea of where theyre setting up and what security measures theyll need to take but before we can talk about an approach we need to know where were going to arrive i stroked a thumb over my mothers gem and consulted the knowledge stored there then i went through the maps until i found one of the proper scale picked up a pen from the table and drew an x on the map here its about five miles north of the pyramid thomas whistled quietly what i asked him you cant do five miles five miles of sidewalk sure thomas said five miles of jungle is a bit different dresden hes right martin said and at night too thomas spread his hands have done a little jungle sanya said coming over to study the map how bad is the bush there tougher than the lower amazon not as bad as cambodia martin said calmly sanya grunted thomas wrinkled his nose in distaste i tried to pretend that martin had given me some kind of tangible information and idly wondered if thomas and sanya were doing the same thing as me how long martin i asked him two hours bare minimum could be more depending i grunted then i said well see if lea cant do something to help us along the room went still um murphy said your psycho faerie godmother that lea harry you told me she was dangerous molly said and i still have the scar to prove it thomas added yes i said quietly shes powerful and by any reasonable standard shes insane and shes currently pointed in the direction of our enemy so were going to use her were using her are we sanya asked grinning he told us what toot said about mab harry molly said softly there was a long stretch of quiet you made a deal murphy said yeah i did for maggie i did i looked around the room im me until this is all over that was part of the deal but if theres anyone here who wants to bail on me and susan do it now otherwise feel free to keep your mouth closed about the subject my daughter doesnt have time for us to debate the ethics of a choice that isnt any of your goddamned business anyway i looked around the room and sanya said i am going who else goes with us mouse sneezed i figured that i told him he wagged his tail me obviously martin said murphy nodded molly did too then thomas rolled his eyes good i said lea will probably have something to speed the trip i said shed better thomas said times short we will be there in time sanya said confidently i nodded then i said and i have a favor to ask two of you i put the bag down and pulled fidelacchius from where id tied it the ancient katanastyle sword had a smooth wooden handle that perfectly matched the wood of its sheath so that when the weapon was sheathed it looked innocuous appearing to be a slightly curved sturdy stick of a good size to carry while walking the blade was razorsharp i had dropped a plastic drinking straw across it as an experiment once the rate of fall had been all the exquisite weapon had needed to slice the straw neatly in half karrin i said and held out the sword sanyas eyebrows climbed toward the roof ive been offered that sword before harry she said quietly nothings changed since then im not asking you to take up the mantle of a knight i said quietly i want to entrust it to you for this night for this purpose this sword was made to fight darkness and theres going to be plenty to go around take it up just until my girl is safe murphy frowned she looked at sanya and said can he do this can you sanya asked looking at me i was entrusted as the swords guardian i said calmly exactly what am i supposed to do with it if it is not my place to choose the swords bearer to the best of my ability sanya considered that for a moment then shrugged seems implicit to me they gave you the power of choice when they entrusted you with the swords one of those things they seem to tell you without ever actually saying anything that sounds remotely related i nodded murph used for the right reasons in good faith the sword is in no danger youre the only one who can know if youre doing it for the right reasons but im begging you take it help me save my daughter karrin please murphy sighed you dont play fair harry not for one second i said not for something like this murphy was quiet for a moment more then she stood up and walked to me she took the sword from my hand there was an old cloth strap fixed to the sheath so that the weapon could be carried over one shoulder or diagonally across the back murphy slipped the weapon on and said ill carry it if it seems right to me ill use it thats all i can ask for i said then i picked up amoracchius a european long sword with a crusaderstyle hilt and a simple wirewrapped handle and i turned to susan she stared at me and then shook her head slowly the last time i touched one of those things she said it burned me so bad i could still feel it three months later that was then i said this is now youre doing what youre doing because you love your daughter if you stay focused on that this sword will never do you harm i turned the hilt to her put your hand on it susan did so slowly almost as if against her will she hesitated at the last moment then her fingers closed on the blades handle and that was all nothing happened swear to harm no innocents i said quietly swear to use it in good faith to return your daughter safely home swear that you will safeguard the sword and return it faithfully when that task is done and i dont see any reason why you shouldnt be able to wield it she met my eyes and nodded i swear i nodded in reply and took my hands from the weapon susan drew it slightly from its sheath its edge gleamed and its steel was polished as smooth and bright as a mirror and when she moved to buckle it to her belt the sword fit there as if made for it my godmother was probably going to feel very smug about that i hope that the almighty will not feel slighted if i carry more ah innovative weaponry as well susan said she crossed to the table slid one of martins revolvers into her holster and after a moment picked up the assault rifle sanya stepped forward as well and took the tactical shotgun with its collapsible shoulder stock if he exists he has never given me any grief about it he said cheerfully da this is going very well already thomas barked out a laugh there are seven of us against the red king and his thirteen most powerful nobles and its going well mouse sneezed eight thomas corrected himself he rolled his eyes and said and the psycho death faerie makes it nine it is like movie sanya said nodding dibs on legolas are you kidding thomas said im obviously legolas youre he squinted thoughtfully at sanya and then at martin well hes boromir and youre clearly aragorn martin is so dour he is more like gimli sanya pointed at susan her sword is much more like aragorns aragorn wishes he looked that good countered thomas what about karrin sanya asked whatfor gimli thomas mused she is fairly finish that sentence raith and we throw down said murphy in a calm level voice tough thomas said his expression aggrieved i was going to say tough martin had gotten up during the discussion he came over to me and studied the map id marked then he nodded as the discussion went onwith mollys sponsorship mouse was lobbying to claim gimli on the basis of being the shortest the stoutest and the hairiestmartin explained what they knew of the security measures around the ruins thats why were going in here he said pointing to the easternmost point of the ruins where rows and rows and rows of great columns stood once they had held up some kind of roof over a complex attached to the great temple now martin continued the jungle has swallowed the eastern end of it theyre only using torchlight so movement through the galleries should be possible there will be considerable shadow to move through means theyll have guards there i said true well have to silence them it can be done if we can move fully through the galleries well be within two hundred feet of the base of the temple thats where we think theyll be performing the ritual in the temple plenty of temples got built on top of ley line confluences i said nodding i studied the map a lot can happen in two hundred feet i said even moving fast martin nodded yes it can and if our various intelligence sources are correct there are more than a thousand individuals nearby a thousand vampires i asked martin shrugged many many will be their personal guards others the highestranking servants i suppose you would call them they are like susan and myself there may also be mortal foot soldiers there to keep the sacrifices in line sacrifices plural martin nodded the ceremonies of the red court of old could last for days with blood sacrifices made every few minutes there might be a hundred or two hundred others chosen to die before the ritual i didnt shudder but only by sheer force of will yeah priming the pump i nodded probably theyre doing it right now yes martin said what we need i said a diversion martin said i nodded get everyone looking in one direction then susan lea and i will hit the temple get the kid then we all run for father forthills sanctuary on holy ground theyll catch us long before we can cover that distance you ever tried chasing a faerie through the woods at night i asked wryly trust me if we can break contact we can make it a few miles why not retreat directly to the spirit world martin asked i shook my head no way creatures this old and powerful know all the tricks there and theyll be familiar with the terrain on the other side that close to their strong places i wont fight them on that ground unless theres no other choice we head for the church i pointed to the location of the church in a small town only about two and a half miles from chichén itzá martin smiled faintly do you honestly think a parish chapel will withstand the might of the red king i have to think that martin i said besides i think a parish chapel with all three swords defending it along with two members of the white council and an elder sorceress of the winter sidhe will be a tough nut to crack and all we have to do is make it until dawn then were back in the jungle and gone martin mused on that for a moment and said it might work yeah it might i said we need to move our ride is outside waiting right martin looked at susan and nodded then he put his fingers to his mouth and let out a piercing whistle the goodnatured discussion came to a halt and he said the cars outside lets go people i said quietly its the big green car everyone grew serious rather rapidly and began gathering up their various forms of gear susan went out first to make sure there werent any problems with lea and everyone filed out after her sanya last sanya i said who did i get cast as sam sanya said i blinked at him not oh for crying out loud it was perfectly obvious who i should have been sanya shrugged it was no contest they gave gandalf to your godmother you got sam he started to leave and then paused harry you have read the books as well yes sure i said then you know that sam was the true hero of the tale sanya said that he faced far greater and more terrible foes than he ever should have had to face and did so with courage that he went alone into a black and terrible land stormed a dark fortress and resisted the most terrible temptation of his world for the sake of the friend he loved that in the end it was his actions and his actions alone that made it possible for light to overcome darkness i thought about that for a second then i said oh he clapped me on the shoulder and left he didnt mention the other part of the book that following the heroes when they set out was the tenth member of their party a broken creature who went through all the same dangers and trials who had made a single bad choice and taken up a power he didnt understand and who had become a demented miserable living nightmare because of it in the end he had been just as necessary to the overthrow of the darkness but he sure as hell didnt enjoy his part i shook my head and berated myself sharply here i was wasting time talking about a damned book about a world of blacks and whites with precious little in the way of grey where you could tell the good guys from the bad guys with about two seconds of effort and right now i didnt give a damn about good and bad i just wanted a little girl home safe it didnt matter which of them i was as long as i got maggie home i picked up my bag left st marys behind me and stalked out to my wicked godmothers limo pulling the soft hood of my dark cape up over my head if i was on the road to hell at least i was going in style chapter there was room for everyone in the back of the limo i was pretty sure that there hadnt been the first time id ridden in it but it had gotten several extra feet of seats along the walls and everyone was sitting there being only a little bit crowded as glenmael charged out to assault chicagos streets i still think we should try a frontal assault sanya argued suicidally stupid martin said his voice scornful surprise tactic sanya countered they will not expect it after a thousand years of never being challenged harry what do you think uh i said and then ebenezars voice said quite clearly and from no apparent source damn your stubborn eyes boy where have you been i went rigid with surprise for a second i looked around the interior of the limo but no one had reacted with the exception of my godmother lea sighed and rolled her eyes right the speaking stones id stuck mine in the bag but since i was holding it on my lap now it was close enough to be warmed by the heat of my body to function it was possible to send terse messages through the stones without first establishing a clear connection as my mentor and i had done back toward the beginning of this mess damnation and hellfire hoss growled ebenezars voice answer me i looked from sanya to my godmother uh i kind of have to take this call sanya blinked at me thomas and murphy exchanged a significant glance oh shut up i said crossly its magic okay i closed my eyes and fumbled through the bag until i found the stone i didnt really need to show up in my outlandish costume for this conversation so i thought about my own physical body for a moment concentrating on an image of my limbs and flesh and normal clothing forming around my thoughts so help me boy if you dont ebenezar appeared in my minds eye wearing his usual clothing he broke off suddenly as he looked at me and his face went pale hoss are you all right not really i said im kind of in the middle of something here what do you want your absence from the conclave did not go over well he responded his voice sharp there are people in the grey council who think you arent to be trusted theyre very very wary of you by missing the meeting you told them that either you dont respect our work enough to bother showing up or else that you dont have the wisdom and the fortitude to commit to the cause i never saw the appeal of peer pressure i said sir im finding a little girl ill come play council politics after i get her home safe if you want we need you here the kid needs me more its not as noble as trying to save the whole white council from its own stupidity i know but by god i will bring that child out safe ebenezars mostly bald pate flushed red despite my orders to the contrary we arent an army you arent my superior officer sir you arrogant child he snapped get your head out of your ass and get your eyes on the world around you or youre going to get yourself killed with all due respect sir you can go to hell i snarled you think i dont know how dangerous the world is me i think youre doing everything in your power to isolate yourself from the only people who can support you he said you feel guilty about something i get that hoss you think you aint fit for company because of what youve done his scowl darkened still more in my time ive done things that would curl your hair get over it think after i get the girl out do you even know where she is ebenezar demanded chichén itzá i said shes scheduled to be the centerpiece of one of the red kings shindigs in the next couple of hours ebenezar took a sharp breath as if id poked him in the stomach with the end of a quarterstaff chichén itzá thats a confluence one of the biggest in the world the reds havent used it in not since cortés was there confluence yeah i said the duchess arianna is going to kill her and use the power to lay a curse on her bloodlinesusan and me ebenezar began to speak and then blinked several times as if the sun had just come out of a cloud and into his eyes susan and he paused and asked hoss i meant to tell you the last time we spoke i said quietly but the conversation wasnt exactly i took a deep breath shes my daughter by susan rodriguez oh he said very quietly his face looked grey oh hoss her names maggie shes eight they took her a few days ago he bowed his head and shook it several times saying nothing then he said youre sure yeah hhow long have you known since a day or so after she was taken i said surprised the hell out of me ebenezar nodded without looking up then he said youre her father and she needs you and you want to be there for her not want to be there i said quietly going to be ayeaye he said dont go back to the edinburgh facility we think arianna laced it with some kind of disease while she was there so far there are sixty wizards down with it and were expecting more no deaths yet but whatever this bug is its putting them flat on their backsincluding injun joe so our best healer isnt able to work on the problem hells bells i said they arent just starting back in on the war again theyre going to try to decapitate the council in one blow ebenezar grunted aye and without the way nexus around edinburgh were going to have a hell of a time with that counterstroke he sighed hoss you got a damned big talent not real refined but youve matured a lot in the past few years handle yourself better in a fight than most with a couple of centuries behind them wish you could be with us i wasnt sure how to feel about that ebenezar was generally considered the heavyweight champion of the wizarding world when it came to direct facetoface mayhem and i was one of the relatively few people who knew he was also the blackstaffthe white councils officially nonexistent hit man authorized to ignore the laws of magic when he deemed it necessary the old man had fought pretty much everything that put up a fight at one point or another and he didnt make a habit of complimenting anyones skills i cant go with you i said aye he said with a firm nod you do whatever you have to do boy whatever you have to do to keep your little girl safe you hear yeah i said thank you sir godspeed son ebenezar said then he cut the connection i released my focus slowly until i was once more in my body in the back of the limo who was it molly asked the others let her take the lead she must have explained the whole speakingstone concept to them which made me look less crazy but i felt twitchy about her handing out information like that to the entire car it wasnt a big deadly secret or anything but it was the principle of the thing that i rubbed at my face with one hand ye gods i was becoming my mentors next id be grumbling about those darned kids and their loud music uh the council i said big shock they arent helping murphy looked like she might be asleep but she snorted so were on our own yeah good its more familiar lea let out a peal of merry laughter murphy opened an eye and gave lea a decidedly frosty look what you think that this is like what you have done before my godmother said so precious murphy stared at her for a moment and then looked at me harry i leaned my head back against the window so that the hood fell over my eyes murphy was way too good at picking up on it when i lied i dont know i said i guess well see it took glenmael less than twenty minutes to get to aurora we got out at a park there a pretty little community place it was empty this time of night and all the lights were out pitchers mound folks i said piling out and taking the lead i was walking with long long strides staying ahead of everyone murphy caught up to me moving at a slow jog harry she said her voice low your godmother yeah can we trust her i scowled she wouldnt be able to see the expression with the hood and all do you trust me why do you think im asking you i thought about it for a moment and then slowed down so that everyone else was nearer that included my godmother okay folks lets clear the air about the scary sidhe lady shes under orders to go with me and to help she will shes got a vested interest in making sure i come out of this all right and if she doesnt do it shes in trouble with the queen as long as you all are helpful to her mission getting me in and out in one piece shell support you the second she thinks youre a liability or counterproductive to her mission shes going to let bad things happen to you maybe even do them herself i looked at lea is that about right that is precisely right she said smiling susan arched an eyebrow and looked from me to my godmother you have no shame about it at all do you shame child is for those who fail to live up to the ideal of what they believe they should be she waved her hand it was shame that drove me to my queen to beseech her aid her long delicate fingers idly moved to the streaks of white in her otherwise flawless red tresses but she showed me the way back to myself through exquisite pain and now i am here to watch over my dear godsonand the rest of you as long as it is quite convenient spooky death sidhe lady molly said now upgraded to spooky crazy death sidhe lady the leanansidhe bared her canine teeth in a foxlike smile bless you child you have such potential we should talk when this is over i glowered openly at lea who looked unrepentant okay folks the plan is going to be for me to stand where the fire is hottest and if one of you gets cut off or goes down im going to go back for you i kept glaring at my godmother everyone who goes in with me is coming out again dead or alive im bringing you all home lea paused for a few steps and arched an eyebrow at me then she narrowed her eyes if they can all carry themselves out i said i believe that would be more quite convenient than if they couldnt wouldnt it godmother she rolled her eyes and said impossible child but there was a hint of a smile on her mouth she bowed her head to me slightly like a fencer acknowledging a touch and i returned it then i figured id best not threaten her ego any more than i had to be careful when you speak to her i told the others dont make her any offers dont accept any not even in passing not even things that seem harmless or that could only be construed through context words are binding around the sidhe and she is one of the most dangerous creatures in all of faerie i bowed my head to her fortunately for us before the nights over well all be glad shes with us oh the leanansidhe purred all but literally preening a trifle obvious but how the child has grown da said sanya cheerfully i am glad that she is here for the first time i got to ride in a limousine already it is a good night and if spooky crazy death sidhe lady can help serve a good cause then we who bear the swordshe paused for a smiling secondall three of themhe paused for another second still smilingwill welcome her aid such charm o knight of the sword lea replied smiling even more endearingly than sanya we are all being so pleasant tonight please be assured that should one of the swords be dropped or somehow misemployed i will do everything in my power to recover it sanya i said please shut up now he let out a booming laugh settled the strap of the shotgun a little more firmly over his shoulder and said nothing more i checked my mothers memories and nodded as i reached the pitchers mound okay folks first leg here should be a simple walk down a trail next to a river dont get freaked when you notice the water is flowing uphill i stared at the air over the pitchers mound and began to draw in my will right i said mostly to myself annnnnd here we go aparturum chapter the first leg of the trip was simple a walk down a forest trail next to a backwardflowing river until we reached a menhirthats a large upright standing stone to those of you without a pressing need to find out what a menhir is i found where a pentangle had been inscribed on the stone a fivepointed star within a circle like the one around my neck it had been done with a small chisel of some kind and was a little lopsided my mother had put it there to mark which side of the stone to open the way on i ran my fingers over it for a moment as much as my necklace or the gem that now adorned it it was tangible proof of her presence she had been real even if i had no personal memories of her and that innocuous little marking was further proof my mother made this mark i said quietly i didnt look back at thomas but i could all but feel the sudden intensity of his interest he had a few more memories than i did but not many and it was possible that he had me outclassed in the parentalfigure issues department too i opened another way and we came through into a dry gulch with a stone wall next to a deep channel in the stone that might once have held a rivernow it was full of sand it was dark and chilly and the sky was full of stars okay i said now we walk i summoned a light and took the lead martin scanned the skies above us uh the constellations where are we i clambered up a stiff little slope that was all hard stone and loose sand and looked out over a vast expanse of silverwhite beneath the moon great shapes loomed up from the sand their sides almost serrated in the clear moonlight lines and right angles that clashed sharply with the ocean of sand and flatland around them giza i said you cant see the sphinx from this side but i never claimed to be a tour guide come on it was a stiff two or three miles from the hidden gully to the pyramids and sand all the way i took the lead moving in a shambling loosekneed jog there wasnt any worry about heatdawn was under way and in an hour the place would be like one giant cookie pan in an oven but wed be gone by then my mothers amulet led me directly to the base of the smallest and most crumbly pyramid and i had to climb up three levels to reach the next waypoint i stopped to caution the party that we were about to move into someplace hot and to shield their eyes then i opened the way and we continued through we emerged onto a plain beside enormous pyramidsbut instead of being made of stone these were all formed of crystal smooth and perfect a sun that was impossibly huge hung in the sky directly overhead and the light was painfully bright rebounding up from the crystal plain to be focused through the pyramids and refracted over and over and over again stay out of those sunbeams i said waving in the direction of several beams of light so brilliant that they made the death star lasers look like they needed to hit the gym theyre hot enough to melt metal i led the group forward around the base of one pyramid into a slim corridor of well it wasnt shade but there wasnt quite so much light there until we reached the next waypointwhere a chunk the size of a large mans fist was missing from one of the perfectly smooth edges of the pyramid then i turned ninety degrees to the right and started walking i counted five hundred paces i felt the lightnot heat just the sheer overwhelming amount of lightbeginning to tan my skin then we came to an aberrationa single lump of rock upon the crystalline plain there were broad ugly facial features on the rock primitive and simple here i said and my voice echoed weirdly though there was seemingly nothing from which it could echo i opened another way and we stepped from the plain of light and into chilly mist and thin mountain air a cold wind pushed at us we stood in an ancient stone courtyard of some kind walls stood around us broken in many places and there was no roof overhead murphy stared up at the sky where stars were very faintly visible through the mist and shook her head where now machu picchu i said anyone bring water i did murphy said at the same time as martin sanya molly and thomas well thomas said while i felt stupid im not sharing sanya snorted and tossed me his canteen i sneered at thomas and drank then tossed it back martin passed susan his canteen then took it back when she was finished i started trudging it isnt far from one side of machu picchu to the other but the walk is all uphill and that means a hell of a lot more in the andes than it does in chicago all right i said stopping beside a large mound built of many rising tiers that if you squinted up your eyes enough looked a lot like a zigguratstyle pyramid or maybe an absurdly large and complicated wedding cake when i open the next way well be underwater we have to swim ten feet in the dark then i open the next way and were in mexico i was doubly cursing the time wed lost in the erlkings realm did anyone bring any climbing rope sanya murphy martinlook you get the picture there were a lot of people standing around who were more prepared than me they didnt have superduper faerie godmother presents but they had brains and it was a sobering reminder to me of which was more important we got finished running a line from the front of the group to the back except for my godmother who sniffed disdainfully at the notion of being tied to a bunch of mortals and i took several deep breaths and opened the next way moms notes on this waypoint hadnt mentioned that the water was cold and i dont mean cold like your roommate used most of the hot water i mean cold like i suddenly had to wonder if i was going to trip over a seal or a penguin or a narwhal or something the cold hit me like a sledgehammer and it was suddenly all i could do just to keep from shrieking in surprise and discomfortand some part of my brain marveled i was the freaking winter knight though my limbs screamed their desire to contract around my chest and my heart i fought them and made them paddle one stroke two three four fiow my nose hit a shelf of rock i found my will and exhaled speaking the word aparturum through a cloud of blobby bubbles that rolled up over my cheeks and eyelashes i tore open the next way a little desperatelyand water rushed out through it as if thrilled to escape i crashed into the yucatán jungle on a tide of ectoplasmic slime and the line wed strung dragged everyone else through in a rush poor sanya the last in line was pulled from his feet hauled hard through the icy water as if hed been flushed down a jotuns toilet and then crashed down amidst the slimed forest peru to mexico in three and a half seconds i fumbled back to the way to close it and stopped the tide of ectoplasm from coming through but not before the vegetation for ten feet in every direction had been smashed flat by the flood of slime and every jungle creature for fifty or sixty yards started raising holy hell on the whatthefuckwasthat party line murphy had her gun out and molly had a wand in each hand gripped with white knuckles martin let out a sudden coughing bellow that sounded like it must have torn something in his chestand it was loud too and the jungle around us abruptly went silent i blinked and looked at martin so did everyone else jaguar he said in a calm quiet voice theyre extinct here but the animals dont know that oooh said my godmother a touch of a childs glee in her voice i like that it took us a minute to get everyone sorted out mouse looked like a scrawny shadow of himself with his fur all plastered down he was sneezing uncontrollably having apparently gotten a bunch of water up his nose during the swim ectoplasm splattered out with every sneeze thomas was in similar straits having been hauled through much as sanya was but he managed to look a great deal more annoyed than mouse i turned to lea godmother i hope you have some way to get us to the temple a little more swiftly absolutely lea purred calm and regal despite the fact that her hair and her slimesoaked silken dress were now plastered to her body and ive always wanted to do it too she let out a mocking laugh and waved her hand and my belly cramped up as if every stomach bug id ever had met up in a bar and decided to come get me all at once it hurt i knew id fallen and was vaguely aware that i was lying on my side on the ground i was there for i dont know maybe a minute or so before the pain began to fade i gasped several times shook my head and then slowly pushed myself up onto all fours then i fixed the leanansidhe with a glare and said what the hell do you think youre doing or tried to say that what came out was something more like grrrrrrbrrrr awwf arrrr grrrrr my faerie godmother looked at me and began laughing genuine delighted belly laughter she clapped her hands and bounced up and down spinning in a circle and laughed even more i realized then what had happened she had turned usall of us except for mouseinto great gaunt longlegged hounds wonderful lea said pirouetting upon one toe laughing come children and she leapt off into the jungle nimble and swift as a doe a bunch of us dogs stood around for a moment just sort of staring at one another and mouse said in what sounded to me like perfectly understandable english that bitch we all stared at him mouse huffed out a breath shook his beslimed coat and said follow me then he took off after the leanansidhe and driven by reflexlevel instinct the rest of us raced to catch up id been shapeshifted one other timeby the dark magic of a cursed belt and one that i suspected had been deliberately designed to provide an addictive high with its use it had taken me a long time to shake off the memory of that experience the absolute clarity of my senses the feeling of ready power in my whole body of absolute certainty in every movement now i had it backand this time without the realityblurring euphoria i was intensely aware of the scents around me of a hundred thousand new smells that begged to be explored of the rush of sheer physical pleasure in racing across the ground after a friend i could hear the breath and the bodies of the others around me running through the night bounding over stones and fallen trees slashing through bits of brush and heavy ground cover we could hear small prey animals scattering before us and to either side and i knew not just suspected but knew that i was faster by far than any of the merely mortal animals even the young buck deer who went soaring away from us leaping a good twenty feet over a waterway i felt an overwhelming urge to turn in pursuitbut the lead runner in the pack was already on another trail and i wasnt sure i could have turned aside if i had tried to do so and the best part we probably made less noise as a whole than any one of us would have made moving in a clumsy mortal body we didnt cover five miles in half the time an hour instead of two it took usmaybe at the mostten minutes when we stopped we could all hear the drums steady throbbing drums keeping a quick monotonous tranceinducing beat the sky to the northwest was bright with the light of reflected fires and the air seethed with the scents of humans and notquite humans and creatures that made me growl and want to bite something occasionally a vampires cry would run its shrill claws down my spine lea stood upon a fallen log ahead of us staring ahead mouse walked up to her gggrrrr rawf arrrgggrrrrarrrr i said mouse gave me an impatient glance and somehowi dont know if it was something in his body language or whati became aware that he was telling me to sit down and shut up or hed come over and make me i sat down something in me really didnt like that idea but when i looked around i saw that everyone else had done it too and that made me feel better mouse said again in what sounded like perfectly clear english funny now restore them lea turned to look at the big dog and said do you dare to give me commands hound not your hound mouse said i didnt know how he was doing it his mouth wasnt moving or anything restore them before i rip your ass off literally rip it off the leanansidhe tilted her head back and let out a low laugh you are far from your sources of power here my dear demon i live with a wizard i cheat he took a step toward her and his lips peeled up from his fangs in unmistakable hostility you want to restore them or do i kill you and get them back that way lea narrowed her eyes then she said youre bluffing one of the big dogs huge clawed paws dug at the ground as if bracing him for a leap and his growl seemed to i looked down and checked it didnt seem to shake the ground the ground was actually shaking for several feet in every direction of the dog motes of blue light began to fall from his jaws thickly enough that it looked quite a bit like he was foaming at the mouth try me the leanansidhe shook her head slowly then she said how did dresden ever win you he didnt mouse said i won him lea arched an eyebrow as if baffled then she shrugged and said we have a quest to complete this bickering does not profit us she turned to us passed a hand through the air in our general direction and murmured anytime you want it back dears just ask youd all make gorgeous hounds again agony overwhelmed me though i felt too weak to scream about it it took a subjective eternity to pass but when it did i was myself again lying on my side sweating and panting heavily mouse came over and nuzzled my face his tail wagging happily he walked around me sniffing and began to nudge me to rise i got up slowly and actually braced my hand on his broad shaggy back at one point i felt an acute need to be gripping a good solid wizards staff again just to hold me up i dont think id ever appreciated how much of a psychological advantage ie security blanket it was either but i wouldnt have one until id taken a month or so to make one mine had been in the blue beetle and died with it too i was on my feet before anyone else i eyed the dog and said you can talk how come i never hear you talk because you dont know how to listen my godmother said simply mouse wagged his tail and leaned against me happily looking up at me i rested my hand on his head for a moment and rubbed his ears screw it the important things dont need to be said everyone was getting back up again the canteens made a round and i let everyone recover for five minutes or so there was no point in charging ahead before people could get their breath back and hold a weapon in a steady hand i did say something quietly to susan though she nodded frowned and vanished she was back a few minutes later and reported what shed found into my ear all right people i said then still quietly gather in i swept a section of the jungle floor clean and drew with my fingertip in the dirt martin lit the crude illustration with a red flashlight one that wouldnt ruin our night vision and had less chance of being glimpsed by a nearby foe there are guards stationed all over the big pyramid the girl is probably there in the temple on top thats where im going me susan and lea are going to move up through the gallery here and head for the temple im with susan martin said i go where she does this wasnt the time or place to argue me susan lea and martin will go in that way i want all eyes facing north when we head for the pyramid so i want the rest of you to circle that way and come in from that direction right here theres a cattle truck where theyre storing their human sacrifices get close and spring them raise whatever hell you can and run fast head west youll hit a road follow it to a town get into the church there got it there was a round of nods and unhappy expressions with any luck that will draw off enough of them to let us pull a smash and grab on the temple also i said very seriously what happens in the yucatán stays in the yucatán there will be no jokes about sniffing butts or chasing tails or anything like that ever agreed more sober nods this time with a few smiles okay folks i said just so you know friendsim in your debt and its one ill never be able to repay thank you gush later murphy said her tone wry rescue now spoken like a true lady i said and put my hand out everyone piled hands mouse had to wedge in close to put his paw on the pile all of us every single one of us except maybe my godmother were visibly obviously terrified a circle of shivers and short fast breaths good hunting people i said quietly go everyone had just gotten to their feet when the brush rattled and a halfnaked man came sprinting almost directly into us his expression desperate his eyes wide with mindless terror he smashed into thomas rebounded off him and crashed to the ground before anyone could react there was a muted rustle and a red court vampire in its blackskinned monstrous form came bounding out of the forest five yards away and upon seeing us went rigid with startled shock an instant later it tried to reverse its course its claws gouging at the forest floor ive heard it said that no plan survives first contact with the enemy its true the vampire let out an earsplitting screech and all hell broke loose chapter a lot of things happened very quickly mouse rushed forward and caught the vampire by one calf just before it could vanish into the thick brush he set his legs as the vampire struggled wildly trying to scream again martin brought his pistol up in a one handed grip six inches of sound suppressor attached to its muzzle without hesitating for an instant martin took a step to one side for a clear shot and fired on the move the gun made a sound no louder than a man clearing his throat and blood spattered from the vampires neck though it kept struggling its screams suddenly ended and it bounded and writhed wildly to maneuver mouse between itself and martin that stopped abruptly when thomass falcata took the vampires head from its shoulders the halfnaked man looked at us and babbled something in spanish susan answered him with a curt gesture and a harsh tone and then the man blurted something nodding emphatically then turned to keep running into the darkness quiet i breathed and everyone dropped silent while i stood quite still listening for all i was worth i have a knack a skill that some people seem to be able to learn im not sure if its something biological or magical but it allows me to hear things i wouldnt otherwise pick up and i figured it was a good time for it for a long breath there was nothing but the continued rumble of the drums then a horn something that sounded a bit like a conch began to blow a chorus of vampire screams arose and it didnt take any supergood hearing to know that they were headed our way there you see sanya said his tone gently reproving frontal assault oh jesus murphy said her tone more disgusted than afraid hes right i said my voice hard our only chance is to hit them hard we had only a moment and my mind raced trying to come up with a plan that resulted in something other than us drowning in a flood of vampires harry susan said how are we going to do this i need lea i said trying to keep my voice calm and steady i need molly molly made a squeaking noise i turned to susan and said we do it in two waves we moved directly toward the enemy entering the ancient gallery full of columns and the vampires came boiling out of the shadows to meet us i dont know how many of them there were more than a hundred less than a million i stepped out in front of everyone and said attack sanyas battle roar was loudest he leapt forward drawing esperacchius and blazing light shone forth from the blade murphy ran forward upon his right letting out a scream of her own and holding the shining length of fidelacchius in her hands an aura of soft blue light had surrounded her on sanyas left susan ran amoracchius held aloft and wreathed in white fire and her scream was something primal and terrible thomas flanked murphy martin ran next to susan and both of them charged forward with blade and pistol in hand i saw the front ranks of vampires hesitate as they saw the pure terrible light of the three swords coming toward them but it wasnt enough to stop the momentum of that horde it swallowed all five valiant figures in a tidal wave of dark flabby bodies claws fangs and lashing tongues suckers i still stood forward of everyone else and the meeting of the two ranks of combatants brought the horde to a halt a brief halt true something that lasted no more than a handful of secondsbut it was time enough for me to reach down to touch the slow terrible power of the ley line flowing beneath my feet the temple atop the pyramid in the ruins was the center of the confluence but ley lines each one a vast roaring current of magical energy radiated out in all directionsand the one beneath us was an enormous current of raw earth magic earth magic wasnt my forte and i knew only a couple of applications well enough to use them in a fight but one of them was a doozy i reached out and touched the power of that ley line desperately wishing i had my staff with me to assist with the effort i could sense the earth magic in my mind feel it flowing by with a power that vibrated up through the soles of the big stompy armorplated boots my godmother had put on me i took a deep breath and then thrust my thoughts down into that power i was immediately overwhelmed with a rush of images and alien sensations contacting a power so intense and coherent that it nearly had its own awareness in a single moment i saw the ponderous dance of continents clashing against one another to form mountains felt the slow sleepiness of the earth its dreaming shivers felt as disasters by the ephemeral things that lived upon its skin i saw wealth and riches beyond petty mortal imagination gold and silver flowing hot in rivers precious gems by the millions being born and formed i fought to contain the images to control them and channel them focusing all of those sensations into a well i could see only in my imagination a point deep below the gallery of crumbling old stone that rested next to the pitifully temporary mortal structure on the surface once i had the raw magic i needed i was able to pull my mind clear of the ley line and i was suddenly holding a whirlwind of molten stone in my head seething against the containment of my will until it felt like my skull would burst outward from the pressure and realized as i did that the use to which i was putting this pure raw energy was almost childish in its simplicity i was a frail wisp of mortality beside that energy which could quite literally have moved mountains leveled cities shifted the course of rivers and stirred oceans in their beds i set that well of energy to spinning and directed its power as it spiraled up a tornado of magic that reached out to embrace simple gravity with the enormous energy of the ley line i focused the pull of the earth for miles around into a circle a couple of hundred yards across and spoke a single word as i unleashed the torrent of energy bound only firmly if imperfectly by my will the spell start to finish had taken me a good sixty seconds to put together and tapping into the ley line had been the last part of the processfar too long and far too destructive to use in any of the faster and more furious fights that id found myself in over the years perfect for tonight for a quarter of a second gravity vanished from chichén itzá and the land for miles all around it jerking everything that wasnt fastened down myself included several inches into the air for that time all of that force was focused and concentrated into a circle perhaps two hundred yards across that embraced the entire gallery and every vampire inside it there the enormous power of that much focused gravity nearly three hundred times normal slammed everyone and everything straight down as if crushed by a single gigantic invisible anvil the stone columns handled it better than i thought they would maybe half of them suddenly cracked shattered and fell into rubble but the rest bore up under the strain as they had for centuries the assault force of the red court wasnt nearly so resilient i could hear the bones breaking from where i stood each snapping with hideously sharp pops and cracks down crashed the wave of vampires in a mass of shattered bones many of them were crushed beneath the falling stones of the weaker columnseach flabby black body smashed beneath a weight of scores of tons of stone even if hit by only one piece from a single block the energy involved had been enormous and as i was bounced up about a foot into the air i was hit with the wave of exhaustion that came along with it it wasnt as bad as it might have been technically i was only channeling and rearranging forces that were already in existence and motion not creating them from my will or i could never have managed to affect an area so big and to do it so violently but believe you me it was still hard i was thrown several inches up along with everything and everyone else that wasnt secured i landed with only one foot beneath me so i dropped to one knee catching myself on my hands panting i looked up to see the results of the spell a couple of acres of flat dead and a few horribly wounded and dying vampires lay strewn about like so many crushed ants and standing over them each in a combat pose as if ready to keep on swinging were the friends i had sent running ahead entirely unaffected good i said panting thats enough kid i heard molly several feet behind me let out a sigh of relief herself and the lights and shining auras vanished from the three figures wielding a sword welldone little one the leanansidhe said and as she spoke the five figures themselves vanished a most credible illusion it is always the little touches of truth that make for the most potent deceptions well you know molly said sounding a little flustered i just watched my dad a few times mouse stayed close at my side his head was turned to the right focused upon the trees and the darkness that way a growl i felt more than heard came from deep in his chest susan stepped up to my side and looked at the crushed vampires with undisguised satisfaction but frowned esclavos de sangre she said yes said martin from somewhere behind me what i asked blood slaves susan said to me vampires who have gone entirely feral they cant create a flesh mask theyre almost animals scum cannon fodder i said forcing my lungs to start taking slower deeper breaths a crowd of scum at a topend red court function yes it wasnt hard to figure out why theyd been there mouses interest in whatever it was he sensed in the trees was deepening the red court was expecting company yes susan said her voice tight well nothings ever simple is it that changed everything a surprise raid upon an unsuspecting unprepared target was one thing trying to simply kick in the teeth of a fully armed and ready red court obviously expecting someone with my firepower was something else entirely namely sheer stupidity so i had to change the game and change it fast a gong began to clash slowly a monstrous thing the metallic roar of its voice something low and harsh that reminded me inexplicably of the roar martin had produced earlier the tension got thicker and except for the sounds of the drum and the gong there were no other noises not of the creatures of the jungle or any other kind the quiet was far more terrifying than the noise had been theyre out there i said quietly theyre moving right now yes said lea who had suddenly appeared at my left side opposite mouse her voice was very calm and her feline eyes roamed the night bright and interested that mob of trash was merely a distraction our own tactic used against us her eyes narrowed they are employing veils to hide themselvesand they are quite skilled molly i said on it boss she replied our distraction was an illusion it didnt cost us any lives murphy pointed out neither did theirs from their perspective sergeant martin said creatures who cannot control themselves are of no use to the red king after all their deaths simply reduced the number of useless parasitic mouths he had to feed he may think of humans as a commodity but hed rather not throw that wealth away harry murphy asked can you do that anvil thing again hell im sorta surprised i got away with it the first time never done anything with that much voltage i closed my eyes for a second and began to reach down for the ley line againand my brain contorted thoughts turned into a harsh explosion of images and memories that left long lacerations on the inside of my skull and even after i had moved my mind away from those images it took several seconds before i could open my eyes again no i croaked no that isnt an option even if they gave me enough time to pull it off then what are we going to do thomas asked he held a large pistol in his left hand his falcata in his right and stood at my back facing the darkness behind us stand here until they swarm us were going to show them how much it will cost to take us down i said hows it coming padawan molly let out a slow thoughtful breath then she lifted one pale hand rotated an extended finger in a circle around us and murmured hireki i felt the subtle surge of her will wash out and drew in my own as it did the word my apprentice whispered seemed to flow out from her in an enormous circle leaving visible signs of its passing it fluttered leaves and blades of grass stirred small stonesand as it continued it washed over several shapes out in the night that rippled and became solid black outlines where before there was only indistinct darkness and shadow not all that skilled molly said panting satisfaction in her voice fuego i snarled and threw a small comet of fire from my right hand it sailed forth with a howling whistle of superheated air and smashed into the nearest of the shadowed forms less than a dozen yards away fire leapt up and a vampire screamed in rage and pain and began retreating through the trees infriga i barked and made a ripping gesture with my left hand i tore the fire from the stricken vampireand then some i sent the resulting fireball skipping over to the next formand left the first target as a block of ice where the damp jungle air had emptied its water over the vampires body and locked it into place rigid and very slightly luminous with the residue of the cold energy i felt in me the gift of queen mab which was just as wellthere were a dozen closing attackers in my immediate field of vision alone which meant another fifty or sixty of them if they were circling in from all around us plus the ones i couldnt see who may have employed more mundane techniques of stealth to avoid the eye i wanted them to see what i could do the second vampire fell as easily as the first as did the third and only then did i say quietly one bullet apiece martin martins silenced pistol coughed three times and the slightly glowing forms of the iceenclosed vampires shattered into several dozen pieces each falling to the ground where the luminous energy of winter began to bleed slowly away along with the iceriddled flesh they got the point the vampires stopped advancing the jungle became still fire and ice murmured the leanansidhe excellent my godson anyone can play with an element few can manipulate opposites with such ease sort of the idea i said back me up of course lea said i stepped forward and slightly apart from the others and lifted my hands arianna i shouted and my voice boomed as though id been holding a microphone and using speakers the size of refrigerators it was something of a surprise and i looked over my shoulder to see my godmother smiling calmly arianna i called again you were too great a coward to accept my challenge when i gave it to you in edinburgh now i am here in the heart of the power of the red king do you still fear to face me coward what thomas muttered under his breath this is not an assault sanya added disapproval in his voice i ignored them i was the one with the big voice you see what i have done to your rabble i called how many more must die before you come out from behind them duchess i am come to kill you and claim my child stand forth or i swear to you upon the power in my body and mind that i will lay waste to your strong place before i die i will make you pay the price for every drop of bloodand when i die my death curse will scatter the power of this place to the winds arianna i bellowed and i could not stop the hatred from making my voice sharply edged with scorn and spite how many loyal servants of the red king must die tonight how many lords of outer night will taste mortality before the sun rises you have only begun to know the power i bring with me this night for though i die i swear to you this i will not fall alone i indulged in a little bit of melodrama at that point i brought forth soulfireenough to sheath my body in silver lightas my oath rolled out over the land through the ruins and bounced from tree to tree it cast a harsh light that the nearest surviving vampires cringed away from for a long moment there was no sound then the drums and the occasional clash of the gong stopped a conch shell horn the sound unmistakable blew three high sweet notes the effect was immediate the vampires surrounding us all retreated until they were out of sight then a drumbeat began again this time from a single drummer whats happening thomas asked the red kings agents spent the past couple of days trying to kill me or make sure i showed up here only as a vampire i said quietly im pretty sure its because the king didnt want the duchess pulling off her bloodline curse against me which means that theres a power play going on inside the red court your explanation isnt one thomas replied now that i am here i said im betting that the red king is going to be willing to attempt other means of undercutting the duchess you dont even know hes here of course he is i said theres a sizable force here as large as any weve ever seen take the field during the war what if it isnt his army what if hes not here to run it thomas asked history suggests that kings who dont exercise direct control over their armies dont tend to remain kings for very long which must be ultimately what this is all aboutdiminishing ariannas power and talking to you does that how the code duello i said the red court signed the accords for what arianna has done i have the right to challenge her if i kill her i get rid of the red kings problem for him suppose he isnt interested in chatting thomas said suppose theyre pulling back because he just convinced someone to drop a cruise missile on top of us then well get blown up i said which is better than wed get if we had to tangle with them here and now i expect okay thomas said just so we have that clear pansy murphy sneered thomas leered at her you make my stamen tingle when you talk like that sergeant quiet sanya murmured something is coming a soft lamp carried by a slender figure in a white garment came toward us down the long row of columns it proved to be a woman dressed in an outfit almost exactly like susans she was tall young and lovely with the dark redbrown skin of the native maya with their long features and dark eyes three others accompanied hermen and obviously warriors all wearing the skins of jaguars over their shoulders and otherwise clad only in loincloths and heavy tattoos two of them carried swords made of wood and sharpened chips of obsidian the other carried a drum that rolled off a steady beat i thought there was something familiar about the features of the three men but then i realized that they werent personally familiar to me it was the subtle tension of their bodies the hints of power that hung about them like a very faint perfume they reminded me quite strongly of susan and martin half vampires presumably just as dangerous as susan and martin if not more so the jaguar warriors all came to a halt about twenty feet away but the drum kept rolling and the girl kept walking one step for each beat when she reached me she unfastened her feathered cloak and let it fall to the ground then with the twist of a piece of leather at each shoulder the shift slid down her body into a puddle of soft white around her feet she was naked beneath except for a band of leather around her hips from which hung an obsidianbladed knife she knelt down in a slow graceful motion a portrait in supplication then took up the knife and offered its handle to me i am priestess alamaya servant of the great lord kukulcan she murmured her voice honeyed her expression serene he bids you and your retainers be welcome to this his country seat wizard dresden and offers you the blood of my life as proof of his welcome and his compliance with the accords she lowered her eyes and turned her head to the right to bare her throat the carotid artery while still holding forth the blade do with me as you will i am a gift to you from the great lord oh how thoughtful the leanansidhe murmured you hardly ever meet anyone that polite these days may i no i said and tried to keep the edge of irritation out of my voice i took the knife from the girls hands and slid it into my sash and let it rest next to the cloth sack i had made from a knotted insideout rolling stones tshirt the shirt had been in my gym bag of contraband ever since it had been a gym bag of clean clothes for when i went to the gym i had pressed the shirt bahdumpbump ching into service when i realized the one other thing i couldnt do without during this confrontation it was tied to my grey cloth sash then i took the young womans arm and lifted her to her feet sensing no particular aura of power around her she was mortal evidently a servant of the vampires she drew in a short breath as she felt my hand circle her wrist and rose swiftly so that i didnt have to expend any effort lifting her should you wish to defile me in that way lord it is also well within your rights as guest her dark eyes were very direct very willing my body is yours as is my blood more than a century murphy muttered and weve gone from like a fish needs a bicycle to this i cleared my throat and gave murphy a look then i turned to the girl and said i have no doubt about your lords integrity priestess alamaya please convey us to his seat that i may speak with him at my words the girl fell to her knees again and brushed her long dark hair across my feet i thank you for my life wizard that i may continue to serve my lord she said then she rose again and made an imperious gesture to one of the jaguar warriors the man immediately recovered her clothing and assisted her in dressing again the feather cloak slid over her shoulders once more and though i knew the thing had to be heavy she bore it without strain this way lord if you please love this job sanya murmured just love it i need to challenge more people to duels thomas said in agreement men are pigs murphy said amen said molly lea gave me a prim look and said ive not sacrificed a holy virgin in ages completely unprofessional muttered martin ixnay i said quietly laying a hand on mouses shoulders all of you follow me and dont look edible and following the priestess with her lamp we entered the city of chichén itzá chapter chichén itzá smelled like blood you never mistake blood for anything else not even if youve never smelled it before weve all tasted itif nowhere else when we lose our baby teeth we all know the taste and as a corollary we all know the smell the main pyramid is known as el castillo by most of the folk who go there todayliterally the castle as we walked up out of the gallery of pillars it loomed above us an enormous mound of cut stone every bit as large and imposing as the european fortifications for which it was named it was a zigguratstyle pyramid made all of square blocks levels piled one on top of another as it rose up to the temple at its summitand every level of the pyramid was lined with a different form of guard at the base of the pyramid and therefore most numerous were the jaguar warriors we had already seen they were all men all appealing all layered with the lean swift muscle of a panther they all wore jaguar skins many of them bore traditional weapons many more wore swords some of them of modern make the best of which were superior in every physical sense to the weapons manufactured in the past most of them also carried a kalashnikovagain the most modern versions of the weapons made of steel and polymer the finest of which were also readily superior to the weapons of earlier manufacture the next level up were all women garbed in ritual clothing as alamaya had been but covered in tattoos much as the jaguar warriors were they too had that same subtle edge to them that suggested greaterthanmortal capability hells bells if the numbers were the same on every side of the pyramid and i had no reason to believe that they were not then i was looking at nearly a thousand of the jaguar warriors and priestesses i am a dangerous manbut no one man is that dangerous i was abruptly glad that we hadnt tried a ropeadope or a forward charge wed have been swamped by sheer numbers almost regardless of the plan numbers matter that fact sucks but that makes it no less true no matter how just your cause if youre outnumbered two to one by a comparable force youre gonna have to be real creative to pull out a victory ask the germans who fought on either front of world war ii german tankers would often complain that they would take out ten allied tanks for every tank they lostbut the allies always seemed to have tank number eleven ready to go i was looking at an impossible numerical disadvantage and i did not at all like the way it felt to realize that truth and i was only on the second tier of the pyramid vampires occupied the next several levels none of them were in their monstrous form but they didnt have to be they werent going all out on their disguises and the allblack coloration of their eyes proclaimed their inhumanity with eloquence among the vampires gender seemed to have no particular recognition two more levels were filled with fully vampire jaguar warriors male and female alike and the next two with vampire priests and priestesses above them came what i presumed to be the red courts version of the nobilityindividual vampires male and female who clearly stood with their own retinues they tended to wear more and more gold and have fewer and fewer tattoos the higher up the pyramid they went just before the top level were thirteen lone figures and from what i could see they were taller than most mortals seven feet or more in height each was dressed in a different form of traditional garb and each had his own signature mask my mayan mythology was a bit rusty but white council intelligence reports said that the lords of outer dark had posed as gods to the ancient mayans each with his own separate identity what they didnt say was that either they had been a great deal more than that or that collecting worshipers had made them more than merely ancient vampires i saw them and my knees shook i couldnt stop it and a light shone in the temple at the top of the pyramid the smell of blood came from the temple it wasnt hard to puzzle out it ran down the steps that led up the pyramid a trickling stream of red that had washed down the temple steps and onto the earth beyondwhich was torn up as if someone had cruised through the bloodied earth with a rototiller and torn it to shreds the blood slaves i was willing to bet my imagination provided me with a picture of that insane mob tearing at the earth swallowing bloody gobbets of it fighting with one another over the freshest muduntil yours truly showed up and kicked off the party i looked left and right as we walked across the open courtyard the cattle car susan had told us about was still guarded by a contingent of men in matching khakis and tactical vestsa private security company of some kind mercenaries there were a load of security bozos around several hundred at least stationed here and there in soldierly blocks of fifty men without pausing alamaya trod across the courtyard and began up the steps moving with deliberate reverent strides i followed her and everyone else present came with me i got hostile stares all the way up from both sides i ignored them as if they werent worth my notice alamayas calves were a lot more interesting anyway we reached the level below the temple and alamaya turned to me my lord will speak to only one wizard dresden please ask your retainers to wait here here right next to the lords of outer night the expired godlings if i made a mistake and if this went bad it was going to go really bad really fast the people who had been willing to risk everything to help me would be the first to suffer because of it for a moment i thought about cutting a deal send them away let me face the red court alone i had enough lives on my conscience already but then i heard a soft soft sound from the level above a child weeping maggie it was far too sad and innocent a sound to be the death knell for my friendsbut that might be exactly what it was stay here i said quietly i dont think this is going to turn into a john woo film for a couple of minutes at least murph take the lead until i get back sanya back her she arched an eyebrow at me but nodded sanya shifted his position by a couple of feet to stand slightly behind her and at her right hand i moved slowly up the last few steps to the temple it was a simple elegant thing an almost cubic building atop the pyramid with a single opening the size of a fairly standard doorway on each side alamaya went in first her eyes downcast the moment she was in the door she took a step to one side and knelt her eyes on the ground as if she were worthy to move no farther forward i took a slow breath and stepped past her to face the king of the red court he was kinda little he stood with his back to me his hands raised over his head murmuring in what i presumed to be ancient mayan or something he was fivetwo fivethree well muscled but certainly nothing like imposing he was dressed in a kind of skirtkilt thing naked from the waist up and the kneecap down his hair was black and long hanging to the top of his shoulder blades he gripped a bloodied knife in his hand and lowered it slowly delicately it was only then that i noticed the woman on the altar bound hand and foot her eyes wide and hopeless fixed on that black knife as if she could not look away my hands clenched into fists i wasnt here to fight i reminded myself i wasnt here to fight but i wasnt here to stand around and let something like this happen either and ive never had a clear head when it comes to protecting women murphy says it makes me a neanderthal she may be right but i didnt seize a bone and jump the guy i just cleared my throat really really obnoxiously and said hey the knife paused then the red king lowered it and turned to face me and i was forcibly reminded that nuclear warheads come in relatively small packages he made absolutely no threatening gesture he didnt even glare he didnt need to the pressure of his eyes was like nothing i had ever felt beforeempty darkness that struck at me like a physical blow that made me feel as if i had to physically lean away from him to keep from being drawn forward into that vacuum and lost to the void i was suddenly reminded that i was alone that i had none of my tools that i was involved in matters way over my head and that my outfit looked ridiculous and all of it was simply his physical presence it was far too huge for the little body it came in too large to be contained by the stone of this temple a kind of psychic body heat that loomed so large that only a fool would not be instantly aware of how generally insignificant he was in the greater scheme of the universe i felt my resolve being eroded even as i stood there and i clenched my jaw and looked away the red king chuckled he said something alamaya answered him then rose and came to kneel down at his feet facing me the slave on the altar remained in place crying quietly i could hear another smaller voice coming from behind the altar holy crap i couldnt have cut this one much closer i focused on my daughters voice for a moment small and sweetand suddenly i didnt feel nearly so small i just felt angry the red king spoke alamaya listened and then said you do not speak the true tongue of the ages wizard so my lord will use this slave to ensure that understanding exists between us radical i said wicked cool alamaya eyed me for a moment then she said something to the red king apparently conveying the fact that i had obnoxiously used phrasing that was difficult to translate he narrowed his eyes i mimicked his expression i didnt know if he got it but he sure didnt like it he said something in a short curt tone my lord demands to know why you are here the priestess said tell him he fucking well knows why im here i said she stared at me in shock she stammered several times as she translated for me i dont know if ancient mayan has a word for bleep or if she used it the red king listened his expression slipping from displeasure into careful neutrality he stared at me for several moments before he spoke again i was given a gift by she you know as duchess arianna the girl translated are you saying that the gift was wrongfully obtained yes i said not looking away from him and you know it i shook my head im sick of dancing tell him that ill kill arianna for him take my daughter with me and leave in peace tell him if he does that it stops being personal otherwise im prepared to fight the girl translated her face once more fearful when she finished the red king burst out laughing he leaned back against the altar his mouth wide in a grin his black eyes utterly unsettling he spoke a few terse sentences my lord says that he will throw one of your limbs from each door if you lift your hand against him i snorted yes but i wont even try to kill him i leaned forward speaking to the red king not the girl and showing him my teeth ill try to cripple him wound him weaken him ask him if he thinks the death curse of a wizard of the white council can deal him a wound ask him how well he trusts the people on the nearest couple of levels of the pyramid ask him if he thinks that theyll visit and send gifts when they realize hes been hurt alamaya spoke in a fearful whisper earning a sharp word of reproof and a command from the red king i guessed at the subject matter i dont want to tell you this my lord stupid slave translate the way i damned well told you to do or ill break my foot off in your ass okay maybe not that last part alamaya got on with her unpleasant job and the words pushed the red king into a rage he gritted his teeth and things moved beneath his skin shifting and rolling where nothing should have existed that could shift and roll i stared at him with one eyebrow lifted and that same wolf smile on my face waiting for his reaction he hadnt been talked to like this in a long time if ever he might not have much of a coping mechanism for dealing with it if he didnt i was going to die really horribly he did he mastered himself but i thought it was closeand it cost the woman on the altar her life he spun and slammed the obsidian knife into her right eye with such force that the blade broke off she arched her body up as much as her restraints allowed and let out a short choked scream of agony throwing her head left and rightand then she sort of slowly relaxed into death one leg kept twitching and moving the red king ran two fingertips through the blood that was seeping from her eye socket he slipped the fingers into his mouth and shuddered then he turned to face me completely composed again id seen behavior like that before it was the mark of an addict scoring a fix and full of contentment that he had a body full of booze or drugs or whatever and therefore the illusion that he could handle emotional issues more capably that explained a lot about how the red court had behaved during the war hells bells their king was a junkie no wonder they had performed so inconsistentlybrilliant and aggressive one moment capable of making insane and idiotic mistakes the next it also explained why there was strife within the court if the mark of power was control of ones blood thirst indulging it only when and where one chose and not with every random impulse then anyone who knew about the red kings condition would know that he was weak inconsistent and irrational hells bells this guy wasnt just a monster he was also paranoid he had to be because he knew that his bloodlust would be seen as a sign that he should be overthrown if it had been happening for very long it would have driven him insane even for one of the red court i mean and that must be what had happened arianna had somehow tumbled to the red kings weakness and was building a power base aimed at deposing him shed be building her own power personal political and social inasmuch as the vampires had a psychotic bloodspattered axmurdering version of a society dealing appropriately with ones enemies was critical to maintaining standing in any societyand for the red court the only two enemies were those who had been dealt with appropriately and those who were still alive she literally had no choice but to take me down if she was to succeed and a pearl harbor for the white council wouldnt hurt her any either if she pulled it off oh i had to make sure this little lunatic stayed king as long as he was the council would never face a competent united red court the red king spoke a moment later and wiped off his fingers in alamayas hair as he did my lord accepts your petition to challenge the duchess this slave will be sent to fetch her while you wait not so fast i said as alamaya began to rise tell him i want to see the girl she froze between us wideeyed the king moved a hand in a permissive gesture she spoke quietly to him his lip twitched up away from his teeth a couple of times but he gave me a curt nod and gestured at the altar then he stepped to one side and watched me i kept track of him out of the corner of my eye as i approached the altar maggie wearing little metal restraints that had ugh been made to fit children huddled on the far side of the altar blood had spilled out from the altar and she had retreated from it until she was pressed against the wall trying to keep her little shoes and dress both filthy already out of the blood her hair was a tangled mess her dark eyes were wide and bloodshot she was shivering it wasnt terribly cold out tonightbut it was cold enough to torment a child dressed in only a little cotton dress i wanted to go to her take those restraints off wrap her up in my ridiculous cloak and get her some food and some hot chocolate and a bath and a comb and a brush and a teddy bear and a bed and she saw me and flinched away with a whimper oh god i ached seeing her there frightened and miserable and alone i know how to handle pain when im the one feeling it but the hurt that went through me upon seeing my child my blood suffering there in front of my eyesit went to a whole new level and i had no idea how to deal with it but i thought it would probably start with tearing some more vampires to bloody shreds i took that pain and fed it to the storm inside me the one that had been raging for endless hours and that flared up whitehot again i waited until my rage had been stoked hot enough to dry the tears in my eyes then i turned to the red king and nodded deal i said go get the duchess ill take out the garbage for you chapter alamaya departed the temple in silence within a minute she was back she bowed to the red kinga full kneeling bow at thatand said something quietly the red king narrowed his eyes he murmured something to the girl and walked out conch horns blew and the drums began again as he appeared to those outside alamaya had to raise her voice slightly to be heard my lord wishes you to know that this place is watched and warded should you attempt to leave with the child you will be destroyed and she with you understood i said calmly alamaya gave me a more conventional bow and hurried out after the red king when she was gone i took two steps over to the altar and the dead woman upon it then i said all right tell me what im looking at from the improvised rolling stones tshirt bag tied to my sash bob the skull said in his most caustic voice a giant pair of cartoon lips i muttered a curse and fumbled with the shirt until one of the skulls glowing orange eye sockets was visible a big goofy magic nerd bob said i growled at him and aimed his eye at the altar oh bob said oh my what is it i asked the ritual curse theyre setting up bob said its a big one how does it work in ten seconds or less ten secargh bob said okay picture a crossbow all the human sacrifices are the effort you need to pull back the string and store the energy this crossbow has its string all the way back and its ready to fire it just needs a bolt what do you mean a bolt like the little girl hiding back behind it bob said her blood will carry the stored energy out into the world and conduct that energy to the target in this case her blood relatives i frowned for a second then i asked does it have to be maggie specifically nah one bolt is pretty much like another long as you use a compatible knife to spill the blood it should work i nodded so what if we used a different bolt the same thing would happen bob said the only difference would be who is on the receiving end its a loaded gun i said quietly i frowned then whyd they leave me alone with it who you gonna kill to set it off bob asked your little girl yourself come on boss can we disarm it then scramble it sure itd blow this temple halfway to orbit but you could do that i ground my teeth if it goes off the way they mean it to will it kill thomas the girls human bob said so only the human bits his body his mind i suppose if he got lucky he might wind up a vegetable in which his hunger demon was trapped but it wont spread any farther into the white court than that dammit i said i started to say more but caught motion out of the corner of my eye i stuffed bob all the way back into the sack admonishing him to shut up and turned to find alamaya entering the temple with a dozen of the fullvampire jaguar warriors at her back if you would follow me lord wizard the girl said i will conduct you to she who has wronged you my lord wishes you to know that he gives his word that your daughter will be spared from any harm until the duel is concluded thank you i said i turned to look at my little girl one more time she huddled against the wall her eyes open but not fixed on anything as if she were trying to watch everything around her at once i moved over to the child and she flinched again i knelt down in front of her i didnt try to touch her i didnt think i would be able to keep cool if i saw her recoil from my hand maggie i said quietly her eyes flashed up to me surprise evident there im going to take you away from the mean people i said keeping my voice as soft and gentle as i knew how i didnt know if she even understood english okay im taking you out of here her lip trembled she looked away from me again then i stood up and followed the priestess of the junkie god to face my enemy outside things had changed the red court had filed down from the pyramid and were on the move walking in calm ordered procession to another portion of the ruins my companions waited at the bottom of the stairs right i said once i reached them duel time sanya shook his head mark my words this will not be settled in a dueling circle things like this always go to hell the accords are serious i said hell play it straight if i win i get the girl and were gone martin shook his head what i asked him i know them he said levelly none of us are leaving this place alive his words had an instant effect on everyone they hit molly the hardest she was already pale i saw her swallow nervously maybe you know the monsters martin murphy said quietly but i know the guy who stops them and if they dont return the girl well make them regret it she nodded at me and said lets go we can watch dresden kill the bitch i found myself smiling murphy was good people once the last of the halfmortal jaguar warriors had departed we fell into step behind them and followed them toward what looked like another temple on the north end of the ruins as we went beneath the temple doorway though we found ourselves passing through it into the open space beyonda swath of green grass at least a hundred and fifty yards long and seventy or eighty yards wide stone walls about thirty feet high lined the long sides of the rectangle while the far end boasted a temple like the one wed just entered its a stadium i murmured looking around the place ugh molly said there are some pretty horrific stories about the mayans spectator sports boss indeed lea sighed happily they knew well how to motivate their athletes alamaya turned to me and said lord your retainers may wait here please come with me keep your eyes open folks i said then i nodded to alamaya and followed her onto the field even as i started out a woman began walking toward me from the opposite end as she approached i saw that arianna had the same facial features more or less but she had traded in her pale skin for redbrown her icy eyes for vampire black and shed dropped six inches from her height she wore a simple buckskin shift and more gold jewelry than a mr t look alike convention her nose was a little sharper a little longer but as we stopped and faced each other from about ten feet away i could see the hate boiling behind her eyes i had no doubt that this was the duchess i smiled at her and said i gotcha now yes arianna replied her eyes flicked up and around us in a quick circle taking in the thousands of members of the red court and their retainers i may faint with the terror why i demanded of her why bring the child into this why not just come straight to me does it matter at this point i shrugged not really im curious she stared at me for a moment and then she smiled you dont know i eyed her warily dont know what dear boy she said this was never about you i scowled i dont understand obviously arianna said and gave me a stunning smile die confused a conch horn moaned and alamaya turned to bow toward the temple id just come through i could see the red king seated upon a throne made of dark richly polished wood decorated with golden filigree and designs alamaya rose and turned to us lord and lady these are the limits within which you must do battle first i scowled hey this is an accords matter we abide by the code duello the red king spoke and though he was more than two hundred feet away i heard him clearly alamaya listened and bowed my lord replies that this is a holy time and holy ground to our people and has been from time immemorial if you do not wish to respect the traditions of our people he invites you to return tomorrow night unfortunately he can make no promises about the fate of his newest chattel should you choose to do so i eyed the red king then i snorted fine i said alamaya nodded and continued first she said as you are both wielders of power you will duel with power and power alone physical contact of any kind is forbidden ariannas eyes narrowed mine did too i knew that the red court had dabblers in magichell the first red court vampire id ever met had been a fullblown sorceress by the time shed been elevated to the red courts nobility judging by ariannas jewelry her proper place had been on the eleventh tier of the pyramidthe one directly below the lords of outer night themselves it stood to reason that even a dabbler could have accrued way too much experience and skill over the course of millennia second the mortal priestess said your persons and whatsoever power you use must be contained within the walls of this court should either of you violate that proscription you will be slain out of hand by the wills of my lord and the lords of outer night i have this problem with buildings i said maybe you noticed the columns back the other way alamaya gave me a blank look i sighed nobody appreciates levity when theyre in the middle of their traditional mumbo jumbo i guess nothing never mind third alamaya said the duel will begin at the next sounding of the conch it will end only when one of you is no more do you understand the rules as i have given them to you yep i said yes said arianna have you anything else to say always i said but it can wait arianna smiled slightly at me give my father my thanks and tell him that i will join him in the temple momentarily alamaya bowed to us both then she retreated from the field and back over to her boss the night grew silent down in the stadium there wasnt even the sound of wind the silence gnawed at me though arianna looked relaxed so i said your dad is the red king indeed he created me as he created all of the thirteen and the better part of our nobility one big bloodsucking brady bunch huh but ill bet he missed all the pta meetings the duchess studied me and shook her head i shall never understand why someone hasnt killed you before now wasnt for lack of trying i said hey why do you suppose he set up the rules the way he did if wed gone by the code duello theres a chance it could have been limited to a physical confrontation really seems to be taking away most of your advantages doesnt he she smiled a jaded person might consider it a sign of his weakness nice spin on that one purely out of curiosity though once you kill me what comes next she lifted her shoulders in a shrug i continue to serve the red court to the best of my ability i showed her my teeth meaning youre going to knock big red out of that chair right that is more ambitious than reasonable she said one of the thirteen i should think will ascend to become kukulcan creating an opening in the lords of outer night i said getting it murdering your father to get a promotion youre all class cattle couldnt possibly understand couldnt understand that daddys losing it i asked that hes reverting into one of your blood slaves her mouth twitched as if she were restraining it from twisting into a snarl it happens betimes to the aged arianna said i love and revere my father but his time is done unless you lose i said i find that unlikely she looked me up and down what a novel outfit i wore it especially for you i said and fluttered my eyelashes at her she didnt look amused most of what i do is business impersonal but im going to enjoy this i dropped the wiseacre attitude the growing force of my anger burned it away taking my kid isnt impersonal i said its a kevorkianesque cry for help such moral outrage yet you are as guilty as i did you not slay paolos child bianca bianca was trying to kill me at the time i said maggie is an innocent she couldnt possibly hurt you then you should have considered that before you insulted me by murdering my grandchild she hissed her voice suddenly tight and cold i am patient wizard more patient than you could imagine and i have looked forward to this day when the consequences of your arrogance shall fall upon both you and all who love you the threat lit a fire in my brain and i thought the anger was going to tear its way free of my chest and go after her without me bitch i spat come get some the horn blew chapter both of us had been gathering up our wills during the snarkoff and the first instant of the duel nearly killed us both i called forth force and fire both laced with the soulfire that would help reinforce its reality making the attack more difficult to negate or withstand it took the shape of a sphere of bluewhite fire the size of an inflatable exercise ball meanwhile arianna fluttered her hands in an odd twisting gesture and a geyser of water erupted from the soil with bonecrushing force the two attacks met halfway between us with results neither of us could prevent fire and water turned to scaldinghot steam in a detonation that instantly washed back over us both my shield bracelet was ready to go and a situation something like this one that had rendered my left hand into a horror prop had inspired me to be sure i could protect myself from this kind of heat in the future i leapt back and landed in a crouch raising the shield into a complete dome around me as the cloud of steam swept down its heat boiling the grass as it came it stayed there for several seconds before beginning to disperse and when it finally did i couldnt see arianna anywhere on the field i kept the allaround shield in place for a moment and rapidly focused upon a point a little bit above and midway between my eyebrows i called up my sight and swept my gaze around the stadium to see arianna forty yards away and running to put herself in position to shoot me in the back a layer of greasy black magic seemed to infest the air around herthe veil that my physical eyes hadnt been able to see to my sight she was a red court vampire in its true form only even more flabby and greasy than the normal vamp a creature ancient in power and darkness i tried not to see anything else but there was only so much i could do i could see the deaths that had been heaped upon this field over centuries lingering in a layer of translucent bones that covered the ground to a depth of three or four feet in the edges of my vision i could see the grotesqueries that were the true appearance of the red court every one of them a unique and hideous monster according to his particular madness i didnt dare look directly up at the spectators and especially not those gathered on the second floor of the little temple at the end of the stadium i didnt want to look at the red king and his lords unveiled i kept my gaze moving as if i hadnt spotted arianna on the prowl and kept turning in a circle timing when my back was going to be exposed to her before i dropped the shield and rose panting as if i couldnt have held it any longer than that i kept on turning and an instant before she would have released her spell i whirled on her pointed a finger and snarled forzare raw will lashed out and exploded against her chest just before the flickers of electricity shed gathered could congeal into a real stroke of lightning it threw her twenty feet back and slammed her against the ancient rock wall along the side of the ball court before she could fall i looked up at the top of the wall seized a section of large stones in fingers of unseen will and raked them out of their resting places so that they plunged thirty feet down toward arianna she was superhumanly quick of course anyone mortal would have been crushed she got away with only a glancing blow from one of the smaller stones and darted to the side rolling a sphere of lurid red light into a ball between her hands as she went i didnt want to be on the receiving end of that whatever it was so i kept raking at the wall over and over again bringing down dozens of the stones and forcing her to keep moving while i ran parallel to her and kept our spacing static we were both slinging magic on the run but she had more oneonone experience than me like a veteran gunslinger in the old west she took her time lining up her shot while i flailed away at her with rushed actions that had little chance to succeed all told i must have dropped several dozen tons of rock down onto her as we ran inflicting nothing worse than a few abrasions and heavy bruises she threw lightning at me once the world flashed redwhite and something hard hit me in the back my legs went wobbly and i sat there for a subjective hour stunned and realized that whatever she had packed her lightning bolt with it had been sufficient to throw me twice as far as my heavy punch had thrown her id bounced off the opposite wall i looked down at myself expecting to see a huge hole with burned edgesand instead found a black smudge on my overdone breastplate and a couple of flaws in the gold filigree where the metal had partially melted i was alive my head came back together in a sudden rush and i knew what was coming i flung up my shield shaping it not into a portion of a sphere as i usually did but into a lengthy triangle in the shape of a pup tent i crouched beneath it and no sooner had i done so than stones from the wall above me torn free by ariannas will began to slam into the shield i crouched there rapidly being buried in grey stone and tried desperately to get my impactdizzied brain to think of a plan the best i came up with under the circumstances was this what would yoda do there was a tiny moment between one rock falling and the next and i dropped the shield as the next rock began to fall i stretched out my hand and my will catching it before gravity could give it much velocity again i screamed forzare and with an enormous effort of will i altered the course of the stones fall flinging it as hard as i could at arianna abetted by gravity and the remnants of her own magic she saw it coming but not until it was too late she lifted her hands her fingers making warding gestures as she brought her own defensive magic to bear the stone smashed through it in a flash of reddish light and then struck her in the hip spinning her about wildly and sending her to the ground harry dresden human catapult i screamed drunkenly arianna was back on her feet again in an instant her shield had bled enough of the energy from the stone to prevent it from smashing into her with lethal force but it had bought me enough time to get out of the pile of rocks around me and away from the stadium wall i smashed at her with more fire and she parried each shaft deftly congealing water out of the air into wobbling spheres that intercepted the bolts of flame and exploded into concealing steam by the fifth or sixth bolt i couldnt see her with my physical eyes but i did see energies in motion behind the steam as she pulled another dark sheath of veiling energy around her and i saw her take off into an animalswift sprint again circling me to attack me from behind no she couldnt be trying the same thing twice duels between wizards are about more than swatting each other with various forms of energy just as boxing is about more than throwing hard punches there is an art to it a science to it in which one attempts to predict the others attack and counter it effectively you have to imagine a counter to what the opponent might do and have it ready to fly at an instants notice similarly you have to imagine your way around the strength of his defenses a duel of magic is determined almost purely by the imaginations and raw power of those involved arianna had obviously prepared against my favorite weaponfirewhich was only intelligent but she had tried this backstabbing ploy on me once before and nearly got burned doing it a wizard of any experience would tell you that she would never have tried that one again for fear that the enemy would exploit it even further arianna was an experienced killer but she hadnt done a lot of dueling with nothing to rely on except her magic shed always had the cushion of her extraordinary strength and speed to fall back upon hell it would have been the smart way to kill mecome straight in shedding attacks and maybe taking some hits to get close enough to end it decisively except here she couldnt and she wasnt adjusting well to the handicap flexibility of thought is almost never a strength of the truly ancient monsters of the world instead of obliging her by standing in place as i had last time shed tried to give me the runaround i darted forward into the edges of the concealing steam i got burned and accepted it as the price of doing business i clenched my teeth focusing past my pain and tracked ariannas energy with my sight waiting for my shot and hoping that she didnt have the sight as well apparently she didnt or wasnt bothering to use it relying upon her superior senses instead she got into position and seemed to realize that id gone into the steam she began to advance cautiously gathering more lightning to her cupped hands i saw the instant in which she began to spot my outline the way she drew a breath to speak the word to unleash the lightning upon me infriga i hissed and threw both hands forward infriga forzare and the entire cloud bank of steam in the air around me congealed into needlepointed spears of ice that flew at her as if fired from a gun they struck her just as she unleashed her lightning bolt which shattered one of the spears and tore a twofoot furrow in the dirt some twenty feet to my side arianna stood still for a moment her black eyes wide with disbelief staring down at the spears and shards of ice that had slammed deep into her flesh she looked up at me for a second and opened her mouth a blob of black blood burst out and spilled down over her chin then she shuddered and fell simply limp to the ground from the far end of the ball court i heard my godmother throw back her head and let out an eerie howl of excitement and triumph bubbling with laughter and scorn i watched arianna twisting upon the spears of ice shed been pierced in dozens of places the worst hit came from an icicle as thick as my forearm which had impaled her through the belly and come out the back bursting the blood reservoir of the creature beneath ariannas flesh mask the pure crystallineclear ice showed a glimpse of her insides as if seen through a prism she gasped a word i didnt recognize again and again i didnt know what language it was but i knew what it meant no no no no i stood over her for a moment she struggled to bring some other form of magic to bear against me but the cruel torment of those frozen spears was a pain she had never experienced and did not know how to fight i stared down at the creature that had taken my daughter and felt i felt only a cold calm satisfaction whirling like a blizzard of snow and sleet in the storm of my wrath she stared up at me with uncomprehending eyes black blood staining her mouth cattle you are ccattle moo i said and i lifted my right hand her eyes widened further she gasped a word i didnt know from the corner of my eye i saw the red king rise from his distant throne i poured all that was left of my fury into my hand and snarled no one touches my little girl the explosion of force and fire tore a crater in the ground seven feet across and half as deep ariannas broken headless corpse lay sprawled within it silence fell over the ruined city i turned toward the red king and started walking that way i stopped on what would have been the tenyard line in a football stadium and faced him now give me my daughter i said he stared at me bleak and remote as a far mountain and then he smiled and said in perfect english i think not i clenched my teeth we had a deal he looked at me with uncaring eyes and said i never spoke a word to you a god does not converse or bargain with cattle he uses and dispenses with them as he sees fit you have served your purpose and i have no further use for youor the mewling child i snarled you promised that she would not be harmed until after the duel he said and sycophantic chuckles ran through the vampires all around me it is after the duel he turned his head to one side and said to one of the jaguar warrior vampires in his retinue go kill the child i almost got the red king while his head was turned but some instinct seemed to warn him at the last instant and he ducked the bolt of flame id hurled at him blew the jaguar warrior vamps jaw off of his head and set him on fire he fell back stumbling and screaming his monstrous form tearing free of his mask of flesh the red king whirled toward me in a fury and those black eyes pressed down upon me with all the crushing weight of the ages i was driven to my knees by a blanket of pure willand not just will but horrible pain pain that originated not in my body but in the nerves themselvespain i was helpless to resist i heard someone shout harry and saw the masked figures upon the temple with the red king step forward a gun went off and then someone screamed i heard a bellow and looked up to see my friends and my godmother facing the masked lords of outer night sanya was on his feet but motionless grimly clutching esperacchius in both hands murphy was on one knee and had dropped her p one hand was moving slowly determinedly toward the sword on her back martin was on the ground i couldnt see any of the others i couldnt turn my head far enough but nobody was up to fighting none of us could move beneath the horrible pressure of will of the red king and the lords of outer night insolent beast snarled the red king die in agony he seized another guard by his jaguar skin and jerked him close as if the brawny vampire had been a child need i repeat myself he seethed and shoved his bloodstained ritual knife into the warriors hands place that child upon the altar and kill her chapter guys like the red king just dont know when to shut up i fought to raise my hand and it was more effort than anything id done that night my hand shook and shook harder but finally moved six inches to touch the surface of the skull in the cloth bag on my hips bob i screamed purely in my head as i would have using ebenezars sending stone hells bells he replied you dont have to scream im right here i need a shield something to ward off his will i figure this is a spiritual attack a spirit should be able to counter it oh sure but no can do from in here boss bob said you have my permission to leave the skull for this purpose i thought desperately the skulls eye sockets flared with orangered light and then a cloud of glowing energy flooded out of the eyes and rose gathering above my head and casting warm light down around me seconds later i heard bob thinking take this shorty and suddenly the red kings will was not enough to keep me down the pain receded smothered and numbed by an exhilarating icy chill that left my nerves tingling with energy i clenched my teeth freed from the burden of pain and thrust my own will against his i was a child arm wrestling a weight lifterbut his last remark gave me some extra measure of strength and suddenly i drove myself to my feet the red king turned to face me fully again and extended both hands toward me his face twisting with rage and contempt the horrible pressure began to swell and redouble i heard his voice quite clearly when he said bow down mortal i took one dragging step toward my friends then another and another and another moving forward with increasing steadiness then i snarled through clenched teeth and said bite me asshole and i put my hand on murphys left shoulder shed already moved her hand halfway to the sword as i touched her touched our auras together spreading my own defenses over hers and felt the direct and violent strength of her own will to defy the immortal power brought against us her hand flashed up to the hilt of fidelacchius and drew the katana from its plain scabbard white light like nothing that ancient stadium had ever seen erupted from the swords blade a bright agony that reminded me intensely of the crystalline plain howls of pain rose from around us but were drowned by murphys sudden silvery cry her voice swelling throughout the stadium and ringing off the vaults of the sky false gods she cried her blue eyes blazing as she stared at the red king and the lords of outer night pretenders usurpers of truth destroyers of faith of families of lives of children for your crimes against the mayans against the peoples of the world now will you answer your time has come face judgment almighty i think i was the only one close enough to see the shock in her eyes and i realized that it wasnt murphy speaking the wordsbut someone else speaking them through her then she swept her sword in an arc slashing the very air in front of us in a single whistling stroke and the will of the red king vanished gone the red king let out a scream and clutched at his eyes he screamed something pointing in murphys direction and in the same instant the rest of my friends gasped and rocked in place suddenly free every golden mask turned toward my friend bob i cried go with her keep her free wahoo the skull said and goldorange light fell from my head toward murphy and gathered about her blond hair even as the joined wills of the lords of outer night fell upon her so thick and heavy that i was knocked away from her as if by a physical force the very air around her warped with its intensity white light from the sword flowed down and over her and her garments literally transformed as if that light had flowed into them become a part of them turning night to day black to white she staggered to one knee and looked up her jaw set in stubborn determination her teeth bared her blue eyes through the distortion blazing like fire in defiance of thirteen dark godsand with one of the most powerful spirits id ever met gathered around her head in a glowing golden halo murphy came to her feet with a shout and a smooth stroke of the sword the lords of outer night all reacted jerking back as if theyd been struck a blow in the face several golden masks were ripped from their faces as if the blow had physically touched themand the molten presence of their joined wills was suddenly gone with a scream the jaguar warriors halfbreed and vampire alike surged toward murphy she ducked the swing of a modern katana shattered a traditional obsidian sword with a contemptuous sweep of fidelacchius and struck down the warrior wielding it with a precise horizontal cut but she was outnumbered not by dozens or scores but by the hundreds and the jaguar warriors immediately fanned out to come at her from several directions they knew how to work together but then so did sanya and i sanya came forward with esperacchius and as it joined the fray it too kindled into blazing white light that seemed to lick out at the vampires forcing them to duck to slap at white sparks that danced in their eyes his booted foot caught one jaguar warrior in the small of the back and the raw power of the kick snapped the warriors head back with force enough to break his neck i followed sanya in unleashing a burst of freezing wind that took two warriors from their feet when they tried to flank murphy from the other side she and sanya went backtoback cutting down jaguar warriors with methodical efficiency for several seconds as more and more of the enemy swarmed toward them i kept slapping them awaynot able to do any real harm but preventing them from focusing overwhelming numbers on murph and sanyabut i could feel the fatigue setting in now i couldnt keep this up forever there were quick footsteps beside me and then molly pressed her back to mine you take that side she said ill take this one dj molly c lifted both of her wands and turned the battle chaos to eleven color and light and screaming sound erupted from those two little wands bands of light and darkness flowed around and over the oncoming jaguar warriors fluttering images of bright sunshine intertwining with other images of yawning pits suddenly gaping before the feet of the attackers bursts of sound shrieks and clashes and booms and highpitched noises like feedback on steroids sent the hyperkeen senses of full vampires into overload literally forcing them back onto the weapons of those coming behind them vampires staggered through the handiwork of the onewoman rave not stopped but slowed and stunned by the incredible field of sound and light i love a good party thomas shouted merrily and he began to dance along the edges of mollys dance floor his falcata whipping into the limbs and necks of the jaguar warriors as they wobbled forward struck down before they could recover i didnt think anyone could have moved fast enough to catch them but my brother evidently didnt agree he struck down the foe as they came for us and he threw in a few dance moves along the way the part he borrowed from break dancing where a wave traveled up one arm and down the other was particularly effective aesthetically when it was bracketed by his falcata beheading one vamp and his automatic blowing apart the skull of another the pressure of numbers increased and thomas started moving more swiftly more desperatelyuntil mouse leapt in to help plug the leak in the dam of confusion that held the full power of the red court at bay i had my own side of the store to mind again i reached into the well of cold ready power and with a word blanketed the field before me in smooth slick ice howling wind rose to greet any foe who stepped out onto the ice forcing them to work around to the killing machine that was sanya and murphy or else circle around to attempt an approach through mollys murderous light and sound show someone touched my arm and i nearly roasted him without looking martin flinched as though hed had a dodge ready to go if i had something for him dresden he called look i looked up on the little temple at the end of the ball court the lords of outer night and the red king were standing in a circle and they were all gathering magical powerprobably from one of the bloody ley lines to boot whatever they were going to do i had a bad feeling that i was reaching the very end of my bag of tricks i heard booted feet and saw the mortal security guards lining up along the sides of the stadium rifles at the ready when they were in position they would open fire and the simple fact was that if they piled enough rounds into us we would go down who was i kidding i couldnt keep the field of ice and wind together for very long and i knew molly couldnt maintain her rave at that intensity for long either dozens of jaguar warriors had fallen but that meant little their numbers had not been diminished by any significant measure we could fight as hard as we wantedbut despite everything in the end it was going to be futile we were never getting out of that stadium but we had to try lea i screamed yes child she asked her tone pleasant and conversational i could still hear her perfectly clearly neat trick the king and his jokers are about to hit us with something big oh my yes the leanansidhe said looking skyward dreamily so do something i howled at her i already am she assured me she removed a small emerald from a pocket of her gown and flung it skyward it sparkled and flashed and flew up out of the light of torches and swords and vanished into the night a few seconds later it exploded in a cloud of merry green sparks there that place will do she said clapping her hands and bouncing up and down on her toes now we shall see a real dance green lightning split the sky erupting with such a burst of thunder that the ground shook instead of fading though the thunder grew louder as more and more strokes of lightning flared out from the area of sky where leas gem had exploded into light then a sheet of a dozen separate green bolts of lightning fell all at the same time onto the ground of the ball court twenty yards away blowing smoking craters in the ground it took my dazzled eyes a few seconds to recover from that and when they did my heart almost stopped standing on the ball court were twelve figures twelve people in shapeless grey robes grey cloaks grey hoods and every single one of them held a wizards staff in one hand the grey council the grey council the nearest figure was considerably shorter than me and stout but he stood with his feet planted as if he intended to move the world he lifted his staff smote it on the ground then boomed remember archangel he spoke a single resonating word as he thrust the tip of the implement at the red king and the lords of outer night the second floor of the stadiumtemple where they stood simply exploded a force hit the ancient structure like an enormous bulldozer blade rushing forward at mach it smashed into the temple stone screamed the red king the lords of outer night and several thousand tons of the temples structure went flying back through the air with enough violent energy to send a shock wave rebounding from the point of impact the massive display of force brought a second of stunned silence to the fieldand i was just as slackjawed as anyone then i threw back my head and let out a primal scream of triumph and glee the grey council had come we were not alone the echo of my scream seemed to be a signal sending the rest of us back to fighting for our lives i blew a few more vampires away from my friends and then sensed a rush of supernatural energy coming at me i turned and caught a tide of ruinous red power upon my shield and hurled a blast of flame back at a red court noble in massive amounts of jewelry others in their ranks began to open up on the newly arrived grey council who responded in kind and the air was filled with a savage crisscross of exchanged energies the stocky figure in grey stumped up to me and said casually how you doing hoss i felt my face stretch into a fierce grin but i answered him just as casually sort of wish id brought a staff with me other than that cant complain from within his hood ebenezar grunted nice outfit thanks i said i liked your ride good mileage as long as theres some carpet to scuff your feet on he said and tossed me his staff here i felt the energies moving through the implement at once it was a bettermade staff than mine but ebenezar had been the one to teach me how they were made and both staves i had used over the years had been carved from branches of the lightningstruck oak in the front yard of his little farm in the ozarks i could make use of this staff almost as well as if it were my own what about you i asked him dont you want it he batted a precisely aimed thrown ax from the air with a flick of his hand and a word of power and drawled i got another one ebenezar mccoy extended his left hand and spoke another word and darkness swirled from the shadows and condensed into a staff of dark twisted wood unmarked by any kind of carving whatsoever the blackstaff fuego shouted someone on the wallsand for a second i was hit with a little sting of insult someone was shouting fuego and it wasnt me while i was feeling irrational pique guns started barking and they aimed at me first bullets rang sharply as they hit my armor rebounding from it and barely leaving a mark it was like getting hit with small hailstones uncomfortable but not really dangerousunless one of them managed a head shot ebenezar turned toward the walls from which the soldiers were firing hits thumped into his robes but seemed to do little but stir the fabric and then fall at his feet the old man said mostly to himself you took the wrong contract boys then he swept the blackstaff from left to right murmured a word and ripped the life from a hundred men they just died there was absolutely nothing to mark their deaths no sign of pain no struggle no convulsion of muscles no reaction at all one moment they were firing wildly down at usand the next they simply dropped dead the old man turned to the other wall and i saw two or three of the brighter soldiers throw their guns down and run i dont know if they made it but the old man swept the blackstaff through the air again and the gunmen on that side of the field dropped dead where they stood my godmother watched it happen and bounced and clapped her hands some more as delighted as a child at the circus i stared for a second shocked ebenezar had just shattered the first law of magic thou shalt not kill he had used magic to directly end the life of another human beingnearly two hundred times i mean yes i had known what his office allowed him to do but there was a big difference between appreciating a fact and seeing that terrible truth in motion the blackstaff itself pulsed and shimmered with shadowy power and i got the sudden sense that the thing was alive that it knew its purpose and wanted nothing more than to be used as often and as spectacularly as possible i also saw veins of venomous black begin to ooze their way over the old mans hand reaching up slowly spreading to his wrist he grimaced and held his left forearm with his right hand for a moment then looked over his shoulder and said all right the farthest grey figure tall and lean lifted his staff i saw light gleam off of metal at one end of the staff and then green lightning enfolded the length of wood as he thrust the metal end into the ground he took the staff backbut the twisting length of green lightning stayed he drove the staff down again about six feet away and again lightning sheathed it then he removed the staff reversed his grip on it and with a sweep of his arm drew another shaft of lightning between the two upright columns of electricity bridging the gap he was opening a way there was a flash of light and the space between the bolts of lightning warped and went darkthen exploded with black figures bearing swords for the first moment i thought that they were wearing odd costumes or maybe weird armor their faces were shaped something like a crows complete with a long yellow beak they were wearing clothes that seemed to be made from feathersand then i got it they actually were beakfaced creatures covered in soft black feathers and carrying swords each and every one of them a japanesestyle katana they poured out of the gate by the score by the hundreds and began to bound forward with unnaturally long leaps that seemed only technically different from flying they looked deadly and beautiful all grace speed and perfection of motion the wild light of the onewoman rave glittered off of their blades and glassy black eyes the kenku owed me a favor ebenezar drawled seemed like a good time to call it in with sharp whistles and wails of fury the strange creatures bounded up out of the ball court and began to engage the red court in numbers it was too much to take in sorcery flew beside bullets on a scale larger than anything id ever seen stone weapons clashed against steel blood flew the black of the vampires the blue of the kenku and mostly flashes of scarlet mortal blood there was too much terror and incongruous beauty in it and i think my head reacted by tuning out everything that wasnt threatening my life or was more than a few yards away maggie i said i grabbed the old mans shoulder ive got to get to her he grimaced and nodded his head where the big temple i said pointing at the pyramid and about four hundred meters north of the temple theres a trailer cattle car i said it was guarded the last time i looked there are human prisoners still in it ebenezar grunted and nodded get the girl well take care of the red court and their night lords the old man spat on the ground his eyes alight with excitement well see how the slimy bastards like eating what theyve been dishing out i gripped his hand hard then put my other one on the old mans shoulder and said thank you his eyes welled up for an instant but he only snorted and squeezed back get your girl hoss the old man winked at me i blinked a few times myself and then turned away time was running outfor maggie and for me chapter godmother i shouted turning toward the pyramid lea appeared at my side her hands now filled with emerald and amethyst lighther own deadly sorcery shall we pursue the quest now yeah stay close well round up the team and move molly was nearest i went to my apprentice and shouted in her ear come on let the birdmen take it from here weve got to move molly gave me a vague nod and finally lowered the little wands as the kenkus charge drove into the red court and took the pressure from our flanks the tips of her wands both of them made of ivory were cracked and chipped her arms hung limply and swung at her sides and she looked even paler now than she had going in she turned to me gave me a quivering smile and then suddenly sank to the ground her eyes rolling back in her head i stared at her in shock for a second and then i was on my knees next to her my amulet glowing as i used its light to check her for injuries in the chaos i hadnt seen that one of her legs at midthigh was a mass of blood one of the wild shots from the security goons had hit her beneath the armored vest she was bleeding out she was dying thomas crashed to the ground next to me he ripped off his belt and whipped it around her leg as a tourniquet ive got this he said looking up at me his expression remote calm go go i stared at him for a second uncertain molly was my apprentice my responsibility he regarded me and his calm mask cracked for a second showing me his tension the fear he was holding in check at the scale of the conflict around us harry he said ill guard her with my life i swear it i nodded and then clenched a fist looking around that much spilled blood would start drawing vampires to the wounded girl like bees to flowers thomas couldnt care for her and fight mouse i called stay with them the dog rushed over to molly and literally stood over her head his eyes and ears everywhere a guardian determined not to fail then i ran to murphy and sanya who both bore small cuts and abrasions and who looked like they were about to charge into the nearest portion of the fray martin tagged along with me apparently calm and by all appearances unaware that he was in the middle of a battle say what i would about martin his blandness his boring demeanor and his noncombative body language were very real armor in this situation he simply didnt look like an important or threatening target and he was untouched i looked around them and picked up a sword that had been dropped by one of the warriors they had killed a simple chinese straight sword known as a jian it was light razorsharp on both edges and suited me just fine were going to the pyramid i called to murphy and sanya a group of thirty or forty kenku went over us witch shadows against the rising moon and entered the fray against the jaguar warriors who still stood between us and an exit from the ball court there i said go go go i suited action to my words and plunged toward the opening ebenezars allies were cutting for us there was a surge of magic and a flash of motion ahead of us as another vampire noble tossed another flare of power at me i caught a small stroke of lightning on my mentors staffit was shorter thicker and heavier than mineconducting the attack down my arm across my shoulder and out the tip of my newly acquired sword the lightning bolt chewed a hole in the belly of the red court noble he staggered as i closed on him i spun the staff to the horizontal and checked him in the nose as i went by dropping him to the ground we went past the remains of the temple and out into the open space between the buildings it was chaos out there jaguar warriors and priest types were everywhere and most of them were armed mortal security folks were forming into teams and racing toward the ball court to reinforce the red court i realized that at some point murphy her clothing shining with white light her halo a blaze of molten gold had begun racing along on my right side with sanya on my left the brilliant light of the two swords was a terror to the vampires and halfbreeds alike and they recoiled from that aura of power and fearbut that wasnt the same thing as retreating they simply fell back while other creatures closed a large circle about us drawing it slowly tighter as we moved toward the pyramid we arent going to make it murphy said theyre getting ready to rush us from all sides always they are doing that sanya said panting his cheerful voice going slightly annoyed never is it anything new they were right i could sense the change in motion of the villains around us how they were retreating more slowly before us pressing in more closely behind us i felt my eyes drawn up to the pyramid aheadand there standing on the fifth level of the pyramid looking down was a figure in a golden mask evidently one of the lords of outer night had been knocked all the way over to the pyramid by ebenezars entrance and i could feel his will at work in the foes around usnot used to overcome an enemy with immobility now but to infuse his troops with confidence and aggression that guy i said nodding at him gold mask we take him down and were through murphy scanned the pyramid until she spotted him then her eyes tracked down to the base of the stairs and she nodded shortly right she said and she raised fidelacchius let out a scream that had startled a great many large men working out at her dojo and plunged into the warriors of the red court like a swimmer breasting a wave sanya blinked holy crap i hadnt meant she should do that tiny sanya said letting out a belly laugh as he began to move but fierce youre all insane i screamed and plunged forward with them while martin backpedaled and tried to keep up with us while simultaneously warding off the vampires closing in from behind murphy did what no mortal should have been able to doshe cut a path through a mob of warrior vampires she went through them as if theyd been no more than a cloud of smoke fidelacchius blazed and no weapon raised against the sword of faith neither modern steel nor living relic could withstand its edge murphy hardly seemed to actually attack anyone she simply moved forward and when attacks came at her bad things happened to whoever had attempted to strike her sword thrusts were slid gently aside while she continued onward her own blade seeming to naturally independently pass through an sshaped slash upon the opponents body on the way through wreaking terrible damage with delicate speed warriors who flung themselves upon her found their hands grabbing nothing their bodies being sent tumbling through the airand that horrible sword of light left wounds in each and every opponent their edges black and sizzling theyd come at her in twos and once three of the jaguar warriors managed to coordinate an attack it didnt do them any good murphy had been handling opponents who were bigger and stronger and faster than her in situations of real danger since she was a rookie cop the vampires and halfbreeds swift and strong as they were seemed no more able to beat her down than had all of those thugs and criminals stronger though her enemies were the blazing light of the sword seemed to slow them to undermine their strengthnot much but enough to make the difference murphy dodged and feinted and tossed warriors into one another using their own strength against them the threeonone she faced almost seemed unfair one of the jaguar warriors armed with an enormous club wound up smashing his two compatriots courtesy of the intern knight only to find his club sliced into three pieces that wound up on the ground next to his own severed leg karrin murphy led the charge and sanya and i tried to keep up she went through that sea of foes like a little speedboat her enemies spun and tossed and turned and disoriented in her wake sanya and i hacked our way through stunned foes pushing and chopping with unsophisticated brutalityand that big russian lunatic just kept laughing the whole time we hit the stairs and resistance thinned sharply murphy surged ahead and the lord of outer night raised a bejeweled hand against her his sheer will causing the air to ripple and thicken sanya and i hit it like a brick wall and staggered to a halt but it seemed to slide off of murphy as had every other attack to come at her her halo burning still brighter panicked the enemy raised a hand and sent three shafts of sorcerous power howling at her one right after another murphys feet sure and swift on the stairs carried her into a version of a boxers bobbing dance and each shaft went blazing uselessly past her sanya yelped and dropped dodging the bolt that nearly clobbered him i blocked one on my shield and took the other in the shin my godmothers armor protected my flesh but i hit the stone stairs of the pyramid pretty hard i jerked my eyes up in time to see murphy rush the lord of outer night and speed straight past him her sword sweeping up in a single upward vertical slash the gold mask fell from the vampires headalong with the front half of its skull silver fire burned at the revealed twisted lumpy lobes of the vampires brain and as its blood flowed out and touched that fire it went up in a sudden pyre of silverwhite flame the lord of outer night somehow managed to scream as fire consumed it and flung more bursts of magic blindly and in all directions for several more seconds until it finally fell into blackened ash and ugly smears on the stone only then did the barrier of its will vanish and sanya martin and i hustled up the stairs toward the temple still the enemy pursued usthere were so damned many of them and as i gained more height i was able to look back and see that the red court had begun to contain the kenku incursion the battle was still furiously under way within the ball court and though the feathered warriors were the match of any two or three vampires or halfbreeds the enemy had numbers to spare i could only be grateful that so many of their spellslingers were duking it out with the grey council instead of getting in our way dammit i said looking up the steps toward the temple at their summit shadows moved inside dammit i looked around me wildly and suddenly felt a hand grasp mine where i clutched my staff murphy shook my hand until i looked at her sanya and i will stay here she said panting well hold them until you get maggie i looked down the slope of the pyramid hundreds of the red court were coming up and they were tearing free of their flesh masks now revealing the monsters beneath hold them it would be suicide the swords gave their wielders immense power against things out of nightmares but it didnt make them superhuman murphy and sanya had both been fighting for twenty minutesand there is no aerobic exercise that compares with the physical demands of combat both of them were breathing hard growing tired suicide but i needed to get up there dresden martin called come on i hadnt even realized he was shaking me trying to get me up the stairs i guess i was getting pretty tired too i narrowed my focus to martin to the stairs up and tried to ignore the burning in my arms my legs my chest i drew in a sharp breath and it was like inhaling sudden cool clean wind i thought i heard someone whispering to me something in a tongue i didnt understandbut i knew my queens voice i became aware that a cloud of white mist and vapor was gathering around me as i continued a little faster the humid air of the yucatán boiling around the frost that had formed on my armor then the cold washed away the hot fatigue and i felt the ice flowing into me implacable merciless relentless my legs began to churn like the pistons of an engine suddenly one step per stride simply wasnt enough and i started flying up them two at a time rapidly leaving martin behind i reached the top and a halfbreed jaguar warrior flung himself toward me i snarled batted his sword aside with mine and lashed out with one foot landing a stomping kick in the center of his chest his sternum cracked audibly and he flew backward as if rammed by a truck he hit the stone wall behind him hard enough to shake dust from the roof overhead and crumpled like a broken toy which was exactly the kind of power the winter knight was supposed to have and as i watched the poor idiot drop i felt nothing but satisfaction the square temple had four doorways one on each side and in the one to my immediate right a vampire torn free of its flesh mask appeared a jaguar skin still draped over its shoulders it clutched an obsidian knife in its handthe red kings dagger it was the vamp hed dispatched to kill maggie fog of war huh i asked him and felt myself smiling buddy did you ever walk through the wrong door at the wrong time its eyes flicked to the floor to my left for an instant and i looked too maggie crouched there directly between the altar and the door on my left chained and shivering huddling low to the ground as if hoping to be overlooked go on i said looking back at the vampire i bounced the sword in my hand lightly white mist poured off the blade so did a few snowflakes go for it tough guy take one step toward that girl and see what happens the door opposite me suddenly darkened the red king and no fewer than four of his lords stood there gold masks shining throwing back weird reflections from the dazzling array of flickering lights and fires in the darkness outside his face twisted with rage and his will and the wills of the lords behind him fell upon me like blows from individual sledgehammers i staggered planted my mentors staff firmly on the stone floor and barely kept myself from being driven to the ground now the red king said his voice strangled with fury put that little bitch on the altar one of the lords stepped forward and bent down to seize the child by her hair maggie screamed no i shouted the red king went to the altar and kicked the corpse of the dead woman from it mortal he spat still so certain that his will matters but you are nothing a wisp a shadow here and then gone forgotten it is fated it is the way of the universe he jerked the ritual knife from the hands of the warrior and glared at me his true nature writhing and twisting beneath his skin the lord dragged the shackled screaming child to the altar and the red kings black eyes gleamed this is your only role mortal he said your only grace the only thing you are truly meant to do he stared at maggie and bared his teeth all long fangs slaver running out of his mouth and down over his chin die chapter the red king raised the knife over my daughter and she let out a quavering little scream a helpless hopeless wail of terror and despairand as hard as i fought with the new strength given me by queen mab with the protection granted by my godmothers armor i could not do a damned thing about it i didnt have to white light erupted over the altar from no visible source and the red king let out a scream the shackles of his will vanished even as his right hand the one holding the stone knife leapt off of his arm and went spinning through the air it fell to the stone floor still clutched hard around the leatherwrapped hilt of the knife and the obsidian blade shattered like a dropped dish i let out a shout as i felt the red kings will slip off of me the others still held me in place but i suddenly knew that i could move knew that i could fight as the red king reeled back screaming i lifted a hand snarled fuego and sent a wash of fire to my right engulfing the jaguar warrior who still stood a couple of feet inside the doorway he tried to flee and only wound up screaming and falling down the deadly steep steps of the pyramid while the soulfire lacing my spell found his flesh and set it aflame i whirled back to the lords facing me from the far side of the altar i couldnt have risked throwing destructive energy at them with my daughter lying on the altar between us and id had no choice but to take out the immediate threat of the warrior so that i could focus on the lords and the red kingotherwise it would have been relatively simple for him to come over and cut my throat while i was engaged by the vampire elite but two could play at that gameand my physical backup was a hell of a lot better than theirs i drew in my own will and lifted my borrowed staffand as i did four more beings in golden masks entered the temple where did all these yoyos come from hold the wizard snarled the red king and the pressure of hostile minds upon me abruptly doubled my left arm shook and the staff i held in it slowly sank down my right arm just ran out of gas as if the muscles in it had become totally exhausted and the tip of the sword clinked as it hit the stone floor the red king rose and stared for a moment at the altar and at the column of shimmering light over it as he did his freaking hand began to writhe like a spiderand a second later it flipped itself over and began to crawl back over toward him the king just stood there staring at the light i tried to fight my way out of the mass of dark will directed against me the light could only be susan veiled behind the leanansidhes handiwork and wielding amoracchius i mean how many invisible sources of holy light interested in protecting my daughter could there be running around chichén itzá she hadnt attacked yet instead standing over maggiei wanted to scream at her to take him that it was her only chance if she didnt the red king and his lords could take her out almost as swiftly and easily as i had the jaguar warrior but he didntand in a flash of insight i understood why he didnt he didnt know what the light was he knew only that it had hurt him when he had tried to murder the child from his perspective it could have been almost anythingan archangel standing guard or a spirit of light as terrible as the ick had been foul i thought back to the voice coming from murphys mouth pronouncing judgment upon the red court and suddenly understood what was making the red king hesitate what he was really thinking that the entity over the altar might be something he did not think actually existedlike maybe the real kukulcan and he was afraid susan couldnt do anything if she acted if she revealed what she was the enemys uncertainty would vanish and the conflict would immediately ensue again outnumbered so heavily she wouldnt have a chance but she knew what she had in uncertainty and fear and she neither moved nor made a sound it was a weapon as potent as the wills of the demigods themselvesit had after all paralyzed the red king but it was a fragile weapon a sword made of glass and i felt my eyes drawn to the broken pieces of obsidian on the floor i couldnt moveand time was not our ally with every moment that passed the more numerous enemy would become more organized recover more from the shock of the sudden invasion of a small army smack in the middle of their holiday celebration i needed an opportunity a moment if i was going to get maggie out of this mess and i needed it soon i strained against the wills of the lords of outer night unable to moveand keeping their attention locked upon me one by one my gaze traveled over each of the golden masks i focused on the last one for a time then began again with the first tried to test each individual will to find out which would be the weakest point of attack when my moment came just then martin ghosted into the temple through the fourth door making absolutely no sound and it looked to me like the moment was freaking nigh all of the lords present were focused on me the red king stood intently distracted by susans light show while his severed hand crawled its way up his leg and hopped over to his wounded arm where rubbery tendrils of black ooze immediately extruded from whole and wounded flesh alike and began intertwining martin had walked into what had to be a fellowship operatives wet dream the red kings naked back and no one to stop him from going medieval on the leader of the vile edifice of power and terror that was the red court he took the machete from its sheath without a whisper of steel on nylon and drew back readying himself to strike there was an intensity of focus in his face that i had never seen before he closed the last two steps in a superquick blur went into a spin and i was getting ready to cheer when his foot swept up to streak savagely through the air beneath the glowing white light i heard susan let out a cry as she fell startled by the blow martin moving with his eyes closed got close to her his arms lashing out and caught something between them he ripped hard with his left arm twisting the machete up with the right as he didand suddenly susan was fully visible bowed into a painful arch by martins grip on her the feather cloak had fallen from her and the blade of martins machete rested against her throat i screamed in rage it came out as a sort of vocalized seethe the red king took a swift step back as martin attacked his eyes intent then when susan appeared his head tilted as he worked through what he was seeing please excuse me my lord martin murmured giving a slight bow of his head to the red king drop it he said in a flat voice to susan he twisted his body more bending her painfully and pressing the machetes edge against her throat even harder until susans fingers opened and amoracchius fell to the floor its light slowly dying a trick said the red king anger began to pour off of him a charlatans trick his eyes moved from susan up to martin and you have revealed yourself i beg your forgiveness my lord martin said it seemed the proper time on my initiative strike teams began removing fellowship personnel and safe houses two hours ago by this time tomorrow there wont be an operative left alive south of the united states and our financial division will have taken or destroyed well over ninety percent of their accounts you son of a bitch susan said her voice overflowing with pain you fucking traitor martins expression flickered at her words but his eyes never left the red king i give you the fellowship of st giles my lord he said and i beg you to grant me my reward reward susan said loading more contempt and hate into the word than should have been possible what could they possibly give you martin to make it worth what youve done the red king stared at susan and said explain it to her you misunderstand martin said calmly i have not betrayed the fellowship susan this was the plan from the moment i joined it think youve known me for less than a decade and youve seen how near some of our scrapes have been did you truly believe i had survived a hundred and fifty years of battle against the red court outlived every other operative ever to serve the fellowship on my own merits he shook his head no escapes were provided as were targets it took me fifty years and i had to personally kill two of my fellows and friends working much as i was to win the trust of the fellowship once they admitted me to the inner circle their time had come trust is a poison susan it took another century to ferret out their secrets but it is finally done and our people will finish removing the fellowship in every meaningful sense by tomorrow it is over susans eyes flickered over to me and maggie continued to weep quietly huddling in on herself susans face was twisted with pain there were furious tears in her eyes as she looked at me and i couldnt even speak to her and what do you get susan asked her voice shaking ascension said the red king i have no interest in admitting bloodthirsty lunatics to the nobility of my court martin has proven himselfhis dedication his selfcontrol and most important his competence over the course of decades he was a priest for fifty years before he was even permitted to attempt this service honestly susan martin said i told you many times that you can never let emotion interfere with your duties if you had listened to me im certain you would have caught on i would have been forced to kill you as i have several others who were too wise for their own good but you would have known susan closed her eyes she was shaking of course you could make contact as often as you wished every time i visited maggie correct he said quietly he turned back to the red king my lord i beg your forgiveness i sought only to give you that which you wished and the timing made it necessary for me to act or see the opportunity pass us by under the circumstances i think i will not object priest the red king said if the strike teams are as successful as you predict you will have your reward and my gratitude martin bowed his head to the red king and then looked up at me he studied my face for a moment before he said the wizard has alamayas dagger in his sash my lord should you wish to complete the ritual the red king took a deep breath and then blew it out his expression becoming almost benevolent martin martin the voice of practicality weve been lost without you my lord is too kind martin said please accept my condolences on the loss of arianna my lord she was a remarkable woman remarkably ambitious the red king said determined to cling to the past rather than exploring new opportunities she and her entire coterie determined to undermine me had she destroyed this animal and then made good upon her promise to break the back of the accursed white council she would have been a real threat to my power i take no pleasure in thinking on it but her death was meant to be as you say my lord martin said the red king approached me smiling and reached for the dagger in my sash susan bared her teeth still straining but martin was more than her equal it seemed there was nothing i could do the deck had been stacked so hard against me that even with martin on our side things had looked grim his treachery had come at the ideal moment damn him damn them all there was nothing i could long ago when i was little more than a child my first lover and i had devised a spell to let us speak silently to each other in class it was magic much like the speaking stone ebenezar had crafted but simpler with a much shorter range i had never used to it communicate with anyone but elaine but susan had been intimate with meand i thought that at that moment the only thought on our minds was maggie it might be enough to establish the link even if it was only oneway i grasped for the minor magic fighting to pull it together through the dragging chains of the wills of the lords of outer night and cast my thought at susan as clearly as i could he doesnt know all of it i sent to her desperately he doesnt know about the enchantment protecting your skin he only knows about the cloak because he saw you use it when we got here susans eyes widened briefly shed heard me the altar i thought the ritual meant to kill us can be turned back upon them if one of them dies on that knife the curse will go after their bloodline not ours her eyes widened more i saw her thinking furiously martin she asked quietly why did arianna target my daughter martin looked down at susan at maggie and then away because the childs father is the son of margaret lefay the daughter of the man who killed her husband by killing her this way she would avenge herself upon all of you if i hadnt already been more or less motionless i would have frozen in place margaret lefay daughter of the man who had killed ariannas husband and vampire child paolo ortega duke ortega who had been destroyed by the blackstaff ebenezar mccoy one of the most dangerous wizards in the world a man of such personal and political power that she would never have been able to take him down directly so she had set out to strike at him through his bloodline from him to my mother from her to me from me to maggie kill the child and kill us all that was what arianna had meant when she said it wasnt about me it was about my grandfather suddenly it made sense that the old man had put his life on the line by declaring himself my mentor when the council would have killed me for slaying justin dumorne suddenly it made sense why he had been so patient with me so considerate so kind it hadnt just been an act of random kindness and suddenly it made sense why he would barely ever speak of his apprentice margaret lefaya name shed earned for herself when her birth certificate must have read margaret mccoy hell for that matter he probably never told the council that margaret was his daughter i sure as hell had no intentions of letting them know about maggie if i got her out of this mess my mother had eventually been killed by enemies she had madeand ebenezar her father the most dangerous man on the white council had not been there to save her the circumstances wouldnt matter no matter what hed accomplished i knew the old man would never forgive himself for not saving his daughters life any more than i would if i failed maggie it was why he had made a statement a demonstration of what would happen to those who came at me with a personal vengeancehe was trying preemptively to save his grandson and it explained why he had changed the grey councils focus and led them here he had to try to save meand to save my little girl and some cynical portion of me added himself though i wasnt even sure that would be a conscious thought on his part underneath the mountain of issues he had accrued no wonder arianna had been so hot and bothered to use the bloodline curse starting with maggie shed avenge herself upon me who hadnt had the good grace to die in a duel and upon ebenezar who had simply killed ortega as you would a dangerous animal a workaday murder performed with expedience and an extremely high profile arianna must have lost a lot of face in the wake of thatand my ongoing exploits against the reds and their allies would only have made her more determined to show me my place with a single curse shed kill one of the senior council and the blackstaff all at once my death would be something to crow about toosince as arianna herself had noted no one had pulled it off yetand i felt i could confidently lay claim to the title of most infamous warden on the council after donald morgans death for arianna what a coup and after that presumably a coup of course if the red king was holding the knife he got the best of all worlds dead enemies more prestige and a more secure throne nobrainer he took the knife from my belt smiling and turned toward the altarand my daughter dear god i thought think dresden think one day i hope god will forgive me for giving birth to the idea that came next because i never will i knew how angry she was i knew how afraid she was her child was about to die only inches beyond her reach and what i did to her was as good as murder i focused my thoughts and sent them to susan susan think who knew who the babys father was who could have told them her lips peeled away from her teeth his knife cant hurt you i thought though i knew damned well that no faerie magic could blithely ignore the touch of steel martin susan said her voice low and very quiet did you tell them about maggie he closed his eyes but his voice was steady yes susan rodriguez lost her mind one instant she was a prisoner and the next she had twisted like an eel too swiftly to be easily seen martins machete opened up a long cut on her throat but she paid as little attention to it as a thorn scratch gained while hiking martin raised a hand to block the strike he thought was comingand it was useless because susan didnt go after him swinging instead her eyes full of darkness and rage her mouth opened in a scream that showed her extended fangs she went for his throat martins eyes were on mine for a fraction of a second no more but i felt the soulgaze begin i saw his agony the pain of the mortal life he had lost i saw his years of service his genuine devotion like a marble statue of the red king kept polished and lovingly tended and i saw his soul change i saw that image of worship grow tarnished as he spent year after year among those who struggled against the red king and his empire of terror and misery and i saw that when he had come into the temple he knew full well that he wasnt going to survive and that he was content with it there was nothing i could do in time to prevent what was coming next and i wasnt sure i wanted to martin said that it had taken him years and years to run a con on the fellowship of st giles but it had taken him most of two centuries to run the long con on the red king as a former priest martin must have known of the bloodline curse and its potential for destruction he must have known that the threat to maggie and the realization of his betrayal would be certain to drive susan out of control hed told me already practically the moment he had come to chicago that he would do anything if it meant damaging the red court he would have shot me in the back he would have betrayed maggies existence practically handing her to the murderous bastards he would betray the fellowship to its enemies he would destroy susan and he would die himself everything he had done i realized he had done for one reason to be sure that i was standing here when it happened to give me a chance to change everything susan rode him to the stone floor berserk with terror and rage and tore out his throat ripping mouthful after mouthful of flesh from his neck with supernatural speed martin died susan began to turn and that was my moment i flung myself against the wills of the lords of outer night with everything in my body my heart my mind i hurled my fear and my loneliness my love and my respect my rage and my pain i made of my thoughts a hammer infused with the fires of creation and tempered in the icy power of the darkest guardian the earth had ever known i raised my arms with a scream of defiance bringing as much of the armor as i could between my head and theirs and wished for a fleeting second that i had just worn the stupid hat and i threw it all at the second lord from the leftthe one whose will seemed the least concrete he staggered and made a sound that id once heard from a boxer whod taken an uppercut to the nuts with that the last lord of outer night to enter the templethe one wearing the mask i had seen once before when murphy had sliced it from its owners headraised her hands and sent ribbons of green and amethyst power scything through her apparent compatriots the blast killed two of them outright with spectacular violence tearing their bodies to godawful shreds and spattering the inside of the temple with black blood all of the remaining lords staggered screaming in surprise and pain their true forms beginning to claw their way free of the flesh that contained them my godmother too discarded her disguise flinging the gold mask at the nearest lord as she allowed the illusion that concealed her true form to fade away taking with it the clothes and trappings that had let her insinuate herself among the enemy her eyes were bright her cheeks flushed bloodlust and an eager nearly sexual desire to destroy radiated from her like heat from a fire she howled her glee and began hurling streaks and bolts and webworks of energy at the stunned lords of outer night spinning power from her flickering fingertips even as they brought the force of their wills and their own sorcery to bear upon her not one of the lords of outer night remembered to keep me down i was suddenly free i hurled myself at the red kings back with a scream and saw him spin to face me knife in hand his dark eyes suddenly widened and the awful power of his will descended upon me like a dozen leaded blankets i staggered but i did not stop i was hysterical i was not well i was invincible my armor and my grandfathers staff and the sight of my frightened child and the cold power flowing through my limbs allowed me to push forward one step and another and another until i stood nearly toetotoe with him the red kings restored right hand snapped forward to bury the obsidian knife in my throat my left hand dropped the staff and intercepted his wrist i stopped the knife an inch from my throat and his eyes widened as he felt my strength his left hand shot out to clench my throat with crushing power i formed the thumb and forefinger of my right hand into a cshape ice crackling as it spread over them rigid and crystal clear i plunged them into both of his black black eyes and then i sent my will coursing down my arm along with all the soulfire i could find as i screamed fuego fire seared and split and cooked and steamed and the king of the red court the most ancient vampire of their kind the father and creator of their race screamed in anguish the sound was so loud that it blew out my left eardrum a novel new agony for my collection and when the red king screamed every single member of his court screamed with him this close to him i could almost feel it feel the power of his will calling them drawing vampires to him with a summoning beyond selfinterest beyond reason but even if i hadnt been there touching him the sudden storm of cries from outside would have told me the same story the vampires were coming toward us in a swarm a storm and nothing on earth would stop them from going to their kings aid his grip on my throat faltered and he staggered back and away from me my fingers came free of his head and i grabbed his knife hand at the wrist with both hands then screaming in rage coating his arm with frost i snapped his forearm in halfand caught the dagger before it could fall to the floor freed the red king staggered away and even blinded and in sanitydestroying pain he was dangerous his will unleashed at random blew holes in the stone walls sorcery lashed out the scarlet lightning that seemed to be a motif around here raking over one of his own lords and cutting the struggling vampire in half the eldest vampire of the red court screamed in his agony as a tide of his creatures came to obliterate us and the youngest vampire of the red court knelt on the ground over martin staring at her hands i watched for a second as the skin around her fingers seemed to burst at the tips then i saw her fingers begin to lengthen nails growing into claws muscle tissue tearing free of skin with audible obvious torment susan stared at them with her allblack eyes shaking her head her face a mask of blood she was moaning shuddering susan i said kneeling down in front of her the howl of sorcerous energies filled the temple with a symphony of destruction i took her face in my hands she looked up at me terrified and tortured despair written over her face theyre coming she rasped i can feel them inside outside theyre coming oh god susan i shouted remember maggie her eyes seemed to focus on me they wanted maggie because she was the youngest i said my voice cold because her death would have taken us all with her she contorted around her stomach which was twisting and flexing and swelling obscenely but she kept her eyes on my face now youre the youngest i hissed at her my voice fierce the youngest vampire in the entire and literally damned court you can kill them all she shuddered and moaned and i saw the conflicting desires at war within her but her eyes turned to maggie and she clenched her jaw i i dont think i can do it i cant feel my hands harry screamed murphy desperately from somewhere nearby theyre coming lightning split the air outside with thunder that would register on the richter scale there was a sudden random lull in the cacophony of sorcerous war no more than a couple of seconds long susan looked back at me her eyes streaming her last tears harry help me she whispered save her please everything in me screamed no that this was not fair that i should not have to do this that no one should ever have to do this but i had no choice i found myself picking susan up with one hand the little girl was curled into a ball with her eyes closed and there was no time i pushed her from the altar as gently as i could and let her fall to the floor where she might be a little safer from the wild energies surging through the temple i put susan on the altar and said shell be safe i promise she nodded at me her body jerking and twisting in convulsions forcing moans of pain from her lips she looked terrified but she nodded i put my left hand over her eyes i pressed my mouth to hers swiftly gently tasting the blood and her tears and mine i saw her lips form the word maggie and i i used the knife i saved a child i won a war god forgive me chapter everything changed the night the red court died it made the history books first for the unexplained destruction of several structures in chichén itzá a thousand years of jungle hadnt managed to bring the place down but half an hour of slugfest between practitioners who know what theyre doing can leave city blocks in ruins it was later attributed to an extremely powerful localized earthquake no one could explain all the corpsessome of them with dental work featuring techniques last used a hundred years before some whose hearts had been violently torn from their chests and whose bodies had been affected by some kind of mutation that had rendered their bones almost unrecognizable as human fewer than percent of them were ever identifiedand those were all people who had abruptly gone missing in the past ten or fifteen years no explanation was ever offered for such a confluence of missing persons though theories abounded none of them true i could have screamed the truth from the mountaintops and blended right in with all the rest of the nuts everyone knows that vampires arent real second it made the books because of all the sudden disappearances or apparent outright murders of important officials businessmen and financiers in cities and governments throughout latin america the drug cartels took the rap for that one even in the nations where they werent really strong enough to pull such tactics off martial law got declared virtually everywhere south of texas and a dozen revolutions in eight or ten different countries all kicked off seemingly on the same night ive heard that nature abhors a vacuumthough if thats true then i cant figure why about ninetynine zillion percent of creation is vacuum but i do know that governments hate em and always rush to fill them up so do criminals which probably tells you more about human beings than it does about nature most of the nations in south america proper kept their balance central america turned into a war zone with various interests fighting to claim the territory the vampires had left behind them finally it made the books in the supernatural community as the night of bad dreams before the next sunset the paranet was buzzing with activity with men and women scattered over half the world communicating about the vivid and troubling dreams theyd had pregnant women and mothers who had recently delivered had been hardest hit several had to be hospitalized and sedated but everyone with a smidge of talent who was sleeping at the time was troubled by dreams the general theme was always the same dead children the world in flames terror and death spreading across the globe in an unstoppable wave destroying anything resembling order or civilization i dont remember what happened when the ritual went off theres a blank spot in my head about two minutes wide i had no desire whatsoever to find out what was there the next thing i remember is standing outside the temple with maggie in my arms wrapped up in the heavy feather cloak her mother had left behind she was still shivering and crying quietly but only in sheer reaction and weariness now rather than terror the shackles lay broken on the ground behind me i dont remember how i got them off her without hurting her she leaned against me using a fold of the cloak as a pillow and i sat down on the top step holding her to see what i had paid for the red court was dead gone every one of them most of the remains were little more than black sludge that i thought marked the dead vampires the halfbreeds though only lost the vampire parts of their nature the curse had cured them of course it was the vampire inside them that had kept them young and beautiful i saw hundreds of people on the ground aging a year for every one of my breaths i watched them wither away to nothing for the most part it seemed that halfbreeds came in a couple of flavorsthose who had managed to discipline their thirst for blood and thus carried on for centuries and those who had not been halfvampires for very long very few of the latter had ranked in the red kings court it turned out that most of the young half vampires had been working for the fellowship and many had already been killed by the redsbut i heard later that more than two hundred others had been freed from their curse but for me it wouldnt matter how many id freed in that instant of choice no matter how high the number it would need to be plus one to be square in my book inevitably the red court had contained a few newbies and after the ritual went off they were merely human again they and the other humans too dim to run any sooner didnt last long once the grey council broke open the cattle car and freed the prisoners the terror the reds had inflicted on their victims became rage and the deaths the reds and their retainers suffered as a result werent pretty ones i saw a matronly woman who was all alone beat alamaya to death with a rock i didnt get involved id had enough for one day i sat and i rocked my daughter until she fell asleep against me my godmother came to sit beside me her gown singed and spattered with blood a contented smile upon her face people talked to me i ignored them they didnt push i think lea was warning them off ebenezar still bearing the blackstaff in his left hand came to me sometime later he looked at the leanansidhe and said family business please excuse us she smirked at him and inclined her head then she stood up and drifted away ebenezar sat down next to me on the eastern steps of the temple of kukulcan and stared out at the jungle around us beneath us dawns about here he said i looked he was right locals stay hidden in their houses until sunrise around here red court would meet here sometimes induct new nobility and so on survival trait yeah i said it was like that a lot especially in nations that didnt have a ton of international respect something weird happens in mexico twenty million people can say that they saw it and no one cares sun comes up theyll be out theyll call authorities people will ask questions i listened to his statements and didnt disagree with any of them after a moment i realized that they were connected to a line of thought and i said its time to go aye soon ebenezar said you never told me sir i said he was quiet for a long moment then he said ive done things in my life hoss bad things ive made enemies i didnt want you to have them too he sighed at least not until you were ready he looked around at the remains of the red court reckon you more or less are i thought about that while the sky grew lighter then i said how did arianna know ebenezar shook his head a dinner maggiemy maggieasked me to a dinner shed just taken up with that raith bastard arianna was there maggie didnt warn me they had some scheme they wanted my support on the vampires thought i was just maggies mentor then he sighed i wanted nothing to do with it said she shouldnt want it either and we fought i grunted fought like family yes he said raith missed it hes never had any family that was sane arianna saw it filed it away for future reference is everything in the open now i asked everythings never in the open son he responded therere things we keep hidden from one another things we hide from ourselves things that are kept hidden from us and things no one knows you always learn the damnedest things at the worst possible times or thats been my experience i nodded sergeant murphy told me what happened i felt my neck tense she saw it he nodded reckon so hell of a hard thing to do it wasnt hard i said quietly just cold oh hoss he said there was more compassion in the words than youd think would fit there figures in grey gathered at the bottom of the stairs ebenezar eyed them with a scowl time for me to go looks like i nudged my brain and looked down at them you brought them here for me not so much he said he nodded at the sleeping child for her what about the white council theyll get things sorted out soon he said amazing how things fell apart just long enough for them to sit them out with cristos running it aye hes black council i said or maybe stupid ebenezar countered i thought about it not sure which is scarier ebenezar blinked at me then snorted stupid hoss every time only so many blackhearted villains in the world and they only get uppity on occasion stupids everywhere every day howd lea arrange a signal with you i asked that ebenezar said sourly on that score hoss i think our elders ran their own game on us elders he nodded down the stairs where the tall figure with the metalheaded staff had begun creating another doorway out of green lightning once it was formed the space beneath the arch shimmered and all the hooded figures at the bottom of the stairs looked up at us i frowned and looked closer then i realized that the metal head of the staff was a blade and that the tall man was holding a spear within the hood i saw a black eye patch a grizzled beard and a brief grim smile he raised the spear to me in a motion that reminded me somehow of a fencers salute then he turned and vanished into the gate one by one the other figures in grey began to follow him vadderung i said ebenezar grunted thats his name this time he doesnt throw in often when he does he goes to the wall and in my experience it means things are about to get bad he pursed his lips he doesnt give recognition like that lightly hoss i talked to him a couple of days ago i said he told me about the curse put the gun in my hand for me and showed me where to point it ebenezar nodded he taught merlin you know the original merlin howd merlin make out i asked no ones sure ebenezar said but from his journals he wasnt the kind to go in his sleep i snorted the old man stood and used his right hand to pull his hood up over his face he paused and then looked at me i wont lecture you about mab boy ive made bargains myself sometimes he twitched his left hand which was still lined with black veins though not as much as it had been hours before we do what we think we must to protect who we can yeah i said she might lean on you pretty hard try to put you into a box you dont want to be in but dont let her she cant take away your will even if she can make it seem that way he sighed again but there was bedrock in his voice thats the one thing all these dark beings and powers cant do take away your ability to choose they can kill you they can make you do thingsbut they cant make you choose to do em they almost always try to lie to you about that dont fall for it i wont i said i looked up at him and said thank you grandfather he wrinkled up his nose ouch that doesnt fit grampa i said gramps he put his hand against his chest i smiled a little sir he nodded at the child what will you do with her what i see fit i said but gently maybe its better if you dont know both pain and faintly amused resignation showed in his face maybe it is see you soon hoss he got halfway down the stairs before i said sir do you want your staff he nodded at me you keep it until i can get you a new blank i nodded back at him then i said i dont know what to say his eyes wrinkled up even more heavily at the corners hell hoss then dont say anything he turned and called over his shoulder you get in less trouble that way my grandfather kept going down the stairs walking with quick sure strides he vanished through the doorway of lightning i heard steps behind me and turned to find murphy standing in the entrance of the temple fidelacchius rode over one shoulder and her p hung from its strap on the other she looked tired her hair was all coming out of its ponytail strands hanging here and there she studied my face smiled slightly and came down to where i sat hey she said her voice hushed you back i guess i am sanya was worried she said with a little roll of her eyes oh i said well tell him not to worry im still here she nodded and stepped closer so this is her i nodded and looked down at the sleeping little girl her cheeks were pink i couldnt talk shes beautiful murphy said like her mother i nodded and rolled one tired and complaining shoulder she is do you want someone else to take her for a minute my arms tightened on the child and i felt myself turn a little away from her okay murphy said gently raising her hands okay i swallowed and realized that i was parched starving and more than anything i was weary desperately desolately tired and the prospect of sleep was terrifying i turned to look at murphy and saw the pain on her face as she watched me karrin i said im tired i looked down at the child a sleepy warm little presence who had simply accepted what meager shelter and comfort i had been able to offer and i thought my heart would break break more because i knew that i couldnt be what she needed that i could never give her what she had to have to stand a chance of growing up strong and sane and happy because i had made a deal if i hadnt done it shed be deadbut because i had i couldnt be what she deserved to have never looking away from the little girls face i whispered will you do me a favor yes karrin said such a simple word to have so much reassuring mass my throat tightened and my vision blurred it took me two tries to speak please take her to father forthill when we get bback i said ttell him that she needs to disappear the safest place he has that i my voice failed i took deep breaths and said and i dont need to know where ttell him that for me i turned to murphy and said please she looked at me as if her heart were breaking but she had a soul of steel of strength and her eyes were steady and direct yes i bit my lip and very carefully i passed my little girl over into her arms murphy took her and didnt comment about the weight but then she wouldnt god i said not two full seconds later molly where is she murphy looked up at me as she settled down to hold the child the girl murmured a sleepy complaint and murphy rocked her gently to soothe her back to sleep wow you were really out of it you didnt see the helicopter i raked through my memories of the night um no after she glanced at me and then away after she said more firmly thomas found a landline and made a call and a navy helicopter landed right out there on the lawn less than an hour later lifted him molly and mouse right out mouse murphy snorted gently no one was willing to tell him he couldnt go with molly he takes his work seriously i said apparently do we know anything i asked not yet murphy said sanyas manning the phone in the visitors center we gave thomas the number before he left be honest sergeant murphy the leanansidhe said quietly as she glided back over to me you gave the dog the number murphy eyed her then looked at me and said defensively thomas seemed to have enough on his mind already i frowned not like that murphy said sternly ugh i wouldnt have let him go with her if hed seemed all weird yeah i said yeah mouse wouldnt have either would he he was in no danger of losing control my godmother said calmly i would never let such a promising prospect be accidentally devoured sanya appeared jogging around the lower end of the pyramid from its far side esperacchius hung at his sideand amoracchius still in its sheath on susans white leather belt hung from his shoulder i stared at the belt for a moment it hurt sanya came chugging up the stairs moving lightly for a big guy with so much muscle he gave my godmother a pleasant smile one hand checking to be sure that amoracchius was still on his shoulder next time lea murmured i think not sanya said beaming he turned to me thomas called he seemed surprised it was me molly is on navy cruiser on maneuvers in gulf of mexico she will be fine i whistled how did i narrowed my eyes lara murphy asked quietly got to be i answered lara has enough clout to get a navy chopper sent into another countrys airspace for an extraction murphy kept on rocking maggie as she spoke seemingly unaware that she was still doing it thats scary yeah i said maybe she sang happy birthday mister president not to be rude sanya said but i saw some people come up road in car and drive away very fast now would be a good time to he glanced over his shoulder and frowned who left that lightning door there i arranged that lea said lightly it will take you directly back to chicago howd you manage that i asked the leanansidhe smoothed her gown a hungry little smile on her lips and folded her hands primly in her lap i negotiated with its creator aggressively i made a choking sound after all your quest must be completed my child my godmother said maggie must be made safe and while i found the swim bracing i thought it might not be safe for her im given to understand that the little ones are quite fragile okay i said i i looked back up at the temple i cant just leave her there will you take her back to chicago child my godmother asked allow your police to ask many questions perhaps slip her into your own grave at graceland boneyard and cover her with dirt i cant just leave her i said the leanansidhe looked at me and shook her head her expression was less predatory than it could have been even if it wasnt precisely gentle go i will see to the childs mother she lifted her hand to forestall my skeptical reply with all the honor and respect you would wish to bestow yourself my godson and i will take you to visit when you desire you have my word a direct promise from one of the sidhe is a rare thing a kindness is even rarer but maybe i shouldnt have been surprised even in winter the cold isnt always bitter and not every day is cruel sanya murphy and i went down the stairs and through the lightning gate murphy politely refused sanyas offer to carry maggie for her he didnt know how to work her the right way to get her to accept help i offered to carry her gear she surrendered the sword and her guns willingly enough and i lagged a few steps behind them while i settled the straps and weaponry about myself i hung the p the only object murph was carrying with enough open space in it to hide an itinerant spirit so that it bumped against the skull still in the improvised bag on my belt and murmured very quietly out of the gun about time bob whispered back sunrise is almost here you trying to get me cooked orange light flowed wearily out of the apertures of the p and back into the safety of the skull the lights in the eye sockets flickered dimly and the spirits slurred voice whispered don gimme any work for a week at least then they flickered out i made sure the tshirt was still tied firmly and that the gun wasnt going to scratch the skull then i caught up to the others and was the first one through the gateway it was like walking through a light curtain into another room a step a single stride took me from chichén itzá to chicago specifically we emerged into father forthills storage roomslashrefugee closet and the lightning gate closed behind us with a snap of static discharge direct flight said sanya with both surprise and approval looking around nice murphy nodded no stops no weird places how does that work i had no idea so i just smiled shrugged and said magic good enough murphy said with a sigh and immediately settled maggie down onto one of the cots the child started to cry again but murphy shushed her and tucked her beneath the blankets and slipped a pillow beneath her head and the little girl was out in seconds i watched maggie without getting involved her mothers blood was on my hands literally sanya stepped up next to me and put his hand on my shoulder he nodded toward the hallway and said we should talk go ahead murphy said ill stay with her i nodded my thanks to her and went out into the hallway with sanya wordlessly he offered me amoracchius i stared at the sword for a moment im not so sure i should have that i said if you were he said i wouldnt want you to have it uriel placed it in your care if he wanted it moved he should say so after a moment i took the sword and hung its belt over the same shoulder as fidelacchius the swords felt very heavy sanya nodded before he left thomas said to give you this that you would know what it was he passed me a key i recognized it from the stamp on the head reading wb it stood for the name of the water beetle thomass beatup old commercial fishing boat it had a bathroom a shower a little kitchen some bunks and i had a couple of changes of clothing there from overnight trips to one of the islands in lake michigan my brother was offering me a place to stay i had to blink my eyes several times as i took the key thank you i said to sanya he studied my face for a second thoughtfully then he said youre leaving now arent you i looked back toward forthills quiet little haven yeah he nodded when will mab come for you i dont know i said quietly soon i guess i will talk to michael for you he said tell him about his daughter i appreciate it i said just so you know murphy knows my wishes regarding maggie shell speak for me da he said then he reached into his pocket and produced a metal flask he sipped from it and offered it to me here vodka of course on an empty stomach i said but took the flask tilted it to him in a little salute and downed a big swallow it burned going in but not necessarily in a bad way i am glad that we fought together he said as i passed the flask back i will do everything in my power to help make your daughter safe until you can return i lifted my eyebrows returning isnt really in the cards man i do not play cards he said i play chess and in my opinion this is not your endgame not yet being the winter knight isnt the kind of job you walk out of neither is being knight of the sword he said but michael is with his family now michaels boss was a hell of a lot nicer than mine sanya let out a rolling laugh and took another sip from the flask before slipping it back into his coat what will be will be he offered me his hand good luck i shook it and you come the russian said i will call you a cab i went down to the water beetle i took off the armor i hid the swords in the concealed compartments thomas had built into the boat for just such an occasion along with bobs skull and i took a long long shower the water heater on the tub wasnt much but i was used to not having hot water being the winter knight didnt help when it came to the cold water which seemed a complete ripoff to mein other words typical i scrubbed and scrubbed at myself especially my hands i couldnt decide if susans blood was coming off my skin or just sinking in i moved mechanically after that with the routine of a longtime bachelor there was chicken soup and chili in the kitchensorry galley i heated them both up and ate them i had a choice between white wine orange juice or warm coke to go with them the orange juice was about to go bad so it won the decision hot soups and cold juice got along better than i thought they would and i lay down on a bunk i thought i would sleep i couldnt i lay there feeling the gentle motion of the great lake rocking the boat water made soft slaps and gurgles against the hull sunlight warmed the cabin i was clean and dressed in an old pair of sweats and lying in a bed that was surprisingly comfortablebut i couldnt sleep the old clock on the wallsorry bulkheadticked with a steady soothing rhythm but i couldnt sleep chicken soup and chili that was one hell of a last meal maybe i should have had the cab stop at burger king as noon closed in i sat up and stared at my godmothers armor which had stopped bullets and lightning bolts and maybe worse id found several marks on the back and sides but no corresponding memories matching them to any of the attacks i knew about evidently it had handled a number of hits i hadnt noticed and i knew that without the ridiculously ornate stuff id be dead the little ticking clock chimed twelve times at noon and on the twelfth chime the armor changed it just melted back into my leather duster the one susan had given me before a battle a long long time ago i picked up the coat there were gaping wounds in it slashes patches burned away clearly visible bullet holes there was more hole than there was coat really and even the surviving leather was cracked dried stiff and flaking it began to fall apart while i stood there examining it i guess nobody tried making a pie out of cinderellas pumpkin once it got through being a carriage though in some versions of the story i guess it had been an onion maybe you could have made soup i dropped the coat into the lake and watched it sink i washed my face in the bathroom and squinted at the little mirror my mothers amulet and gem gleamed against my bare chest three days ago my life had been business as usual now that little bit of silver and stone was just about the only thing i had left not my office not my house not my car not my dogor my cat god where had mister gone after the fire not my integrity not my freedom not my friendsnot after mab finished with me what was left a little bit of silver and a tiny rock and maggie i sat down and waited to see what happened footsteps came down the dock and then onto the boat a moment later murphy knocked on the door and then let herself into the cabin she looked like shed come straight here from the church since she was still in her whitened battle wear and from her expression she hadnt slept she exhaled slowly and nodded i thought so murph i said maybe you shouldnt be here i had to see you she said you you just left wanted to say goodbye i asked dont be stupid she said i dont want to say it she swallowed harry its just that i was worried about you ive never seen you like this ive never murdered my childs mother before i said tonelessly thats bound to take a little adjustment she shivered and looked away i just just came to make sure that you arent doing this to punish yourself that you arent going to do anything dramatic sure i said nothing dramatic thats me dammit dresden i spread my hands what do you want from me murphy theres nothing left she came and sat down next to me her eyes on my face on my chest and shoulders taking in all the scars i know how you feel she said after maggie was settled i called in to the office theres been another investigation launched that putz rudolph she swallowed and i could practically smell the pain on her the games rigged stallings thinks he can get me early retirement half pension jesus murphy i said quietly im a cop harry she whispered but after this she spread her hands to show me that nothing was in them im sorry i said i got you into this the fuck you did she turned angry blue eyes to me dont try that bullshit with me i knew what i was doing i took the risks i paid for it and ill keep doing it for as long as i damned well please dont try to take that from me i looked away from her and felt a little bit ashamed she was probably right she could have backed off from me a long time ago shed chosen to be my friend even though shed known the danger it didnt exactly make me feel any better about myself but it made me respect her a little more is it wrong of me to admire a woman who can take a hit take it with as much fortitude as anyone alive and stand up again with the fire still in her eyes if it is i guess i can blame it on a screwedup childhood do you want the sword i asked she let out a quiet groan you sound like sanya that was the first thing he said she twisted her face into a stern mask wearing a big grin and mimicked his accent this is excellent i have been doing too much of the work i almost laughed well i must say it looks good on you felt good she said except for that pronouncementofdoom thing it was like someone else was using me as a sock puppet she shivered ugh yeah archangels can be annoying i nodded toward the hidden compartment theres a space behind that panel you ever want the sword check there im not rushing into anything ive had rebound boyfriends not interested in a rebound career i grunted so what are you going to do she shrugged i dont know i dont want to think about it i dont want to make any more decisions so i think im going to go get really drunk and then have mindless sex with the first reasonably healthy male who walks by then have a really awkward hangover and after that well see sounds like a good plan i said and my mouth kept going without checking in with the rest of me again do you want some company there was a sharp heavy silence murphy actually stopped breathing my heart rate sped up a little i wanted to curse my mouth for being stupid but why the hell not bad timing is for people who have time i she swallowed and i could see her forcing herself to speak casually i suppose you exercise it would make things simpler simple i said thats me her hand went to her hair and she forced it back down i want to she took a breath ill pick you up in an hour sure i said she stood up her cheeks pink hells bells it was an adorable look on her an hour then she said before she could leave i caught her hand her hands were small and strong and just a little rough she had bandages over a couple of burst blisters the sword had worn on her during half an hour or so of hard work i bent over it and kissed the back of her fingers one for each i let her go reluctantly and said my stomach muscles twitching with butterflies an hour she left and i saw her walking very quickly toward her car her ragged ponytail bobbed left and right with her steps the only thing certain in life is change most of my changes lately hadnt been good ones maybe this one wouldnt be good either but it didnt have that feel to it i took forty minutes shaving and putting on my nicest clothes which amounted to jeans and a tshirt and my old fleecelined denim jacket i didnt have any cologne so the deodorant and soap would have to do i didnt allow myself to think about what was going on in a dream if you ever start realizing its a dream poof its gone and i didnt want that to happen after that i spent a few minutes just breathing listening to the water around me the ticking of the clock the peaceful silence drinking in the comforting sense of solitude all around me then i said out loud screw this zen crap maybe shell be early and i got up to leave i came out of the cabin and into the earlyafternoon sun quivering with pleasant tension and tired and hauntedand hopeful i shielded my eyes against the sun and studied the citys skyline my foot slipped a little and i nearly lost my balance just as something smacked into the wall of the cabin behind me a sharp popping sound like a rock thrown against a wooden fence i turned and it felt slow for some reason i looked at the water beetles cabin wall bulkhead whatever behind me and thought who splattered red paint on my boat and then my left leg started to fold all by itself i looked down at a hole in my shirt just to the left of my sternum i thought why did i pick the shirt with a bullet hole in it then i fell off the back of the boat and into the icy water of lake michigan it hurt but only for a second after that my whole body felt deliciously warm monstrously tired and the sleep that had evaded me seemed finally to be within reach it got dark it got quiet and i realized that i was all by myself die alone whispered a bitter hateful old mans voice hush now whispered a womans voice it sounded familiar i never moved but i saw a light ahead of me with the light i saw that i was moving down a tunnel directly toward it or maybe it was moving toward me the light looked like something warm and wonderful and i began to move toward it right up until i heard a sound typical i thought even when youre dead it doesnt get any easier the light rushed closer and i distinctly heard the horn and the engine of an oncoming train authors note when i was seven years old i got a bad case of strep throat and was out of school for a whole week during that time my sisters bought me my first fantasy and scifi novels the boxed set of lord of the rings and the boxed set of han solo adventure novels by brian daley i devoured them all during that week from that point on i was pretty much doomed to join sff fandom from there it was only one more step to decide i wanted to be a writer of my favorite fiction material and here we are i blame my sisters my first love as a fan is swordsandhorses fantasy after tolkien i went after c s lewis after lewis it was lloyd alexander after them came fritz leiber roger zelazny robert howard john norman poul anderson david eddings weis and hickman terry brooks elizabeth moon glen cook and before i knew it i was a dual citizen of the united states and lankhmar narnia gor cimmeria krynn amberyou get the picture when i set out to become a writer i spent years writing swordsandhorses fantasy novelsand seemed to have little innate talent for it but i worked at my writing branching out into other areas as experiments including sf mystery and contemporary fantasy thats how the dresden files initially came aboutas a happy accident while trying to accomplish something else sort of like penicillin but i never forgot my first love and to my immense delight and excitement one day i got a call from my agent and found out that i was going to get to share my newest swordsandhorses fantasy novel with other fans the codex alera is a fantasy series set within the savage world of carna where spirits of the elements known as furies lurk in every facet of life and where many intelligent races vie for security and survival the realm of alera is the monolithic civilization of humanity and its unique ability to harness and command the furies is all that enables its survival in the face of the enormous sometimes hostile elemental powers of carna and against savage creatures who would lay alera to waste and ruin yet even a realm as powerful as alera is not immune to destruction from within and the death of the heir apparent to the crown has triggered a frenzy of ambitious political maneuvering and infighting amongst the high lords those who wield the most powerful furies known to man plots are afoot traitors and spies abound and a civil war seems inevitableall while the enemies of the realm watch ready to strike at the first sign of weakness tavi is a
