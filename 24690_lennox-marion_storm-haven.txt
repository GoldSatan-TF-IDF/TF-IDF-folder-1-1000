marion lennox storm haven chapter one nikki russell youre killing yourself nikki looked up from her books the causes of renal failure were swimming around her tired mind and it took a moment before she could focus on her elderly housekeeper beattie gilchrist stalked forward and planted a mug of hot chocolate on top of nikkis open text i know you asked for coffee she said darkly but ive no intention of helping you stay awake its bed you need dr russell and thats a fact nikki smiled wearily and pushed her heavy glasses from her nose thanks beattie im coming to bed in a moment i know i know mrs gilchrist folded her arms and glared at her employer in a few hours more like you delivered the raymond baby last night you were up at six to amy you had a full day at the surgery today and its near to midnight now odds are youll be called out again tonight and then where will you be exhausted nikki admitted but the exams only three weeks away beattie and old doc maybury told me theres not the least need for you to be sitting the exam yet he said most doctors wait five years from graduation before even thinking about it and youve been practising less than that youll drive yourself to an early grave nikki russell you mark my words beattie im only twentyseven nikki smiled placatingly at her housekeeper and pushed stray curls of flaming hair back from her face im young and fit hard works not going to kill me it will if its all you do beattie sniffed its no life for a girl buried here as eurongs solo gp you should be out having fun while youre still young youve a little girl whos growing up without knowing her mother can be fun and happy she hesitated honestly nikki dear its been five years since scott nikkis smile faded and her face closed what im doing now has nothing to do with scott she grimaced or maybe it has i had fun with scott and look where that got me but thanks for the chocolate nikkis eyes told her housekeeper to keep away from the raw spotthe aching pain that had been there for five long years beattie i really need to study the housekeeper stared at her young employer in concern beattie had known nikki russell since childhood and was almost as fond of her as she was of her own family nikkis nose was back in her text but beattie tried one more time while this locums here she started tentatively while hes here couldnt you get away for a bit take amy and have a few days right away ive employed the locum so i can study nikki said shortly she shoved her glasses higher on to her nose as she buried her face determinedly in her text as she did the front doorbell pealed damn she swore ill go beattie sighed oh my dear i didnt want you to be called tonight leave it beattie nikki echoed beatties sigh closed her book and rose you go to bed ill deal with it nikki made her way swiftly through the darkened house to the front door sending up a silent prayer that whoever was waiting for her had a minor problem the last thing she needed tonight was major traumanot when she was so tired still she might not have a choice if there was a medical emergency there was only nikki on this bleak thought she swung the front door wideand found herself staring into the most arresting blue eyes she had ever seen this was no emergency the man was standing half turned as if he had been soaking in the view across the moonlit valley to the sea beyond there was no panic here dr russell the man smiled as she frowned across the veranda at him he held out his hand im luke marriott luke marriottmechanically nikki held out her hand and had it enveloped in a much larger one the strangers grip was strong and warm intensely masculine he stood holding her hand and smiling down at her and nikki felt her secure dull existence shift on its foundations she had never seen a man like this never not even scott good grief what on earth was she thinking of nikki gave herself a mental shake trying to rid herself of the overwhelming impression ofwell there was no other word for itof masculinity nikki was tall but this man was taller by several inches he was strongly built with fair unruly curls that looked in need of a good cut his face bore two or three days stubble and his jeans and opennecked shirt were stained with sweat and dust there was a smudge of dirt across the strong wide features of his face and the deep blue eyes laughing down at her in the porch light were creased as though constantly shielded from the sun luke marriott nikki said blankly your new locum the man explained patiently i know im not due until tomorrow but i hitched a lift on a prawn boat rather than wait for the bus he grinned ruefully down at himself i hope that explains the dirtand the smell im not usually so perfumed nikki wrinkled her nose now that he mentioned itugh there was a definite smell of old fish about him the prawn boat was down in brisbane for a refit the man explained ruefully one of the deck hands lives here so i filled his place until we arrived what id thought would be a great two days holiday turned into a solid two nights working he looked down to his grubby sports shoes i hate to think whats on these he grinned ill take them off before i come in that is he raised his eyebrows in mockenquiry if you intend asking me in i nikki shook her head as through trying to dispel a dream luke marriott she had advertised for weeks for a locum and had been so delighted when this man had rung to accept that shed asked little further of him except his registration details but but weve organised your accommodation at the hospital she stammered theres a room there theres not he told her ive been there and the night sisters apologetic but cooks cars broken down and if they want cook on hand for breakfast she stays they seemed to think their breakfast is more necessary than i amand cook wont share butbut you cant stay here look i only take up six feet of floor space the mans humour was beginning to slip clearly hed expected a warmer welcome lady ive come almost a thousand miles to do a locum for you do you expect me to find a park bench i your night sister said whispering palms had at least six bedrooms and it only held three people now if i promise to rid myself of prawn bait and berley and not indulge in rape or pillage can whispering palms stretch itself to accommodate me the stranger stepped back as he talked his eyes following the long lines of generous verandas with the rows of french windows opening out to the night breeze or do you want me to go back to brisbane nikki pulled herself together with a visible effort of course there was no reason to refuse to accommodate her new locum if onlywell if only he werent so soso she didnt know what she stood aside and held the door wider ofof course not come in dr marriott welcome to eurong im not very he said looking quizzically down at her what he saw made his deep eyes crease in perplexity nikki russell was a stunner in any mans books her fabulous redgold curls framed an elfin face with huge green eyes which refused to be disguised by her too heavy glasses she was slenderalmost too thin for good healthand her pale skin was shadowed by the traces of exhaustion the casual jeans and worn cotton shirt she wore accentuated her youth she looked too young to be a practising doctor and i wonder why not he said slowly im sorry nikki frowned trying to make sense of his words you do want a locum oh yes nikki was under control now moving aside to make way for him as she did she was intensely conscious of his sizehis smelland it wasnt all fishingboat smell either it was only that you were so well unexpected because i wasnt due until tomorrow he asked yes she said firmly why else she turned to usher him into the house but as she did the telephone on the hall table started to ring now what she flashed him a look of apology and went to answer it it was almost a relief to turn awayto give her confused mind time to settle she wasnt granted time the voice on the other end of the line was harsh and urgent nikki it was sergeant milnes voice eurongs solitary policeman yes nikki knew trouble when she heard it dan milnes voice was laced with it youd better get here fast the policeman barked into the phone ive got two kids trapped in a wreck on the beach road and i doubt if eitherll make it they look bloody awful luke marriott and a car crash all in one night nikki turned from the phone to find her new locum watching her hed placed his luggage down on the polished boards of the hall and was listening in concern to nikkis terse queries behind them beattie gilchrist appeared in her dressinggown and fluffy slippers the housekeeper raised her brows in surprise at the strange man making himself at home in the hall but didnt speak until nikki put down the phone trouble she said as she saw nikkis face what she saw there made her treat the strangers presence as secondary beattie this is dr marriott our new locum nikki said briefly pushing her hair back in a gesture of exhaustion can you find him supper and a bed i have to go theres a car come off the back beach road and a couple of kids are still inside sergeant milnes there and it looks bad i dont need supper luke marriotts deep voice cut across her decisively he abandoned his battered suitcase and strode back to the door is the ambulance there its on its way but look i can handle i dont think you can the big man was suddenly in control more assured than nikki to be honest you look done in already and if there are two kids is there a medic with the ambulance our ambulance drivers are volunteers with firstaid certificates nikki admitted but then no buts the man ordered lets go dr russell it took five minutes to get to the wrecked car nikki didnt speak but concentrated on the roads and the man at her side seemed content to let her do so the local roads were treacherous the population of eurong was too small to support major road maintenance and the roads were twisting and narrow above eurongs swimming beach the road curved in a sharp u around the headland the teenagers in the car had tried to take it too fast and a massive eucalyptus had halted their plunge to the sea below by the time nikkis little sedan pulled to a halt at the scene there was a towtruck and ambulance in attendance and floodlights lit the wreck from the road above nikki left the car and swiftly made her way to the edge of the cliff abandoning luke marriott in her haste what she saw made her wince with dismay the towtruck driver was securing cables to the rear of the crumpled car ernie the ambulance driver was half into the wreck and the policeman was behind him sergeant milne looked up and gave a wave that showed real relief as he saw nikki he struggled up the cliff to meet her its bad he said briefly casting a curious glance across at nikkis companion its martin fleming and lisa hay lisas conscious but her legs are crushed between the car and the tree martins unconscious and bleeding like a stuck pig ernies trying to put pressure on now ill go down nikki turned to slide down the slope but was stopped by a strong grip on her arm your bags in the boot yes nikki had forgotten that she wasnt alone she looked up to luke marriott relief in her eyes if youll get it theres morphine theres everything iwell need saline luke was already moving that cars stable he snapped over his shoulder now weve secured it it is the policeman grimaced i wouldnt let ernie in till then for a while i thought theyd slide right down well need more men to get them out theyre on their way nikki didnt wait to hear more she was already sliding the car was a mess the ambulance driver pulled back as nikki arrived his face grim and distressed i cant stop the bleeding he whispered his eyes on the conscious girl in the passenger side of the car lisa was moaning softly to herself her body rocking against the savage constriction of her legs and i cant do anything for get around to lisas side nikki ordered see if you can check those legs for bleeding and stop her twisting she raised her voice trying to penetrate the girls pain lisa helps here well give you something for the pain while we cut you free youll be ok now just keep still and let us help you the girls moans grew louder she turned wild eyes to nikki martins going to die she sobbed and my legsyoull have to cut off my legs no nikkis voice was sharp but she didnt make an impression she was trying to work as she talked conscious of the blood pumping through a wound on martins scalp her fingers searched frantically for the pressure points but her eyes also saw what lisa was doing to her legs she was pulling doing what nikki could only guess to be more damage im going to die youll have to cut off my legs martins dead the girls voice rose in terrified hysteria and she writhed helplessly against her cruel confinement youre talking nonsense a mans clipped firm voice cut across lisas screams the ambulance driver was edged firmly out of the way and luke marriotts face appeared on the other side of the car his hands came in and caught the hysterical girls flailing fingers from hauling at her legs keep still he ordered dont move then in the fraction of a moment while she reacted to his voice he produced a syringe swabbed with lightning speed and plunged the morphine home thats good lisa he said more gently the pain will ease now and we can cut the metal from your legs but theyre smashed youre cutting them by pulling luke said firmly so dont pull and martins dead is martin dead luke looked over to where nikki had found the point she wanted nikki was pushing firmly on a wad of dressing over the wound at lukes terse request she looked up no one bleeds this much if theyre dead she said grimly ernie i need a saline drip if i can replace fluids there you are luke told the frightened girl he looked down at what he could see of the bottom half of her body now if youll stay absolutely still ill see if i can relieve some pressure on your legs it was grim work getting the two from the car and by the end of it nikki was despairing for the boy she was treating martin was deeply unconscious and the longer he remained unconscious the worse it looked the steeringwheel had slammed into his face he had smashed his cheekbones but something else was causing the coma what she hated to think all she could do was keep him alive while around them men worked to free them over and over she was grateful for luke marriotts presence what good fairy had brought him to eurong tonight lisa needed attention as much as martin and nikki knew that alone she would have struggled to keep both alive finally the metal panels were ripped from the frame of the car martin was freed first as nikki the ambulance driver and the assisting men carefully lifted his unconscious frame on to a stretcher nikki turned helplessly to luke itll be another ten minutes before we have lisa free luke told her how fars the hospital five minutes take him and send the ambulance back for us he ordered and there was nothing nikki could do but obey she didnt have time to think of luke marriott for the next halfhour nikki didnt have time to do anything but hold desperately to her patients fragile grip on life both she and martin were fighting she thought grimly but only one of them was aware of it the nursing staff of eurongs tiny hospital were out in forcethe full complement of five nurses and a wards maid were all at the hospital before nikki and her patient reached it in a tiny community like eurong word travelled fast everyone knew these two kids and the nurses were grateful for anything they could do to help but there was so littlenikki set up an intravenous infusion took xrays and then monitored her patient with an increasing sense of helplessness hes slipping andrea the hospital charge sister took martins bloodpressure for the twentieth time and looked grimly to where nikki was adjusting the flow of plasma isnt there anything we can do the planes on its way from cairns nikki told her itll be here in an hour theyll transport him back there but hes slipping fast i know nikki looked helplessly down at the boys pallid face she suspected what was happening from the xrays there was pressure building up in the intracranial cavity she was faced with an invidious choiceto operate here with her limited skill or put the boy on the plane knowing that by the time the plane landed in cairns hed probably be dead i cant operate she whispered i havent the skills there was so much to this job she would never be skilful enough to cope with the demands on her nikki had done obstetrics basic surgery and anaesthetics but nownow she wanted a competent neurosurgeon right here and now and because she hadnt done the training this boy would die i can the voice sounded behind her and nikki spun around luke marriott had quietly entered the theatre and was standing watching her he looked more disreputable than he had when shed first seen him the travel stains and the marks from catching prawns for two nights had been augmented by an hour trying to free the injured girl his shirt was ripped and bloodstained even his fair hair was filthy matted with dirt and blood intracranial bleed he asked yes ive stabilised lisa he said briefly shell make it she has two broken legs but theyll wait for surgery in cairns shes out to it now if you prep dr russell ill throw myself through the shower scrub and operate here he turned to the junior nurse show me where to go fast but you cant nikki said blankly why not the fairhaired man turned back to her and his eyes seemed suddenly older than nikki had thought despite the dirt he looked hard professional and totally in control youre wasting time dr russell prep please and fast but youre not im a surgeon he snapped and ive done enough neurology to get me through now move nikki moved the burr hole was the work of an expert nikki could only watch and marvel in the few fleeting moments she could spare from her concentration on the anaesthetic luke marriotts fingers were skilled and sure it was martins good fairy that had sent him here tonight what on earth was such a man doing as a relieving locum in a place like eurong luke marriotts skills belonged in a large city teaching hospital for him to be volunteering to work for the meagre wage of a locum for three weeks there was little time for her to question his motives all nikkis energy had to focus on the job she was doing skilled surgery such as luke marriot was performing took every ounce of her anaesthetic skill and she knew that the nurses too were being pushed to their limits at one stage she raised her eyes to meet the eyes of her charge nurse andrea pursed her lips in a silent whistle of wonder and nikki agreed with her totally and then finally this strange surgeon was done he dressed the site with care and signalled for nikki to reverse the anaesthetic weve done all we can he said grimly now its up to martin his parents are outside nikki was still fiercely concentrating she wasnt going to slip now when lukes part had been so expertly played ill take over the anaesthetic luke marriot told her his voice gentling this was the job all medicos hatedto face parents when they couldnt totally reassure you know them nikki nikki nodded numbly she stayed where she was until luke reached her and his fingers took the intubation tube as they did their hands touched and nikki felt a flash of warmth that jolted her that and the gentleness of his eyeshe understood what she was facing and that on its own made her job easier ill go she whispered and left him with his patient the few moments with the two sets of parents were as bad as they could be nikki tried her best to reassure them this sort of thing hadnt been so bad before she had amy she reflected sadly but nowhow would she feel if someone were telling her these things about her lovely daughter were taking them both down to cairns she told them gently we can take you on the plane but you must be back here in twenty minutes with what you need overnight gear for yourselves and a few things martin and lisa will want the hospital will provide the necessities but a few personal belongings make a difference she hesitated maybe a few of martins favourite tapes he mayhe may be in a coma for a while sound is important martins dads eyes filled with tears a comafor a whilehow the hell long he demanded roughly i dont know nikki said honestly dr marriott has lifted the pressure but there may have been damage done before that we can only wait luke was waiting for her as she returned to theatre bad he said softly and nikki looked up at him for some stupid reason she felt like weeping this wasnt nikki russellprofessionaluntouchable terrific she said sarcastically and her tone was harder than she intended what do you think his face tightened and he turned to the sink sorry i asked nikki bit her lip she followed him across and mechanically started to wash youll fly to cairns with them she asked tentatively normally it would be her making the long flight and she hated the flights with emergency patients it left eurong with no doctor within thirty miles still both lisa and martin needed a doctor on the trip and now there was luke marriott ready to go or maybe not luke shook his head your job dr russell nikki stared at him but if something goes wrongits you who has the neurology skills dr marriott and a fat lot of good theyll do me at ten thousand feet you can take bloodpressure and fix a drip just as well as i can dr russell they were being abruptly formal and all of a sudden it sounded absurd the trough where they were washing was meant for one doctor they were confined in too small a space and the night was too hot for comfort the nurses had turned on the airconditioning but it was still making a halfhearted effort to cool but nikki tried again but ive a little girl at home youve a daughter his brows rose as if the news shocked him nikki winced wishing for the thousandth time she looked her age i have she told him amys four and she worries but your housekeeper is there yes but and ill be there too he smiled and his smile held a trace of selfmockery im held to be good with children but he shook his head and his hands came up suddenly to grip her shoulders dr russell do you know what im wearing at this particular moment nikki stared his deep eyes were challenging her and behind the challenge was the hint of laughter i dont know nikki looked down writhing in the unaccustomed hold she didnt enjoy being so close then she gasped luke marriott was wearing a theatre gown nothing else below the gown hard muscled legs emergednaked even his feet were bare im in my birthday suit he grinned without my theatre gown im really something his smile deepened and he released her to turn his back so that the ties behind him faced her want to untie me and check it out no nikki stepped back in horror he turned back and smiled well im sure as hell not wearing an operating gown all the way to cairns my stuff was caked with dirt i couldnt wear it in theatre and these gowns are meant to fit someone about six inches shorter than i am sisters already told me you keep a change of clothes here dr russell on the grounds that youd look better in your change of clothes than i would youre going to cairns but he sighed leaned back and folded his arms whats the matter dr russell arent you happy leaving eurong and your daughter to my tender mercies dont you trust me nikki stared up at him the deep blue eyes mocked her with their trace of laughter for the life of her she couldnt answer chapter two martin recovered consciousness before the plane touched down at cairns for nikki it was a weird journey she felt as if she had been snatched from her nice safe existence and only part of that feeling was due to flying to cairns she watched over her patients while she tried hard to avoid thinking of luke marriott hes nice isnt he lisa whispered as she stirred from her drugged sleep and found the strength to speak who nikki asked she knew already whom lisa was talking about the new doctor hehe saved my life nikki shook her head but part of her acknowledged the truth of lisas words his presence might not have saved lisas life but it had probably spared her legs and as for the boy she was with nikki checked martin for the hundredth time and noticed with satisfaction the lessening of his unconsciousness he stirred just as they touched down his eyes flickering open and gazing upwards in dazed confusion youre safe nikki told him gently you and lisa crashed the car lisas here with you shes ok were taking you both to hospital it was all he could cope with hearing his eyelids lowered and he slept at cairns nikki was suddenly redundant forewarned there were ambulances and doctors waiting as their flight landed martins condition was less serious now than they had feared so nikki could slip into the background she was content to do so by now the cumulative effects of two sleepless nights were showing it was five in the morning and she was close to exhaustion someone showed her to a sparsely furnished room at the hospital all nikki saw was the bed somehow she shed her clothes slipped between cool sheets and seconds later was asleep nikki woke to heat there was a big ceiling fan in the bedroom but shed been too tired to think of turning it on now the temperature in the room had risen to the point of discomfort nikki opened her eyes looked automatically at the wristwatch on her arm and sat up with a start midday midday it couldnt be she stared again and shook her wrist the daily flight up to cooktownher only means of getting homeleft at eleven am now now she was stuck here for another twentyfour hours whether she liked it or not she flung back her sheet in distress someone should have woken her they knew the routine the staff here knew she had a flight to catch then a knock on the door made her dive back for the modesty of her bedclothes the door opened and a smiling face appeared it was miss charlotte cain a young surgeon whose friendship with nikki dated from medical school hi nikki charlotte smiled welcome to the day the whitecoated young doctor looked down at her watch and her smile widened i cant say good morning any more thats for sure charlie what on earth were you doing letting me sleep nikki demanded angrily you knew i had a plane to catch im only following orders charlotte grinned i hardly dared do anything else what do you mean just that luke marriott rang from eurong early this morning she told the bemused nikki he rang to find out how his patients werehis patients mindi think youve suffered an insurrection in your absence when we reassured him as to martin and lisas condition he turned his attention to you he said you werent to be woken he told us he didnt expect you back in eurong until tomorrow we are to pass on instructions to you to get some rest go shopping the man said i am informed everything is under control at eurong and you are not required an autocratic male is our mr marriott not a man to deny id say charlotte sat down on the bed raised her eyebrows at her friend and grinned she had the look of someone who was enjoying herself hugely mr marriott nikki stared up at charlotte in confusion so the man really is a surgeon one of the best charlotte said simply as your young martin can testify hes fully conscious and showing no signs of permanent damage charlotte shook her head i wish i could operate like that i dont understand nikki folded her sheet more closely about her and stared up at her friend what dont you understand anything nikki wailed but especially i dont understand why someone with luke marriotts skill and training accepts the job as my locum it doesnt make sense she looked desperately at her friend make sense of it for me charlie charlotte shook her dark hair i cant she admitted we were all amazed when you contacted us last night and told us who was operating luke marriott resigned from this place two years ago we thought hed gone overseas but no one heard and then he springs up with you in eurongin the nick of time as far as i can gather in the nick of timeit had certainly been that but why did anything happen nikki asked slowly i mean why did he leave here to do locum work who knows there must be something nikki frowned did something dreadful happen was there a lawsuit or medical mistake that would make him give up surgery didnt you ask for details of his past when you employed him charlotte asked amused surely an outstanding lawsuit would have to appear on his curriculum vitae i didnt ask for his curriculum vitae nikki snapped and then at the look on her friends face she changed her tone i checked he was currently registered and left it at that honestly charlotte i was just so tired i thought anyone would do as long as they were qualified and registered i mean i wasnt going to leave the town you mean you were going to do your usual trick of employing a locum and then doing the work yourself charlotte said drily for heavens sake nikki leave it charlie nikki said brusquely she looked up saw the fleeting look of hurt in her friends eyes and immediately regretted her words look charlie its just that its just that if you stop working then you have time to think her friend retorted and then a sudden smile flashed over her face well you and luke marriott should get on famously two workaholics and only enough work for one dear oh dear so tell me about him nikki demanded anxious to get the conversation away from herself why on earth is he acting as a locum if hes so darned clever and conscientious he looks like she thought back to luke marriotts disreputable appearance and the sudden memory of naked legs appearing from under his scanty hospital gown made her almost gasp he looks like a bum to me she said unsteadily well hes not a bum charlotte shook her head vehemently frowning i suppose were talking of the same luke marriott i dont think ive ever seen the man without imported tailored suits and amazingly expensive silk ties she looked at nikki whats your luke marriott like how to describe naked legs and laughing blue eyes nikki couldnt she opened her mouth and tried but the words stuck and then charlotte laughed ok she smiled thats our luke youre thinking of i know luke marriott theres not many men who could make you look like that nikki russell but luke marriott has to be a good bet he hasnt changed then hasnt changed luke marriott was the most gorgeous male within jetplane distance of this hospital charlotte said firmly he had every junior nurse some senior ones and a few female doctors besides making fools of themselves every time he walked past hes broken more hearts than i care to name she peered at nikki not yours yet sweetie dont be ridiculous nikki snapped and to her annoyance found herself flushing no charlotte stood up abruptly im not being ridiculous nikki its five years since scott i dont want to talk about scott i know her friend said grimly you dont want to remember scott well thats never going to happen if you dont ease up on work and start enjoying yourself a bit more charlotte said bluntly she looked at her watch hey your new locum ordered you to shop she smiled and i have the afternoon off when was the last time you went clothes shopping dr russell i dont need clothes nikki snapped i can use this afternoon at the library i need to study charlie the medical library is closed on wednesday afternoons her friend grinned now isnt that a shame and you havent a text with youand im damned if ill lend you a single one of mine charlie nikki russell you must have more money than you know what to do with your parents left you that fabulous house and you have a perfectly sound income from a too busy medical practice and i dont see a single sign of frivolous spending those jeans you were wearing last night were years old now either you come shopping with me or ill personally ring the airport and cancel your flight home tomorrow she put her hands on her hips coming dr russell nikki sighed well maybe she could do with some new jeansif youre not doing anything she said reluctantly im doing something all right her friend grinned im spending the afternoon with my closest friend to spend someone elses money theres nothing i could enjoy more i have to telephone amy theres a telephone beside your bed her friend told her you have fifteen minutes dr russell and then youre coming shopping whether you like it or not jeans werent what charlotte envisaged when she said shopping charlie dragged her friend from one shop to another and there wasnt a pair of jeans in sight honestly charlie nikki expostulated this stuff is crazy the shop charlie had pushed her into was upmarket and exclusive dealing in everything from beautiful imported shoes and designer fashions to the most indulgent of lingerie nikki fingered the soft swiss cotton of the dress her friend had just discovered the frock was lovely light and soft with swirling green pastels which lit the brilliant red of nikkis hair i wouldnt wear this in eurong itd be wasted maybe yesterday you wouldnt have worn it her friend grinned but todaytoday luke marriott is your new locum i wouldnt be seen dead in anything less than this dress if luke marriott was in the vicinity honest nikki charlie i am not the least bit interested in luke marriott nikki snapped youre lying charlotte said simply my grandmother would look twice at luke marriott and shes been happily married to my grandfather for fifty years charlie look just try it on charlie pleaded she thrust the dress into nikkis hands and pushed her towards a changingroom you could even wear this to workwith a nice white coat over the top its time you gave the bachelors of eurong their moneys worth i bet you charge top rates even when you wear your mouldy old jeans half laughing half exasperated nikki gave in she was fond of charliein fact charlotte cain had been a true friend for a long time it wouldnt hurt to humour her and these clothesshe fingered the soft cotton with a trace of regretthese clothes could join the rest of the things she had put away five years ago her mothers jewellery her cosmetics her contact lenses she looked up to her face and grimaced at the too heavy glasses she knew she was being stupid wearing these but they were a defence against something she no longer wanted they were a defence against the likes of luke marriott unbidden the thought of nikkis new locum flashed before her and it was all she could do not to rip the dress she was trying on from her back the thought of him produced something that was close to panic this was crazy there was no need for her to panic luke marriott obviously had problems of his own and a threeweek stint as her locum was hardly going to change either of them her panic was inexplicable and needless nikki forced herself to concentrate on the dress it was pretty there was no doubting that it fell in soft folds around her slim form catching the colour of her eyes and highlighting her brilliant hair she should get her hair cut she thought crossly there was too much of it or maybe she should just tie it back into a severe knot she shoved her glasses back on and opened the curtain charlie and the shop assistant were both waiting oh nikki its lovely charlie exclaimed delightedly dont you like it its ok nikki agreed reluctantly she fingered the fine cotton it feels good and so it should charlotte took her by the shoulders and spun her around it really makes you look likewell like you ought to look apart from those glasses theres nothing wrong with my glasses why do you wear them all the time charlotte demanded you know you only need them for reading im more comfortable with them on but you used to wear contact lenses well i dont any more nikki snapped ill take this off youll buy it if you think i ought to nikki said flatly the shop assistant had been watching the proceedings with interest it does look pretty she said but have a look at it in the fulllength mirror before you buy it theres one just around the corner here i dont need to yes you do charlotte said her voice firm go and look nikki then she reached forward towards the objects on nikkis nose and look without these awful glasses charlie can you see without them charlotte demanded yes but then look without them charlotte firmly removed the offending articles and thrust her forward now go and look at what you should be nikki russell nikki was propelled firmly forward by the shop assistant the assistant had obviously taken nikkis lack of interest as a personal challenge she stood next to nikki chatting cheerfully at nikkis image in the mirror it looks so good miss you should wear that colour all the time green really suits you she smiled up at her reluctant client and your friends right you shouldnt wear those glasses nikki stared at her reflection and a part of her cringed she wanted no part of this to be beautiful scott had told her she was beautiful ill get changed now she said firmly you will take it the assistant said anxiously oh yes nikki grimaced charlotte would give her no peace unless she did and her friendship with charlotte was important speaking of charlotte she looked around where was her friend charlie your friend must have slipped out the assistant frowned she looked around the shop visions of shoplifting clearly flashing through her mind people who distracted the shop assistant and left were a worry surely not these two women seemedwell classy but charlotte had gone and then nikki parted the curtain to her changingcubicle and realised with horror that something else had gone as well all her clothes everything her sandals even her glasses the shop assistant was right behind her seeing what nikki had seen she gave a nervous but relieved giggle oh dear she offered your friend seems to have to have taken all your clothes charlie nikkis voice was an angry wail what on earth was her friend playing at im back it was the cheerful voice of charlotte coming back in the door from the street missed me charlie where are my clothes nikki asked softly her tone was low and dangerous charlie grinned unperturbed i put em in a rubbish bin she confessed blithely actually i put em in about five garbage bins i put your jeans in one i put your shirt in another one sandal per bin i wish id been able to get your knickers and bra but you will be sensible and buy some more of those wont you sweetie charlotte well you were going to buy new clothes her friend said innocently you said you were and youd never choose to wear those old things when you have lovely new clothes now would you her face assumed an expression of innocence you werent buying these just to humour me now were you nikki it was so close to the truth that nikki gasped she opened her mouth to say something and then couldnt think of a thing to say finally she closed her mouth again and contented herself with glaring thats better charlie said she turned to the shop assistant you know this girl has nothing now but the clothes shes standing in i think we need at least a couple more outfits the sales assistant choked on shocked laughter oh yes miss she breathed she turned to nikki we have the loveliest linen suit that youd look smashing in wheel it out charlie said firmly charlotte where are my glasses nikki said awfully and her friend threw up her hands in mockfright beats me she laughed either mall litter bin or mall litter bin or was that your left sandal she shrugged charlie her friend put her hands on her hips nikki russell you are my very best friend she smiled then her face grew suddenly serious you have been vegetating in eurong for the past five years with no one to appreciate how lovely you really are now i find that one of the most eligible males i know is working as your locum im damned if ill let you go home wearing those glasses id be failing in my friendship if i did now try this suit on nikki russell and lets have no more nonsense charlie i am not the least interested in luke marriott it was almost a wail well thats fine her friend said simply all im ensuring is that luke marriott is interested in you it was a still angry dr russell who climbed from the plane at eurong airstrip the next day the wind was hot and blustery the dress charlotte had chosen hung coolly on nikkis slim body fluttering in the breeze it felt soft pleasant and frightening nikkis legs were bare apart from simple crystalgreen sandals her hair wisped around her face no longer held back by the rigid frames of her glasses nikkis fingers kept moving selfconsciously to her face but there was no dark shield to hide her she felt strange and frighteningly exposed its only until i reach home she muttered to herself i can change immediately if only she had more glasses the pilot had come around to help her from the cabin as she thanked him he reached down on to the floor and retrieved a package the size of a small suitcase this is for you too doc he grinned a miss cain sent it out to the airport last night said we werent to give it to you until now nikki looked down at the package and her lips tightened the package was emblazoned with the logo of the shop she had visited the day before she had refused to buy anything more than the dress she was wearing but she knew already what would be in the parcel everything charlotte had pleaded with her to buy she imagined i suppose these are all paid for she said icily and the pilot grinned as though he too was in on the plot theyre bought on approval he said well here nikki thrust the package at him i dont approve you can take them right back not me doc the pilot backed off with his hands held up in negation i promised miss cain that theyd stay in eurong for a least a week if you dont want them after that she says i can bring em back but you wouldnt have me break a promise he smiled yes nikki put the parcel down on the tarmac and glared his grin deepened and he shook his head in mocksorrow tuttut what a thing to say now im sorry doctor but undermining my moral values is something i dont hold with have it here in a week if you want it returned fine nikki snapped i will now doc pete was looking anxious and nikki sighed and relented it was no fault of the pilots that she had such a scheming friend sorry pete its just that im feeling managed yeah she looks managing that miss cain the pilot looked behind her across the runway and speaking of managingis this your new locum nikki spun around shed been expecting beattie to meet her but striding across the tarmac was dr luke marriott he was walking swiftly towards them carrying a parcel in his arms it was all nikki could do not to gasp the change in the man was extraordinary instead of the disreputable vagrant of two days ago this man was welldressed arrogant and assured it showed in his stride in his immaculately tailored linen trousers and quality opennecked shirtand in the way his eyes dropped approvingly over nikkis figure well well well he whistled soundlessly as he neared them a veritable transformation you should talk nikki said abruptly and then flushed her eyes fell away she didnt know how to react to this man he grinned didnt you like my coating of prawns bait and blood he smiled he looked up to the pilot thanks for bringing her back it was as if he were a parent thanking the air hostess for looking after a child nikkis flush deepened and she felt anger mounting within her couldnt beattie come to collect me she asked ungraciously you dont approve of the substitute he demanded his eyes still laughing he motioned down to the parcel in his arms beattie and amy are involved in a most important function at amys kindergarten they said theyd meet you at home speaking of beattie she asked me to send this down to cairns he handed it over to the pilot can i leave it with you the address is on the label then he turned back to nikki shall we go fine nikki turned away but the pilot stopped her youve forgotten your parcel doc he said apologetically looking down at the bulky package still at nikkis feet he looked from luke to nikki obviously relishing the undercurrents he was sensing leave it here until next week nikki snapped i dont want it im not doing that the pilot said definitely this building is open to heaven knows who youll have to take it he turned to luke can you take it for doc russell luke nodded and held out his hands to accept it i get rid of one and im given another what is it he asked curiously i gather our doc russell went shopping yesterday the pilot grinned as per instructions luke marriott smiled and the smile made nikkis heart give a sickening lurch very good dr russell im glad to see you can follow orders excuse me nikki said icily i thought i was the general practitioner and you were the locum or was i mistaken since when has the locum given orders to his employer lukes smile only deepened for three weeks you said i was the general practitioner and you were out of work he told her and thats the way its going to be over my dead body nikki said savagely and then wished she hadnt both luke and the pilot obviously found it enormously amusing come on nikki russell luke marriott said kindly in the voice of one humouring a fractious child lets take you home dr marriott its mr marriott luke told her i thought your friends in cairns would have told you that but you can call me luke if you like nikki stood almost speechless the ground was being swept from beneath her feet she felt as if every foundation she possessed was cracking luke marriott i dont know what the hell youre playing at she started im not playing at all luke raised his free hand in acknowledgement and farewell to the pilot tucked nikkis parcel under his arm and started walking towards the hangars in the distance nikki saw her car parked waiting he glanced at his watch in fact im late late for afternoon surgery he informed her blandly i have patients booked my patients no he shook his head theyre mine youre not wanted for three weeks dr russell you can take yourself off to your texts or sleep by the swimmingpool for all i care but youre not working but beattie has explained things to me luke went on blandly she tells me youre set on passing this exam and its my responsibility to see that you do and im one to take my responsibilities very seriously im not your responsibility no but your practice is for the next three weeks dr russell you are not wanted chapter three well we think hes lovely nikkis housekeeper and her small daughter were smitten beattie stood at the big wooden table mechanically mixing her dough her eyes faraway amy was fixed on her mothers lap her small fingers fingering the soft fabric of nikkis dress in blatant admiration oh nikki hes just the best thing beattie continued dreamily since sliced bread nikki snapped she was perched on the stool as she held her daughter sipping tea and feeling stranger and stranger it was midafternoon her surgery was crowded she knew and she wasnt even welcome there much less wanted if you come near the place then ill pick you up and deposit you outside on your very neat bottom luke marriott had said sternly and by the look in his eyes nikki wasnt going to test the truth of his statement she had the feeling that luke marriott didnt make idle threats but whats he doing here nikki asked for the fiftieth time hes a surgeon for heavens sake whats he doing acting as temporary locum in eurong i have no idea beattie said giving her dough a sound pummelling all i know is thats hes an answer to a prayer nikki russell and you dont ask questions when fate plays you lucky he might be the answer to your prayers nikki said bitterly but hes not the answer to mine a more autocratic overbearing i know beattie sighed isnt it lovely beattie i dont mean hes rude beattie said shocked by nikkis tone he just knows what has to be done she looked down at her pastry and he really likes my cooking she cast a look of disapproval at her employer no just picking around the edges i asked him what hed like for dinner tonight and he said the same as last nightonly more i wont give it to him of course last night i made a chicken casserole but tonight ill do a standing rib roast with yorkshire puddingand have apple pie to follow eh but its good to cook for a man again i havent since my john died but hes not staying here nikki said frowning isnt he supposed to be staying at the hospital id arranged it i know beattie eyed her employer doubtfully the thing is matron rang while you were in cairns and asked if we could have him stay on for a while longer cooks done the cylinderhead on her car and itll be a week or more before they can get the part meanwhile shell have to stay at the hospitaland matron doesnt want to use a ward beattie took a deep breath and her dubious look intensified soso i told her of course wed have him here beattie weve plenty of room her housekeeper told her severely for heavens sake nikki there are three spare bedrooms you hardly have to see the man apart from mealtimes ill have my meals in my study nikki said angrily and beattie smiled with amy mummy why dont you like him amy had been intent on her drink and biscuits finished with the serious business of life she turned to her mother we think hes nice and he makes us laugh she frowned direfully at her mother im not eating in the study if dr lukes in the diningroom dr luke nikki frowned back down at her daughter mr marriott to you he said i could call him dr luke amy announced i said no one would think he was proper if we called him mister and he thanked me for the advice and he agrees and i showed him the swimmingpool this morning and he said hed teach me to dogpaddle starting tomorrow so he has to stay here well there you are then beattie grinned her smile faded a little and she looked down at nikki in concern its better this way she said gently the night calls come here and youd be going out anyway if he was staying down at the hospital this way i know nikki threw up her hands this way i have nothing to do except study which is what you wanted isnt it beattie said doubtfully and nikki gave a reluctant smile yes beattie she said slowly its what i wanted nikki left and made her way back to her study her text still stood open at the causes of renal failure nikki picked it up and frowned at the blurred image shed have to put in her contact lenses and part of her didnt want to she put a hand up to her face in a gesture of distress her heavy glasses were a token of her defence against the world but they were a comfort to her charlotte had thought she was doing her friend a favour depriving her of them if she had known how distressed it was making nikki feel how exposed you mean nikki whispered and then shook her head angrily she wasnt exposed there wasnt the slightest reason to believe that luke marriott was the least bit interested in her i can wear what i like nikki muttered looking down uneasily at the attractive dress she was wearing still still she would just go and change before luke marriott came home for dinner after all she had to go to her bedroom to find her contact lenses anyway two minutes later she was back in the kitchen beattie where are the rest of my jeans she asked softly the housekeeper looked up startled from her cooking and turned a becoming shade of pink oh nikki dear you startled me beattie where are my jeans nikkis voice was dangerously quiet she stood with her hands linked behind her staring at the elderly beattie all of them beattie asked she sounded flustered all of them well i sent them to charlotte of course beatties expression of innocence didnt quite come off like she asked me to beattie now i know youll think were interfering beattie said paying minute attention to the pastry she was crimping but miss charlotte rang and said youd bought the most lovely clothes and you wouldnt be game to wear them if you didnt get some encouragement she flushed even redder so she told me to burn them and i wouldnt of course she said virtuously as she saw nikkis jaw drop so then she told me to pack them all up and put them on the aeroplane back down to cairns said shed look after them until you wanted them again so nikki stared speechless so i did i asked your new locum to give them to the pilot when he met you from the plane beattie and miss charlotte said you were to yell at her and not me and then beattie smiled a cheeky smile but you can yell at me if you like my shoulders are broad enough to take it she left what she was doing folded her floury arms and fixed her young employer with a hard stare miss charlotte thinks its time you started living again and im not disagreeing nikki sank on to a kitchen chair her anger was palpable so you take my clothes those things werent clothes beattie said harshly they were a disguise is what miss charlotte reckoned and shes right youre pretty as any girl in eurong nikki russell and youre too darned young to be as bitter and reclusive as youve been she sniffed defensively so weve taken a hand she buried her hands in her pastry again and if you dont like it you can sack me but ive done no more than my christian duty or what your mum would have done if shed been alive she sniffed again i was that fond of your mother and ive a duty to her too the telephone broke across her words it was just as well nikki thought grimly in another minute beattie would be in tears flashing a look of frustrated fury at her housekeeper she crossed to the bench to answer it it was the last person she wanted to speak to luke marriott ok i said i wouldnt disturb you from the other end of the line his voice was clipped and efficient but ive a child here im unhappy about karen mears karennikkis anger was placed aside what is it she asked quietly its a greenstick fracture of her arm but am i right in worrying nikki sighed yeah she said grimly well have to get her to hospital ill be right there no the voice was firm and authoritative i just wanted my suspicions confirmed i can deal with it but mrs mears will never let you shell let me luke mrs mears has problems none that justifies this her problems can wait for now all we need to do is make sure karens protected then we act but nikki i dont need you go back to your study ill see you tonight the line went dead nikki was left holding the useless telephone she stared down karen at least this showed that luke marriott was thinking as he worked most children presenting with a greenstick fracture would not excite attention karen though karen was eight years oldthe eldest of a family of four children her father had walked out a year ago and nikki was sure mrs mears wasnt coping karen seemed to be bearing the brunt of it shed been a quiet child to begin with but now she was withdrawn to the point where nikki worried she had grown thinner her pinched little face pale and haunted with her two huge hazel eyes a mirror of misery the child had one cold after another but the only time nikki saw her was during routine school checkups the teacher had drawn nikki aside and confided her worries shes often bruised the young teacher had whispered and she forgets her lunch most days im sure shes not getting enough to eat nikki had gone over the little girl thoroughly there were bruises over the childs bodyenough to make her approach mrs mears shes just clumsy sandra mears had said defensively shes always knocking into things nikki had watched the young womans hands tremble as she talked sandra mears was younger than nikkimuch younger to have to cope with the burden she was facing sandra can i organise you some help nikki had said gently i can get council child care one day a weeksome time to give you a break the four children must make you tired theres nothing wrong with me sandra had snapped i dont want your charity sandra its not charity well i dont want it the girl had repeated rising now butt out of whats not your business karens health is my business theres nothing wrong with karen and if she says there is then shes a liar the girl had thinned her lips in a gesture of defiance but still the lips had trembled now let me get karen and ill go home and nikki had been able to go no further shed talked to karens teacher again and then reluctantly had contacted the states childrens protection services the social worker had travelled from cairns but like nikki she had hit a blank wall theres not a lot i can do shed told nikki unhappily im sure karens taking the brunt of her mothers unhappiness sandra seems deeply depressed but neither will admit theres a problem at what point should the authorities step in and remove children from a parents care nikki didnt know unhappily she stared now at the telephone and accepted that the point might be now it took all her selfcontrol not to go back to the hospital i dont need you luke marriott had said if he could get sandra to agree to the little girls going to hospital well he had as much chance as she did if not better nikki thought bitterly an autocratic male might succeed where she had failed so dismally maybe even egocentric surgeons had their uses with this cheerless thought she buried her head again in her books the hated contact lenses in place if only she could concentrate somehow nikki managed to do some useful study she left her books when beattie called her for dinner once more uneasily conscious of her new appearance her dress felt odd around her bare legslike a forgotten memory she wished she could go back to work a white coat now would be comforting luke marriott was in the kitchen with amy and beattie amy was involved in helping beattie serve and luke seemed to be supervising in his hand he held a glass of wine and as nikki walked in he raised it in salutation the worker emerges he said drily and nikki flushed i would have described you all as the workers she frowned at the glass did you buy wine beattie i bought wine luke told her he filled another glass have some no thanks i never do when im working she was being a wet blanket but the man unnerved her one glass isnt going to interfere i dont want it nikki bit her lip ashamed of her outburst im sorry she managed she turned to the housekeeper who was regarding her in astonishment can i help beattie ive all the help i need in young amy here beattie told her you two go in shoo ill wait and help carry in the plates the last thing nikki wanted was to be alone in the diningroom with luke marriott alone anywhere nikki ate in silence while beattie amy and luke chatted amiably over the events of the day nikki couldnt join in her overwhelming emotion was anger with herself why on earth had she behaved like a tiresome child nikki hadnt the faintest idea why this man was making her react like this and she hadnt a clue what to do about it her normal cloistered existence was shattered she was having to share her home with a man who made her feelwho made her feel like a gauche schoolgirl luke lapsed into silence as beattie left to clear the table amy virtuously helping but he didnt seem in the least uncomfortable on the contrary his deep blue eyes held the trace of a twinkle as if he was aware of and enjoying the discomfiture his presence engendered in the girl at the other end of the table finally the interminable meal came to an end and nikki rose she hadnt tasted a thing and beattie had gone to extraordinary trouble it was a shame im going to put amy to bed she said stiffly you mean you do occasionally spend some time mothering nikki bit her lip i spend heaps of time with amy she said hotly and amy understands how important my job is does she look i dont have to answer to you no he said slowly only to amy nikki pushed back her chair scraping it harshly on the polished boards amy has to understand that life is serious she told him and works important now if youll excuse me dont you want to know about karen luke enquired raising his brows i thought a bit of professional concern might be in order nikki flushed bright red and sank down she was going crazy not to have enquired tell me about her she said stiffly of course im worried are you of course i am nikki bit her lip as again her anger threatened to burst out so why havent you interfered before now you do know the child is being abused abused there are bruises all over her and the xray shows the arm has been broken before not that im aware of well it was luke grimaced the fracture is further up the arm from the original break the bones calcified around the old fracture it happened around a year ago id say nikki closed her eyes i didntneither her teacher nor i picked that up she whispered it must have happened during the long vacation ive seen the bruising though and turned the other cheek i contacted community services they sent a social worker up from cairns that did a lot of good ill bet nikki rose so what would you have them do she snapped take the children away sandra had karen when she was fourteen fourteen shes only twentytwo now and she has four children she married a nohoper had one child after another and now hes left her and she has nothing the community here labelled her eight years ago when she had karen out of wedlock and shes been isolated ever since she struggles on to hold them together well shes not struggling enough luke said grimly id say she has a temper and karens taking the brunt of it so we take all the children nikki shook her head where does that leave themor sandra i asked karen about the bruises she told me she kept falling oversandras obviously warned her about telling the truthbut if you gave her the choice of going to a strange foster home or staying with her brothers and sister then i know the choice karen would make so youre proposing we patch her up and send her back to face her mothers temper again no of course not nikki subsided again into her chair some things were just so hard not if its reached the stage of bones being broken but i dont knowill have to contact cairns again the social worker well what else do you suggest nikki demanded he smiled then the blue eyes challenging rising he came around to her end of the table and placed a hand on the back of her chair i suggest you abandon your studies for a couple of hours he said firmly lets go and see sandra now what now as soon as amys in bed he looked at his watch she wont be expecting us it will give us a chance to assess what things are like at home and we just might be able to do something constructive like bring all the children back here nikki said bitterly and lukes smile deepened he looked around appraisingly through the french windows to the swimmingpool beyond well theres certainly enough room in case you hadnt noticed nikki said icily this is my home and i like my privacy and i wonder why luke said thoughtfully this place is enormous it needs half a dozen kids to bring it to life so you propose going and taking sandras just to keep amy company i suppose dr russell nikki looked up at him suspiciously yes dont be so bloody stupid they stopped at the hospital first the childrens ward was in darkness the nurse rose to greet them her finger raised to her lips in a gesture of silence karens only just gone to sleep she whispered despite the medication luke frowned why she should have drowsed off hours ago she was too frightened to go to sleep she said the nurse hesitated she kept saying wed take her away while she was asleep she sighed and her mother didnt come was karen asking for her no but her eyes never left the door waiting poor wee mite luke crossed silently to the bed and nikki followed the child was sleeping soundly in a druginduced sleep her injured arm was flung out at a rigid angle in the dim ward light her face was a wan pool of dejection there were shadows under the huge eyesshadows that spoke of abject misery nikki felt her heart wrench within her maybe this little one could come back to whispering palms for a while professional detachment luke said softly from the other side of the bed and nikki raised her eyes as she realised he was watching her its a bit hard isnt it its impossible nikki said wearily and turned to go nikki directed luke mechanically out past the town boundaries along the coast road and then inland to an old farmhouse set well back from the road this had once been the homestead for the sugar plantation it was on but the owners had long ago wearied of the fight with white ants and age and had rebuilt a mile further down the road they were renting this house out for a pittance waiting for nature to take its course it would soon happen this land was natural rainforest and without constant clearing the forest was reclaiming its own huge palms surrounded the house so much so that it was difficult to see where house started and garden ended the veranda was sagging wearily on rotten footings and vines and the beginnings of coconut palms were shoving up through the boards what a place to bring up children the place must be crawling with snakes nikki thought grimly and it was miles from anywhere sandra had been isolated from the eurong community since shed had her first child but by living here her isolation was complete there was complete silence as they approached the house a rustedout ford sedan stood forlornly in front of the veranda and a light showed through a single window they could see a vague shape through the cracked glass the figure rose while they watched and came towards the door what a dump luke stood at the edge of the veranda and looked up whistling soundlessly between his teeth surely there must be better places what do you want sandra was standing at the door the solitary light behind her casting her shadow twenty feet out into the night she was wearing a worn dressingrobe and her long hair was matted and wild her figure was so thin that she appeared almost emaciated she stood barefoot her arms folded her stance spoke of defiance and a fear so tangible that nikki felt she could almost touch it you didnt come to see karen nikki said gently we thought you might karen shouldnt be in hospital shes only got a broken arm were not keeping karen in hospital because she has a broken arm luke said harshly mrs mears may we come in no luke nodded then well keep karen until the social workers arrive from cairns he said firmly we have no choice but luke looked up at the woman on the veranda and in the dim light his eyes were suddenly implacable and hard mrs mears karen has bruises all over her she has a broken arm and its not the first time its been broken she flinches when i raise my hand as if shes used to being beaten and shes malnourished hungry mrs mears now are we going to come inside and talk about it or do we contact the authorities in cairns sandra mears gave an audible gasp and her hand flew to her mouth she took a step back as if luke had slapped her we need to talk mrs mears lukes voice had softened but was no less implacable there was a long silence then sandra slowly turned as if sleepwalking and walked inside nikki had expected chaos judging from the outside the house was a ruin and sandra incompetent to her amazement the place was almost pathetically clean the cleanliness accentuating the abject poverty in the place she looked around in amazement and then down to sandra sandra had sunk to sit at the kitchen table her head fell forward on to her arms and her shoulders heaved this girl was wretched and despite her anger nikki felt a wave of compassion what sort of mess was this girl in so tell us what happened the compassion hadnt touched luke he was standing over sandra almost like the interrogator in a bad movie nikki put up a hand in protest but he silenced her with a look sandra looked up her tearstained face a plea but luke wasnt interested in pleas tell us sandra he said sheshe broke her arm no tell us the silence stretched out outside on the veranda a cane toad started its harsh croaking the naked lightglobe made the effect surrealistic and awful you know sandra said at last no you tell us sandra cast a scared look up at him and dashed a hand across her cheek luke didnt stir his gaze didnt waver she wasshe wouldntshe wouldnt do what i told her she took a deep breath its not true she said suddenly it was jamie mymy youngest hes four id just been to town and bought some biscuits we hadnt had biscuits for so long butbut the kids asked and asked one packet of biscuits she looked up pleading with them to understand i just couldnt bear not toso i got them and then i went outside and when i come back jamie had got at them and eaten six and shoved the rest in the toilet cos he was full and he didnt know what to do with the halfeaten packet and was scared id find them and they blocked the toilet and i found them and i hit jamie but i couldnt hit him hard cos hes only four and he gets asthma and then karen started crying and said i shouldnt hit him andand i just her voice broke off into tears so you hit karen instead luke said and to nikkis surprise his voice had gentled yeah the girls face came up i always do shes so like me she just stands there and takes it she doesnt even cry she just stands there the other kids were crying cos they hadnt had any biscuits but not karen shes so like you yeah sandras head sank on to her arms and she gave a broken sob i feel so bad i love her so much and i hurt her she managed to look up again maybe its best if you take her away i know ill keep hurting her and i love her she gave a desperate gulp as if to gain strength to continue i know it sounds crazy but i love her more than the rest of the kids put together and yet i hurt her you didnt come to the hospital shed look at me sandra said brokenly i know shed just look at me and not say anything she wont even cry luke sat down at the bare scrubbed table and his hand came out to cover sandras mrs mears youve reached the point where you accept help or watch your family disintegrate he said softly he motioned backwards to where nikki was standing silently watching dr russell and i can help but only if you let us youve admitted theres a problem if you love your daughter then you must admit that you need help and then accept it sandras eyes once more met his there was a long silence even the cane toad outside had hushed nikki found she was holding her breath so much depended on these next few moments then sandra took a ragged breath and then another she looked over to nikki and back to luke im in trouble she whispered i dont know what to do pleaseplease help me luke nodded as if he had expected no less his hand stayed exactly where it was and nikki had a sudden sense of how sandra must feel to have this man touching her feeding strength reassurance and warmth into her through his touch there was a sudden crazy moment of irrational jealousy quickly stifled luke stood and motioned to nikki do we have any sleepingpills dr russell yes nikki frowned she wouldnt have thought leaving sleepingtablets for this woman was the most sensible thing sandra seemed almost suicidal well leave you two tablets for the night luke told sandra heading off nikkis criticism i want you to take them and get a solid nights sleep tomorrow morning i want you to get up wash your hair put on your nicest dress and bring the children into the hospital ill arrange the nursing staff to take care of them for the rest of the day youll visit karen and then meet me in my surgery at twelve my surgery nikki flinched on the words this man had taken right over still he had achieved more so far than she had ever been able to with this sullen frightened girl but no buts luke was standing still not taking his eyes from sandra by twelve tomorrow ill have a list of options available for you and i want you to come knowing that every option is better than whats happening now but theres nothing it was a frightened whisper theres everything once more lukes voice gentled and his hand came down on to her shoulder theres a whole great world out here for you and your children sandra and its time you started finding it but karen karen loves you he smiled then and his smile warmed the bleak little room if i didnt think that i wouldnt help you but karen loves you and shes a smart little girl she wouldnt love you unless you were worth loving so lets get to work and repay her trust they left her then sitting staring out bleakly into the night nikki was aware of intense disquiet as they bumped down the overgrown track away from the house you dont think shell do anything stupid do you she said softly luke flashed her a quizzical look like suicide like suicide he shook his head she loves her family too much you sounded tougher before you met her luke nodded as he manoeuvred the little car out on to the road and turned homewards shes ok he was talking almost to himself sometimes life is just too much i think for sandra its reached that point but now shes said she needs helpwell i reckon theres light at the end of her tunnel anyway nikki frowned across at him his voice had suddenly flattened as if he was doing some sort of personal comparison surely this selfconfident overbearing male couldnt have major problems in his life and yethe was at eurong for a reason what on earth was it tell me why youre doing country locums she said gently and he flashed her a look of amusement probing into my ghosts dr russell nikki flushed youre a successful surgeon she continued and was annoyed at the trace of resentment she heard in her voice whywhy have you given it up i havent given it up doing a locum in a backwater like eurong is hardly a strategic career move she said waspishly no he smiled across at her neither is burying yourself here in a house too big for you in a community thats known and labelled you from childhood and thats what youre doing dr russell nikki bit her lip angrily beattie she started if you think i can practise for half a day in this place and not learn all the local gossip you dont know much about the town you live in he told her especially when you ask he grinned especially when i ask the car slowed suddenly and nikki looked out they were still two miles from home on the beach road luke was pulling the little car on to the kerb and coming to a halt whwhat are you doing nikki stammered ive been in a stuffy surgery all day luke told her and the moon is full and the beach is calling im taking a short walk dr russell are you coming or do you intend to sit in the car and sulk while i walk but luke didnt hear the car was stationary and luke had left striding swiftly around to hold the door open for her coming dr russell a walk on the beach was how nikki often ended her day after hours spent trying to solve everyone elses problems the sea and the moonlight were often the only way she could calm her tired mind but to walk with this man she looked up and his eyes held a challenge afraid they mocked and suddenly she knew she was she didnt want this she didnt want what seemed to be happening whether she wanted it or not dont be so bloody stupid he said for the second time that night and his eyes mocked her nikki took a deep breath i should be in bed she said tightly he held up the car keys well the cars going nowhere he said gently he held out his hand to take hers helplessly nikki felt herself drawn up and out of the car a walk he said firmly nothing else dr russell not yet chapter four the night was still and warm a gentle breeze from the sea stopped it being oppressively hot october on the coast along the great barrier reef was the loveliest of monthsthe time before the real oppression of the steamy wet season began nikki walked slowly down towards the sea as she had risen from the car luke had released her hand and had gone before leaving her to follow if she would now he strode easily across the firm tidewashed sand his face lifting to the moonlight as though soaking in its beauty once more nikki found herself wondering about this man of many parts how many men took time to soak up the loveliness of a night like this what had she expected that he would use this opportunity to make a pass at her he seemed now to be oblivious to her presence and nikki knew that luke would have stopped the car and walked even if hed been alone as he was now he walked alone across the moonlit beach alone with whatever demons drove him and nikki was left to her own demons and they were there the ghosts from nikkis past were never far from this place her parents scott what was scott doing now married again of course hed be married nikki told herself bitterly scott was charming and personable and desperate for money hed be married now to some lady who could support the lifestyle he craved bitterness at the past rose up in her threatening to overwhelm her how could he have treated her like that men were bastards she thought bleakly remembering sandra mears haggard face she and sandra both why on earth hadnt she been able to see scotts true colours before shed been crazy enough to marry him shed been so stupid well it wasnt going to happen again not ever she needed no one and amy was solely dependent on her amy would be brought up with security and love but no man was needed the bitter words scott had flung at her had stayed in her heart for five long years he had called her a lying deceitful whore he had laughed at her for believing that he had married her for lovehed told her that no one would ever want her for herself alone nikki took a deep breath and turned her face into the warm night air the bitterness was all around her and she was so alone she looked down to the waters edge at luke and a sense of empathy edged into her consciousness somehow this man was alone as she it was curiously comforting the soft night wind whipped the fine fabric of her dress around her bare legs her hair blew lightly around her face and she drank in the salt air greedily something was happening to her she didnt know what it was but she only knew that something inside her was being releasedjust a littlefrom the bondage that scott had imposed was it charlottes crazy impulsive action in forcing her into attractive clothes or was it something else luke was walking slowly back up the beach towards her his face in shadow with the moon behind him as he reached her he held out his hands and nikki took an involuntary step back im not going to rape you he said easily and there was a trace of mocking laughter in his voice oh so scared miss prim why im not scared nikki sounded like a defiant child he nodded as though humouring her then sank on to the sand and hauled his shoes off then his socks then what are you doing nikki gaped openmouthed and then blushed crimson as she realised just what he intended im going for a swim of course she couldnt see his face but there was no mistaking the laughter coming this was something nikki had done in the longforgotten past eurong beach stretched for miles and the tiny population meant that it was almost always deserted eurong was not a tourist destinationthe locals kept its beauty as a closely guarded secretand it meant it was possible to come down here strip to nothing and swim undisturbed the last time nikki had done such a thing had been five years agofive years dont be nikki turned away with a gasp as she realised her protest was falling on deaf ears his naked body in the moonlight was breathtakingand the last thing she wanted to do was look illill wait for you in the car its a magnificent night he protested still half laughing why waste it on prudery miss prim im not you dont have to strip he told her or are you worried about spoiling your beautiful new clothes im scared to nikkis horror she felt his hands grip her shoulders his body touched the soft fabric of her dress sending a sensuous shiver through her skin lifes short he said softly and youre wasting it dr russell you wouldnt really go back to bury yourself in books tonight would you let me go nikki wrenched herself away but was no match for his strength why his voice softened and the humour faded nikki life is for living god knows what tomorrow holds surely you cant ignore tonight his grip on her shoulders tightened look up the stars are magnificent the sea is ours the night is ours dr russell and i dont intend to go tamely home to bed and i cant soak it up if i know youre sitting in the car tapping your fingers on the dashboard with impatience so as far as i see it theres only one thing for it i youre going to have to come in too no nikkis cry of refusal was cut off in a staccato shriek it was ignored in one fluid movement luke marriott had dropped his hands to her waist and pulled her up into his arms there was nothing she could do nikki was cradled helplessly against him powerless to struggle heedless of the futility of her actions she crashed her fists into his bare chest it was as much use as a moth fluttering against a lighted window lukes chest showed as little impact and he strode purposefully forward put me down it was a cry of outrage no man had touched nikki russell for five years and she had no intention of permitting it now especially not this man ill put you down luke promised drily when im ready but dr russell you are withering into dust with your old house and your elderly housekeeper and your books beattie has more life in her than you and shes near seventy your housekeeper says you need something to cheer you up and ive taken it on board as a personal challenge if you think dumping me in the water will cheer me up she pummelled again and her feet lashed out but he kept right on walking implacably quiet towards the water and nikki fell silent speechless the feel of lukes hard body under her was doing crazy crazy things to her equilibrium this was mad her whole world was mad im not dumping you in the water he said cheerfully as they neared the shallows im taking you for a swim there are stingers in the water and stingrays beattie tells me the stingers wont be here for another few weeks he reassured her kindly and with the amount of noise youve been making any selfrespecting stingray will have lit out for texas ten minutes ago now shut up hold your nose and enjoy yourself but she got no further while luke had been talking he had broached the waves at the waters edge now they were surging around his waist and as nikki uttered her last word a large crest surged towards them shoulderhigh luke simply lifted his burden and deposited her neatly into the foaming surf nikki had forgotten what it would be likeshe had expected coldnessshockbutthe tropical water was almost warm it had been five long years since nikki had granted herself the indulgence of a beach swim and despite her shock and anger her overwhelming sensation was that of being welcomed back by a friend she had loved the sea now it folded her back into its clasp with a sensual pleasure that was almost a caress involuntarily nikki felt her body moving into a graceful dive turning away from the man throwing her into the wave and sweeping under the crest in a lithe arcing of her slim body oh it was lovely why had she stayed away for so long the salt water surrounded her encasing her in its cool caress cooling her overheated body taking the shards from her anger what on earth was she doing she wasnt swimming there were texts she hadnt opened yet and she was in the water cavorting she rose unsteadily to her feet her feet finding the sandy bottom her dress clung and swayed around her legs pulled by the strength of the water luke was only feet from her his eyes in the dim moonlight amused and appreciative well well he said slowly the lady can swim now why does beattie tell me you havent swum in the sea for years its none of your business nikki spluttered trying to stalk forward another wave pounded into her back making her stumble and spoiling the effect of her damping words entirely where on earth was her dignity before she could fall strong arms reached out and held her its ok to have fun luke marriott said softly looking down at the sodden girl in his arms its ok nikki well this is hardly my idea of fun nikki snapped to be half drowned you half drowned you can swim like a fish you didnt know that when you threw me under no he was staring down at her in the soft light i didnt but i could guess as i can guess a hell of a lot about you nikki russell well keep your guesswork for someone else nikki was almost crying i dont want it i dont want you anywhere near me or anyone else he said softly at least thats what you say its true no he shook his head you have needs just like the rest of us dr russell i dont well lets just see his grip suddenly tightened her body was drawn hard against his naked chest and his blond head sank to kiss her nikki froze his lips took hers to him yet they couldnt force her to respond her mouth was hard immobile and then her hands came up to shove him away it was that movement that was her undoing her fingers touched his wet bare skin and a tremor ran through her five years five long years of nothing and now this lips that searched hers hands that held her hard against him making her body feel his strengthhis maleness her dress might not have existed wet and limp it was a frail barrier between them and nikkis body knew his beneath it his hands held her tighter tighter still pulling her to compliance moulding her breasts into his muscled chest waves of salt foam swept in and out around them but the surging water just deepened the caress isolating them more against the world and to her horror nikki felt herself respond the night was magic this moment was magic the warmth of the water the light of the waning moon and the sweeping whisper of the surf all combined to drug her into euphoria she was powerless to resist powerless slowly slowly her lips parted allowing his insistent tongue to enter he tasted of the sea salt and something elsesomething of the night and the mood and the maleness of him oh god she was mad and yet she couldnt stop it was as if she were indeed drowning and this mans body was the only thing between her and the end of the world there was the ocean around them they were an island in the sea and they were stranded forever his hands fell to her hips caressing her thighs pulling her in to feel his maleness and she felt her body mould to him if she were to die now this was what heaven would feel like she arched back her neck white and satinsheened in the moonlight and from a distance she heard herself moan the sound held pain and desire and and what who could know his mouth fell to the swell of her breasts and the top button of her dress was suddenly undone a hand went in to tease the tautness of her nipples and nikki moaned again and then the sea intervened a surge of surf larger than the rest tossed itself at the entwined couple they staggered together and lukes hand fell away to save them both from falling it was enough the tiny movement of withdrawal was enough to give nikki back her senses with a gasp of horror she pulled away her hands coming up to cover the gaping nakedness of her breasts mad she was mad they were both mad and then they were staring at each other over the moondrenched sea and lukes eyes reflected what nikki was feeling there was horror in his eyes as well and nikki knew that he too had not intended what had just happened nikki lukes voice was unsteady uncertain for the first time since nikki had met him nikki shook her head and turned away ill be in the car she whispered when youre ready luke dressed swiftly on the beach while nikki sat sodden in the car waiting when he came she was hunched as far away as it was possible to be on the passenger side of the car and after one swift hard glance at his companion luke started the car and turned for home they drove home in silence lukes face was set and grim and his customary cheerfulness seemed to have deserted him it was almost as though he was as shaken as she was nikki thought bitterly though such a thing was hardly possible a love em and leave em man was luke marriott if charlottes information could be relied on which it could be nikki thought to do thisto seduce her he hadnt seduced her he had kissed her and she had responded that truth made nikki hug her arms into her breasts and shiver and luke cast a glance across at her my sweaters over the back he said impersonally and another shudder ran through nikkis body how could he how could he act as if nothing had happened maybe it was the only way to act but some emotion which nikki could not define was running between them and to talkto try for impersonal conversationwould somehow strengthen that emotion the tension scared nikki half to death and by the look of it luke also didnt know how to react good she thought nastily to get the great luke marriott off balance curiously the thought didnt help at all all it did was make her want to cry finally the little car pulled off the road into the driveway of whispering palms nikki looked out in relief at the sight of her homeher refuge if only she could turn to luke marriott and tell him it was no longer his that he should find somewhere elseeven if it did mean sleeping on a park bench she turned to him and found him watching her but before she could speak he laid a finger on her lips im sorry nikki he said gently i should never have kissed you the great luke marriott apologising nikki could hardly believe her ears and yet all it did was make her urge to burst into tears even greater and then before she could respond before she could realise what he intended his head came down and his lips touched hers it was a kiss of contritiona featherlight kiss that should have caused no feeling she had been kissed many times like that before instead nikki felt her heart turn within her she put a hand up to touch his face but he had already withdrawn and im sorry for that too he said unsteadily it wont happen again how was a girl supposed to study after that heaven knew nikki didnt she showered the salt and sand from her body donned a housecoat rinsed her sodden dress and then went to tackle her texts it was the last thing she wanted to do but she had wasted so much time what was luke doing the words of the text danced before her eyes in a meaningless jumble what on earth was she trying to study hearing difficultiesproblems with the ear she had to concentrate if she kept going like this shed fail and then what a thin insistent little voice started up in the back of her head so what if you fail theres always next year and your income doesnt depend on it what on earth was she saying this was work she was rejecting and one thing nikki russell hadnt done in the last five years was reject work it was only a matter of blocking out the thought of luke marriott the memory of his handshis lips damn the man she stared down at her page and started to read aloud forcing her tired mind back on to track tinnitusringing in the ears what on earth did she know about tinnitus do you need some help nikki jumped close to a foot in the air the house had been deathly still and she hadnt heard luke come up behind her now she nearly dropped her text as he placed his hands on the back of her chair and read over her shoulder you shouldnt be working he said conversationally but if you insist then ill give you a hand thanks but i dont need it it was as much as nikki could do to get the words out what do you need then he quizzed her gently you tell me you dont need a walk you dont need a swim you dont need help he smiled down at her his mobile eyebrows arched upwards im a paid employee dr russell so start employing me nikki shoved her book down on the desk with a bang and rose unsteadily to her feet she should be wearing something more substantial than her flimsy housecoat it was sheer cotton and not respectable in the least im employing you to attend to my normal medical duties she said tightly and imi dont want anything else he wasnt listening luke had picked up the text she had just dropped ok he said absently what are the three types of tinnitus look what are they dr russell nikki stared helplessly at him arguing was impossible the man was like a bulldozer she forced herself to focus on what he was saying tinnitus types what were they lowfrequency noise like hearing the sea she started hesitantly cause typically impacted wax or maybe otosclerosis good he approved next type highfrequency noise like a cicada nikki told him her hand was on the back of her chair as if for support but her mind was steadying as she focused on work suggestive of inner ear pathology such as ototoxicity trauma or tumour compressing the nerve and the last look you dont have to do this i wasted your time taking you swimming now im making amends next dr russell i dont think dr russell lukes voice was clipped and professional reminding nikki of nothing so much as her old professors grilling her until she was exhausted during final exams she took a deep breath she knew she had to know and it was there locked in the recess of her tired mind she brought it out and dusted it off pulsatile tinnitus she said hesitantly noise coinciding with the patients heartrate thats the one and cause i dont know then at his look of disgust she changed her mind yes i do intercranial vascular lesion for instance jugular tumour and if you cant treat tinnitus what do you do about it luke demanded and nikki stared i thought you were a surgeon she muttered surgeons never admit you cant treat something he smiled then his eyes weary but acknowledging a hit this is an exam for general practitioners he smiled not for surgeons lets assume weve done our worstall the medical possibilities are exhausted the surgeons have sent your patient back to you with a too hard label on him and your patient still has ringing in his ears what then dr russell antidepressant it can make the noise more tolerable luke agreed but then what do you leave your patient taking pills for the rest of his or her life the examiners wont like your answer dr russell nikki flushed well the accepted treatment is the use of white noise she said stiffly a noise simulator which produces something like the noise of a running stream or rain on a tin roof most unmedical but effective and thats what this exam is all about luke told her how nikki russell has learned to dispense medicine in the real world and knows when to shove the prescription pad aside it sounds as if you know it all nikki said resentfully and im just a surgeon he flipped to the next page what next nikki moved to the door im going to bed he shook his head you intended to work for at least a couple of hours before i appeared didnt you dr russell nikki nodded reluctantly but i cant now yes you can he moved back to block her exit from the door dr russell i am here to ensure you pass this exam come hell or high water and its only come dr marriott so sit down and answer questions now dr russell but sit down he said quietly but his low voice held the trace of a threat sit or ill sit you down in a way youll find distinctly undignified nikki stared up at his face but the humour was gone his eyes were stern and implacable and she did want to pass this exam if he could really help she sat to nikkis amazement the ensuing two hours were the most productive she had spent so far what had passed between them earlier in the night had somehow been driven aside it was still there latent unresolved but it was another part of them the professional partthe part that had put them through stringent medical trainingwas in play and it produced the most effective study nikki had done when the big grandfather clock in the hall struck midnight she lifted her head in amazement thank you she said simply i will go to bed now to sleep the blue eyes watching her saw too much of course the shadows let you sleep then what what do you mean unconsciously nikki clutched the neckline of her housecoat as though seeking warmth from its flimsy fabric what do you meanshadows they stand out a mile luke told her he stood stretching his long limbs he was barefoot wearing light cotton trousers and a soft shortsleeved shirt open at the throat the two of them could be taken for a married couple nikki thought suddenly and then grimaced it was a crazy scenariothe two of them alone at this hour beattie was long since gone to bed and the house was in whispering stillness the palms along the veranda which gave the house its name murmured in hushed tones in the night breeze youre crazy nikki stood too and then wished she hadnt the movement brought her too close to luke she half expected him to move back but he stayed looking down at her tell me about scott he said softly chapter five scott the name flashed before them like a cruel sword knifing at nikkis heart how had luke tell me about him he repeated gently what sort of questioning was this nikkis eyes widened she stared up at luke with anger flashing but lukes eyes were reflective and calm no she whispered luke was between nikki and the door nikki put out a hand to shove him aside but he caught and held it her hand lay in his warmth against warmth and nikkis anger turned to an overwhelming feeling of distress she pulled again but the grip tightened look its none of your business she managed i dont know how you found out about scott beattie he smiled how else well beattie has no right to talk about me beattie charlotte and now you nikkis voice rose in anger all of you think you can interfere with my life well i dont want it i dont need your interrogation you dont need anybody lukes eyes were still calm the deep blue penetrating into the depths of her heart his look was like a redhot torch burning in nikki had never felt anything like it in her life before this man could see parts of her that had remained hidden for yearsthat she had sworn would never again be revealed you do though nikki he said softly and whatever is hurting needs to be talked of so tell me no he shook his head nikki im only here for three weeks then i get out of your life forever but for those three weeks i intend getting rid of the shadowsor at least having a damned good try you need someone to talk to so talk to me i dont want to it was practically a wail and luke smiled yes you do he told her and pulled her firmly in to lie against him his hand came up to run through her mass of goldenred curls and his fingers sent warmth and reassurance through her body beattie tells me youve been carrying this for five years its too long to carry bitterness and hate so tell me nikki held her body stiffly resentfully but the fingers did their work insidiously his hand moved against her head sending messages of reassurance and comfort through her let the bitterness go his hand was telling her tell me tell someone spill it out and he wouldnt release her until she did scott was my husband she said stiffly reluctantly but i suppose beattie told you that and he left you yes it was crazy talking to this man cradled against his shoulder like a child needing comfort she didnt feel like a child though nikki felt every inch a woman and her body was achingly aware of his and yetand yet she could talk to him this was a comfort she had never knowna peace she had never been blessed with scott and i grew up together she said slowly she was talking into the soft folds of lukes shirt his face was above hers she could feel the beating of his heart there was no need to talk above a whisper scotts father was a fisherman she continued but scott hankered for life away from here we went to university together in brisbanescott to do law and me to do medicine she sighed scotts motiveswell im not sure why he wanted to do lawbut my mother had severe rheumatoid arthritis and ever since i was tiny id been frustrated by not being able to help so we went to brisbanetwo kids from a tiny townand we just kept on together scott was always there just as hed been when i was small your parents were wealthy nikki stiffened in lukes hold but his fingers didnt pause in their gentle stroking he was way ahead of her he could read her mind this man it seemed that she didnt need to tell him anything he knew my father was the son of a british peer nikki said bitterly he had a fight with his father came to australia when he was a teenager married my mother and stayed money was never a problem for usor at least it never appeared a problem dad was lord peter russell and he never stopped using the lord my mothers family left us whispering palms but my father always implied that he was humouring her by living in her childhood home rather than something much more grand my father didnt work he spent heaps on my mother and me and he made it sound as though he had lots for me to inherit thats why thats why scott asked you to marry him nikki writhed in lukes grasp but his hold didnt ease instead it tightened and the waves of warmth and reassurance increased tell me nikki he said of course it was why he asked me to marry him nikki said reluctantly but i was too stupid to see i didnt realise that the only reason someone so vibrantso aliveas scott would want to be with me was because he was on to something he couldnt get any other way she shook her head and angry tears started behind her eyes scott and i were married while we were still at university she continued bitterly we were happy for a while and then just as i graduated my mother died and my fatherthe man who i always thought was the strong onecouldnt face what was left behind he took what he believed was the only way out luke gave an almost soundless whistle tough he said softly it was nikki put a hand up to wipe away angry tears but luke was before her his hand taking the tears away from her eyes but it got worse after his funeral they gave me a note which hed left with his lawyer she took a deep breath my father left a note saying the money had finished a couple of years earlierthat he couldnt face life without money and he was deep in debt hed managed to hide it until my mother had died but nownow the only way for him was suicide and scott lukes voice was grim scott nikki laughed a harsh tight little sound that was caught by lukes nearness at first scott was so supportive he was marvellous when my mother died and when they found my father i remember thinking at least i have scott with scott i can face this only thenthe night of the funeralthe lawyer gave me the note and scott and i read it together and then and then we sat down and went through my fathers desk and realised that after coping with the bills there would be nothing i see luke did see from his voice nikki knew she didnt have to say the rest it came out though it seemed as if it had to at first i thought scott was just upset for mebut thenthen i said that at least we still had whispering palms it was my mothers sheshe must have known about my fathers debts the house was left in trust for ourfor my children so it couldnt be sold so at least we had a home and scott wasnt impressed nikki shrugged listlessly scott said he was damned if he was working hard for the rest of his life he said hed been conned he said hed been trapped into marriagethat my father had led him to believe there were millions and that much was true nikki admitted my father had always talked big and scott well scott just stood up at the end of it and said thats it nikki this is where i get off and he walked out just like that just likejust like my father this is where i get off nikki fell silent she stood motionless against luke while his fingers did their work i never saw him again she whispered finally he wrote once to ask for a divorce but that was all well lukes fingers had stilled but now they started again that must have been some week out of your life nikki she shrugged in that week i had my pregnancy confirmed in that weekwell it was the week i found out what the world is really all about what scott was all about luke said grimly you cant judge the world by your fathers weakness and scotts appalling behaviour you cant nikki he put her away from him then his hands holding her shoulders at arms length allowing him to look into her teardrenched eyes believe me you cant and for a moment she almost believed him nikki looked up into the depths of those eyes and found her world shifting she could drown in those eyes she could let herself go she could be as big a fool over this man as she had been over scott then from nowhere charlottes words came crashing into her head to haul her back to reality luke marriott had every junior nurse some senior ones and a few female doctors besides making fools of themselves every time he walked past hes broken more hearts than i care to name charlottes words echoed over and over again until nikki came to her senses luke marriott wasnt breaking her heart she wasnt going to make a fool of herself not again she couldnt bear it with an angry thrust she put herself away from him and whirled to face the door i know i cant keep judging she said bitterly but i can make darned sure im not such a fool again if you dont trust then you cant love he said softly she turned back to face him well who can i trust she demanded are you to be trusted i dont even know why the hell youre here luke marriott you should be sitting back in cairns with your adoring nursing staff and your highly paid surgical career thats right he said equitably i should be so why the hell arent you nikki had gone past the point of courtesy this man had left her raw and exposed and she wanted to lash backat any cost why arent you there what are you running from im not running from anything no nikki gave a bitter laugh something had to go wrong in your life to make you give up such a lucrative profession as your surgical career ive told you my pathetic past luke marriott now you show me your shadows lukes eyes darkened for a moment nikki thought he would walk out of the room in anger without replying then his look changed fair enough he said softly you did tell me so so why did you leave cairns in such a hurry the words came out slowly as nikkis anger died suddenly she wasnt sure she wanted to know his reason and when it came she was sure of it there was a very good reason he said slowly i had cancer cancer the word echoed around and around the small room nikki stared across at luke as if he had physically struck her cancer she said blankly thats right she took a deep breath whatwhat sort hodgkins disease it had to be she thought dully hodgkins disease was a cancer of the lymph glands often presenting in otherwise healthy young males nikki had seen a couple of cases in her practice one had died and nikki still cringed at the tragic waste yes ii see no he shook his head and his eyes were suddenly faraway i bet you dont see dr russell only someone whos faced cancer themselves can see what a diagnosis like that can do to you it mustit must have been frightening he shrugged what do you think he closed his eyes momentarily i dont think ive ever been so scared in my whole life nikki moistened her lips searching for the right words in the end she found refuge in medicinea doctors approach how did you find it i had night sweats he said shortly id been working too damned hard and was feeling pretty run down then i started waking drenched with sweat for a while i told myself i was imagining things then i found a swollen lymph node in my neck weight loss no he smiled without humour i was living too well for that stillnikkis mind was racing without weight loss hed caught it early so you had tests in cairns no luke grimaced i can put two and two together pretty fast even if i was hoping to hell i was making fourteen i was at the end of a job in cairns an oncologist friend rod olsing who worked with me for a while in cairns had just moved to sydney so i rang him and took myself down there why he shrugged again his habitual smile was gone replaced with bleak remembrance cowardice if you like in cairns id been successful and totally in control suddenly i was badly out of control and i couldnt face it so i went south and faced it there and it was bad nikkis voice had softened in automatic sympathy yeah it was bad he gave a short laugh and theres nothing like lying in a strange hospital thinking youre facing death for making you look at life or what youve been calling life you had radiotherapy and chemotherapy luke dug his hands deep in his pockets and turned away the xrays and ct scan were clear thank god the glands in the neck were the only ones affected but the night sweats made me stage b instead of stage a hence they gave me the works nikki nodded the appearance of a single tumour would usually be treated just by radiotherapy the night sweats would mean chemotherapy though involuntarily her eyes went to lukes shock of blond hair and he caught her look as he turned back to face her its grown back nicely he said grimly touching his hair thats the least of the sideeffects nikki nodded sympathetically but youve been in remission now for for close on two years but that means theres every chance youre cured the curerate for hodgkins is over seventy per cent if its caught at stage one i know dr russell believe me i know well then nikki took a deep breath well then why arent you getting on with life again i am by running im not running so what are you doing here isnt your career centred on the city youll never get anywhere doing threeweek locums he shook his head on the contrary dr russell ill never get anywhere by being a successful city surgeon he touched her hair lightly with his finger and now if youll excuse me dr russell your locum is going to bed to bed but not to sleep nikki lay for hours watching the light of the full moon gradually move across her ceiling the big ceiling fan whirred lazily mesmerically over her head usually it soothed her to sleep but not tonight hodgkins diseasethe prognosis ran around nikkis tired mind as though she were being examined tomorrow even with the added symptom of night sweats lukes prognosis was good if hed been in remission for two years he was nearly out of danger nearly and then something hit her tired mind making her sit up in bed and turn on her light hodgkins diseasetreatment was she right suddenly it was imperative that she know and know right now now padding softly through the darkened house she found the text she wanted and returned to bed where was it treatment of hodgkinsdiagnosis managementchemotherapy what regime had they used nikki flicked the pages over missing what she wanted in her urgency and having to return there were two chemotherapy regimes listed the first was moppnikki stared blankly at the printed page mopp is associated with significant toxicity including infertilitymopp therapy produces nearuniversal sterility in males mopp wasnt warranted though not for stage b the lesser regime was abvd adriamycin bleomycin vinblastine and dacarbazinereduced risk of sterilityrecommended in stage b surely theyd used abvd and not mopp even soeven so there was a strong chance that luke marriott was now sterilethat he would no longer be able to father children how would such an outcome hit a man who exuded masculinity as luke marriott did to know that he could never father a child it was all just too hard there was too much going on in nikkis tired mind for her to assess what she had been told somehow her eyes managed to close and she fell into a troubled dreamfilled sleep she woke to laughter nikki stirred her eyes moving automatically to her bedside clock it was close on seven later than she usually woke but in her exhausted troubled state the night before she had not set the alarm the laughter sounded again the high tinkling sound of amy having fun for a moment nikki frowned thinking how rarely she had heard that sound lately why and then she heard a splash and nikki rose to her feet before she was aware she was doing so her feet flying to the door amy wasnt allowed in the pool by herself she knew the rules it wasnt safeshe flung open the french windows stepped through into the soft morning sunlight and stopped dead amy wasnt alone in the pool luke marriott was there too his arms holding the laughing little girl high above the water and then swooping her down like a bird so that her body flitted through the water and then swept up again showering the man beneath her with sunlit water do it again amy screamed do it again and luke obliged laughing with her was this her daughter nikki put her hand to her eyes as if to rub the shreds of dreaming from them amy was a serious grave little girl who seldom laughed she took her life seriously did amy or maybe that wasnt true as amy had been brought up in a house with an elderly housekeeper and a mother who distrusted the world maybe there just werent enough opportunities for laughter amy looked up then and saw her mother look at me she screamed happily look at me mummy dr lukes teaching me to dive look at me dive do it again dr luke luke marriott looked up at nikki his eyes quizzing her dangerously maybe your mummy had better go put on her swimming costume and join us shed be more respectable that way with a gasp nikki looked down her nightgown was a short soft cotton one that was years old and its age meant that it was almost transparently thin and the sun was behind her she put her hands up to cover her breasts and backed away mummy do come in amys voice pleaded with her please mummy were having a really really lot of fun amy i have to work nikki said uncertainly you and luke are enjoying yourselves without me i always enjoy myself without you amy said sadly but if dr luke is here too oh helpthe tiny niggle of guilt which her daughters laughter caused now rose to overwhelm her i always enjoy myself without you they were both watching her nowman and child amy was nestled in lukes arms as though she belonged she watched her mother with eyes that expected to be rebuffed lukes eyes gave away nothing ok nikki swallowed ill come in she was rewarded instantly with amys whoop of joy yes she yelled mummys coming in mummys coming in hurry mummy the waters beeyoootiful she arched back and plummeted her small body downwards under water and emerged choking and laughing well get mummy in wont we dr luke its your mummys decision luke grinned we have nothing to do with it oh yeah nikki said to herself grimly stalking in to find her bathing costume this place had been sane before luke marriott arrived the man was turning their lives upsidedown five minutes in the pool she promised herself a token to appease amy and then work only of course it wasnt five minutes the morning sun was hot by the time nikki slipped selfconsciously into the water and the water was a balm to her tired body she had slept badly and was thick with bad dreams and selfdoubt somehow the sun and the water and her daughters laughter dispelled the black cloud luke was teaching amy dead mans float taking his duty very seriously nikki floated aimlessly on her back watching man and child enjoy each other this was what scott should be doing enjoying his daughter loving his daughter instead of which she had written to him but scott had never even acknowledged that his little girl existed it was a bitter thought but this morning it didnt seem as bitter as it usually did somehow the sting was eased because luke was here the thought drifted around nikkis mind as she floated and she had to acknowledge that while luke was here she had no place in her mind for scott for the first time scotts face blurred in her mind as though the memory was fading the laughing eyesthe mocking smile where were they gone with scott replaced suddenly with eyes that laughed with a sympathy that was not feignedthat mocked but mocked with kindness and compassion she looked to where luke was bending over the small wet amy holding her still while the child tried desperately to keep her body floating kindnessthis wasnt some errant playboy making a line for her this was a man who genuinely wanted her small daughter to feel good about herself and then his eyes shifted to her and his smile faded a little feel better for your swim dr russell nikki found her feet and stood upright breastdeep in water thank you idid better be settling down to work and she was absurdly shy somehow having trouble making her voice work it was sowell so darned domestic to be in the waterthe two of them with the child and youd better be thinking about morning surgery she managed not yet it was beatties voice cutting across the morning stillness nikki looked up to see the housekeeper smiling down at them she was carrying a vast loaded tray pancakes she called i saw you out here and decided you might like a special breakfast pancakes amy surfaced from her float still bubbling with excitement she looked from luke to nikki pancakes for breakfast we havent had pancakes for breakfastever she looked anxiously across at her mother as if expecting this treat to be somehow snatched away will you both stay to eat them the child was used to nikki eating on the run please of course we will luke promised holding out his hand to tow amy to the side of the pool wont we nikki and he held out his other hand it would be churlish not to take his hand amy stared at her mother waiting for nikki to take the proffered hand nikki wavered helplessly come on dr russell luke said gently pancakes await us and im not one to hesitate where pancakes are concerned are you still the hand was out to avoid it nikki had to walk right by brushing him aside amy watched the sun was warm on her face nikkis body was cool in the water but all of a sudden the water wasnt enough it was as if she was flushing all over slowly she brought up her hand lukes eyes were still watchful the laughter gone in a slow considered movement he brought his fingers closer and closed on hers the three were entwined man woman and child come on amy luke said slowly lets take your mother to breakfast somehow that morning nikki managed a little study but little was the operative word even with her contact lenses her eyes refused to focus on the books and when she forced herself to read the words aloud they failed to make sense what on earth was the matter with her amy was at kindergarten beattie was shopping and luke was running morning surgery she had the house to herself and she had less than three weeks to the exam so work she muttered savagely make yourself work she stared back at the page but all she saw was lukeluke lifting her daughter high in the air smiling up at amy smiling across at her im going nuts nikki whispered i cant cant be falling in love the words suddenly slammed into her head and stayed falling in love with luke marriott what on earth was she thinking of you just feel sorry for him she told herself savagely because of the cancer but that wasnt true at all this morning the fact that luke marriott had suffered from hodgkins disease had been thrust away into some far recess of her mind she hadnt been thinking of it while she had been in the pool all she had been thinking of was him all she had been aware of was his bodyhis presencebinding her to her small daughter entwining them into a threesome like a family oh good grief she had to stop this luke marriott was here for another few weeks and then he would be goneforever just like scott not like scott her mind suddenly rebelled refusing to link the two men and she stood abruptly she was getting nowhere at all if she went on like this she was going to fail this damned exam the phone cut across the silence and she answered it gratefully anything to get her mind away from these dangerous thoughts it didnt help though it was luke on the end of the line nikki im seeing sandra mears at twelve he told her id like you to be present but i know im covering for you but sandra needs someone whos going to provide ongoing support if i persuade her to trust me and then leave shell be no better off than before ive done the groundwork but i want you to be involved so who was whose boss nikki held the receiver back and stared at it she was used to giving the orders he was right though her examher studyingwas important but not more important than the longterm happiness of the mears family ill be there she told him slowly what have you done so far ive another patient in the waitingroom he said curtly i cant talk now but id like you here at twelve yes sir nikki thought the words but wasnt given a chance to utter them the line was dead chapter six by the time she reached the clinic nikki had worked herself up to anger it was the only feeling she was capable of defining and it covered a number of other emotions she was trying to dismiss luke marriott might have been ill but it hadnt stopped him being autocratic he said jump and he expected the world to jump he should have asked not ordered maybe i should dock his wages nikki thought humourlessly on the grounds of insolence the thought gave her a fleeting ray of comfort putting the relationship back on a purely professional basis she climbed out of her little car selfconsciously smoothed down the next frock from charlottes neverending supply and made her way indoors her receptionist met her hi doctor mary said happily wow you look gorgeous she grinned i dont blame you our new locums worth dressing up for isnt he im not dressing up for any locum nikki snapped but her receptionist simply arched her eyebrows and grinned mrs mears is in with him now she smiled the children are all over at the hospital and ive cleared an hour if you need it she held up her fingers showing them crossed good luck sandras not going to take to interference very kindly she no longer has a choice nikki said sandra was sitting in an easychair in the surgery luke had come from behind the desk and was sitting beside her they looked up as nikki knocked and entered luke giving her a small professional smile and sandra looking downright scared i asked dr russell to join us luke said gently im only here for another two and a half weeks and youll need nikki for longer than that nikkithe use of her name jolted her and nikki flashed luke a look of annoyance before sitting he didnt seem to notice hows karen he asked sandra shes fine sandras voice was apprehensive at least did you go and see her no sandra shook her head defensively ii went and talked to the sister in charge she saysshe says karens ok why didnt you go and see her she wouldnt want to see me i think she would luke frowned sandra what do you think karen would say to you now if you went to see her nothing nothing you mean she wouldnt be upset that you hurt her no sandra said bitterly shell justshell just look at me youd like it better if she yelled at you well sandras head sank down so that she was staring at the carpet ii hurt her so what are you going to do about it lukes voice was unemotional and firm it was as if he were asking what sandra intended to have for dinner that night that she should have something was as inevitable as the fact that she was now forced to take action sandra raised tearfilled eyes i dont know she said hopelessly i dont sandra why are you living in that dump it wasnt a criticism just a statement of fact and nikkis eyes flew to luke she would never have been so blunt ii cant afford anything else but youve the supporting mothers benefit ive been on to the department of social security here they tell me what you get should cover one of the housing commission homes down near the river theyre basic but theyre clean and wellkeptand with your skill as a housekeeper youd get one looking great in no time and theyre right in town the children could walk to school and you could walk to the shops but but what sandra swallowed my husbandmy husband ran up debts before he left im paying them off but so farso far ive done no more than cover the interest does your husband pay any child support for the first time sandras dark eyes flashed anger it was as if something deep within her was hiddenand as though she was afraid of exposing her hatred of course not she said bitterly he and his girlfriend are further southhes a canecutter and makes a heap but im left with nothing but his debts his debts and the kids luke nodded but youd like some help ive no hope of getting it sandras voice flattened again he spends as fast as he earns no luke smiled then the new rules require all employeeseven casual workersto register tax file numbers with employers wherever they work and theres no way your husband can be working without doing that all we have to do is ask social security to place a garnishee on his wages youll be paid before he is and well ask for his debts to be transferred to his name if youve sole responsibility for the children there should be no problem there he grinned and hell find his debtors have no trouble garnisheeing even more of his wages your husband might find himself with a little less easy money in the future mrs mears and you might find things a whole lot easier sandra stared hope and disbelief warring visibly in her tired eyes ifif i lived in town i could sell the car thats right but sandra swallowed folks around here think im a tart because i got pregnant before i was married theyd give me a hard time nikki moved then she rose and walked around the table sandra there are lots like you in the town she said gently everyone has their ghosts you can either move to a bigger city where you can be anonymous or stay here look people in the eye and ride it out youll find history is forgotten as long as you act as though its forgotten honest sandra looked up and smiled you had a hard time too didnt you doctor i sure did nikki said ruefully but i still wanted to stay a small town has some good things going for it when it comes to raising children she touched sandras shoulder and there are supports here that you wont find in the city if you accept them i should have before this sandra hesitated looking from luke to nikki if id admitted i was in trouble earlier i could have got helpi wouldnt have hurt karen maybe youre asking for help now luke said gently thats all that matters he rose as well handing sandra a slip of paper the housing commission tells me theres a house vacant at the moment go and have a look before you commit yourself but but what he was smiling down at the girl daring her with his eyes this is going to take courage sandra but you have it i know it and so does karen karen he nodded your little girl has faith in you youre all she has sandra can i take her home luke shook his head not yet you need time to sort yourself out and karen needs you at your best until you move youll be worried and anxious and thats the time when karen is most likely to be at risk isnt it sandra hung her head yes she whispered but i wouldnt we cant risk that lukes voice was firm karen doesnt need hospital but she does need care im not fussed about involving community services and sending her to cairns for foster care i suggest that she spend the next couple of weeks with us at whispering palms nikkis eyes widened she opened her mouth to protest but lukes eyes were on her hard and challenging we have a great housekeeper a comfortable bed and a little girl wholl enjoy your daughters company you can pop in and see her once a day but you can have two weeks time out from each other he smiled itll make you realise just how much you do care for your eldest daughter and how much you risk losing if you dont put her first i dont risk losing yes you do lukes smile faded sandra if i reported this break to community services theyd have no choice but to place karen in foster care now what were offering is an alternative do you accept sandra looked wildly from nikki to luke and back again butbut you dont want my daughter shell be a nuisance wed love to have your daughter as our guest luke said firmly whispering palms is built for children isnt it dr russell nikki took a deep breath she looked down at sandra and read the desperate need in her eyes this woman had reaped a harvest more bitter than nikkis from her relationship with her man and nikki could help luke was right whispering palms is built for children she repeated slowly she smiled at sandra and her voice firmed wed love to have karen you could have asked me nikki barely waited until sandra had closed the door behind her before her anger burst forth for heavens sake luke marriott who do you think you are its my house and karen needs it and you need it and so does half the population of north queensland as far as i know and you intend inviting them home home my home not your home luke marriott my home nikki russell do you know how extraordinarily beautiful you are when youre angry nikki slumped back into her chair and gazed up at the man before her in fulminating fury if you think you can worm your way around me with your insincere compliments to get you what you wantyou dont care do you for your privacy he smiled not a lot it seems youre taking enough care of that for both of us just because i like keeping to myself and blocking the world out he shook his head nikki amy needs the rest of the world even if you dont luke marriott i am not your patient no no well then his smile deepened and he pulled his white coat from his shoulders hanging it behind the door if youre not my patient then you can come to lunch with me hungry dr russell no liar he said equitably coming or do i have to sling you over my shoulder and take you by force you wouldnt dare once more the irrepressible smile try me dr russell maybe wed both enjoy it nikki glared lukes smile didnt slip she placed one foot tentatively forward and lukes smile deepened even further he would enjoy it nikki realised hed enjoy carrying her past her patients and receptionist with no thought at all for her dignitywith no thought for the fact that she was here forever in this town and had her reputation to consider im going back to whispering palms for lunch she said halfheartedly but he simply shook his head and took her hand beattie packed me enough lunch for three he told her i want sea sun sandwiches and swim in that order lets go dr russell i dont if youre worried about your precious virtue you neednt worry he smiled were taking karen karen nikki said blankly but shes in hospital for the next three minutes he agreed were taking her to the beach for lunch and then youre taking her home to whispering palms luke marriott do you have any idea what youre doing to me regardless of listening ears on the other side of the door nikkis voice rose hysterically i have exams in two and a half weeks my house is filling with strangers i never allow my work to impinge on my private life to take a child home so what would you do dr russell the hand holding nikkis suddenly tightened and lukes smile slipped would you send karen home to her mother before sandras been given a chance to sort her life out or would you put her on a plane to cairns to be put into a foster home there she knows you and she trusts you sandra can pop in and see her when she feels like it more people in my home yes the smile crept back with any luck by the time i leave that place will start feeling like a home lets go dr russell karen was still in bed when they reached the hospital propped up by so many pillows that her wan little face all but disappeared she didnt smile as they approachedjust watched them gravely hows my girl luke smiled as he reached his small patient his hand came down and ruffled the short cropped hair feeling better can i go home karens voice was lifeless and uninterested her eyes flicked over to the door as though she was expecting someone else to come karen were going to hold on to you a while longer luke sank down to sit on the bed he took karens small hand in his and his body blocked her view of the door he looked down silent until he was sure he had her full attention karen your mum broke your arm didnt she the child stared up silent and luke nodded you dont have to tell us he said but its not you who needs the treatmentits your mum youre taking her away no lukes hands came up to grip karens slight shoulders karen youve seen a balloon burst havent you whats happening to your mother at the moment is very much like what happens when you blow a balloon up too far she has so many worriesand each one is like a puff into a balloon the worries build up and build up until the last little puff makes her explode that little puff might be just a child coughing at the wrong momentor tea burningor even just a draught from an open door its not the person who caused the tiny puff whos at fault but the explosion comes just the same you meanyou mean when she gets angry i mean thats what happens when your mum hurts you lukes eyes didnt leave the child your dad isnt giving your mum the money she needs to support you she cant afford to buy the food you need the littlies are causing her too much work shes lonely and shes worried and all these things are just building up and building up to the point where she hurts you she feels dreadful about it karen but i know she doesnt come its because shes ashamed karen can you understand that karens big eyes filled with tears she looked wildly up at nikki the doctor she knew and trusted she doesnt have to be ashamed and she shouldnt be worried i can look after her i try i know you do nikki moved swiftly to give the little girl a hard hug but youve been trying on your own for long enough now its time for dr marriott and me to take a turn what your mum needs now is a rest and a chance to sort herself out so while she does that shes agreed to let you come to stay with us for a holiday us karen looked through her tears from nikki to luke and then back again yes nikkis voice firmed she didnt look at luke ok he was right this little girl needed whispering palms more than nikki needed her privacy you know amymy little girland mrs gilchrist weve a swimmingpool and lots of toys and books your arm can heal while your mum finds a new place for you to live a new place yes luke grinned and pulled back karens covers a perfectly splendid new home where you and your mum and brothers and sister can all live happily ever after now miss mears we have a picnic lunch to eat and a quick swim before dr russell takes you to your temporary accommodation but karen looked up wildly i wont be able to swim i havent got my bathers andand you said i mustnt get my plaster wet luke shook his head solemnly no problem he glanced around to the ward nurse sister here will provide us with a large plastic bag and a rubber band for your arm and as for the restwell if youre wearing a plastic bag you cant be accused of skinnydipping can you karen looked from one doctor to another her teardrenched eyes widened and then very softly she giggled so what was happening to her nice quiet study period nikki sat in her study and gazed out over the pool amy and karen were sitting under the vast grapevine discussing the merits of alternative ways of dressing barbie dolls it was evidently a very solemn topicboth little girls were taking the matter very seriously despite herself nikki smiled it hadnt occurred to her to have children here to play with amy and nownow she saw how much pleasure amy could get from it and karen too karen had enjoyed her picnic to the full laughing at lukes silly jokes and thoroughly enjoying frolicking in the shallows with him later though as nikki had tucked her into bed for an afternoon sleep the shadows had come back over her face i want to go home shed whispered not yet sweetheart nikki had told her how to tell a child that her mother was still so tense that she might strike her again they couldnt risk it then as tired tears had welled in karens eyes amy had appeared clutching her teddy and a battered stuffed monkey i have to have an afternoon sleep too shed announced and i thought i could sleep with karen ifif i let her use monkey it was the perfect solution karen had moved over in the big bed and the two little girls cuddled down together they were asleep in minutes so luke was right luke marriott was always right nikki had thought bitterly he could organise everyones life except his own she had picked up herabandoned text and stared at it uselessly shed still been staring two hours later when the sounds through the house had announced that the girls were awake and ready for fun the exam was starting to seem irrelevant so what if i fail it shed asked herself and then blinked what had she just said she looked out of the window as the two little girls emerged to the poolside as she watched beattie brought out a tray of lemonade and biscuits nikki saw her glance doubtfully across to nikkis window shed be wondering whether to disturb her nikki knew and suddenly nikki threw her text aside it was time for a few minutes with the children she decided some things were more important than exams a few minutes an hour and a half later nikki was still by the poolside amys entire collection of dolls was dressed to the young ladies satisfaction and the young ladies themselves were clothed in a variety of evening wear supplied by nikki they looked amazing both had high heels stockings down around their ankles mock pearls and diamonds and enough makeup to supply an entire chorus line luke arrived home just as nikki was lining up the giggling girls and assorted dolls to be photographed for posterity wow he said reverently emerging from the french doors to the astounding sight a real bevy of beauties were gorgeous dr luke amy announced importantly arent we you certainly are luke grinned he picked amy up and swung her high causing her stockings to fall down around his face ugh what are these theyre my pantyhose amy said indignantly making a futile clutch as they fell i dont know how mummy keeps em up mummy has hips luke said grinning wickedly across at nikki ample hips is what you need my girl are mummys ample they certainly are nikki gasped without thinking she abandoned her camera scooped down and brought up a huge handful of pool water directing it straight at luke it hit him full in the face karens jaw dropped but amy crowed in delight yay mum she yelled do it again im not sure i could nikki said nervously backing away from the pool luke grinned he picked up a towel and carefully wiped his face his shirtfront and tie were sodden mummy growls at me when i get my clothes wet amy giggled are you going to growl at mummy of course i am luke said severely he frowned direfully down at the two children what do you think i should do to her nothing karen said nervously but amy was made of sterner stuff i think she should be spiffspifflicated she pronounced oh yes lukes straight face broke and what exactly is spifflication im not sure amy confessed i thinki think its sort of like tickling luke grinned i can do that he agreed he turned back to nikki prepare to be spifflicated dr russell dont you touch me in front of the children luke finished for her smoothly of course not you have your dignity to maintain i only ever spifflicate in private beattie the housekeeper appeared from nowhere she had obviously missed nothing of the proceedings yes beattie gilchrist was close to laughter fighting to keep a straight face is dinner something that will spoil its casserole dr luke would it ruin your day if i told you i was taking dr russell off to dinner and hence to a fate of spifflication beattie chuckled delightedly of course not she beamed the casserole will taste better than ever tomorrow night and me and the girls will cook ourselves hamburgers you wont mind will you girls no way amy shouted but karen looked troubled luke crossed to the little girl and knelt down what is it karen he asked gently you wontyou wont hurt dr russell will you the child asked tremulously she didnt mean to get you wet dont you believe it our dr russell did so mean to get me wet luke took karens hands in his and gave them a reassuring squeeze but no karen i may tickle dr russell until she screams for mercy but i wont hurt her not now not ever i dont hurt people thats a promise the laughter had gone from his voice he met the little girls eyes and what she read in his seemed to reassure her the corners of her mouth struggled to smile i like hamburgers she said simply then thats settled luke turned to nikki go and get yourself into a pretty dress dr russell ill take off one sodden shirt and thenthen prepare to meet your doom but i like hamburgers too nikki said weakly this was going too fast for her she had no intention of going out to dinner with this man beattie if you were doomed to spifflication where would you want to eat your last meal luke demanded ignoring nikkis protest and turning to the housekeeper beattie chuckled only one place to eat out hereabouts she told him the fishing coop runs a club the diningroom looks out over the harbour its real pretty and the foods not bad either it sounds just what the doctor ordered luke smiled ok dr russell you have ten minutes to prepare yourself lets go the man was like a bulldozer nikki thought grimly she stood in her bedroom and gazed helplessly at the mirror a meal outto be taken out by a man to be taken out by luke marriott nikki closed her eyes as a wave of confusion ran through her what was happening she should be staying at home studying she should put her hands on her not so ample hips and tell luke marriott exactly what she thought of him if he hadnt been ill she would do she decided but it was hardly fair when hed been through such a bad time thats not the reason and you know it she told her reflection out loud you want to go out no you dont a little voice inside her protested yes you do nikki thought back to luke marriott kneeling before the troubled karen and a feeling of warmth flooded over her this man was kind and caring and this man was trouble capital t trouble he would be gone in a couple of weeks he was transienta transient presence in a life which so far hadnt been all that much fun why shouldnt i go out then nikki demanded of her reflection seize the day live for the moment youre talking rubbish that inner voice asserted oh leave me alone nikki turned her back on her wiser self and stared into the wardrobe she had hung the clothes charlotte had sent her and then ignored all that she could now she crossed to pull the racks apart charlotte was never a girl to do things by halves she had taken nikkis wardrobe as a personal challenge omitting nothing and there was something just right for tonight something just right for a first and last date a night to forget she was dr nikki russell who took the world seriously a night to forget the loneliness of the rest of her lifetaking a deep breath nikki slipped the fabric over her shoulders the dress was soft white silk loosefitting but clinging with the sheerness of the fabric it hung low across her breasts the soft sleeves cut away so that they exposed her slender arms the dress fell in delicate folds around her thighs and down to swirl around her long legs a ribbon of palest green looped around the waist and down to hint at its presence among the folds as she moved the dress turned her into someone she wasnt or someone she had once been but had forgotten existed nikki stood before the mirror and stared unconsciously she brought her hand up to gather her hair into a loose curling knot of flame the action made her seem younger and more vulnerable she let it fall and then in swift decision put it up again before she had time to change her mind she pinned it and turned from the mirror she had done it she was ready wow it was amy bursting through the door her new friend tagging behind wow mummy youre beautiful isnt she beautiful karen my mums prettier karen said stoutly butbut youre really pretty dr russell is she ever luke marriott was standing in the passage he too had changed into a dark suit which made nikki see just why he had caused so many problems among the nursing staff in the city dropdead handsome the man was she looked up blushed and looked away again what on earth was she doing have a really good time now amy ordered them what time will you be home by midnight mother nikki laughed swooping her small daughter up to give her a kiss dont wait up for me dont spifflicate her too hard will you dr luke amy warned i make no promises luke grinned his arm came around nikki in a proprietorial gesture vengeance is mine dr russell for tonight youre at my mercy chapter seven if there was to be only one evening left in the world this could well be the evening it was a night to forget the past forget the future and just be something had snapped inside nikkis controlled head who knew what had caused it was it the culmination of long years of work and worry charlottes lovely dress floating around her slim form the balmy tropical night or the presence of the man at her sidea man whose smile made her heart do crazy jumps inside her body and made her forget that she was dr nikki russell with the weight of the world on her shoulders which of these things was causing the feeling of euphoria creeping over her nikki didnt know and she no longer cared the night was hers and somehow for luke it seemed the same the world was put on hold they were alone together and nothing else mattered miraculously there was a table available in the best part of the cluba sheltered alcove with windows looking out over the lights of the harbour to the sea beyond the waiter showed them to their seats with an astonished second look at the towns transformed lady doctor i didnt know you existed his glance said and lukes hand tightened on nikkis waist as he guided her forward the ladys mine for the night his hand said keep off nikki should have shrugged the hand aside but she wouldnt not tonight afterwards nikki couldnt remember a thing theyd talked about inconsequential nonsense she suspected luke kept her in a ripple of laughter as they ate the tiny pieces of calamary still tasted of the sea and of the lemon groves in the hills above the townand the grilled whiting melted in nikkis mouth blending in with her perfect night he made her seem the most desirable woman in the world nikki thought and wondered fleetingly how many other women had been given the same treatment it didnt matter not tonight tonight was hers they ate huge red strawberries and farmfresh cream drank their coffee and then rose reluctantly to leave miraculously the beeper in lukes pocket stayed silent it was as if the world were holding its breath a walk i think luke told her as they emerged to the starfilled night im not ready for bed yet dr russell and i dont think you are either nno it was true nikki didnt want this evening to end in the morning she would be back with her books and luke would be back to being her locum and the world would have shifted on to its rightful axis but not yetso they walked along the sand barefoot with shoes dangling in their free hands one hand of each was in use linked unconsciously with the other they walked far from the lights of the jetty and of the town around the headland where the beach stretched out for mile upon endless mile of deserted sand the moonlight played on their faces from somewhere a long way off nikki heard herself talking of her childhoodtelling this man things she had told no oneof a lonely childhood with eccentric parents in a house too big for herbut with love and laughter always present and luke talked tooa littleof his family in melbourne and his life beforebefore he knew he had cancer it was as if the last few years were taboo they werent spoken of the night was magical and ugly realities werent allowed to intrude and finally their wandering feet came to a halt and nikkis voice fell silent luke let his shoes drop to the sand removed nikkis sandals from her grasp and then took her shoulders turning her to face him in the moonlight so what now my lovely nikki he said softly are you going to let the world in again is your life going to have ended when scott walked out the door i dont you cant let that happen he told her his fingers tightening on her shoulders im pushing you hard but when i go will you close the door on life again retire back into your parents house and shut the world out when i gothe words hung between them and nikki was aware of a rush of desolation sweeping through her this was a transient thing this moment was just what she knew it must bea dreama fantasy of something that could never be its none of your business what i do when you go she managed to whisper but it is his hands came up to cup her cheeks tilting her face he looked deeply into her troubled eyes i care about you nikki yes you care she agreed bitterly the way you care about karen and the way you care about sandra like all the other waifs youve decided to adopt as part of your healing process it was unfair nikkis accusation was contemptible and she knew it but somehowsomehow it was so important that she be different and she was she saw it in the sudden blaze of anger in lukes deep eyes and the tightening of his mouth his hands held her harder why do you do this he said softly his voice dangerously low why do you want to lash out at me i dont nikkis voice fell away i dont know she whispered miserably im sorry luke her words trailed away between them there was a long silence broken only by the rush of the sea in its constant washing of the vast stretch of beach luke gave a low savage moan and turned to stare out to sea nikkis hands came up to touch her face where he had held it what now what and then slowly as though driven by something he didnt understand and couldnt fight luke turned he reached out to take her face again and when she tried to pull away his hands gripped harder for a long long moment he stood looking down into her bewildered face and then infinitely slowly he stooped to kiss her it was a harsh demanding kiss it was a kiss of confusion and pain and of punishment youve hurt me the kiss said and i take my revenge but then it was more than that the lips that demanded possession of her mouth were asking something more than appeasement of anger they wanted her they wanted to know her mouthknow the secrets of her tonguepossess the smooth contours of her even teeth they wanted it wasnt the lips that wanted it was the man and the woman wanted in return nikki felt the hardness of lukes body against hers and a flame started deep within her this was a sweetness that she had never known she could smell him taste him feel him and she wanted more she wanted to be closer than she had ever been to a man in her life before where were the memories of her longgone husband they were certainly not here in fact they no longer existedblown away by the sensation of these hands holding her these fingers caressing the smooth contours of her thighs pulling her closer to feel the urgency of his wanthis need luke she wasnt sure that she whispered the name aloud but it crowded her consciousness it was a cry of desperate loneliness need and the start of some crazy hope soon this man would be gone but if onlyif only it didnt matter for tonight there were the stars and the sea and this man holding her as if she were the most precious thing in the world nikki arched herself against him and felt his head drop to her breast somehow the loose silk of her dress was put aside and lukes mouth covered the taut wanting of her nipples the sensation was so sweet that nikki cried aloud and tears of joy coursed down her face oh god it had never been like this with scott she had thought scott was a friend and he turned into her husband this man thoughthis man was no friend this man was her mateher soulmateher love her love the word swept through and through her and she knew with absolute certainty that it was true she loved luke marriott with every ounce of her being she loved she loves she will love forever and ever and ever and then as lukes arms came around her cradled her and gently lowered her to lie on the warm sand beside him she knew that whatever he wanted was right with her if he only wanted her for this moment then this moment would have to last forever and then from some faraway place came the sound of a harsh electronic beep it grew into a crescendo splitting the night with its awful insistence lukes mouth stilled where he had been exploring the valley between her breasts as nikki grew rigid in his arms he swore unsteadily and rose fate worse than death he said unsteadily i think were wanted my love he put down a hand and pulled her to her feet his arm pulling her to his body kissing her roughly on the mouth he put her from him in bitter resolution the world calls lets see what they have to say the world callsnikki stood confused as luke searched his trouser pocket for the beeper he lifted it high to see its faint light in the moonlight mcdonald baby arriving he read assistance required mcdonald nikki frowned butbut mrs mcdonalds only seven months pregnant she thought back to the last time she had seen lara mcdonald last week and she was only twentynine weeks then ill have to go fast she said unsteadily well have to try to stop labour until we get her to cairns she was already searching in the sand for her sandals well walk faster without shoes luke told her come on ready for a run my love they covered the distance back to the car in a time nikki would have thought was impossible luke however was in a hurry and with his hand holding hers anything was possible he gave nikkis feet wings it was a desperate run with both knowing the need for urgency but somehowsomehow it was still part of the magic night whatever the night held nikki was as one with luke marriott if he ran fast then she was part of him carried along by emotion she was gasping for breath as they neared the car but as luke stopped to find the key she started laughing i feel like a naughty child trying to get home before they find im missing she laughed oh luke i hope we can stop this labour he looked down at her curiously in the dim light and his mouth twisted into an answering smile so do i he murmuredbut whatever we do we need to do it fast it was an enigmatic statement which nikki didnt follow there was no need to say the obvious she thought but then they were in the car with lukes hand on the horn as they turned back out on to the main road towards the hospital nikki turned her face towards the ribbon of bitumen forcing her thoughts savagely away from the man beside her lara mcdonald didnt need a lovestruck girl she needed a competent doctor and that was just what nikki had to be nikki was out of the car almost before it had come to a halt at the front door of the hospital running swiftly up the tiled steps and through the glass doors the night sister came out to meet her shes in the labour ward the sister said behind her a big man in denim work trousers and generous flannelette shirt materialised out of the shadows he was literally wringing his hands but ceased momentarily as he reached to clutch nikkis arm the babyll die if it comes now he said hoarsely doc russell its too early and laras had three miscarriages already thisthis is our last chance he broke off to run his hand across his wet cheeks oh god doc you gotta stop it if this baby doesnt make it sister could you find mr mcdonald a cup of strong sweet tea nikki said and then come straight back to the ward have you examined mrs mcdonald i didnt like to the sister told her i thought i might make matters worse good the nurse was right an internal examination might hurry things even further sheturned to the labour ward and found luke by her side two doctorsat least there were two doctors if the baby was born it would have a much better chance if it could have the undivided attention of luke while nikki attended the mother she smiled gratefully up at luke as he swung the door wide lara mcdonald was a small wiry woman in her late thirties she and her husband owned a small sugar farm just out of town and struggled to make ends meet laras face reflected it weathered and lined from years of too much sun and hard work her face was further lined now creased in agony as a spasm ripped through her her eyes were wide with terror and as nikki approached she reached out to clutch her hand stop it she whispered frantically youve got to stop it nikki kept hold of the hand until the worst of the spasm passed out of the corner of her eye she could see luke scrubbing and getting into gown and gloves once more she was grateful for two doctors it meant she could stay where she was lets not panic she said gently wait until we see whats going on when did you start having pains after dinner aboutabout an hour ago have you had a show any bleeding no a fresh spasm hit and the hand clutched again then luke was at the table the night sister had returned and together she and nikki lifted away laras cotton dress nikki frowned as the fabric fell to the side lara was midspasm but her swollen abdomen was smooth and still nikki put a hand on the firm flesh nothing this wasnt a contraction she looked a question to luke swiftly he performed a gentle examination his face clearing as he did theres no dilation at all he told nikki mrs mcdonald what did you have for dinner i lara was wincing through pain i dont then she paused curry she said suddenly we had curry do you often have curry lukes voice was clipped and professional demanding the womans attention no she managed a faint smile butbut i really wanted it so bill went down to innisfail to get some for me he got three tubs luke grinned and you ate the lot well bill didnt like it luke shook his head nikki found herself relaxing the tension oozing out of her three tubs of curry when unaccustomed to it mrs mcdonald youre not in labour she said gently im sure of it whats happening to you is caused by your system reacting to curry probably your pregnancy has made you a bit more prone to tummy upsets than usual and the curry is making itself felt is that all the womans eyes widened she stared wildly from nikki to luke and then back to nikki slowly the frantic terror behind her eyes faded still clutching her stomach she fell back on to the pillows exhausted oh my god she whispered fervently oh thank you any time nikki grinned she looked up to see lukes smile reflecting her own relief was making her lightheaded she thought suddenly she felt like singing or maybemaybe it wasnt all relief well give you an injection to settle your tummy and well keep you overnight nikki reassured her patient forcing her attention away from luke but youll live to eat curry again andand the baby it seems hes enjoying the new sensations youve been causing him too much to want to leave luke grinned i bet he emerges in two months demanding more vindaloo and chapattis ugh lara mcdonald moaned dont even mention them a few minutes later they left their patient resigned to an uncomfortable night nikki had kept a straight face as shed administered medication but as she climbed into the car she broke into delighted chuckles it wasnt often that dramas turned so nicely into farce unsympathetic wench luke growled did you never have food cravings in pregnancy i was desperate for oysters and beer one night nikki confessed but i made myself a cup of hot milk instead a very restrained young lady luke nodded his hand came over to her side of the car starting from the tip of her knee his fingers gradually worked their way upwards keep your eyes on the road dr russell he advised kindly just remember how restrained you are nikki gasped dont why the fingers were touching the soft flesh of her inner thigh through the flimsy fabric of her dress why stop dr russell because ill crash the car if you dont nikki managed he grinned point taken how long until we get to whispering palms the house was in darkness when they arrived home a solitary lamp burned in the hall but beattie and the children had long gone to bed nikki locked the big front door behind them and then turned uncertainly to the man beside her all of a sudden she felt very young and very shy ggoodnight then she stammered he flicked her cheek with his finger lifting an errant wisp of flaming hair do you want it to be goodnight my nikki of course she did of course she wanted to walk along the passage to the solitude of her own room she could even do an hours study before she slept so why was she slowly shaking her head as if mesmerised by lukes slow smilethe look of understanding and care in his hypnotic eyes hypnotic it was the right word she thought ruefully it was as if she were drugged her eyes held his and she smiled uncertainly up at him nno are you sure he took her shoulders in his hands and held her at arms length nikki i make no promises about tomorrow im here for two and a half weeks and after thatwell after that who knows where ill be but for now she could hardly accuse him of deceiving her he was laying his bitter cards out for her to see and if she didnt like them she could leave right nowwalk through the house to her bedroom and close the door hard behind her but he wasnt lying this man was telling her the truth and no matter how unpalatable it was the truth was what she wanted scotts lies and deception had been with her for too long for her to want anything else and she wanted luke his eyes held her mesmerised and nikki knew that if two weeks of this man was all she could have then two weeks would have to be enough it would have to suffice for the rest of her life she lifted her hands to hold his face and stood on tiptoe to touch his lips with hers if tonight is all we have she whispered then tonight is all there is for a long moment he stood motionless nikki felt a moments searing panic she had thrown herself at him would he react in disgust and then his hands came around her body and tenderly she was lifted up to lie cradled in his arms he held her hard against him and his lips deepened the kiss my bedroom has the double bed nikki whispered as the kiss came finally to its sweet end and luke chuckled ever the practical one dr russell he pushed the door from the hall open with his foot well dr russell what are we waiting for it was the sweetest night nikki had ever known five long years she had been without a man and her body had forgotten just how good it was or maybe her body had never known luke held her tenderly in his arms and the world was forgotten all she knew was the feel of his skin against hers his warmth embracing her making her feel the most desirable woman in the world and when tenderness turned to urgency it was nikkis desperate need that drove her on she wanted this man so much she wanted to be closer to him than she had ever been to another person in her life before she wanted to be part of him one with him and when they climaxed together she soared on a pinnacle of ecstasy that made her feel the night was exploding around her oh god she loved him she loved him so much nikki drifted towards sleep in his arms his face cradled in the rise of her breasts and her heart swelled in a rush of pure tenderness she would do anything for this man anything and he was only hers for two and a half weeks they hadnt taken precautions nikkis eyes suddenly widened in the dark as the thought struck supposesuppose she was wrong about lukes infertility he felt her sudden stiffness and stirred to lift her face to his what is it my beautiful nikki he asked sleepily luke nikki said unsteadily luke im notim not protected i didnt think theres no need lukes voice was suddenly bitter you know the ramifications of the treatment for hodgkins disease as well as i do dr russell and as for anything elsewell i havent been with a woman since i was ill youre quite safe oh luke im sorry nikki could have bitten her tongue from her head yeah well leave it luke said roughly go to sleep she didnt straight away as luke slept nikki lay in the dark and tried to come to terms with what she was feeling she couldnt the emotions crowding through her mind were those she had never felt before and had no idea how to cope with i havent been with a woman since i was ill where had he been had he moved from locum position to locum position since then and if so what was he trying to escape it was too much for now he was here and she could somehow assuage the barrenness of the past and he could do the same for her nikki nestled her head against lukes bare chest he stirred slightly in his sleep and pulled her closer she slept luke woke at dawn gently he disengaged himself from nikkis arms but the slight movement woke her for a momentjust a momentshe wondered where she was and then the tender memories flooded back her hands reached out to hold him to her he couldnt leave not yet its nearly morning luke smiled tenderly leaning over to kiss the smooth skin behind her ear he entwined a golden curl in his finger and then replaced it reluctantly where it had been lying on the pillow do you want your daughter to burst in on her not so respectable mama dr russell nikki chuckled and her hands tightened lukes chest was broad and muscled and warm a tremor went through her as the flame started to spread without volition through her naked body amys a heavy sleeper she whispered and shes under strict instructions not to wake mummy until seven luke shifted slightly so that he could bring his arm up from under nikkis supine form give me back my watch woman he growled finally he held it up sixfifteen he announced that gives us fortyfive minutes fortyfive minutes for what nikki asked breathlessly she knew but to ask was heaven if you dont know then im not the man to tell you luke told her sternly he moved to pull his body up and over her the flame in nikkis thighs was building to an inferno youyou wont tell me she managed lady what use is talking he muttered he leaned down to take first one nipple and then the other between his strong teeth it was all nikki could do to stop herself crying aloud what use is telling when i can show you chapter eight luke left her with five minutes to spare luckily amy chose this morning to sleep late so nikki was able to shower and pull her disordered mind back into some sort of control before her daughter and their visitor burst in lukes in the swimmingpool amy informed her beattie says we can swim too but will you come as well then she frowned at her mother you look different i wore this dress a couple of days ago nikki said selfconsciously it was one that charlotte had sent dont you like it i remember its a pretty dress amy agreed she eyed her mother up and down its not that thats different its she stopped i dont know what it is your mums smiley karen announced suddenly shes not usually smiley well i hope your mums smiley today too nikki said softly stooping to give karen a swift hug the hug did more than show affection to the little girl it also enabled nikki to hide her mounting colour shes coming to see you today and maybe shell take you for a walk to show you your new house will i go back home today well get you moved into your new house first nikki promised karen it might be a week or two before your mums got things under control do you think you can put up with us for that long karen nodded solemnly i like it here she said seriously and if you think mum needs a rest i think you both need a rest nikki told her when your arms a bit better and you can go back to being your mums best helper then well send you home so fast we wont see you for dust faster than a speeding bullet faster even than superman amy giggled i like having karen here mummy are you coming swimming with luke nikki shook her head no she dared not the thought of luke in the swimmingpoolthe thought of luke anywhere at all was enough to turn her knees to water she needed strong black coffee and some distance between them you girls go she ordered but lukes waiting let him wait once again they breakfasted by the side of the pool whispering palms was transformed nikki thought fleetingly as the childrens laughter sounded across the water beattie was beaming and affable she kept looking from luke to nikki and back again and nikki knew exactly what was in her mind you need to find yourself a nice new man beattie had told nikki over and over again and now seemingly one had found her cherished dr nikki and such a nice young man beattie handed out extra pancakes and her smile broadened are you staying home to study all day beattie asked nikki refilling her coffeecup and nikki nodded though ill have to go in to the hospital first she told the housekeeper she was carefully avoiding lukes eyes i need to check mrs mcdonald i can do that luke told her lazily no nikki flushed and stared intently at her cup of coffee laras my midwifery patient and i should see her suits me to her surprise luke didnt argue he pushed back his chair thanks for breakfast beattie he lifted his brows at nikki coming then he could as well have kissed her his eyes smiled at nikki as he moved to help her rise and she felt herself flush to the core of her being she felt beautiful and desirable andand loved oh if only she were there was a minor hiccup luke had been using nikkis car and beattie needed the house car to take the girls to school and kindergarten its no problem luke told her as nikki voiced doubts ill drop you back after the hospital rounds youll still be home in time for enough study to suit your rigid requirements nikki looked up at him suspiciously but he wasnt laughing he wouldnt laugh at her she thought suddenly hed laugh with her maybe but not at her they found lara mcdonald perched up in bed eyeing her breakfast dubiously do you think i should she asked as nikki and luke entered luke grinned i dont see why not do you dr russell not too much nikki advised she crossed to the bed feeling better then a hundred per cent mrs mcdonald took a deep breath you know maybe some of the pain was just fear i thought the baby was coming and it got worse it happens nikki lifted the chart and smiled at what she saw everythings fine then i see no reason why your husband cant take you home this afternoon stay until after lunch though well see how your tummy responds to breakfast first he wont want me home the woman smiled shyly he cossets me that much if he had his way id stay in hospital for the next two months she sighed i cant blame him this baby means so much to both of us i know nikki said gently well maybe you dont the woman said you had your baby young if i remember right my husband and i thoughwell weve been trying for ten years ten years is a lot of time to be without a baby when you really want one she bit her lip i dont know how people cope when they cant have children i thinki think i might have gone mad or maybe you would have found the strength to cope nikki said gently trying hard not to look up at luke theres more to life than having children you say that but then you have your daughter lara said firmly and maybe ill say that when ive got my brood safely round me but not until then a slight sound made nikki turn luke had quietly left while the woman talked closing the door behind him oh the woman in the bed said hes gone i guess hes in a hurry and i was wasting your time with my small talk she looked up at nikki such a nice man she smiled yes said nikki dully such a nice man there was little else for nikki to do all the other patients in the hospital had been handed over to luke she spent ten minutes in the office going through correspondence and then made her way back out to the car luke appeared fifteen minutes later there should be a taxi service in this town nikki said lightly as he lowered himself into the car beside her for once lukes face was set and grim nikki turned away not wanting to see the etching of pain in the lines around his eyes its no problem to drive you back no but itll make you late for surgery will you dock my pay if im late luke demanded and nikki swung back towards him surprised by the intensity of his tone dont be daft he laughed without humour its happened before being a locum is the pits so why do you do it lukes mouth tightened even further he swung the little car out of the car park and was silent for the rest of the drive home that was the last time they talked for the day back at whispering palms nikki left the car without a word for the life of her she couldnt think of a thing to say tackle whats really wrong her medical training told her probe the hurt and yetand yet this was the man she loved and she couldnt do it she couldnt hurt him further she spent the rest of the day desultorily studying but to her surprise she achieved a lot im in danger of passing this blasted exam she told her reflection as she dressed for dinner which makes luke marriotts arrival well worth while the thought held no comfort at all nikki stared bleakly at her reflection and then turned away what on earth was happening to her nice ordered life she had no idea luke wasnt in his customary position in the kitchen when she appeared beattie shook her head disapprovingly at nikkis questioning look he wont be in she said tightly rang and said he had a case out the other side of town its only verity birchip i told him if he spent his life running all the way out to birchips for every one of veritys imaginary ills hed have his work cut out for him but he wouldnt listen said hed grab something to eat in town and be home late maybe there really is something wrong with verity nikki said mildly thatll be the day beattie snorted you mark my wordsverity birchipll go to her grave swearing she has something the medical textbooks havent even heard of and demanding to know why the heck the doctors are worrying about her dying of old age when shes got something far more interesting nikki managed a chuckle and beattie looked at her closely whats the matter then lass nothing nikki crossed to the cutlery drawer to avoid beatties penetrating gaze something is and it wouldnt be why dr luke had suddenly decided to spend tonight out would it beattie gilchrist youre out of line youd say that to your own mother beattie crossed her arms and fixed nikki with a look and its your substitute mother talking now nikki russell if you play your cards right beattie be quiet nikki clapped her hands on her ears and glared at her housekeeper if only beattie knew that nikki was playing every card she hadand it wasnt going to be enough there was a long silence and then thankfully the door burst open and two small girls tore in were starving amy said breathlessly mummy wheres dr luke hes out on a call nikki told her abruptly stooping to kiss her small daughter she smiled down at karen how was your day karen good the little girl said seriously she appeared to consider the question mummy picked me up after school and took me around to see the house shes been offered we think despite her solemn tone the childs face suddenly twisted into a smile we think it will be satisfactory it has one bedroom for mummy one for the girls one for the boys andand one left over and its nice its even got an inside toilet thats great nikki swooped to give karen a hard hug and when does mummy think she might be able to move the lady at the hospital has offered to look after the littlies karen was back to being solemnan eightyearold matron mummy says it will take her a week to have everything sorted out she said if i was able to help shed be much faster and she really misses me karen looked up anxiously she said shes really sorry she hurt me she said she was so worried she went a bit crazy but you and dr luke are fixing it up so shell never get like that again she cried and she hugged me andii dont think shell do it again i dont think she will either nikki told her with a small rush of relief sandra was talking to her child the lines of communication were open and by the sound of it karen still considered them friends sandra was still only twentytwo and her relationship with her daughter might always be more one of friendship than motherdaughterbut then that was ok too can i go home when shes moved in of course you can sweetheart nikki assured her and made herself a promise to contact sandra the next day by the look of things the situation was improving rapidly but it needed to it was a long night nikki read the girls to sleep and then went back to her study every time a car came up the road she let her book fall as she listened but it was close to midnight when luke finally came home nikki listened to the brisk tread of steps along the hall and then his bedroom door closing firmly behind him she was being shut out whatever intimacy had existed between them last night had ceased to exist now she prepared herself for bed and climbed between cool sheets in her lonely bed last night luke had been here last nightthe memory of him was all around her and he was so close the night was hot above her head the wooden ceiling fan lazily stirred the air but it wasnt enough nikki tossed and turned as she struggled for sleep but it wasnt forthcoming finally she could bear it no longer she slipped out of bed and padded along the bare wooden boards of the hall her naked feet made no sound there was a light shining underneath lukes door nikki hesitated for a moment and then taking a deep breath softly knocked silence had he gone to sleep with the light on then as she turned reluctantly away afraid to go further the door opened inwards luke was still fully clothed he had been working the desk behind him was strewn with papers and a pen had been tossed hastily aside all this nikki saw before luke moved to block her view what is it he asked abruptly and nikki flinched ii couldnt sleep he looked down at her for a long moment his eyes inscrutable as he took in her slim form scantily clad in her wispy cotton nightdress i dare say you have sleepingtablets in your bag he said roughly at last nikki drew in her breath i dont need a sleepingtablet she managed angrily i need to talk what about luke marriott what the hell is going on despite her struggle for dignity and control nikkis voice rose her words echoed down the darkened corridor and instinctively she looked towards the door behind which the children slept luke can i come in no why the hell not suddenly nikkis fragile hold on her temper snapped what are you playing at last night you treated me as the most desirable woman you knew and tonighttonight you dont even want to talk to me what have i done to deserve being treated like a onenight stand her voice was a whisper intense angry and wavering to her fury she felt hot tears slip down her cheeks and she brushed them away angrily with her hand behind them she heard the sound of a child stir in her sleep and cough nikki winced luke stood before her implacable and immovable remote damn you luke marriott she whispered brokenly and turned away he moved then in two swift strides he caught her seized her shoulders and swung her round to face him away from the light of the open door nikki couldnt make out his expression not that she looked she was aware that her body was trembling as she tried to stay rigid in his grasp hell he muttered savagely it is nikki whispered maybe youd better let me go luke nikki the child coughed again and luke swore seizing nikkis hand he pulled her forward into his bedroom and closed the door behind him silence stretched out between them within the small room luke released her nikki stood numbly against the closed door her hand idly rubbing her arm there would be bruising there where he had pulled her god nikki im sorry the words were wrung from him nikki looked up at him her eyes dull and heavy for making love to me she asked flatly i never meant to no she kept rubbing her arm as if by doing so she could assuage some of the hurt in her heart i dont suppose you did charlotte said charlotte my friend in cairns she said you couldnt help yourself wherewhere women were concerned god nikki last night was different he turned away his voice agonised id say that anyway wouldnt i yes its the truth he turned back to her and grasped her shoulders its the truth but it still cant make a difference to the final outcome the truth is that i was mad i forgoti dont want you nikki i dont want a woman not now not ever thats not how it felt last night no but last nightlast night i was crazy just for a little you forgot that you cant father a child nikki took a deep breath is that what it is luke no yes he thrust her back from him god nikki youre so lovely you stand there and all i want to do is make love to you and and what nikki said gently luke you accused me of shutting the world out arent you doing the same thing leave it nikki he said roughly no nikki shook her head her redgold hair tossing from side to side youve hauled me from my splendid isolation and nownow youre telling me im really alone after all youre not alone you have your daughter beattiethis town oh yes thats not what you said a week ago nikki it doesnt matter lukes eyes hardened whatever i said whatever ive done doesnt alter the fact that i want no one i should never have made love to you because of course you want more nikkis green eyes flashed she took a deep breath you arrogant toad she spat i meant he rubbed his hand wearily through his hair nikki i didnt mean that to soundi just mean that lovemaking implies emotional commitment and i cant give that not now not ever not ever the phrase echoed harshly around them nikki took a ragged breath and leaned against the door at least he was honest last nightlast night she had thought it would be enough nownow she hated his damned honesty she hated him he was avoiding the issue running just like her father just like scott so what was left their professional relationship she could tell him to get out of her house nowor somehow she could act professional one doctor to another how was mrs birchip she asked suddenly mrs birchip luke looked blank the lady you spent the night with i beg your pardon you did a house call to verity birchip nikki said coldly striving desperately for a return to normality and it kept you all night oh lukes blank look suddenly faded and he managed a smile mrs birchip thinks she has heredity heredity it was nikkis turn to sound blank she read somewhere that heredity can cause all sorts of problems so she thinks shes got it i suspected a bad cold but shes sure its heredity you know i wouldnt be the least bit surprise if shes right nikki said slowly it would explain a lot and luke managed to grin yeah so this was all there was over a fine romance nikki thought bitterly gone the way of all the loves in her life walking away from her nikki drew in her breath i guessi guess id better go to bed then i think you should luke said gently his smile faded nikki im sorry dont it was practically a cry she bit her lip and then gestured to the pile of papers on his desk imim sorry i interrupted you whatwhat were you doing im writing a newspaper column nikkis eyes widened a newswhat sort of newspaper column who cares who cares nikki stared in amazement in disbelief she crossed to the desk and stared down there were loose sheaves of handwritten pleas for help and attached to each was a neatly written paragraph nikki picked up and read the first note dear doctor my fifteenyearold daughter has one breast bigger than the other and i cant get her to agree to visit our family doctor i know shes scared stiff shell be like this forever then there was the response carefully worded under the major heading who cares and nikki didnt have to read the response she had read who cares every week for the past eighteen months with a growing sense of admiration for the measured careful and caring responses given by the anonymous answering doctor she knew just what the reply would bea careful reassurance amusing anecdotes of lopsided adolescents i have known as well as a plea to back up the reassurance by a visit to the girls own doctor nikki let the sheaf of papers fall to the table youre the doctor behind who cares she whispered she stared this was making less and less sense the column must pay well why then was he doing locums yes he came abruptly forward and pushed the papers into a folder i started doing it while i was ill for the money he laughed without humour you guessed it and besides its a job you can do without people nikki im not trying to avoid people only involvement look whos talking you still think im trying to avoid involvement nikki demanded she put her hand wearily to her eyes i thinki think im cured he looked hard at her then his eyes narrowing nikki i you dont want to hear nikki finished for him well youre going to you came up here for god knows what reason but whatever your motive you decided on a nice boy scout objective get dr russell out of herself involve her with the human race again teach her to love nikki i didnt mean i dont care what you meant tears welled up in nikkis eyes and she turned away and i dont care what you were trying to do all i know is that i love you there the words were said she could do no more this man was all she wanted in life and she had laid her heart on a plate for him to take if he wanted it it seemed he didnt he stood motionless for a long moment and then came to turn her gently towards him nikki dont he said gently cry why the hell not isnt falling in love with yet another man who doesnt want me something to cry about she wrenched back away from him her fingers searching for the doorknob while she watched his face it was bleak and hard whatever she said would make no difference nikki im sorry he said softly implacably there was no love for her in the words ill bet you are nikki whispered she shrugged and so am i her fingers found the knob and twisted nikki turned and walked out of the room regardless of sleeping children and housekeeper she slammed the door hard she hadnt stalked more than three feet from the door when the front doorbell rang nikki stopped dead now what her hand flew up to her tearstained face great if she was needed now lukes bedroom door opened again as he too heard the bell ill go he said roughly youd better wash your face and pull yourself together great professional caring and sympathy and to make it worse he was right nikki watched him stride along the passage and if shed had something in her hand she would have thrown it something hard and big she thought savagely something that would break into a million fragments and release some of the awful tension within her instead of which she went meekly back into her bedroom to repair some of the ravages of the last few minutes she had hardly started before luke was back his knock on her door showed as little respect as nikki had for the still sleeping occupants of the house nikki i need you like hell you do nikki thought bitterly you dont need anyone luke marriott she didnt say it though instead she let her robe slip to the floor hauled on the dress shed been wearing that afternoon and opened the door whats wrong he narrowed his eyes are you fit to operate of course nikkis hands were fumbling to fasten the front buttons on her dress and once again she cursed fate at having sent luke to stay in this house she was forced to be intimate in such surroundings weve a nasty tear and fracture to repair a fisherman got his hand caught in a craypot rope its darn near torn off his thumb nikki nodded it happened the fishermen worked fast and often didnt stop the motor when they dropped the pots occasionally one fouled on a propeller there had been a couple of nasty accidents since nikki had started practising i usually send them down to cairns she said quietly trying to make her voice sound professional and detached i canti dont have the skills i do he was striding away ring the hospital and tell them to prepare theatre then come ill drive him down hes here nikkis eyes widened hes currently making a mess of beatties hall luke said grimly his mates were set on a night prawning and wouldnt interrupt to take him to the hospital they dropped him at the wharf and he walked up here because whispering palms is closer than the hospital good grief nikki frowned in disbelief hurry luke told her turning away the kids lost a lot of blood and the thumbs hanging by a thread the faster we get it sewn back the more chance he has of keeping it the kid hes not much more than a teenager it was a fiddly delicate operation once more eurong was in luck having luke as acting locum nikki thought reflectively knowing that if the boy had been sent to cairns his thumb would have been well and truly dead by the time they got him there as it was he had a good chance of keeping it luke meticulously cleaned the shattered bone inserted a tiny metal pin which would hold the bones together and then slowly stitched the mass of torn muscle and flesh back into the shape of a thumb he used skills nikki could only wonder at it took hours the first trace of dawn was showing through the big south window of the operating theatre as luke finally raised his head thats it he said wearily the best we can do he moved to adjust the intravenous line it was feeding antibiotics through which hopefully would keep the wound free of infection infection now would mean all their work was wasted it was considerate of luke to include nikki in his assessment of what had been done but the work had been lukes nikkis job as anaesthetist had been relatively easy keeping a fit and healthy nineteenyearold asleep for the time it had taken well done she said softly to luke signalling one of the nurses to assist him with his gown he looked exhausted and nikki suddenly remembered that the man had been ill himself was he completely recovered is mr payne here yet she asked the charge sister jim payne had given permission for himself to be operated onat nineteen he was able to do soand in response to their enquiries he had replied that his dad didnt give a stuff anyway beneath her hands the boy stirred as he took over his own breathing not as far as i know andrea told nikki we telephoned home but no one answered i guess his dad will still be at sea luke frowned down at the boy does he have any other family he had been scrubbing while nikki had questioned the boy earlier only his father here nikki said grimly his father owns the boat jim works on he would have been the one to put jim off last night with instructions to walk to hospital luke stared down at their still sleeping patient the boy was pale beneath his weathered complexion at nineteen he still looked very youngand very vulnerable some people dont deserve to have children he said softly no nikki shook her head there are some cases where parents cant seem to help mistreating their childrenlike sandra mears its just the buildup of hardship that proves too much for them but bert paynes differenthes always been rough and uncaring jims mum took off when berts roughness finally got too much for her and since then jims had to cope with it alone lukes mouth twisted into a grimace poor bloody kid he said softly ive given him back his thumb but what sort of chance does he have hell survive the nurse told them the paynes are tough yeah and toughness breeds toughness next generation well maybe hell marry a nice girl who gives him all the cuddles hes missed out on nikki said roundly ah yes the happy ending there was no mistaking the derision behind lukes words and nikki flushed ill finish up here she said tightly youre tired feeling sorry for me dr russell nikkis eyes flew up to his and flashed fire no she said between her teeth i just want to get rid of you chapter nine the days that followed were endless somehow nikki managed to study but afterwards she never knew how it was a defence mechanism she thought dully immersed in her texts telling herself they were important somehow she could block out lukes presence in the house not that he was there often he worked longer hours than he needed to and nikki suspected that many house calls were simply an excuse to be away from whispering palms away from her i dont know whats eating the man beattie puzzled one day as they ate yet another dinner without him he was so darned cheerful when he camelike a breath of fresh air through the placeand now hes like a bear with a sore head amy announced isnt he karen karen nodded solemnly and then carefully replaced her knife and fork on the plate mummy says shed like me to come home on saturday she announced she saysshe says the house is ready she says its really pretty and weve got a nice garden i can help look after and what else will she let you help with beattie said darkly and karen flushed hearing the implied criticism i like gardening she said in a small voice i want to grow carrots andand flowers and mummy says i can ill drop in tomorrow and see your new house nikki intervened sending her housekeeper a dark look and if your mums really ready then i dont see any reason why you cant go home it was yet another way of blocking her thoughts from lukeand no way was entirely successful after lunch the next day nikki walked around the river to sandras new home it was quite a distance and by the time she arrived nikki was regretting her impulse to leave the car at home especially as she rounded the corner and saw her own second vehicle parked outside luke oh no she stood irresolute in the sun as she tried to decide what to do the last thing she wanted was to walk in on luke then the door opened and sandra saw her before she could move sandra lifted an arm and waved dr russell hi come and see so there was nothing for it but to cross the road and enter the sparkling clean home luke had obviously just been leaving he was standing in the hall as nikki entered two doctors sandra said smiling nervously do i get charged for two house calls of course not nikki tried desperately to ignore luke as she smiled reassuringly at sandra i just thought id drop in for a look let me show you sandra started eagerly but luke interrupted i have to be getting back for afternoon surgery he told them he didnt look at nikki ill leave you two alone sandra nodded she looked up at him and then suddenly stretched out her hands to take his i dont know how to thank you she told him she turned to nikki did you know dr luke has located my husband she whirled suddenly into the kitchen and returned carrying a slip of paper and look i dont know how he did it but its a cheque for child maintenance and they saythey say therell be more coming it wasnt me that found him luke told her it was the department of social security ive been to them before sandra said darkly and nothings happened and then you two move in and and your husband gets to shoulder his responsibilities nikki said warmly im so glad sandra smiled for the first time in years she seemed young this will meanoh everything well have enough to eat for a change and therell be money left over ill be able to buy them new clothes and take them to the pictures sometimes she giggled and my husbandhes not going to have all that great a time with his new girlfriend now she chuckled not with his wages being garnished for maintenance for the kids plus she ended triumphantly all the stuff he bought on credit cards and ive been paying off some of it hes still got and the rest hes sold his girlfriend was there when the social welfare people came around and she told them without thinking oh yeah he bought thatthat old stereo she said he sold it and things like that and they told the credit people and the credit people transferred the debt i dont get to use the credit cards any more but i never did anyway so nowso now hes got to pay for the lot and i dont have a single debt i feeli feel fantastic ready for karen nikki said quietly sandras smile faded she met nikkis look without flinching im ready for karen she said i thinki think ive come to terms with what ive been doing with her i just felt so darned uselessand karens so like me so when i felt like punishing myself i took everything out on her she took a deep breath but it wont happen any more i promise you that karen well karens going to be a little girl again and im going to be a proper mother you know there wont be any more chances luke said heavily you know that dont you sandra sandra nodded i know you two have given me a second chance she agreed i know that and ill be grateful forever and i wont mess it up karen can come back to whispering palms at any time nikki promised use us as a safetyvalve if you feel the tensions mounting then send her to us to usbecause she was standing beside luke it sounded as if the invitation was from both of them and sandra took it as such she smiled at both of them in turn ill take you up on that if i ever need to she promised but i wont i know that now suddenly she leaned forward and kissed nikki on the cheek and dr russell yes nikki was flustered and it showed in her mounting colour im really glad youve been given a second chance too luke left them then much to nikkis relief and sandra showed her around the house it looked lovely finally sandra walked her to the refrigerator and opened the door the interior was crammed with the sort of food most children would die forlemonade cocktail sausages chocolate éclairs lamingtons a small boy sidled up beside sandra as they looked and pulled his thumb from his mouth to announce no ones allowed to eat anything until karen comes home its karens welcomehome party cos were glad shes better and we missed her mummys put me in charge of seeing no one cheats and this was the little boy whod triggered the scene that had ended with karens broken arm nikki smiled down at him and wondered just how shed react given the scenario of not having enough food to feed her children she looked back to sandra and saw that sandra guessed her thoughts it tore me apart she whispered to be hungry myself and still watch karen be hungryand for her not to complain it wont happen again nikki said softly its over i know sandra smiled happily and guess what ive got a spare room and dr luke suggested i might take in a boarder itll mean even more money and ill have someonesome adultto talk to she grimaced i know ive been treating karen too much like an adultbut then ive needed to ive been so darned lonely i know the feeling nikki said softly and their eyes linked in a moment of understanding and nikki knew in that moment that sandra would ask for help if she needed it there was a bond between them which both recognised nikki left then her heart a little lighter because of the familys obvious happiness she glanced at her watch as the door closed behind her it would take her half an hour to walk home which left her with a solid afternoon to study on sundayin two days timeshe had to climb on to an aeroplane and face the exam in cairns it no longer had meaning it was a meaningless milestone she was aiming for because she had nothing else to do nothing but face a future which was bleak and empty i still have amy she said aloud and beattie and whispering palms and a good job and it sounded empty there was a void that only luke could fill she looked up towards the road and her heart stilled her car was parked on the corner luke was waiting he got out of the car as she approached and watched her walk towards him i thought you were late for surgery she said nervously so sack me she shook her head and unbidden tears threatened behind her eyes you knowyou know i wouldnt he shrugged i thought you could do with a ride seeing as im using your car its bloody stupid walking so far in the midday sun i know nikki said bitterly im bloody stupid he glanced over at her as he started the car and his mouth tightened it was as if he was agreeing with her you leave for cairns on sunday he said evenly yes your exams are on monday and tuesday yes she couldnt think of anything further to say and youll be back here on wednesday she nodded unable to trust her voice ill leave here first thing thursday then fine she hardly recognised her voice it was tight young and forlorn she sounded about amys age lost desolate and alone once more he glanced at her and then stared determinedly back at the road its better this way he said finally why it was all she could do to whisper wherewhere are you going im not sure maybe ill go back to sydney for a while spend some more time on my column fine she couldnt think of anything else to say instead nikki sat with her hands clenched tight in her lap and waited to be deposited home there was little more preparation she could do for the exam if she didnt know what she needed now she never would nikki desultorily packed and stared aimlessly at her books for the rest of the weekend on saturday she took karen home to be welcomed by a tearful sandra and her joyful brothers and sister but that was the only cheerful spot in the day when you get back therell be no karen and no dr luke amy said dolefully as she hugged her mother goodbye on sunday mummy what are we going to do we survived fine by ourselves nikki told her daughter forcing a smile but we werent happy amy reminded her dr luke makes me laugh he doesnt make me laugh nikki said to herself sadly she clenched a tight wad of paper in her handa note left on the kitchen table when luke had left this morning on one of his interminable house calls good luck the note read love luke loveyou dont know what love is nikki whispered to the absent luke as she made her farewells you have it if you want it its yours nikki stayed in the staff residence of the hospital while she sat her exams it was the same hospital shed stayed in the night shed come down with her two casualties she took the opportunity of visiting them and her spirits lifted a little as she found both recovering well its the last time i drive a car fast martin told her and lisa settled in a wheelchair beside martins bed agreed with him i was egging him on she said sadly we were fools lucky fools at least youre both alive to learn a lesson from it nikki smiled the pair were now inseparable their hands linked tight while they talked a happy ending if ever she saw one and she was so jealous she could cry nikki turned from the bed as her friend charlotte came into the ward oho charlie grinned back in town need some more clothes do we dr russell no i do not despite her cross tone nikki couldnt suppress a smile charlotte was incorrigible so its just exams thats brought you to town how boring i suppose i cant persuade you to join me for dinner tonight are you kidding nikki linked arms with her friend and they walked out together my last night before the exam and this exam is so important it is to me charlotte shook her head she glanced across at nikkis strained face and wisely decided to hold her peace would you have half an hour to spare from your hectic exam preparation though she asked slowly charlotte i cant not to spend in riotous living her friend assured her drily but theres someone in town who badly wants to see you who luke marriotts sister lukes sister nikki turned and stared at her friend what on earth why would lukes sister want to see me i suspect to ask after luke but look dont ask me charlotte spread her hands im only the intermediary i only know that this girls from melbourne she told me about lukes illnessapparently she hasnt seen him since then shes worried sick about him and came north to try and locate him i heard she was asking the staff if anyone had heard from himi stuck my oar in and told her where he was and i told her you were coming down she was due to fly back to melbourne today but has held over to try and talk to you will you see her nikki frowned i suppose so so whats the story charlotte linked arms again and kept walking has he murdered someone who luke marriott nikki tried to laugh i wouldnt think so so whys he running who knows nikki said lightly much more lightly than she felt who knows lukes sister megan was a more petite version of luke in a feminine form she was blonde blueeyed and beautiful and her smile would turn mens hearts her smile was tentative when she met nikki as though she was afraid of what she might be about to hear i hope you dont mind me bothering you she started awkwardly as nikki ushered her into her sparsely furnished little bedroom an hour later miss cain says you have exams tomorrow it doesnt matter nikki pulled out the hard chair from the desk motioned her guest into it and then perched on the bed how may i help you they were both so nervous the air was brittle she thought i thoughti just wondered if you could tell me about luke the girl gripped her hands together and held them hard wewe were so worried my company sent me up here for a conference and i thought id try to find out about him while i was here you havent heard from him for a while no megan bit her lip oh we heard about his illness he rang from sydney and my oldest sister flew up to be with him during the worst of it but then then he just seemed to withdraw since he left sydney weve received the occasional postcard from different places and nothing else its as ifits as if he doesnt want us any more join the club nikki thought bitterly but she didnt say it instead she looked sympathetically across to megan the girl was young maybe only twenty or so and looked miserable youre fond of your brother she asked we all are the girl took a deep breath were a really big family dr russell im the second youngest of eight children and luke is the oldest my father died when i was two and my mum died three years ago lukewell lukes been more a parent than a big brotherto all of us she looked at the floor we know hes not workingat least until i heard about you i didnt think he was my young brothers still at university though and the cheques keep arriving from luke to keep him there i dont know how hes doing it nikki did this explained why he had to do the locum work but but why doesnt he contact you nikki was talking almost to herself wewe wondered if he was still ill if his cancer had come back if he didnt want to face us nikki shook her head it hasnt she said gently hes fit and healthy and id be willing to bet hes going to be one of the lucky ones whos in for a complete cure and is he happy megan asked tremulously its driving us crazy not knowing last christmaswell we all got togetherall of us and husbands and wives and childrendo you know that luke now has eleven nieces and nephews with two more on the way and the only one not there was luke the only one and you know she lifted a woebegone face i would have said of all of us to luke the family was the most important and maybe it still is nikki thought slowly maybe the sight of his brothers and sisters marrying and producing their own families when he cant is just too painful for him to face she didnt say that she couldnt instead nikki leaned forward and gripped megans hands megan i cant answer your questions she said gently i dont know the answers myself all i can do is assure you that luke seems healthy if you like ill tell him ive seen you and tell him youre worried thatsthats all i can do but he is at eurong megans tearstained eyes met nikkis i cant extend my stay now but one of my brothers or sisters will come up i know they will she grimaced maybe if you dont tell him were coming megan he wont be there megan paused nno no lukes doing a locum for me and he leaves on thursday and i dont know where hes going something in her tone caught megans attention she stared youyou care for him too she said slowly nikki nodded i do well then megan luke wont let me near him he wont let anyone near him nikki closed her eyes with remembered pain for nowfor now luke wants to be alone and i thinki think we have to respect that do you think its because hes sterile nikki looked up sharply you know about that megan nodded my sister was so worried she made a special trip to sydney to see dr olsing six months ago hes the one who looked after luke when he was ill dr olsing thought that might have something to do with whywhy hes avoiding the family luke would have been fairly upset when he found out nikki said carefully and megan nodded again dr olsing said there was some reason luke couldnt bank spermand almost as soon as the last chemotherapy session was over he asked to be tested and his count was really low dr olsing said if luke hadnt been a doctor he would have pushed him to counselling butwell if you know luke youd know he wouldnt take to counselling very well hed reckon he could cope luke hasnt been back to dr olsing since then we assume hes getting his regular checkupsbut he could get them done anywhere couldnt he im sure he is nikki said gently lukes sensible megan hell be being careful careful and remote as the south pole she thought bleakly megan left soon after and nikki faced a long and sleepless night in the morning she sat the first of her exams they seemed easy or maybe that was just because nikkis mind was elsewhere she answered perfunctorily and if sometimes one of her examiners seemed annoyed well nikki couldnt help it she was nervous though she must be nikki had sat down in the hospital cafeteria for breakfast on the monday morning only to be nauseated by the sight of so much food shed been ill before shed gone into the exam her stomach had settled as she worked but on tuesday morning it happened again nerves it was almost as if the thought struck nikki out of the blue halfway through an oral examination on bonestructure on the tuesday afternoon strange sensations suddenly slid into frightening place somehow nikki managed to answer the professors questions there was one other written exam which she completed in not much more than half the time stipulated she walked out of the examinationroom and didnt stop until she reached the hospital pharmacy an hour later charlotte knocked on nikkis door hearing no response she turned the knob to find it unlocked nikki was sitting on the bed staring out of the window hey whats this charlotte chided her i thought youd be out painting the town red she plonked herself down on the bed beside her friend or did the exam go badly it went ok nikki said listlessly well what charlotte broke off her eyes caught sight of what lay on nikkis bedside table a small bottle a plastic box and an eyedropper charlotte leaned forward and picked up the box the paper in the window on the front of the box showed a firm definite cross charlotte glanced across to where nikki was still staring intently out of the window and then looked back at the box a cross she said conversationally whos the lucky girl then charlotte dont nikki put her hands up to her face and her shoulders heaved with a gasp charlotte leaned over to grasp her friend hey honey dont this isnt the end of the world how far im only just nikki wailed im only a week overdue i just couldnt luke nikki closed her eyes of course luke she whispered who else who else indeed charlotte whistled silently over nikkis tumbled curls holy heck nikki love i thought you had more sense i did i do hes supposed to be sterile and then the whole story came tumbling out while charlottes frown deepened and her hold on her friends shoulders tightened well she said at last what now nikki russell i dont know she said bleakly i cant think ihe was so sure that he was sterile when was he tested i dont know nikki wailed and then she remembered what megan had said justjust after the last lot of chemotherapy he was very anxious too anxious charlotte said grimly if he tested too soon surely he would have retested if hed been negative nikki whispered when it was so important to him maybe thats why he didnt retest charlotte shrugged to submit yourself to a sperm count when you think youre sterile must be pretty darned demoralising if he got a really low count he would have assumed it would stay low the chances of it rising are pretty darned small small but possible nikki said bleakly and guess who wins the prize charlotte shook her head you always were the lucky one nikkinikki you realise its early enough to do something about the pregnancy no just like that just like that nikki told her i could have done the same when i was pregnant with amy i was broke and frightened and much younger and if i had i would have missed out on my lovely daughter and besides besides charlotte prompted this is lukes child i see charlotte looked hard at her friend and her heart sank luke marriott had claimed another victim then so tell luke she said heavily ive never heard that luke marriott didnt take his responsibilities seriously maybemaybe hell want to marry you for a happyeverafter ending nikki gave a short harsh laugh is that what you think if he thinks hes sterile hell be delighted about the baby yes nikki nodded hes taken his sterility hard and family is important to him youre right charlie if i told him then luke would marry me and you dont want that nikki shook her head notnot on those terms but he made love to you he must feel he made love to me out of some crazy stupid scheme to shake me out of my isolation and misery for the same reason as you pinched all my clothes well it worked only too well im not isolated any more im going to be the mother of two oh nikki will you cope sure ill cope nikki whispered the town will talk behind my backbut they always have beattie will stand by me and i have my career isnt it lucky ive just done this damned exam her voice broke on a sob and she buried her face in her hands nikki charlotte held out a hand helplessly to her friend and then withdrew it nikki youll have to tell him its not fairapart from anything else he has to know hes not firing blanks shaken nikki looked up sharply and charlotte shrugged and grinned well he does if he had a low sperm count he must only have marginal fertility nikki said slowly he could try for twenty years and not father another child or he could do the same tomorrow nikki nodded ok she said slowly ill tell him she took a deep breath her face was set but not yet ill let him get right away from eurong and then ill write to him care of the medical board theyll forward a letter but it wont be for a while yet ill give myself time to have the strength to tell him to go to blazes when he demands that i marry him thats really what you want to do hell love our baby nikki said bleakly but he doesnt love me soso its what i really have to do chapter ten nikki arrived back at eurong the following afternoon to find beattie and amy waiting for her at the airport amy raced across the tarmac to envelop her mother in a bearhug mummy guess what were going to have a luke party a luke party nikki buried her face in her daughters chubby shoulder for longer than usual finding comfort in that small persons presence another amy maybemaybe someone who looked like luke a luke party she said again unsteadily bringing her face up to smile at beattie whats a luke party lukes going tomorrow amy told her her face momentarily clouding but beattie said tonight were having a party to say welcome home mummy and goodbye dr luke onlyonly i think it would be nicer if luke thought the party was just for him if you dont mind she asked anxiously i dont mind nikki set her daughter back on to her feet and what delicacies have we planned for such an event all the food hell like best amy said proudly little red sausages bread and butter and hundreds and thousands jelly beans red lemonade sausage rolls wow nikki grinned what man could ask for more exactly amy skipped beside her her hand clinging to her mothers maybemaybe if he sees what really good food we have sometimes maybe hell stay i dont think thats possible no beattie glanced across at nikkis set face and then looked away there was real pain there nikki drove down to the hospital just before dinner luke it seemed was leaving in the morning and nikki needed to know what hospital patients were in and what their medications were while he was still available to answer questions she did a slow ward round methodically going through each patients chart there were no problems luke had written each patients history with meticulous care knowing that he was soon handing over the young fisherman was recovering nicely and nikki was pleased to see his impatience to be home i dunno why hes keeping me so long the boy complained ive only got a sore thumb you wouldnt have any thumb at all if it werent for dr luke nikki told him severely and if you risk infection by going home you can still lose it yeah well ive got nine more the boy grinned and nikki shook her head you dont know how much youd miss your right thumb until youre without it she warned him so just lie back and let us take care of you it is nice the fisherman admitted he smiled shyly up at her the nurses here are great and the food is something else i guess it beats your dads cooking nikki hesitated has he been in to see you yeah once the boys face closed just wanted to know how long hed have to hire someone else for i dunnoi dunno that ill go back to living with him i might get private board or something does your mum know youre in hospital no jim bit his lip mumwell mum left a couple of years back and i chose to stay with dad it was a mistake i guess butbut i didnt know where she was going andi know dad would hang up if she rang or would burn any letters she wrote nikki nodded if you give me her full name and birthdate i might be able to contact her she offered if you like could you jims eyes brightened and then clouded again he lay back on his pillows shes probably glad to be shot of us both let me try and see nikki told him it cant hurt to try she left him then and spent a fruitful halfhour on the telephone at the end of it she was practically certain that the brisbane police would contact mrs payne just let her know her sons in the eurong hospital after suffering an accident she told them it made it sound a little more serious than it really was now but jimwell jim was only nineteen and he still needed someone everyone does she thought bleakly she looked up as the door of her office opened and luke entered welcome back his tone was formal and his smile was forced how did the exam go fine nikki rose to her feet and stood awkwardly how would it be she wondered if i just told him luke im carrying your child for a momentjust a momentshe felt a crazy impulse to do so but he was looking at her with eyes that were distant and formal youve come for handover i thought i should fine then lets go so they walked through the hospital again this time with luke going through the notes as they visited each patient the process was professional efficient and cold the patients must think we cant stand each other nikki thought and bit her lip maybe for luke it was true nikki had made him drop his guard and let the world in luke had done the same for her but for nikki the world in the guise of one luke marriott was more than welcome is there anything else i should know about she asked in a tight voice as they reached the end of the patient list no ive left notes in the surgery fine she nodded hopelessly ill be getting home then iveweve a party to organise nikki dont go to any trouble she turned then you do intend to show up she demanded i havetheres a house call luke amys counting on this party nikki amy has you and beattie and she has you a surge of anger rose in nikki that he could hurt her was enough but to hurt amymy daughter cares for you luke marriott shes as big a fool as her mother in that regard id stop it if i could but i have no control over my daughters decision to give her affection shes sad to see you go and shes pressed us all into giving you a party that you dont deserve nikki you dont care who you hurt do you mr marriott she demanded youd hurt amyyoud hurt me youre hurting all your familyoh yes i forgot to tell youi saw megan while i was in cairns shes another whom youve hurt with your introspective nurturing of your damned pain just because youve been sick luke marriott you think you can trample on the feelings of others and you dont give a damn nikki i do you dont or you wouldnt do it amy is a lovely little girl luke marriott and shes going to cry herself to sleep tonight if you dont come to this damned party so you can put yourself second for a change and come and eat little red sausages and party cakes and you can look as if youre enjoying it or or what lukes face was still or i dont know nikki ended up lamely or ill think youre even more selfish thanthan my exhusband if it hadnt been for the children the night would have been impossible as it was sandra came with her four and the party was a riot if nikki was quiet and lukes smile was forced then the children more than made up for it sandras brood were making up for past deprivation with a vengeance they ate like miniature vultures while sandra made futile protesting noises in the background and beattie looked on with an indulgent smile it does me good to see whispering palms full of children she beamed its like it ought to be she glared then at both luke and nikki in turn as if they were deliberately withholding its due from the old house afterwards the children dived en masse into the pool and luke joined them amy looked a question at her mother but didnt voice it it seemed she sensed nikkis reluctance to be with them and tonight amy was going to enjoy her dr luke and her new friends to the fullest for tomorrow her doubtful look at her mother said well be back to being by ourselves not for long nikki thought grimly eight months at the thought of what lay ahead blind panic filled her she had assured charlotte that she could cope but could she when amy was a baby she had suffered at the hands of eurongs gossips now all eurong would count back and know whose baby this was and how would luke react when he finally found out he wont find out for months nikki told herself desperately it cant be until i have the strength to say i wont be part of a family for a babys sake i wont and finally the interminable evening ended luke left to drive sandra and her children home and nikki wearily carried an exhausted amy up to bed it was nice wasnt it amy asked sleepily snuggling into her mothers arms yes it was nikki pulled back amys bedcovers and deposited her daughter on to the pillows a special night dr lukes special amy said seriously mummy i dont think dr luke should go away i think he should stay here and be our daddy and so say all of us nikkis heart replied instead though she kissed her daughter goodnight and made her way back down to the kitchen beattie had already left for bed nikki made herself coffee and then went to sit out by the swimmingpool she needed time to think think of what the next few years the rest of her life she closed her eyes as loneliness engulfed her the responsibilities ahead were awesome and she couldnt face them not alone there were footsteps behind her and she turned luke was there his body outlined in the light of the doorway he saw her and came across satisfied he asked her that you came to my daughters party it was very generous of you she whispered i even ate little red sausages as an attempt at humour it was pretty appalling but nikki managed a smile she rose well done a manly effort she made to go past him but he stopped her with his hand nikki let me go please she said steadily im tired nikki im sorry it had to end this way before god i never meant to hurt you what did you mean to do he sighed i dont know my nikki i saw you so damned alone and i thoughtwell i thought it was time you came out of your shell so i dragged you out and now im exposed she whispered without a shell and im supposed to be grateful nikki im going to bed she said wearily let me go please luke not yet please nikki tomorrow ill be gone i cant stay here we both know that nikki shook her head i dont know that i dont see why you have to keep running im not running no he closed his eyes his face was haggard in the moonlight nikki im just trying to come to terms with myselfwith whats happened cant you see that with the fact that you cant have children he nodded yes its important to me luke it was so close the words were so close instead nikki drew in her breath she wouldnt buy this mans love she wouldnt it had to be for her luke i love you she whispered isnt that enough cant that be enough he stood motionless in the still tropical night around them even the cicadas fell to silence waiting and then luke shook his head i dont think it can be he said roughly god knows it should be but i cant make it work even though i want you do you want me you dont know how much he opened his eyes and stared across at her she stood motionless waiting she was playing with every card she had there was only tonight there was only now im yours if you want me luke she whispered if you want me she could do no more she closed her eyes and waited and he would have had to be less than human to resist in the moonlight her soft white dress floating around her and her tousled curls goldred in the moonlight she was almost ethereal luke groaned and half turned away nikki didnt move please she was whispering over and over in her heart please and he came to her he had to it was as if they were two parts of a magnetic force that only had attraction for each other he came and gathered her into his arms as though he were drowning his lips took hers and nikki gave herself to him with joy she could never recall how it happened but somehowsomehow they were inside in her big cool bedroom and he was kicking the wide french windows closed behind them nikkis dress was somehow falling on to the polished floorboards and she was being lifted to lie on the smooth sheets to waitto wait for her love this was her place this was her rightful home in the universe she was with her manof her manoneand her body responded with all the joy that was in her heart this man was her love this man was the father of the child she carried in her body and her whole being reacted with light and love her hands took him to her greedily hungrily she wanted to know every part of him forever and ever and ever they were mad that night they were two hearts wounded and somehow made whole for the blessing of one magic night in each others bodies they found joy and peace and love they made love and slept and woke and made love again and nikki tried to keep awake in lukes arms so that she could savour itthis night that she wanted to go on for the rest of her life i love you she whispered over and over again as he loved her bodyas he made her feel the most loved and wanted woman on the face of the earth she ran her fingers over his muscled frame and sought to make him herssought to melt her body into his i love you she whispered but he didnt respond he didnt reply his lovemaking told her that he wanted herthat he needed herand that when he was gone he would be desperate for the comfort of her body his tongue tasted her and loved her but didnt say the words that would tie him to her forever nothing and finally nikki slept she woke at dawn as luke stirred beside her disengaged his body from hers and rose sleepily nikki looked up loving the strong curves of his muscled body her eyes sought to know every inch of him instinctively she knew that there was to be no more this was the end the end she didnt speak she couldnt instead she lay in the weak dawn light and watched the man she loved prepare to leave finally clothed he turned to face her wordlessly she watched waiting silence stretched out between them it went on and on as if neither was willing to face what had now become inevitable finally luke swore softly and crossed to the bed to look down at her nikki lay still her redblonde hair tumbled on the pillow around her too pale face her eyes were enormous as she looked up at him waiting for the hurt and sure enough it came last night shouldnt have happened he said quietly his eyes painfilled these whole three weeks should never have happened nikki agreed i know but they have luke andand ive changed forever because of it he touched her hair as if it hurt to do so im gladif it means youll get out more meet people find someone someone wholl love me nikkis voice broke and she turned into her pillow luke how can you say that how can you say that when you know i love you god nikki she turned back to him then and rose to a sitting position the sheet falling away to reveal her lovely nakedness her hand came out to touch hisa wordless pleading luke why dont you want me she shook her head i donti dont understand you dont feel what i feel hell luke pulled his hand from hers and turned away to stand and stare out of the window i want you nikki god knows but not enough to ask me to stay with you for a while yes he said bleakly i want you at this moment i want you more than anything i have ever wanted in my life but i want more than that nikki i want things i cant have i want a family and im not enough no he stared sightlessly out of the window for a few crazy moments here i thought it might be i thought that with you and amy i could be at peace but i dont think i can ever be at peace nikki so the fact that you cant father a child is more important than your love for us nikkis heart shrank from what he was saying she could have this man she knew just by opening her mouth and promising him his child and it would be no better than what she had had with scott scott hadnt wanted her unless she had money now luke had no use for her unless she had his child nikki it seems unfair it is unfair nikki took a deep breath and rose pulling her sheet after her she wound it around her as if it were some sort of defence against him but her defence had come too late you made love to me as if you loved me she whispered you made me feelyou made me feel as if i was part of you and i gave myself to you not just my body luke marriott but myself my love my heart and nownow you tell me that because of your damned pastbecause of an illness thats robbed you of the ability to bear childrenmy loves not enough nikki anger came then as some sort of inbuilt defence against the pain it gave her strength to lash out one more time youve got a damned nerve nikkis eyes flashed fire you want me if i can bear your children but not otherwise what the hell does that make me luke marriott i know its unfair too damned right its unfair he shook his head lukes hands came up as if to touch her and then fell away uselessly to his sides nikki my family is importantlook it would be so easy to take you to take what youre offering and then in five yearswell in five years if my inability to have children were as important to me as it is now wed be in a real mess because it would hurt for me to have amy and your brothers and sisters to have children and you not yes damn it yes and thats more important than my love yes no luke was as angry as nikki now his eyes almost black with frustration and fury its easy for you to say its not important and if magically you could have childrenwhat then he shook his head the flash of anger slowly fading i dont know he said quietly nikki if i could have children with youoh god nikki so youd want me as a mother to your children nikkis voice was flat and lifeless but not otherwise nikki thats not what im saying well its what it sounds like from here nikki spat its just as well youre going luke marriott its just as well youre getting out of my life because i think your cancer has done more damage than you know i dont know what you mean you should nikki said bleakly i thinki think its destroyed your capacity to love nikki just go she said chapter eleven the weeks that followed were desolate without luke the house fell silent amy became once again a solemn child and even beattie forgot to sing as she did the housework beattie watched her young employer with concern her shrewd eyes taking in the telltale shadows on nikkis face if she heard nikki wandering the house late at night or saw her lonely figure standing out by the swimmingpool staring at nothing for hours on end she said nothing somehow nikki managed to work her results came through for her examinationsa magnificent result the letter said congratulations she felt nothing nikki laid the letter aside and beattie found it underneath a pile of advertising literature the following morning once more beatties forehead wrinkled into a frown of concern but still she said nothing it was fortunate for nikkis sanity that there was plenty of work she drove herself mercilessly shoving aside the lethargy of early pregnancy there was no time to think of the child she was carrying she didnt want to know and yet in a way she was intensely aware of the new life starting within her it was a little of luke left to her the baby would bring luke happiness when he heard she knew once he knew he was not sterile he could find someone elseone of the women who had loved him when he was back in cairns or someone elsesomeone whod be prepared to accept him on the terms he offered a woman who wanted to be the mother of his children first the mother of lukes childrennikki touched her still flat stomach selfconsciously as she acknowledged herself as such that was what she was whether she wanted it or not the mother of lukes child so why not accept the joy as well because she wanted more for once in her life nikki wanted to be loved for herselfwanted for herselfand if luke didnt want her on those terms then she couldnt let him near she began to plan the mechanics of the next few months as she went about her work at about five months she would write to him care of the medical board she thoughtor care of the newspaper he wrote for she would have to write before there was a possibility of his hearing via the medical grapevine it would be a formal little note passing on the news of her condition and also letting him know it could make no difference to their relationship even if he came storming up here in another three months then she must be strong enough to cope with that she must be strong enough to tell him there was no place in her life for him is there anything wrong doc nikki looked up swiftly from what she was doing she was rechecking jim paynes healing thumb he had been released from hospital the week before with no complications anticipated it was healing beautifully thanks to lukes expert care and nikki forced a smile nothings wrong jim she reassured him this is looking really good you might have some residual stiffness but ill give you some exercises to do once you get rid of the plaster and itll slowly get back to almost a hundred per cent i meant the young man frowned down at her i meant with you youre notwell youre not as cheerful as you used to be im not a really cheerful person nikki told him somewhat taken aback at his forthrightness you were when doc marriott was here nikki shook her head the town would be talking about her and luke she knew how much would the talk grow as her figure filled out it was good to have him here she said simply he was a very skilled surgeon dont i know it jim looked ruefully at his thumb i guess ill be grateful to him for the rest of my life you havent heard from your mother nikki asked trying to turn the subject yeah nikki frowned she picked up the scraps of the bandage she had been fixing and tossed them into the rubbish bin so what gives the boy was silent for a moment staring at his bandaged hand i dunno he said at last you dont know jim shook his head he looked up did you know im boarding at sandra mearss thatsthats why i was saying you were more cheerful when doc marriott was here sandra said you were she reckonedshe reckoned you had something going between you nikki shook her head sandras on the wrong track she said tightly then she looked up how are you finding it at sandras its great shes a real good sort and i like the kids mmm was this going to work nikki turned it over in her mind replaying the conversation shed had with sandra the week before we advertised and jim replied shed said happily and ive always felt sorry for jimmy i reckon hes had almost as bad a deal as me do you think you can cope with the extra work nikki had frowned and sandra had laughed i like housework shed grinned call me daft if you like but now ive a decent house to look after itll be no trouble the kids like jimmy and his board money will be handywell im going to start thinking were rich so nikki had smiled and agreed knowing jim was reluctant to go home to a father who didnt seem to give a damn about his only son but if jims mother were to come she telephoned me in the hospital jim said slowly andand she asked me to go to brisbane to stay with her oh jim thats terrific he shook his head maybe not he looked up shes remarried her new husbands a widower with three kids i dunno you dont know where you fit he shook his head i know dad seems a selfish bastard he said directly but mumwell she left and maybe if she really wanted to contact me she could have and herewell here at least i know the people and i know ive got a job on your fathers boat yeah well maybe ill go back to working for him and maybe i wont jim said uncertainly theres other boats but fishings all i know its going to be quite a change living with sandra it is and all jim said happily those kids he shook his head theyre great kids doc russell and do you know the boys have never even been taught to kick a football no nikki breathed in mockhorror and jim grinned well im going to teach them he said resolutely he took a deep breath sandras taken a risk taking me in i know this town and i know itll talk even more about her but we talked it over and reckoned we could ignore it and maybe make it work nikki sat back on her heels and looked thoughtfully at the young fisherman he sounded as if he was taking on more of a responsibility than a decision to rent a room for a few weeks and when the door opened for jim to leave the surgery and nikki saw sandra and the two youngest children in the waitingroom she saw what was happening a family was forming out of mutual need the children came forward to greet jim as their personal property and he took a hand of each and turned to go thanks a lot doc he told nikki over his shoulder thanks for everything nikki watched them walk awaysandra at twentytwo with the lilt of a girl back in her step and jim at nineteen playing the father for heavens sake she smiled suddenly it mightit just might work crazier things had happened and then her receptionist handed her the next card and nikki turned her attention to mrs alphingtons neuralgia she didnt have time for reflectionand that was the way she wanted it the days dragged on nikki found herself staring stupidly at the calendar as though it had some meaning three weeks since she had seen lukefour when will he come back amy asked for the hundredth time and nikki strove for patience luke isnt coming back she said gently he will amy said stubbornly even if its just for a visit maybe hell come for christmas dont count on it nikki winced at the thought of christmas she hated it christmasthe time of families beattie left them every christmas flying down to brisbane for her onceayear visit to her daughter and there would only be amy and nikki some christmas maybe she should employ another locumget right away for a few weeks if she could get somewhere cooler maybe this awful cloud of oppression would lift summer had arrived with a vengeancethe real tropical rainy season it rained unceasingly the rain turning to steam in the blistering heat nikki never enjoyed the rainy season and nowit was as if the sky were crying in sympathy with her its real cyclone weather beattie said darkly as the first week of december neared its end were in for one you wait and see dont say so nikki groaned the last cyclone near eurong had passed five years before cutting a swath of damage there were still scars in the rainforest from its passing beattie sniffed well theres no warnings yet but itll come soon she was wrong for the next few days nikki worked with her eye on the weather and her ear constantly tuned to the local radio cyclone hilda threatened them for a little but swerved right away from the coast and blew harmlessly out to sea there were no other warnings finally nikki ceased worrying and her thoughts went back to luke where was he how would he spend christmas as she and amy put up their little christmas tree she thought of lukes family gathering in melbourne would he visit them this year what would his reaction be if he knew that a child of his was on its way that next year he would be a father a father in absentia she reminded herself and then winced what if he demanded access how would she cope seeing him every time he wanted to visit their child it didnt bear thinking of she made herself concentrate on the silver baubles she was tying to the tree its lovely mummy amy said in satisfaction and then paused as beattie hurried into the room the housekeeper had been packing her suitcase ready for her afternoon flight south something was wrong the elderly housekeepers face was pale and she was obviously distressed i knew it she said tremulously its a cyclone oh no nikki rose her eyes creasing in sympathy beattie had been filled with excitement at the thought of seeing her newest grandchild for the first time if a cyclone was threatening between here and brisbane then flights would be cancelled how close nikki asked it wouldnt have to be too close for the plane to be cancelled were dead centre beattie said grimly i just heard it on the radio dead centre nikki stared at beattie in dawning horror dead centre of a cyclonethe damage cyclones did was enormous but eurong had never been directly in ones path the destruction caused by being close to the cyclone path was bad enough butbut theres been no warning of one imminent theres only been cyclone hilda and its right out to sea hundreds of miles north thats the one beattie was practically wringing her hands its swung inland for some reason and theres a red alert they saythey say itll hit here in three hours three hours instinctively nikki looked out of the window the palms were swaying in a rising wind but there was nothing to suggest an impending disaster this was no time for panic amy was watching with enormous eyes and if nikki showed she was frightened it would communicate fast to the child ok nikki said evenly striving for calm lets get the storm covers up does this mean youre not going away for christmas beattie amy asked and beattie and nikki looked at each other if that was all it meant they would be lucky i guess it does ii think ill take some things down to the storm cellar beattie said nervously and nikki nodded they hadnt used the storm cellar for anything but storage for years nikkis father had installed it as a safety precaution and eurong had decreed him mad totally unnecessary theyd said but nownow it made nikki feel that there was at least one safe place where she could leave her daughter we need to open the windows on the lee side a little nikki said quietly trying to remember the precautions shed been taught if the pressure builds up i know beattie nodded putting her personal disappointment aside ill do that now im going to have to go down to the hospital i know that too beattie said grimly she took a deep breath and looked down at amy come on then young lady you and i have got work to do can we telephone karen and her mum and ask them to share our cellar amy bubbled the cyclone sounded like a wonderful adventure from a fouryearolds angle nikki nodded slowly its not a bad idea sandras house is fibrocement with no protection our cellars big enough ill telephone beattie told her she nodded decisively at nikki and nikki silently blessed her good fortune at having such a competent housekeeper ok she stooped to give amy a quick hug you promise youll both be in the cellar an hour before the storms due to hitwhatever happens we promise beattie told her and you nikki russell she sighed well take care of yourself dont go taking any damned fool risks who me nikki smiled with a bravado she was far from feeling im not one for damned fool risks i was born a coward the hospital was at peak bustling efficiency when nikki arrived there were three internal rooms that had no windowsthe hospital had been built with storms in mindand when nikki arrived the nurses were moving their patients into safety one room will have to be left free as theatre nikki said grimly weve had enough warning for people to be prepared andrea the charge sister said surely there wont be people do darned stupid things nikki grimaced especially when theyre frightened and if we really are in the eye of the storm then many of these houses wont make it but most are built under regulations for cyclones yeah nikki piled boxes of dressing to carry to the makeshift theatre but theres still no guarantee theyll survive the eye of a cyclone remember darwin they both did the city had been struck on christmas eve several years previously and hardly a house had been left standing the force had been as great as a major earthquake it cant be as bad as that the nurse said nervously can it heaven knows i dont is the fishing fleet in there werent any boats too far out to get back into harbour the nurse told her theyre all back well thats something nikki worked steadily setting up her makeshift theatre as best she could with luck the work she was doing could be totally unnecessary to operate on seriously injured casualties she might not have a choice even after the cyclone passed it would be hours before the wind died enough to evacuate casualties nikki thought fleetingly longingly of luke she felt desperately alone knowing the next few hours would bring more casualties than she could cope with everyones being warned she asked anxiously her mind raced over her scores of elderly patients who lived alone many wouldnt have heard the radio warning the state emergency service are doing a doorknock now the charge nurse told her andrea was linked to the emergency services by twoway radio anyone theyre worried about theyll bring in here or to the school like the hospital the school also had reinforced rooms fine everything that could be done was being done so now there was only time to sit and wait and hope i dont suppose dr maybury could come nikki said uncertainly if she didnt have an anaesthetist there was little she could do if there were serious casualties the elderly doctor was nikkis nearest colleague and he was within driving distance if he came at once i doubt it the charge sister told her penrith is thirty miles south but by the sound of the radio warnings theyre expecting damage there as well hell have to stay nikki nodded she knew it already she was on her own the wind rose with relentless fury how would amy and beattie be coping nikki tried to block out thoughts of home as the storm gathered strength her attention was needed here half an hour before the eye of the storm was due every one of the occupants of the hospital deserted the outside rooms and the inner doors of the little hospital were wedged closed the telephone lines were already down there was no way nikki could contact home even if she wanted to eurong was isolated until the storm was past and every home was also completely isolated as they closed the big inner doors and nikki saw the outside world for the last time she wondered how on earth the storm could get fiercer the huge coconut palms around the hospital were bending almost double in the shrieking wind and beyond the headland the sea was a seething white fury but grow worse it did locked behind their doors the hospital occupants couldnt see but they could hear the wind screamed around the little building and every now and then a crack rang out like gunfirethe sound of a palm giving up its fight for life there was little time to listen within the room nikkis patients were terrifiednot so much for the immediate danger but at the thought of what lay ahead when those doors were opened again nikki moved from bed to bed comforting as best she could and listening to nameless fears she sedated one elderly lady as her fears brought on angina a fullscale heart attack was the last thing nikki wanted now she would have enough to deal with when the doors opened the wait was interminable the sound of the screaming wind went on and on and when it finally eased nikki knew that the doors had to stay closed now they were in the eye of the cycloneand there was a rim to the eye they had passed through one side of the rim and the other was yet to come if only she knew what was going on at home the thought of the cellar was infinitely comforting and beattie knew about the eye of the storm she knew not to come out yet the little radio owned by one of the patients and listened to by all was blazing out warnings of the danger to come stay where you are it warned over and over again dont think the danger is over stay behind closed doors use rooms with the least windows think of the pantryor the broom closet the bathroom is often the safest room stay where you are as long as people were listening nikki sent endless silent prayers up to whoever would listen please let people stay put please let no one be hit by falling trees or flying pieces of corrugated ironit was a useless prayer but she sent it anyway i wont have a house any more an elderly man said flatly as she paused by his bed my place is old and rundown and it wont stand up to this racket his gnarled old face creased into tears youll have to put me in a home after this my housell be matchsticks there was little comfort nikki could give outside the storm struck again as the eye passed and each fresh blast made her wince to stay here while eurong was blown to bitsit was the hardest thing she had done in her life and then finally the worst of the storm was past the screaming wind settled to howls and then to a dull whine the nurses looked at each other fearfully and then at nikki nikki nodded in silent acquiescence it was time to open the doors maybe it would have been better to stay inside the nurses and the ambulatory patients walked outside to a deathless hush it was a frightening new world the hospital had survived the building was intact but every window had been blasted out the rooms were full of debris and rain water torn curtains lay shredded on the floor in sodden heaps the wind still whistled in through the broken windows bringing rain in with it steam rose from everything soundlessly they moved outside the veranda posts had crumpled under the strain and the roof sagged under the weight of a huge coconut palm luckily the two posts over the door had held so it was safe to move outside if one wanted to nikki took one look and decided she might not want to see the rest of the devastation the hospital gardens were in ruins nikkis car lay where she had parked in the hospital car park turned up on to its side it was covered with a mass of torn and twisted debris dear god andrea was beside nikki and her hand came up to grasp nikkis arm dear god there was nothing else to say around them the rest of the staff were slowly coming to terms with what they were seeing they had little time for reflection as the patients saw and guessed at the damage elsewhere it was as much as the small nursing staff could do to control the rising hysteria nikki conquered it by ordering everyone to work patients included i want everyone fit enough to move to start getting the water out of the wards she demanded i want plastic over the windows i want the beds made up again dry and ready for whatever comes mrs fletcher nikki eyed a patient whod been in hospital with a broken hip mavis fletcher was in tears already and her tears were turning to noisy sobs mavis can you hear me mavis looked up tearfully oh me dear she gasped what are we going to do what are we going to do i dont know about you but i intend to start working nikki said grimly if im not mistaken therell be people out there who are a lot worse off than we are if i put you in a wheelchair can you supervise sandwichmaking mr roberts might be able to help what do you say mavis gave a tearful gulp she looked around at the mess and then back to nikki to be needed if you think i can dear she whispered nikki grinned im sure you can she said solidly im sure we all can it was the last time nikki had to ask anyone to help the whole hospital was galvanised into action even the patients doing what they could to clear the mess and prepare for the onslaught and onslaught there was five minutes after they emerged from the inner rooms their first casualty arriveda man carrying his threeyearold daughter shed been hit by a block of plaster falling from the roof the child was concussed and needed stitches to a nasty gash on her head and by the time nikki had attended her there were three more patients waiting amazingly there seemed little serious injury as each casualty arrived nikki braced herself for tragedy but although the stories of property damage were heartbreaking as yet there were no reports of loss of life there were a couple of fractures and dozens of lacerations caused by falling debris nikki held her breath as she worked if this was all the new regulations seem to have worked andrea told her in a break between patients and the warnings which everyones had since darwin people havent taken risks and they havent been seriously hurt nikki nodded andrea could you find out about whispering palms she said tightly the girl working beside her flashed her a look of understanding oh doctor im sorry ill contact ses theyll go around now theres no need to make a special trip nikki managed butbut ill work better if i know its still standing of course andrea turned to go but before she did they heard footsteps racing along the debrisstrewn hall and the door to their inner sanctum burst open it was sandra sandra was soaking wet her dress was torn and a gash dripped blood slowly down across one eye she was wildeyed and gasping for breath nikki she burst out doctornikki can you come nikki turned from the wound she was dressing the colour drained from her face sandra had been in the cellar at whispering palms amy she whispered she clutched the edge of the examination table sandra wheres amy sandra caught herself with a visible effort she took a ragged breath and then another silently andrea moved forward and took the girls arm she looked as though she was about to collapse its not amy she managed imim sorry i didnt think you were in the cellar at whispering palms sandra nodded andrea pushed the girl into a chair and she sat gratefully her knees buckling under her ththanks ok now that nikkis worst fear had been relieved she could be calm again she knelt in front of sandra and took her hands tell me whats happened she said gently its jim jim payne sandra nodded he was with us at the beginning helping with the kids then when beattie rang he said it was sensible that we all go to whispering palms so he took us but he didnt stay sandra shook her head he wouldnt hehe made sure we were all safe and made us promise not to leave the cellar and then he said he had to go to his father his father nikki thought of bert paynes tiny rundown house down by the beach whatever regulations the council had introduced she could be a hundred per cent sure that bert wouldnt have introduced them hed tell any official to mind his own damned business so jims down at his fathers no yes sandra looked up her face a tearstained plea for help as soon as we got out of the cellar i went to try to find him whispering palms is ok and beattie said shed be fine with the kids andand jims been so good to us i had to leave the car a quarter of a mile from the house and walk in theres trees down all over and thenthen i came to the house she looked up its down the house has collapsed yes and jim and his father are inside yes nikkis grip on the girls hands tightened are they dead sandra the shock tactics worked sandras eyes flew open and she fought for some sort of control she shook her head notnot yet iwill you come of course ill come nikki was already rising pulling sandra after her are they trapped inside i dont again a ragged gasp for breath yes theres a huge tree over the house and jims inside and his fathers stuck fast and jim says hell bleed to death if he leaves him but the trees going to come all the way down any minute and lets go nikki turned to andrea let the emergency services know i want ablebodied men there as fast as possible tell them i want shoring timbers and as much help as i can get do you want me to come andrea asked nikki shook her head youre needed here andrea im needed here too come to that but if bert paynes bleeding she turned back to sandra does anyone else know sandra shook her head iit was closer to run to the hospital than go back for the car i didnt meet anyone ok lets go they arrived at what was left of bert paynes fishing shack ten minutes later the road was impassable with nikkis little car but just as they came to a halt three men in a state emergency fourwheeldrive vehicle came racing up behind them they moved nikkis equipment over to their jeep and kept on going good grief nikki muttered holding on to her seat for dear life the jeep bucketed over the debris strewn as if it were a deliberately placed obstacle course youll kill this car she blinked forward trying to see what was ahead in the pelting tropical rain better the jeep dies than jim payne the driver said grimly and nikki nodded jimthere was concern for the boy but not the father bert payne had made few friends in this town then what was left of bert paynes house was in view and the condition of the jeep was forgotten the house was flattened as if it had been a house of cards blown flat nikki stared at the wreck in horror there were the remains of a chimneystack in one corner and nothing else there was nothing higher than chest height that someone might still be in there the driving wind and rain were almost blinding her whipping her sodden hair around her face nikki pushed it back in frustration before the jeep came to a halt sandra was out of the vehicle running to what was left jim she screamed jim sandra it was a hoarse cry from somewhere under the ruin barely audible above the sound of the still whistling wind sandra ive got help sandra yelled hoarsely dr nikki and men already the men were in action following the sound of jims voice nikki dragged her bag from the car and then stood helplessly where on earth were they theyre right under the tree sandra said hopelessly oh god the tree was enormous it was a vast strangler fig which had grown originally around a coconut palm the coconut palm had long since died and the fallen fig now resembled a huge hollow log after the rotting of its host it was almost twenty feet wide at the basea mass of thick twisting wood smashed down on the tiny house were going to have to cut through the ses chief said grimly well never lift the thing its going to come down further sandra told him look they looked where the tree had snapped was about eight feet from the base it had fallen but the base of its broken part had caught on the shattered stump there was maybe a twoinch rim where the weight of the huge tree rested my god the ses chief whispered he swung around to his secondincommand the shoring timbers weve got wont hold that get back to base i want more men and stouter timbers if that goes down there was no reason to finish the sentence they all knew jim where are you nikki was moving along the trunk of the tree stepping over debris in here jims voice was hoarse and tight are you hurt yeahivei think my arms brokeand my headi keep blacking out and your dad hes here hes unconscious but hes still alive hes bleeding though doc im holding his leg buti cant keep the pressure up are you trapped theres a bit of space behind me i reckoni reckon i could crawl back out butbut dads stuck and if i leave him hell bleed to death nikki was standing almost over the voice now she looked around to where the debris subsided the old doorway was just here clambering down she peered through there was a gap in here if she crawled jim yeah she could see a shape stir slightly in the blackness the beams of the doorway had slipped down but had afforded protection to a small areaa tunnel of no more than eighteen inches in diameter jim seemed about fifteen feet in through this tunnel your fathers bleeding from the leg she asked behind her the ses men and sandra were staring in horror as she wedged herself into the gap trying to see the top of his thigh hesthe trees over his chest i cant budge jims voice trailed off he sounded close to unconsciousness himself and youve lost blood too nikki spoke loudly and insistently she didnt want him passing out now yeahitit doesnt matter oh jim behind nikki sandra had started to cry she clutched nikkis arm and pulled her backwards hes got to come out if that tree slips then she raised her voice jim youve got to come out your dad doesnt give a stuff about you youve got to she broke off and turned away jims not like his father nikki told her rising and putting her hand briefly on sandras shoulder and if he wereif he were then you wouldnt be crying she took a deep breath and lowered her voice sandra have you told jim how dangerous the tree is sandra shook her head i didnt see until now oh nikki jim were shoring up the entrance to where you are nikki gave a warning look to sandra and the men as she raised her voice i want you to come out im not leaving i told youdadll die hell die if you stay nikki said brutally you sound as though youre drifting in and out of unconsciousness do you have the strength to maintain pressure on that leg or is it still bleeding its still bleeding jim managed but you can move yeahbut jim i cant get in unless you come out nikki said harshly and your father needs me sandra gave a gasp but nikkiyou cant she was stopped by nikkis fierce grip on her arm sandra jims hurt and i dont know how badly this is the only way hell come out it was nikki had known it since she saw the entrance it was unpalatable but true she bent down and peered into the recess one of the ses men was directing a flashlight through the rubble ok jim she ordered start moving slowly backwards now but dadll die the faster you get out the faster i get in nikki said ruthlessly move jim three minutes later jim emerged to daylight nikki did a lightning check on the dazed young man satisfied herself that she could leave him to the care of the people around him and then stooped down the ses man stopped her as she placed her hand on the doorbeam doc this is just bert payne youre risking your neck for he said uncertainly ii dont like this nikki nodded i know its just bert payne she whispered looking over to where sandra was holding jim but hes dying in there and im a doctor i havent a choice he wouldnt do the same for you the man said brutally no nikki shook her head but then he doesnt seem to have passed his cruel attitudes on to his son thank heavenand we cant afford to be like him she took one last look at jim and sandra took a deep breath and lowered herself into the makeshift passage jim had been wearing heavy denim jeans which had protected him a little from the worst of the jagged splinters and nails and for the first time in weeks nikki regretted that she wasnt wearing the same charlottes pretty clothes had become part of hera legacy of her time with luke now the dress she was wearing ripped three feet into the tunnel and she felt a nail jab into her bare leg she swore and kept going ill ring charlotte and give her a hard time when i get out of here nikki thought grimly as she felt her way forward through the mass of broken timber the thought of charlotteof cairnsof somewhere other than this hellholewas somehow steadying she had to think of something other than the tree poised above where on earth was bert jim had backed out this way bert payne must be somewhere here she shoved forward her hands groping in the dim light and her hand met something soft here he was nikki could see nothing what she was feeling seemed to be a leg shed attached a rope to her waist before coming in and now she turned to tug it after her her bag came sliding roughly through the debris and attached to its handle was a flashlight nikki looked back along the tunnel and saw daylight being blocked by anxious faces she flashed her light at them and then turned back to her patient and her heart sank bert payne lay half crushed by the huge tree it held his body in a vice and nikki couldnt see his left arm or leg his face was near her his skin devoid of any colour and his breathing was shallow and uneven nikkis hand slid down the exposed leg and met the warm ooze of blood instinctively nikki felt for a pressure point but she knew already that her action was useless there must be massive internal injuries with her free hand she felt for a pulse and as she did berts eyes flew open jim he whispered weve taken jim out nikki said gently he has a broken arm but hes safe but the mans eyes concentrated in a sheer effort of remembrance as nikki groped in her bag for morphine but he was here yes he came back to see i was all right yes he did nikki twisted her body to a position where she could fill the syringe she turned and drove it home wondering as she did so whether there was time for it to take effect i wasi was a bastard to him the big man muttered he reached forward with his one free arm and gripped nikkis hand youre sureyoure sure hes all right hes safe nikki was no longer worrying about the oozing blood it was too late for that now she gripped berts free hand in hers and held it tell himtell him im sorry ill do that nikki told him evenly i promise and tell him the elderly fisherman closed his eyes as if he had reached a point where he could go no further his words were an almost superhuman effort tell him hes been a good kid and imim proud of him tell him ill tell him it was the last thing bert payne ever said five minutes later he died there was nothing more for nikki to do she let berts hand rest on the pile of rubble and pushed her bag back out of the way there was no point in her staying not now but as she moved so did the tree nikki looked up in fear as the massive trunk started slowly to settle she flung herself backwards but it was too late the mass of rubble in the tunnel behind her came down in a dustladen roar the dust filled her head blinding her she put her hands instinctively to her head and waited and it came the huge mass of debris above her head shifted downwards nikki felt a blow to her shoulder and then a massive crushing weight on her head she tried to cry out but no sound came the weight nikki the sound came from outside the shifting rubble nikki luke nikki whispered a response uselessly into the shifting tearing dark it was luke he had come back to herluke then she knew no more chapter twelve there was something gripping her head it was an iron vice clamping behind each ear and slowly squeezing nikki opened one eye and then shut it again fast whatever was holding her gripped a thousandfold tighter with light she lay absolutely still not daring to move whatever vice her torturers were using might stay in abeyance if she only kept still theres my girl come on nikki love you can do it come on my love she was dead and was dreaming nikkis eyes stayed firmly closed while she thought about the voice it was lukes it was lukes voice her love maybe it wasmaybemaybe if she opened her eyes she would see him but then again maybe not maybe she was dead and dreaming come on nikki love there was no mistaking the voice nikki felt her hands being taken between two strong ones and gripped and somehow lukes hold on her hands lessened the gripping pain surrounding her head come on nikki love you can do it come back to me nikki come back to mestill nikki didnt stir she lay and let the voice drift around her it was luke he was here with her and his voice held love if she opened her eyes then she might find it was all a dream that it was all some cruel joke her head hurt so a tear crept down her cheek and she tasted it as it reached her lips she was dead and dreaming that luke was herethat luke had come back to her and then the hold on her hands tightened and a mouth covered hers kissing away the salt tear come on nikki love come back to me i love you so much and she opened her eyes it was no dream he was hereher luke he was holding her as if she were the most precious thing in the world and his kiss held the tenderness she had only dreamed of he must have felt her slight movement lukes head lifted from her face and his troubled eyes looked down and he saw her eyes on his there was no mistaking the joy in his face it lit him within blazing down on her like a blessing nikki his voice was hoarse with strain nikki luke nikki wasnt too sure where her voice came from she only knew that somehow the nightmare had receded the pain in her head was still there but so was lukeand who could feel pain with so much happiness inside tears slid helplessly down her face luke she whispered again and he closed her lips with his fingers dont try to speak nikki love youre safe amy and beattie are fine and youre safe thats all that matters you came too damned right i came luke said grimly he gathered her tenderly to him holding her tight while leaving her carefully still on the white hospital bedclothes and im never leaving you again not ever and thats a promise my love my lovenikki closed her eyes again as the words drifted round and round her my love it was with her still as she drifted into sleep when next she woke the pain in her head had all but disappeared nikki lay for a moment staring sightlessly up at the hospital ceiling the pain had gone but so had luke had she dreamed the whole thing had it been some crazy nightmare she put her hand tentatively up to her head a large bandage covered her forehead shed been hit on the head and had been dreaming the disappointment almost made her cry out but as her hand dropped to the pillow the door opened and andrea bustled in well well the charge nurse smiled so youre awake dr russell about time too nikki tried to focus howhow long have i been asleep oh about two days two days well not all of that time asleep andrea told her lifting nikkis wrist and looking down at her watch to check her pulse you were unconscious for twentyfour hours she grimaced down you gave us the fright of our lives she confessed i gave me the fright of my life nikki agreed weakly she put her hand back up to her bandages whats a fractured skull and twelve stitches andrea told her but its a simple fracture and there doesnt appear to be any internal bleeding dr luke says dr luke dr luke says youll live andrea grinned happily down at nikki and dr luke seems a whole heap happier since he made that announcement i can tell you so he really is here ii thought i dreamed it hes here andrea told her hes checking a plaster at the moment or hed probably be beside you right now she smiled again hes spent a fair amount of time next to this bed over the last two days ii thought i heard him whenwhen the tree came down you did andrea told her i gather he was in cairns and when the cyclone warning came through he moved heaven and hell to get back here he came storming in here about fifteen minutes after you left for bert paynes he got a helicopter to port douglas but heaven knows how he got through the blocked roads to here the call came from the ses people about two minutes after he arrived asking for more men and longer shoring timbers and telling us why they told us you were in the ruins with bert and dr marriottwell she shook her head i think dr marriott seemed a little crazy so he was there he got there just as the tree came down andrea told her the ses men told me he worked like a madman she hesitated have a look at his hands next time you see him theyre torn to bits he didnt stop until they got you out and even thenwell even then i think he was a little crazy she shook her head you looked awful you were deeply unconscious and there was so much blood but bert payne bert paynes dead andrea told her but jims alive thanks to you the ses people say it was a miracle you werent crushed to death anyone as big as jim would be dead for sure jimsjims ok jims ok its his plaster dr marriott is checking now its checked the strongly masculine voice came from the doorway making the charge nurse twist around with a start luke was standing there his stethoscope swinging from his fingers and his eyes on nikki he needs a new sling though sister he said without taking his eyes from nikki if you could the charge nurse looked from nikki to luke and back again she smiled broadly i was just taking dr russells obs she said demurely but if you think my services are wanted elsewhere i think your services are wanted elsewhere luke confirmed you wont disturb my patient will you doctor the nurse grinned luke picked up the observation chart threateningly get out of here you insolent baggage he smiled dr russell im sorry to inform you that you have a very insubordinate staff its hard to command respect when andrea and i went to kindergarten together nikki whispered and luke crossed swiftly to the bed to take her hand behind him andrea made her departure still grinning dont you worry about that my love he said gently the staffll fall in line now im back working here together well pull this place into shape he smiled down at the bed in a way that made nikkis heart almost stop beating togetherand luke was looking at her as as she had always dreamed a man would look at her not just a man her luke we she whispered this medical service is damned inefficient luke complained with mockseverity he sat on the bedside chair and possessed himself of her other hand leaking roofs draughty corridors nurses wearing torn jeans and swearing their uniform blew out the window when i complain a hospital kitchen with a living potplant wedged right through one wall i like a bit more antiseptic and sparkle myself a staff who say yes doctor no doctor three bags full doctor you dont stand a chance in a million nikki smiled butbut luke yes my love his eyes were twisting her in two his eyes were making love to her all by themselves youre not staying luke frowned nikki whispering palms is one of the few undamaged houses in the district you dont have any reason to leave inno well there you go then youre staying im staying luke nikki looked helplessly up at him her head was spinning in a dizzy haze of light luke dontdont say it dont say it isnt true he finished for her he nodded and his smile faded his grip on her hands tightened i shouldnt but i can be happy here theres enough medicine to keep me content and i can keep my journalism going as well but whether i stay depends depends on whether one crazy courageous beautiful girlwoman will find it in her heart to forgive me for walking away on the most precious gift ive ever received on whether my heartmy lifemy lovely nikki will marry me nikki drew in her breath luke i know i left you luke said softly but nikki i almost went out of my mind i thoughti thought family was so damned important my masculinity was such an issue that i couldnt cope and thenthen i walked away and i realised you and amy were my family already whether you agreed to marry me or not because my heart is yours nikki russell for now and forever nikki took a long shuddering breath tears of weakness and joy were sliding down her face and luke swore as he bent to kiss them away you dont have to say anything yet he told her gently god nikki i shouldnt be saying this but but i thought id lost you and i thought there was nothing as bad as that the cancer infertility nothing to lose my lovely nikki he shook his head and then kissed her lightly on the lips you need to sleep we can talk about this later yes it was a sleepy murmur nikkis hand didnt relinquish her grip and her hand was not relinquished in turn she was where she wanted to be for the rest of her life nikki love mmm nikki before you sleep can you do a wriggle for me test your fingers and toes nikki thought about this for a moment it was sensible and it didnt interfere with her euphoric happiness she tried ouch she said softly where ive got full movement she told him sleepily but my lower back feels as though its been kicked by a horse youve got a thumping bruise there luke told her it looks like just bruising but maybe id better take an xray to make sure nikkis eyes flew wide suddenly lukeluke i havent been bleeding have i he frowned no apart from your head she closed her eyes in thankfulness thank god she whispered thank luke let her hands fall and he bent forward nikki what the hell she smiled faintly and her eyes opened again this was right there would never be a better time i was just thinking maybe you shouldnt do that xray she whispered why not lukes eyes were dark with anxiety because pelvic xrays on unborn babies are contraindicated unborn babies luke sat back hard in his chair you meanmy god nikki youre not pregnant only a little bit she smiled shyly only he seized her hands again and his grip wasnt gentle how far you tell me nikki smiled or dont you remember there was a long long silence nikki watched as lukes face twisted his eyes closed as though in pain but when they opened there was no pain there was joy there was love and there was peace my nikki he gathered her to him and held her close around them the insistent rain battered the roof and the wind whipped around the building searching for entry in the makeshift repairs neither noticed no storm could touch them where they were they had come home marion lennox
