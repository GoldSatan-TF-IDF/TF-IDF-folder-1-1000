of the greatest thrills of my writing career thank you for your support and enjoy the read prelude beirut lebanon mitch rapp stared at his reflection in the dusty cracked mirror and questioned his sanity there was no shaking or sweaty palms he wasnt nervous it was just a cold calculated assessment of his abilities and his odds for success he went over the plan once more from start to finish and again concluded it was likely that he would be severely beaten tortured and possibly killed but even in the face of such prospects he couldnt bring himself to walk away which brought him right smack dab back to that part about his mental health what kind of man willingly chose to do such a thing rapp thought about it for a long moment and then decided someone else would have to answer that question while everyone else seemed content to sit on their hands it was not in rapps nature to do so two of his colleagues had been grabbed from the streets of beirut by a nasty little outfit called islamic jihad they were a tentacle of hezbollah that specialized in kidnapping torture and suicide bombings the jihadis had without question already begun the interrogation of their new prisoners they would expose the men to unthinkable pain and they would begin to peel back each layer of the onion until they got what they wanted that was the savage truth and if his colleagues could delude themselves into thinking otherwise it just meant they had consciously or unconsciously gravitated toward convenient conclusions after a day of watching the very people who said they would handle the situation do nothing rapp decided to look for a solution on his own the bureaucrats and foreign service types back in washington might be content with letting things take their natural course but rapp was not hed been through too much to allow his cover to be blown and beyond that there was that nagging little thing about honor and the warriors code hed been through the wringer with these guys one he respected admired and liked the other he respected admired and hated the pull for him to do something anything to save them was strong the gang back in washington might be able to simply write off losing the faceless operatives as a cost of war but to the guys who were in trenches it was a little more personal warriors dont like leaving their own to die at the hands of the enemy because secretly they all know they might be in the same position one day and they sure as hell hope their country will do everything in their power to get them back rapp eyed his fractured reflection his thick uncombed head of black hair and beard his bronzed olive skin and his eyes so dark that they were almost black he could walk among the enemy without attracting so much as a suspicious glance but that would all change if he didnt do something he thought of his training and everything hed sacrificed the entire operation would be exposed and that meant his career in the field would be over hed be stuffed behind some desk back in washington where hed rot for the next twentyfive years hed wake up each morning and go to bed each night with the nagging thought that he should have done somethinganything and ultimately he would emasculate himself by questioning the size of his balls for as long as he lived rapp shuddered at the thought he might be a little crazy but hed read enough greek tragedies to understand that a life filled with that kind of recrimination would eventually lead him to the psych ward no he thought id rather go down swinging he nodded to himself and took a deep breath before walking over to the window rapp gently pulled back the tattered curtain and looked down at the street the two foot soldiers from islamic jihad were still positioned across the street keeping an eye on things rapp had dropped a few hints around the neighborhood about what he was up to and they had shown up barely an hour after he had pressed his seventh hundreddollar bill into the willing hand of a local merchant rapp had considered killing one lackey and interrogating the other but knew word would spread so fast that his colleagues would be either moved or killed before he could act on whatever intel he could gather rapp shook his head this was it there was only one avenue open to him and there was no sense in delaying what had to be done he quickly scrawled a note and left it on the small desk in the corner he gathered his sunglasses the map and a large wad of cash and headed for the door the elevator was broken so he walked the four flights to the lobby the new man behind the front desk looked nervous as all hell which rapp took as a sign that someone had talked to him he continued out the front door into the blazing daylight and held his map above his head to block the sun while he looked up and down the street looking out from behind the sunglasses he pretended not to notice the duo from islamic jihad with his face buried in the map he turned to the right and started heading east within half a block rapps nervous system began sending his brain alarms each more frantic than the previous one it took every ounce of control to override his training and millions of years of basic survival instincts that were embedded like code into the human brain up ahead the familiar black car was parked across the street rapp ignored the man behind the wheel and turned down a narrow side street just thirty paces ahead a roughlooking man was stationed in front of a shop his left leg was straight and firmly planted on the pavement and the other bent up behind him and placed against the side of the building his big frame was resting against the building while he took a long drag off his cigarette there was something vaguely familiar about him right down to the dusty black pants and the white dress shirt with the sweatstained armpits the street was otherwise empty the survivors of the bloody civil war could smell trouble and they had wisely decided to stay indoors until the mornings sideshow was concluded the footfalls from behind were echoing like heavy shoes on the stone floor of an empty cathedral rapp could hear the pace of his pursuers quicken a car engine revved no doubt the black bmw hed already spotted with every step rapp could feel them closing in from behind his brain ran through scenarios with increasing rapidly looking for any way out of the impending disaster they were close now rapp could feel them the big fellow up ahead threw his cigarette to the ground and pushed himself away from the building with a little more spring than rapp would have guessed him capable of he filed that away the man smiled at him and produced a leather truncheon from his pocket rapp dropped the map in feigned surprise and turned to flee the two men were exactly where he expected them to be guns drawn one pointed at rapps head the other at his chest the sedan skidded to a stop just to his right the trunk and front passenger door swinging open rapp knew what was next he closed his eyes and clenched his jaw as the truncheon cracked him across the back of the head rapp stumbled forward and willingly fell into the arms of the two men with pistols he let his legs go limp and the men struggled with his weight he felt the arms of the big man wrap around his chest and yank him upright his mm beretta was pulled from the back of his waistband and he was dragged the short distance to the cars trunk rapp landed headfirst with a thud the rest of his body was folded in on top of him and then the trunk was slammed shut the engine roared and the rear tires bit through a layer of sand and dirt until they found asphalt rapp was thrown back as the vehicle shot away he slowly cracked open his eyes and as expected he found himself enveloped in darkness his head was throbbing a bit from the blow but not too badly there was no fear on his face or doubt in his mind though just a smile on his lips as he thought of his plan the seeds of disinformation that he had spread over the past day had drawn them in just as hed hoped his captors had no idea of the true intent of the man they now had in their possession and more important no idea of the violence and mayhem he was about to visit upon them part i chapter southern virginia one year earlier mitch rapp removed the blindfold from his face and raised his seat back the brown ford taurus sedan rocked its way down a rutted gravel road twin plumes of dust corkscrewing into the hot august air the blindfold was a precaution in case he failed which rapp had no intention of doing he stared out the window at the thick wall of pines that bracketed the lane even with the bright sun he could see no more than thirty feet into the dark maze of trees and underbrush as a child hed always found the woods to be an inviting place but on this particular afternoon it had a decidedly more ominous feel a foreboding premonition hijacked his thoughts and sent his mind careening into a place that he did not want to go at least not this afternoon still a frown creased his brow as rapp wondered how many men had died in this particular forest and he wasnt thinking of the men who had fought in the civil war all those years earlier no he thought trying to be completely honest with himself death was too openended a word for it it left the possibility that some accident had befallen the person and that was a convenient way to skirt the seriousness of what he was getting himself into executed was a far more accurate word the men he was thinking of had been marched into these very woods shot in the back of the head and dumped into freshly dug holes never to be heard from again that was the world that rapp was about to enter and he was utterly and completely at peace with his decision still a sliver of doubt sliced through the curtains of his mind and caused a flash of hesitation rapp wrestled with it for a moment and then stuffed it back into the deepest recesses of his brain now was not the time for second thoughts hed been over this around it and under it hed studied it from every conceivable angle since the day the mysterious woman had walked into his life in a strange way he knew where it was all headed from almost the first moment shed looked at him with those discerning penetrating eyes he had been waiting for someone to show up though rapp had never told her that or that the only way he could cope with the pain of losing the love of his life was to plot his revenge that every single night before he went to sleep he thought of the network of faceless men who had plotted to bring down pan am flight that he saw himself on this very journey headed to a remote place not dissimilar from the woods he now found himself in it was all logical to him enemies needed to be killed and rapp was more than willing to become the person who would do that killing he knew what was about to happen he was to be trained honed and forged into an ultimate precision weapon and then he would begin to hunt them down every last one of the faceless men who had conspired to kill all those innocent civilians on that cold december night the car began to slow and rapp looked up to see a rusted cattle gate with a heavy chain and padlock his dark brow furrowed with suspicion the woman driving the vehicle glanced sideways at him and said you were expecting something a little more hightech perhaps rapp nodded silently irene kennedy put the car in park and said appearances can be very deceiving she opened her door and stepped from the vehicle as she walked to the gate she listened a moment later she heard the click of the passenger door and she smiled without an ounce of training he had made the right decision from their very first meeting it was apparent he was different she had audited every detail of his life and watched him from afar for several months kennedy was exceedingly good at her job she was methodical organized and patient she also had a photographic memory kennedy had grown up in the business her father had worked for the state department and the vast majority of her education had taken place overseas in countries where an american was not always welcome vigilance was a part of her daily routine from the age of five while other parents worried about their kids wandering out into the street and getting hit by a car kennedys parents worried about her finding a bomb under their car it was drilled into her to always be aware of her surroundings when kennedy finally introduced herself to rapp he studied her for a long second and then asked why she had been following him at the time rapp was only twentytwo with no formal training if kennedy had a weakness it was with improvisation she liked things plotted out well in advance and being so thorough she had gone in assuming the novice would have no idea that she had been running surveillance on him she had recruited dozens of people and this was a first kennedy was caught off guard to the point of stammering for an answer the recruit was supposed to be the one struggling to understand what was going on rapps recognizing her was not part of the script later in her motel room outside syracuse she retraced her every move over the past eight months and tried to figure out where she had slipped after three hours and seventeen pages of notes she still couldnt pinpoint her mistake with frustration and grudging admiration she had concluded that rapp had extremely acute situational awareness she moved his file to the top of her stack and made a bold decision rather than use the normal people she contacted a firm run by some retired spooks they were old friends of her fathers who specialized in handling jobs without creating a paper trail she asked them to take an objective look at rapp just in case she had missed something two weeks later they came back with a summary that sent chills up kennedys spine kennedy took that report straight to her boss thomas stansfield midway through reading the file he suspected what she was up to when he finished he slowly closed the twoinchthick biography of the young mitch rapp and made her plead her case she was concise and to the point but still stansfield pointed out the potential pitfalls and obvious dangers of leapfrogging the initial phase of training she countered perfectly the game was changing he had said it himself many times they could not sit back and play defense and in this ever more interconnected world they needed a weapon more surgical than any guided bomb or cruise missile having spent many years in the field himself stansfield also knew this person would have to be uniquely autonomous someone who conveniently had no official record kennedy ticked off eight additional reasons why she felt this young man was the perfect candidate her logic was sound but beyond that there was the simple fact that they had to begin somewhere by stansfields reckoning this was an endeavor they should have started a good five years earlier so it was with a heavy sigh and a leap of faith that he decided to proceed he told kennedy to forgo the normal training and take him to the only man they knew who was crazy enough to try to mold a green recruit into what they needed if rapp could survive six months of schooling at the hands of stan hurley he might indeed be the weapon they were looking for before she left stansfield told her to eliminate any connection every last file surveillance photo and recording that could ever tie them to rapp was to be destroyed kennedy pulled the car through the gate and asked rapp to close and lock it behind them rapp did as he was asked and then got back in the car one hundred yards later kennedy slowed the vehicle to a crawl and maneuvered diagonally in an effort to avoid a large pothole why no security on the perimeter rapp asked the hightech systems more often than not they draw too much unwanted attention they also give a lot of false alarms which in turn requires a lot of manpower thats not what this place is about what about dogs rapp asked she liked the way he was thinking as if on cue two hounds came galloping around the bend the dogs charged straight at the vehicle kennedy stopped and waited for them to get out of her way a moment later after baring their teeth they turned and bolted back in the direction theyd just come from kennedy took her foot off the brake and proceeded up the lane this man kennedy said the one who will be training you the crazy little guy who is going to try to kill me rapp said without smiling i didnt say he was going to try to kill you i said he is going to try to make you think hes trying to kill you very comforting rapp said sarcastically why do you keep bringing him up i want you to be prepared rapp thought about that for a moment and said i am or at least as prepared as you can be for something like this she considered that for a moment the physical part is assumed we know youre in good shape and thats important but i want you to know that you will be pushed in ways you never imagined its a game one thats designed to make you quit your greatest asset will be mental discipline not physical strength rapp disagreed with her but kept his mouth shut and his face a mask of neutrality to be the best required equal doses of both he knew the game hed been through plenty of grueling football and lacrosse practices in the humid august heat of virginia and back then it was only a simple desire to play that kept him going now his motivation to succeed was much deeper far more personal just try to remember none of it is personal kennedy said rapp smiled inwardly thats where youre wrong he thought its all personal when he responded however he was compliant i know rapp said in an easy tone what about these other guys if there was one thing that made him a little nervous it was this the other recruits had been down here for two days rapp didnt like getting a late start they would have already begun the bonding process and were likely to resent his showing up late he didnt understand the delay but she wasnt exactly forthright with information there are six of them kennedy scrolled through the photos in her minds eye she had read their jackets they all had military experience and shared at least on paper many of rapps qualities they were all darkfeatured athletic capable of violence or at least not afraid of it and they had all to one degree or another passed the extensive psychological exams they had all showed a facility for foreign languages in terms of a sense of right and wrong they all hovered near that critical six oclock position on the mental health pie chart that thin line that separated law enforcement officers from career criminals around the next bend the landscape opened up before them a freshly mowed lawn roughly the size of a football field ran along both sides of the lane all the way to a white barn and twostory house with a wraparound porch this was not what rapp had expected the place looked like a rural postcard complete with a set of rocking chairs on the big white porch a man appeared from inside the house he was holding a cup of coffee in one hand and a cigarette in the other rapp watched him move across the porch the man swiveled his head to the left and then right in a casual manner most people would have missed it but rapps senses had been opened to the reality that the world was divided between those who were part of the herd and those who liked to hunt the man was checking his flanks he stopped at the top of the porch steps and looked down at them from behind a pair of aviator sunglasses rapp smiled ever so slightly at the realization that this was the man who was going to try to break him it was a challenge he had been looking forward to for some time chapter rapp looked through the bugsplattered windshield at the ballbuster hed been warned about even from across the yard he could see the displeased look on the guys face he had mediumlength brown hair swept to the right and a full tom selleck mustache he was in a pair of faded olive shorts that were a little on the small side and a white vneck tshirt as the car came to a stop rapp noted the faded black combat boots and white tube socks that were pulled all the way up to his knees his skin was a leathery dark brown and all of it even his cheeks seemed tightly wound with muscles and tendons rapp wondered about the eyes that were conveniently concealed behind a pair of sunglasses he thought about his plan and he figured hed find out soon enough how old is he rapp asked not sure kennedy said as she put the car in park hes older than he looks though but i wouldnt bring it up he doesnt like talking about his age she unbuckled her seatbelt wait here for a moment kennedy exited the vehicle and walked casually across the gravel driveway she was wearing black dress slacks and a white blouse due to the heat and the fact that they were more than a hundred miles from headquarters shed left her suit jacket in the backseat a mm beretta pistol was on her right hip more to avoid a tonguelashing from the man she was about to face than from any real fear that shed have to use it she looked up at the man on the porch and brushed a loose strand of her auburn hair behind her ear stopping at the base of the porch steps she said uncle stan you dont look too excited to see me stan hurley glanced down at kennedy and felt a twinge of guilt this little beauty could jerk his emotions around in ways very few could hed known irene longer than shed known herself hed watched her grow up bought her christmas presents from strange exotic places and spent more holidays with the kennedys than without them and then a little less than a decade ago all the joy had drained from their lives when a delivery van packed with over two thousand pounds of explosives pulled up to the us embassy in beirut sixtythree people perished including kennedys father hurley had been away screwing one of his sources and had narrowly dodged the bullet the cia had lost eight valuable people that april day and they had been playing catchup ever since hurley was well aware that he had almost no control over his temper so it was his habit to keep things brief when he was upset and talking with someone he liked he said simply afternoon irene kennedy had been expecting and dreading this moment for some months normally hurley would have greeted her with a warm hug and asked her how her mother was but not this afternoon shed done an end around on him and stan hurley did not like people going over his head for approval on something this serious the chill in his mood was obvious but still she pressed on asking how are you feeling hurley ignored her question and pointedly asked whos in the car new recruit thomas told me he filled you in kennedy was referring to their boss hurleys eyes were shielded by the polarized lenses of his aviators his head slowly swiveled away from the car toward kennedy yes he told me what you were up to he said with obvious disapproval kennedy defensively folded her arms across her chest and said you dont endorse my decision absolutely not why i dont run a damn boy scout camp never said you did stan kennedy said in a biting tone then why the hell are you wasting my time sending me some tittyboy college puke who doesnt know the difference between a gun and a rifle the normally stoic kennedy allowed a bit of irritation to show she was well aware of the special hold she had over hurley and a look of disapproval on her part was far more potent than a direct attack hurley looked down at her and could see she was unhappy with him he didnt like that one bit it was the same with his own daughters if one of his boys had so much as looked at him sideways he would have knocked him on his ass but the girls had the ability to get past all his defenses get inside him and create doubt still on this issue he knew he was right so he held his ground dont make this personal irene ive been at this a long time and i know what im doing i dont need you going over my head and then coming down here and dumpin some untested rookie in my lap kennedy stood sphinxlike refusing to yield her position hurley took a drag from his cigarette and said i think you should save us all the headache and get back in your car and take him back to wherever you found him kennedy was surprised by the genuine resentment she felt shed been working on this for more than a year her analysis and her instincts told her rapp was just the man they were looking for yet here she was being dismissed like some complete neophyte who had no understanding of what they were trying to accomplish kennedy slowly climbed the porch steps and squared off with hurley the veteran backed up a bit obviously uncomfortable with someone whom he wouldnt dare lay a hand on entering his personal space i got a lot of work to take care of this afternoon irene so the sooner you get back in the car the better off well all be kennedy squared her shoulders and in a tight voice asked uncle stan have i ever disrespected you thats not what this is its exactly what its about what have i done to you that has caused you to hold me in such low regard she inched closer hurleys feet began to shuffle his face twisted into a scowl you know i think the world of you then why do you treat me as if im still a teenager i dont think youre incompetent you just think i should stick to analysis and leave the recruiting and training to you he cleared his throat and said i think thats a fair statement kennedy put her hands on her hips and stuck out her chin do me a favor and take off your sunglasses the request caught hurley off guard why because i know your achilles heel and i want to see your womanizing eyes when i tell you what someone should have told you a long time ago hurley cracked a smile in an attempt to brush her off but she told him again to take his glasses off hurley reluctantly did so i respect you kennedy said in fact i might trust you more with my life than anyone in this world you are unquestionably the best man to whip these operatives into shape but theres one problem whats that youre myopic really yep im not sure you really understand the type of person were looking for hurley scoffed as if the idea was preposterous thats right and youre too stubborn to see it i suppose you think the special operations group just showed up one day who do you think trained all those guys who do you think selected them who do you think turned them into the efficient badass killing machines that they are you did and you know thats not what im talking about im talking about our third objective hurley frowned she knew right where to hit him he quietly wondered if stansfield had put her up to this and said you think this shits easy you want to take over running this little operation kennedy shook her head and smiled in amazement you know for a tough guy youre awfully thinskinned you sound like one of those damn desk jockeys back at langley who run their section as if they were some third world dictator she might as well have hit him in the gut with a twobyfour hurley stood there speechless youve created a cult of personality kennedy continued every single recruit is you twenty to thirty years ago and whats wrong with that nothing if youre talking about our first two objectives kennedy held up one finger training operatives with the skills to get down and dirty if they have to and she held up a second finger creating a highly mobile tactical assault team but when it comes to the third she shook her head were still at the starting gate hurley didnt like hearing this but he was not some unaware idiot he knew what hed been tasked to do and he was acutely aware that he had so far failed to make any progress on the most delicate of the three programs still it wasnt in him to cede the point so easily i can teach anyone how to kill thats easy you point the weapon you pull the trigger and assuming you can aim bam a piece of lead enters the targets body hits a vital organ and its done if youve got big enough balls i can teach you to slide a knife through a guys armpit and pop his heart like a balloon fuck i can show you a thousand ways to punch someones ticket i can teach you battlefield techniques until im blue in the face but kennedy asked prodding him in the direction she knew he was headed turning a man into what were looking for hurley stopped and shook his head it just aint that easy kennedy sighed this was the opening she was looking for touching hurleys arm she said im not saying it is which is why you have to start trusting the rest of us to do our jobs i have brought you a gift stan you dont realize it right now because you think a guy has to go through boot camp before hes ready to have a run at your selection process and normally i would agree with you but this is different youre just going to have to let go of some of your control issues for a bit what i have in that car is exactly what youve been looking for stan no bad habits thatll take you months to undo none of that stiff military discipline that makes all these guys stand out like a sore thumb when we dump them into an urban setting hurley glanced at the car hes off the charts on all of our tests kennedy added and hes yours for the shaping with a deep frown hurley studied what little he could see of this raw lump of coal that kennedy was about to dump in his lap that is kennedy said if you can swallow your pride and admit that the little girl you used to bounce on your knee is all grown up and just might be better at spotting talent than you checkmate hurley thought to himself im stuck with this puke at least for a few days until i can figure out how to make him quit fine he said with a defeated tone but no special favors he pulls his weight just like everyone else or hes gone i dont expect any favors but kennedy said pointing a finger at his face i am going to be very upset if i find out you singled him out and gave him some of your famous extra love and attention hurley digested her words and then gave her a curt nod fine ill do it your way but trust me if i so much as get a whiff of weakness i know i know she said robbing him of the final word youll make him wish hed never met you kennedy had pushed it as far as she was willing for the moment rapp would simply have to show the crotchety old bastard what she already knew i have to head over to the farm to take care of something ill be back for dinner she turned to head back to the car and over her shoulder she yelled and hed better look no worse for the wear than the other six or youre going to have one very unhappy niece on your hands chapter rapp watched kennedy drive away his heavy oversized lacrosse duffel bag hanging at his side the scene was a bit surreal it brought back memories of being dropped off at summer camp when he was nine and watching his mom drive off just like today he had gone of his own free will but this time there were no tears in his eyes back then hed been a boy afraid of the unknown today he was a twentythreeyearold man ready to take on the world as the car drove down the lane rapp could feel the weight of his decision a door was closing he had picked one path over another and this one was undoubtedly the one less traveled it was overgrown and more treacherous than his imagination could do justice to but then again his youthful self felt invincible and was filled with schemes to cheat death he would undoubtedly be pushed to quit but he was confident that would not happen hed never quit anything in his life and hed never wanted anything anywhere near as bad as he wanted this rapp knew the score he knew how his chain would be yanked and jerked every which way and he would be forced to endure all of it the prize at the end was what it was all about though and he was willing to endure all of it for his chance rapp could feel the mans eyes on him he let his heavy bag fall to the ground and watched him come closer the man with the stache and the sunglasses blocked his view of the long driveway rapp instantly smelled the acid mix of coffee and cigarettes on his breath he wanted to take a step back but didnt want to appear to be backing down so he stayed put and breathed through his mouth take a good look at that car hurley said sourly rapp tilted his head to the side and watched the sedan disappear around the corner she aint coming back hurley added in a taunting voice rapp nodded in agreement eyes front and center hurley snapped rapp stared at his own reflection in the polarized lenses and remained silent i dont know what kind of fucking bullshit you pulled on her i dont know how you managed to con her into thinking you had what it takes to make it through my selection process but i can promise you that every day youre here you will curse her a thousand times for walking into your life but you better do it silently because if i hear you utter one single unkind word about her i will make you feel pain you never thought possible do you understand me yes yes hurley barked do i look like one of your faggot college professors no rapp said without twitching no hurley howled with a veiny throat you call me sir when you talk to me or ill stick my boot so far up your ass youll be chewing leather a fleck of spit hit rapp in the face but he ignored it hed figured something like this would happen hed already taken a look around and hadnt seen any others so this was probably his best chance sir permission to speak i should have figured hurley said with a sigh he placed his hands on his hips and said all right ivy league ill give you this one chance to say your piece i can only pray youre going to tell me this was a bad idea and youd like to go home and ive got no problem with that he added quickly hell ill drive you myself rapp grinned and shook his head shiiiiit hurley drew out the word as he shook his head in disgust you actually think you can do this i do sir so youre really going to waste my time it appears so sir although if i may i suggest we speed things up a bit speed things up hurley asked yes sir my guess is once you step in the ring with a man you can probably figure out inside about twenty seconds if a guy has enough talent to make it through your selection process hurley nodded thats right i dont want to waste your time so i say we find out if i have the goods hurley smiled for the first time you want to take a run at me yes sir so we can speed things up hurley laughed you think you can take me from what ive heard not a chance in hell then why are in you such a hurry to get your ass kicked i figure youll do it sooner or later id rather do it sooner and whys that so we can get on with the important stuff and what would that be like you teaching me how to kill terrorists this was a first hurley took a step back and studied the new recruit he was sixone and looked to be in perfect shape but at twentythree that was expected he had thick jetblack hair and dark bronzed skin he had the right look hurley sensed the first glimmer of what kennedy had alluded to more amused than worried hurley nodded his consent and said all right well have a go at it you see that barn over there rapp nodded theres an open cot in there its yours for as long as you can last throw your crap in the footlocker and put on a pair of shorts and a tshirt if youre not ready and standing in the middle of the mat in two minutes im sending you home rapp took it as an order he grabbed his bag and took off at a trot for the barn hurley watched him duck inside noted the time on his digital watch and walked back to the porch where he set down his coffee mug on the edge of the glossy white floorboards without so much as glancing over his shoulder he unzipped his pants and began to urinate on the bushes chapter rapp found the cot next to three bunk beds it was standard military surplus not great but a hell of a lot better than the floor after stripping to his underwear he opened his bag and pulled out a pair of shorts and a plain white tshirt kennedy had told him to pack only generic clothing she didnt want him wearing anything that could give one of the other men an idea where he came from they were all under strict orders to not discuss each others past rapp folded up his clothes placed them in the footlocker closed it and set the bag on top he would have unpacked the bag but he heard his instructor approaching rapp took up his position in the middle of the wellworn wrestling mat and waited eagerly for his shot hurley stopped near the entrance to the barn took a long drag off his cigarette and began to loosen up with a few side stretches and shoulder rolls he was not expecting much of a fight so after a quick calf stretch he took one last puff off his cigarette stubbed it out against the sole of his boot and entered the barn the new recruit was standing in the middle of the mat wearing shorts and a tshirt hurley gave him the onceover he was fit just like all the others but there was a certain casual relaxed posture that he found offputting shoulders back eyes front and center hurley shook his head and mumbled some incoherent words to himself i dont have time to babysit he bent over and took off his boots and socks and set them neatly at a ninetydegree angle at the edge of the mat socks folded on top he took off his sunglasses and set them on top of the socks stepping onto the mat he asked rules rapp didnt flinch thats up to you sir hurley bent back continuing his stretching and said since no ones here to monitor this little ass kickin i suggest we keep it civilized stay away from the balls and the eyes and no throat strikes choke holds absolutely hurley grinned if you want it to end all you have to do is tap out rapp shook his head fair enough hurley caught his first glimmer of something he didnt like there was no sign of tension on the kids face he looked as relaxed as a schmuck who was about to play a round of golf two possibilities presented themselves and hurley liked neither the first was that the recruit might not be the little mamas boy that he thought and the second was that he might be too stupid to know he wasnt cut out for this line of work either way he might have to waste more than one day of his valuable time trying to drum him out hurley was shaking his head and muttering to himself when he realized there was a third possibilitythat the kid actually might have the goods the potential hazard made hurley pause he glanced at the young college kid and realized he knew surprisingly little about the man standing in the middle of the mat the jacket hed received from stansfield was so sanitized that the pertinent details would have fit onto one page beyond the general physical description and test scores every other piece of information had been redacted the man was a blank slate hurley had no sense of his physical abilities and general bearing he didnt even know if he was left or righthanded a frown creased hurleys welllined brow as he ran through some more scenarios normally when hurley stepped onto the mat with a recruit he already had the advantage of having read an extensive personnel file as well as having watched them for several days you could tell a lot about a man by observing him for a few days he silently called himself a dumbass for not thinking of this sooner there was no calling it off at this point his bare feet were on the mat if he called it off it would be a sign of weakness hurley set his apprehension aside and reminded himself that hed bested every man hed run through here he moved forward with his normal swagger and a lopsided grin on his face he stopped ten feet away and said ready when you are rapp nodded dropped into a crouch and made a slow move to his left hurley began sliding to his right looking for an angle of attack he glimpsed his opening when his opponent made an aggressive head fake that was an obvious tell of what would follow in that moment hurley decided to dispatch the kid quickly he wasnt going to waste time with defensive blocks and holds he was going to make this kid feel some real pain maybe bust a couple of his ribs that way even if he proved to be a stubborn fool thered be no hope of his keeping up with the others hurley anticipated the punch ducked into a crouch and came in to deliver a blow to the kids midsection right about the time he pivoted off his back foot and let loose his strike he realized something wasnt right the kid was a lot faster than he had anticipated the little shit had doubled back on his own weak fake and was now a good two feet to the right of where hurley had thought he would be it looked like he had been suckered hurley knew he was horribly out of position and exposed but he wasnt the least bit alarmed he pulled back his punch and prepared to go back in again on a different angle of attack he was in the process of delivering his second blow when he realized again that something was wrong hurley sensed more than saw the big left hook bearing down on his face in the final split second before impact he braced himself by pulling in his chin and dropping his hips the crushing blow landed just above hurleys right eye punches are funny things in that each one is different youve got uppercuts hooks jabs roundhouses haymakers and rabbit punches to name a few if youve sparred enough youve felt all of them and you learn to recognize each one by feel almost the instant it lands a little scorecard in your head quickly analyzes the blow and theres a brief conversation that takes place between the part of the brain that analyzes the thousands of instantaneous signals that come flying in and the part of the brain whose job it is to make sure the brain stays online hurley had been doing this for years and as a man whose job it was to judge talent and teach he had grown very accustomed to giving instant feedback to the man whose ass he was kicking on this occasion however he was too busy trying to stay on his feet so he kept his mouth shut the punch hit him so squarely that hurley actually went down to one knee for a split second the turtle move had saved him from getting koed if his head had been exposed any further the force of the blow would have snapped his jaw around so quickly his equilibrium would have gone offline and hed be down for a nice long nap the ringside announcer in hurleys brain made him aware of two things in extremely quick succession the first was that he hadnt been hit this hard in a long time the second was that hed better launch a counterattack and do it quickly or he was going to get his ass kicked hurley pivoted from his back to his front foot and launched a flurry of combinations designed more to get this kid to back up than actually hit him the first two were blocked and the next five found nothing more than air hurley realized the kid must have been a boxer and that meant hed have to get him down on the mat and twist him into submission no more punches before hurley had a chance to regroup he felt the leg sweep catch him perfectly in the ankle of his right foot which happened to be bearing about percent of his weight what happened next was simple physics the sweep took him out so cleanly that there was no hope of catching himself with his back leg so hurley went with it he landed on his ass tucked and rolled back and sprang onto his feet the fact that the kid had just swept him was not lost on hurley boxers did not know how to use leg sweeps there was a splitsecond pause while hurley looked across the mat at the new recruit and wondered if hed been lied to about his lack of military training the respite did not last long once again hurley found himself on the receiving end of a combination of wellplaced punches he had to get this kid down on the mat or he really was going to get his ass kicked he backed up quickly as if retreating for his life the kid followed him and when he launched his next attack hurley dropped down and slid in he grabbed the lead leg and stuck his shoulder into the kids groin while pulling and lifting at the same time the kid tried to drop his hips but hurley had too good a hold hurley was about to topple him when a doublefisted hammer strike landed between his shoulder blades the blow was so solid hurley nearly let go but something told him if he did he would lose so he hung on for dear life and finally toppled the kid hurley was on top of him he found a wrist and jammed his thumb into the pressure point while maneuvering the rest of his body into position for an arm bar he rolled off and delivered a scissor kick to the throat of his opponent that under the rules was not exactly fair but neither was their business the kick barely missed but hurley had his opponents wrist in both hands now and was ready to lean back and cantilever the kids damn arm until he hyperextended the elbow before he could lock in the move though the kid did something that hurley did not think possible rapp had somehow reversed into the hold and was now on top of hurley who still had a good grip on his wrist hurleys head however was now firmly locked between rapps knees rapp hooked his ankles together and began to close his knees like a vise crushing a coconut hurley jabbed his thumb as deeply into the wrist of his opponent as he could but it didnt get him to back off a bit he could feel the early stages of a blackout coming on and scrambled for a way out he released his left hand from the wrist hold and grabbed a handful of the kids thick black hair instead of letting go though the kid squeezed his knees even harder white lights were dancing at the periphery of his vision hurley couldnt believe he just had his ass handed to him by some college puke still he did not stop looking for a way out and with the darkness closing in he found his answer sitting only a few inches in front of his face he vaguely remembered a brief discussion about rules before they had started but that wasnt important right now making sure he didnt lose was what was important in a lastditch effort to avoid calamity hurley released his opponents wrist and lashed out with his now free hand he found the kids gonads and with every last ounce of strength he clamped down and began to squeeze chapter kennedy returned to the lake house just after six in the evening she was tired hungry and not in the mood for another confrontation with hurley but there were certain developments that needed to be discussed one of the unforeseen and increasingly difficult aspects of her job was the inability to communicate freely with her colleagues foreign intelligence agencies that operated in washington were always a threat but no longer her biggest concern now she had to worry about her own government and a new generation of journalists who wanted to break the next watergate pentagon papers or iran contra scandal combined they had ended hundreds of careers and done untold damage to national security it was the new sport in washington to pound on the very agencies tasked with keeping america safe surprisingly kennedy was fairly ambivalent about it as her mentor thomas stansfield had told her many times great spies dont complain about the rules they find ways around them she parked the car in front of the house and climbed the porch steps dreading the thought of going another round with hurley kennedy opened the screen door and entered the rooms to her left and right were empty so she went down the center hall to the kitchen her feet stopped where the hardwood floor transitioned to linoleum sitting at the kitchen table was a bruised and battered stan hurley he had a drink filled with ice and makers mark pressed against a fat lip and a bag of ice held against his swollen right eye leaning against the counter directly across from him was troy tschida a thirtytwoyearold former green beret and hurleys righthand man tschida tried but failed to suppress his amusement over his bosss battered physical appearance you think this is funny hurley snarled absolutely not tschida said with dramatic false sincerity you prick wait till i stick your ass in the ring with him you wont be laughing after he lands a couple punches what happened kennedy asked genuinely not sure what they were talking about hurley hadnt seen her enter because the bag of ice was covering his right eye and he didnt hear her because his ears were still ringing he turned his head and removed the bag of ice to reveal an eye that was so swollen it was almost entirely closed the skin above the eye was a shiny bulbous red what happened hurley said in a voice rising with anger was that fucking trojan hoarse you dumped in front of my house this afternoon it clicked and kennedy thought of rapp youre saying my recruit did this to you dont fucking play games with me i am in no mood hurley slammed his glass down on the table and grabbed the bottle of bourbon he filled it to the brim i have no idea what youre talking about kennedy said sincerely hurley took a big gulp and said my ass hes your recruit you give me some cutandpaste fuckin jacket on the guy that reads like a ransom note i know nothing about him hes here less than a minute and he up and suggests we find out if he has the right stuff hurley stopped to take another drink and then in a falsetto voice designed to mimic rapp said lets speed things up and find out if i have what it takes to do this my recruit did that to you asked kennedy still not entirely sure what the man was talking about hurley slammed his glass down again this time brown liquid sloshed over the lip of the glass yes god dammit and dont stand there and act like this is a surprise to you he pointed an accusatory finger at her you planned it you set me up i have no idea what youre talking about kennedy shook her head and asked are you trying to say my recruit bested you damn close hurley turned his attention to his drink and mumbled to himself your boy had him beat tschida interjected with a smile but stan here broke the rules and put the kids balls in a vise you think this shit is funny hurley barked tschida smiled and nodded hurley looked like he was going to launch his glass across the room at him and then at the last minute decided to use the bag of ice tschida stuck out his right hand and caught the bag with ease dont be a baby after all the asses youve kicked around here its about time you got a little taste my problem hurley shot back is getting ambushed by this young woman here someone i helped raise by the way hurley turned his one good eye back on kennedy no military experience my ass where did you find this kid kennedy was still in a bit of shock she herself had seen hurley tie nflsized linebackers into pretzels nowhere in her research had she found anything that would lead her to believe rapp was capable of going toe to toe with stan hurley stan you need to trust me i had no idea he could best you he didnt best me he almost did yeah but you cheated tschida said taking perverse pleasure in the torment he was causing hurley so technically he beat you it took every last bit of restraint to not throw his glass at the gloating tschida hurley turned his attention back to kennedy and asked what are you up to why in hell would you try to sucker me like this just calm down for a minute stan i am telling you right now we found nothing in our research that said he was capable of this kennedy gestured at hurleys battered face it was my sincere hope that someday he would be able to do this but not this soon then your research sucks you dont learn how to fight like this in your basement someone has to teach you kennedy admitted hes been going to a martial arts studio for the past year that would have been nice to know hurley fired back stan you have been bitching up a storm that this guy is a waste of time because he hasnt had special forces training you think a year of training in a strip mall is equal to what the army puts guys through that depends on the instructor and the student tschida added kennedy folded her arms and thought long and hard before she spoke there is one other possibility whats that i know you dont like to talk about your age but is it possible that youve lost a step tschida started laughing so hard his big barrel chest was rising and falling with each chuckle hurley was seething im going to put your ass in the ring with him first thing in the morning well see how funny you think this is then tschida stopped laughing kennedy pulled up a chair and sat at the table across from hurley please tell me what happened youre not jerking my chain kennedy shook her head you werent trying to pull a fast one on me set me up she shook her head again and said no in fact i was worried that he would be on the receiving end of a beating not the other way around even through his anger and bourboninduced haze hurley was starting to grasp that kennedy was telling the truth where did you find this guy kennedy gave him a look that he instantly understood shithead hurley said to tschida go check on those clowns and if theyre screwing around bust em out and make em snap off a hundred updowns got it tschida moved out all business as soon as the screen door slammed hurley looked at kennedy and said who is he she couldnt keep him in the dark forever but she would have preferred to wait a few more days setting her apprehension aside she said his name is mitch rapp chapter rapp lay on his cot his head propped up on a lumpy pillow and a bag of frozen peas on his groin dinner had been served buffet style on a folding table at the far end of the barn his appetite wasnt really there but he forced himself to eat there were seven of them plus two instructors and among them they polished off a giant pot of spaghetti a plate full of rolls and all the salad and corn on the cob they could stomach the men were tired hot and ragged but they stuffed their faces all the same and washed it down with pitchers of ice water and cold milk rapp had spent the last five years eating at a training table and knew how it worked tough drills in heat like this didnt exactly spur the desire to eat it had the opposite affect but you had to ignore it and shovel down the food the physiology was pretty straightforward they would be burning fivethousandplus calories a day and that meant either they had to eat a ton of food or they would begin to lose weight with his frame and current weight rapp could lose ten pounds but anything beyond that and he would open himself up to injury and illness rapp tossed the copy of time magazine on the floor and adjusted the bag of frozen peas one of the instructors had pulled him aside as he was clearing his plate and told him he wanted him to get on his back and start icing he then gave him strict orders to report any blood in his urine rapp simply nodded and took the bag of peas after his sparring match and before dinner hed had a few hours to reflect on what had happened while one of the instructors led him through a tough circuit of calisthenics and then a tenmile run through the woods rapp made it seem like he was struggling but he wasnt especially with the running he could last all day if he had to but he didnt want to show these guys too much too soon besides give a teacher the choice between a straight a student who has all the answers and an earnest one who gets better over time and theyll pick the earnest one every time rapp was still trying to absorb what lesson there was to learn from his earlier throwdown with the man whose name he still did not know he was not happy that the man had changed his own rules in the middle of a fight but there wasnt a lot he could do about it now he had to focus on how it would affect things going forward it was important to know how far he could push it and if these instructors werent going to abide by the rules they could hardly expect him to do so rapps first chance to meet the other men was after his run they were at the pullup bars behind the barn doing four sets of twentyfive in addition to the mean old bastard running the place there were three more instructors just as his recruiter had told him no one was to use his real name or discuss any personal information the first two instructors were easy to keep straight the short skinny one was called sergeant smith and the tall skinny one was called sergeant jones they would start their days with smith and end with jones rapp had to do two sets of twentyfive with a thirtysecond rest between so he could catch up with the other recruits after each man had polished off a full one hundred pullups sergeant smith went nuts he lined them up and paced back and forth dumping disdain on them one of you faggots doesnt think he needs to do a full pullup the instructor started thinks he can go halfway down and not quite all the way up well i dont like anything done halfassed so you ladies get to start over then the invective really started to fly as he called into question their manhood honor intelligence and lineage rapp noted that he treated them as a group rather than singling out the supposed offender who he wasnt so sure even existed hed watched the other men and none of them seemed to be slacking off the sergeant was simply moving the goal line in hopes that one of them would grow sick of the games and quit as he looked around though he didnt see that happening the other six were hard individuals four more sets on the quick lets go the sergeant barked and do em right this time or ill send you ladies on a nice long run and you can forget about dinner there were two bars so the men lined up and started over rapp was waiting for his turn when one of the other recruits poked him hard in the kidney rapp turned around and took inventory of the man who had jabbed him and was now cussing him out in a voice only the two of them could hear the man looked like one of those professional rugby players from europe he had a heavy brow made heavier by a single black eyebrow that traveled laterally from one temple to the other his eyes were coalblack and wideset but his most prominent features were a hook nose that looked to have been broken at least twice and a dimple in the middle of his pronounced chin rapp thought of two things almost instantly the first was that it would be a waste of effort to try to knock him out with a punch to the head the guys neck was as thick as the average mans thigh the second was that he didnt fit in at least as far as rapp understood the intent of what they were up to the mans features were so distinctive as to make him almost impossible to forget he looked more like an enforcer than a stealth operative do em right this time shithead the big man said testily rapp was sweaty dirty hot as hell and not used to taking crap from anyone he had done his pullups correctly if anyone could be accused of not doing them all the way it would be the very man who was in his face rapp was tempted to set the tone and knock the guy on his ass but he figured there would be plenty of time for that later he turned back around without responding and stepped to the line thats right the big man said be a smart boy and keep your mouth shut just fucking do em right this time the rest of the afternoon proceeded without incident and they were allowed to jump into the lake to cool down before dinner rapp steered clear of victor but kept an eye on him he had learned that was the big mans name or at least the name hed been given since they were forbidden to use their real names the instructors gave each of them a fake first name rapps was irving which they had already shortened to irv the other five guys were fred roy glenn bill and dick they all seemed decent enough and pretty much kept their heads down and their eyes alert there were a lot of knowing glances and silent communication since they were forbidden to talk about their past there was no mention of military service or the units they had served in this created an interesting situation for rapp the instructors more than likely knew hed never served in the military but the other recruits had no idea it created a weird dynamic when you dumped a group of guys in a situation where they were forbidden to talk about their pasts it pretty much killed small talk so little was said during dinner rapp retired to his cot so he could ice his groin and was staring up at the slow churning revolutions of the ceiling fan that hung from the rafters directly above him he was thinking about the match going through it move by move wondering what he could have done differently when victor appeared next to his cot whats your name he asked in a hushed voice rapp glanced over to the door where one of the instructors was giving orders to one of the other guys irv no dumbass he shook his head i mean your real name rapp was starting to think he didnt like victor hed been warned by his recruiter repeatedly that talking about your personal life was grounds for immediate dismissal from the program just ten minutes earlier while they were eating the instructors had reminded them of this again rapp impassively looked up and said didnt you hear what the instructors told us a lopsided grin fell across the other mans face thats just a bunch of bs its a game theyre just trying to fuck with us he glanced over his shoulder to make sure no one was close enough to hear and said come on where you from whats your angle huh what are you up to just trying to get to know the guys thats all try not to take this the wrong way but its none of your business who i am or where im from is that so his face flushed a bit and his jaw tightened ill tell you something i dont need you telling me what is and isnt my business rapp didnt like his predicament he was on his back and vulnerable but he didnt want victor to think he was easily intimidated its not me telling you he said in a casual voice its them rapp looked over at the instructor by the door the instructor finished whatever he was saying and left it was just the seven recruits now victor started laughing there goes your mother looks like your ass is mine rapp decided lying down was no longer the best position to be in he quickly swung his legs off the cot and stood in a conversational tone that was loud enough for the others to hear he said whats your problem victor youre my problem i gathered that rapp said from the other side of the cot but could you be a little more specific maybe its something i could fix i doubt it the bigger man said with disdain you look soft to me like you dont belong here well why dont we find out rapp gestured to the wrestling mat victor laughed as if the idea was preposterous you dont stand a chance rapp nodded as if to say maybe maybe not and walked over to the edge of the mat im sorry about your mother victor what did you just say victor asked i said rapp half yelled im sorry about your mom youd better watch yourself victors eyes had taken on a wild glare or what rapp asked the other five guys all dropped what they were doing to see what was going on you gonna take a swing at me victor rapp egged the big man on he was ready to end this thing right now whats wrong your mom the neighborhood slut when you were growing up she didnt hold you enough when you were little she let every guy she met suck on her tit except you you got a big mouth victor snarled barely able to contain his rage just trying to figure out whats wrong with you victor you been shooting your mouth off all day acting like a worldclass prick were all getting sick of it im going to kick your ass victor howled as he hopped from one foot to the other like a boxer rapp didnt say a word he moved to the middle of the mat and motioned for victor to join him victor started whooping and hollering as he danced circles around rapp he was throwing shadow punches and explaining in detail what he was going to do to rapp when suddenly one of the instructors reappeared in the doorway what in hell are you ladies doing victor fell silent but it was too late thats it you dumbassess if youve got enough energy to fight then youve got enough energy to run youve got sixty seconds to muster your worthless asses outside on the line put your running gear on and move it everyone sprang into action and while they were putting on their gear the other five men made their displeasure known through a mix of looks and verbal complaints rapp did not respond while victor seemed to relish it he turned the taunts back on the other men and invited any of them to take a shot at him just as soon as one of them grew a set of balls rapp put on his shoes and sprinted for the door he was the first one on the line and while he waited for the others it occurred to him that something wasnt right if this program was so secretive and elite what in hell was a loudmouth like victor doing here chapter camp perry virginia tom lewis took the call on the secure line he listened patiently to the person on the other end relay a seemingly benign message about a meeting that was to take place in washington dc the following afternoon to anyone with the ability to breach the secure system which of course included the internal security people back in langley the conversation would have seemed so ordinary as to not warrant a second thought in the third sentence however an adverb was used that caused his right eyebrow to shoot up a quarter inch lewis thanked the person on the other end and said they would talk at the meeting the next day the clinical psychologist slowly placed the phone back in its cradle and tapped his pen on a generic desk blotter everything in the office was generic all standardissue government furniture the kind that was purchased in massive quantities every year by the behemoth federal government the desk bookcase and credenza were all made from particle board coated with a thin plastic veneer that was supposed to look like wood but didnt the chairs were black plastic with coarse charcoal fabric seats that could render a pair of dress pants useless in just nine months lewis was amazed at how ubiquitous this type of furniture had become in washington which in turn led him to the conclusion that the maker of this substandard furniture was more than likely headquartered in the home district of the chairman of the house appropriations committee lewis detested such poor craftsmanship but nonetheless made no attempt to add a personal touch to this office his private office was in the district and every square inch of it had been meticulously decorated with what he charged for an hour of therapy he could not only afford the fine trappings but even more his clients expected it in a rather short period of time he had built up a very profitable practice his patient list was a virtual whos who of washingtons power elite lobbyists lawyers and ceos made up the bulk of his business he treated only a smattering of politicians but dozens of women who were married to powerful senators and congressmen came to see him every week and poured their hearts and minds out if he were unscrupulous hed be able to use that information to his benefit but he had never been tempted the thirtysixyearold lewis had both the passion and the natural inclination for his work he had obtained an undergraduate degree in economics and math from pomona college and a graduate degree in clinical psychology from the university of pennsylvania the latter was paid for by the government which required him to serve four years in the army upon graduating that stint in the army more than anything was what pulled lewis into this current situation in a windowless crappy office on a base that very few people even knew existed it seemed he had a knack for spotting mental deficiencies which when he was in the army was something that greatly interested at least one flag officer and a couple of colonels down at fort bragg hed spent three years helping the joint special operations command tighten up their selection process and develop a new system for game theory lewis took a moment to collect his thoughts and figure out how the call would affect his evening the camp had a bachelors quarters of sorts for the various employees and consultants who traveled back and forth to dc when a new class was on the post he normally stayed one or two nights a week so he could observe how they interacted he had planned on staying the evening and spending some time with one of the recruits who was showing some troublesome signs but the phone call was more pressing lewis looked down at his world war ii elgin a us military watch his father had given it to him on his deathbed three years earlier lewis had replaced the worn strap and kept the watch in nearperfect shape it was sevenfourteen in the evening nothing on his desk was that urgent and besides it was a perfect evening to get out on the open road and clear his mind he collected the two open files and spun his chair around to face a gray metal safe which was already open lewis placed the files in the proper slot closed the safe and spun the dial he left the office door open as there was nothing other than the contents of the safe that needed to be protected his motorcycle was parked in the first space in front of the building lewis took off his sport coat and tie and carefully folded and placed them on the seat he unlocked one of the saddlebags of the bmw motorcycle and retrieved a gray and black leather riding jacket and pair of chaps he never rode his bike without them even with the thermometer pushing ninety degrees imprinted on his brain was the road rash a friend had received when hed been forced to lay his bike down on a hot california afternoon the jacket and tie were placed in the saddlebag and he put on his gray helmet the motorcycle hummed to life and lewis climbed on sixty seconds later he tipped his visor at the sentry standing post at the main gate and blew past him a minute after that he was rocketing up the entrance ramp onto interstate and on his way north the drive would take a bit more than an hour which lewis didnt mind in the least no phones no one knocking on his door wanting him to listen to his problems lewis was finding it increasingly difficult to find the time to clear his mind and focus on the task at hand a big green sign informed him how many miles he had to travel to reach richmond but he barely noticed he was already thinking of their new recruit that had to be why she had called lewis set the cruise control at mph adjusted himself on the seat and checked his mirrors he considered how much work he had put into this one candidate the man was as close to perfect as anyone theyd come across in the almost two years hed been working on the program lewis leaned into a turn and wondered if it was possible for hurley to run the kid out in one afternoon unfortunately he knew the answer to that question because hed seen him do it on more than one occasion chapter lake anna virginia it was a moonless night sky and all but a few of the exterior lights were off so as to not attract bugs the mutts had just finished their run and another hundred updowns and a few more exercises designed to fatigue littleused muscles and maybe get one or more of them to quit so they could get down to the serious stuff unfortunately all seven were now filing into the barn in a manner not much different than that of cows returning from a day grazing in the pasture their heads were down their pace was slow and their footing unsure and fortunately the arguing was over the only thing they could think about at the moment was sleep hurley took a sip of bourbon and looked out across the lawn despite the fact that it was his seventh in the past three hours he was not drunk when it came to booze and a lot of other things the spook had the constitution of a man three times his size tonight however his normally unshakable confidence was a little wobbly hurley was feeling a nagging indecision that to the average person was a daily occurrence but to a headstrong decisive man like him was rare the shiner on his eye and his throbbing headache were nothing more than a nagging physical symptom a few more glasses of makers mark and they would be thoroughly dulled the problem was between his earsa crack in his psyche that had put him in a rarely visited but increasingly familiar place it was gnawing at the back of his head trying to crawl into his brain stem and take him down the signs were all there tight chest quick breath a sudden desire to get the hell out of dodge and go somewhere anywhere but here for a man who was used to being in control used to being right all the time it was the most unwelcome feeling he could imagine hed rather get kicked in the head until he was knocked unconscious than try to wrestle with this crap the fix hurley knew involved something he still wasnt used to hed spent years burying his problems patching them hiding them under anything he could find his job was too important there were too many enemies to confront and not enough men willing to do it there was too much to do the stakes were too high for him to sit around and feel sorry for himself he was after all a product of the cold war while the children of the sixties cut loose and got in touch hurley cut throats and got as out of touch with his feelings as was possible he darted around europe in the late fifties and early sixties and then southeast asia in the midsixties the seventies brought him to south america the early eighties to central america and then finally for the biggest shit show of all he landed in the middle east the entire thing was a gigantic multidimensional chess match with the soviets a continuation of what had happened at the end of world war i and then the aftermath of world war ii getting in touch with his thoughts or feelings or whatever they were was not something hurley relished there was right and there was wrong and in between an abyss filled with societys whiners people who had inherited the luxury of safety and freedom while having done nothing to earn it he had never heard these opinions pass the lips of his mother or father they didnt have to he was born during the depression but they had lived through it theyd moved from chicago to bowling green kentucky with their five kids to escape the long food lines and massive unemployment of the inner city hurley had come of age not knowing any better his lot in life seemed just as good as the next kids hed taken that stoic demeanor and joined the army after serving his stint he enrolled at virginia tech on the gi bill and graduated with decent marks that final spring a man from the federal government who was extremely interested in his military record and asked him if hed like to see the world asked him if hed like to make a difference hurley bit officially hed spent the last twentyone years darting in and out of wartorn countries and doing his part to create a few wars too unofficially it had been longer than that hed been on the very edge of the conflict between the soviets and america and had no illusions about which side was the more noble of the two all a person had to do was spend a little time in berlin to understand the effects of communism and capitalism talk about a tale of two cities east berlin and west berlin were living breathing examples posters for the governments who had run them since the end of world war ii one side was a vivid kodachrome film and the other a grainy old blackandwhite pile of crap hurley had never been more proud than when that damn wall came tumbling down hed spilled his own blood in the battle and had lost a few friends and more sources than he could count or wanted to remember but theyd won unfortunately there wasnt a lot of time to enjoy their victory hurley and a few others already had their eyes on the jihadists hed come across them when he was helping bleed the soviet union of cash equipment manpower and eventually the will to continue its despotic experiment it had been in the khyber pass and at first he saw nothing that made him nervous these people wanted their land back and the soviets out the problem started with the religious zealots who were being shipped in from saudi arabia yemen and a handful of other crappy little countries hurley loved to swear drink and chase women which put him on a collision course with the puritan funsucking wahhabi jihadists from saudi arabia he almost instantly developed a special dislike for them but didnt understand back then that they would want to spread their jihad beyond the jerkwater mountains of southwest asia that came later when he started to see them meddling in the affairs of the palestinians it was starting all over again the soviets had been contained and beaten and now this new enemy was out pushing its agenda hurley had a bad feeling about where it was headed and on top of that for the first time in his life he felt tired this threat was not going away and he suddenly wasnt sure he could find let alone train the next batch of kids who would be needed to meet the threat he needed help unfortunately asking for help was not something hurley was good at he heard one of the dogs bark and then the sound of a motorcycle drifted through the pines it was not the rumble of an americanmade motorcycle rather the purr of a japanese or german bike hurley breathed a small sigh that was part relief part resignation it was the doc he realized kennedy must have called him a single beam of light slashed through the trees and a moment later the motorcycle coasted round the corner the bike was so quiet hurley could hear the tires on the gravel driveway the bike rolled its way up to the house and the rider eased the kickstand into the down position and then killed the engine after retrieving a flat piece of wood from one of the molded saddlebags he put it under the kickstand and then took off his helmet thomas lewis ran a hand through his shaggy blond hair and looked up at hurley he immediately noticed the swelling over the eye but he was more concerned with a look on the mans face that he had only recently grown to understand tough day hurley tried to laugh it off no easy days in this line of work you know that lewis nodded he knew all too well the toll that their business could inflict on a person and not just the body the physical injuries were fairly straightforward they could either be mended or not the assaults on the mind and soul were an entirely different matter chapter beirut lebanon the battered dusty peugeot slowed to a crawl the driver leaned out over the steering wheel and looked left and then right down the length of hamra street his friend in the passenger seat did the same but in a more halfhearted fashion there was no stop light nor was there a stop sign but habits formed during war died hard samir was the youngest of four brothers three of them had died in the civil war that had destroyed this oncebeautiful city his closest brother only thirteen months his senior had been killed by an rpg while crossing this very intersection to the westerners who covered the bloody civil war hamra street was better known as the green line ali and his friends called it nomansland it was the street that divided east and west beirut and to a certain degree the muslims from the christians or more accurately the shiite muslims from the maronite christians there were neighborhoods on each side of the line where you could find pockets of sunnis armenians greek orthodox and druze some of these outposts were more exposed than others and they had all but disappeared during the lengthy and savage civil war while a few of the more entrenched ones were now rebuilding the civil war in many respects resembled the mob warfare of chicago in the s but with much bigger guns with the war officially over for almost two years virtually every part of the city was showing signs of life the christians to the east were rebuilding at a blistering pace and the muslims to the west were struggling to keep pace construction cranes dotted the skyline and you were now more likely to get killed by a dump truck or a bulldozer than a sniper at least in certain areas hamra street was not one of those areas the buildings were still gutted shells perfectly suited for a sniper to lie in wait samir scanned the building across the street to his left while his friend ali who was sitting next to him did the same thing to their right still cautious the man in the backseat said in a coarse voice samir looked sheepishly in the rearview mirror sorry assef sayyed nodded and took another drag from his cigarette he remembered that samirs brother had been killed not far from here a lot of good men had been killed along this godforsaken stretch of road sayyed however did not make small talk with his men such familiarity led to their getting ideas ideas were not good they only needed to follow orders he also had no desire to get too close to the allbutdisposable men who worked for him it was far easier to mourn the loss of someone you didnt know well than the loss of a close friend once samir received the goahead from ali he gunned the engine and tore across the broad street over the abandoned trolley tracks and into a canyon of halfdemolished buildings on the other side a year or two earlier he would have never dreamed of taking this shortcut the car continued for two blocks dodging piles of rubble and then hung a sharp left turn building by building block by block things got better the first sign was that the roads were clear of debris scaffolding and cement mixers were the next positive sign and then finally they came upon a row of buildings that actually had windows although the stone facades were pockmarked from artillery shells and smallarms fire two young men stood in front of a roadblock ak assault rifles at the ready samir slowed the car to a stop and looked at the young face of the man who was pointing the barrel of his rifle at his head they were all young these days or old but there were very few in between an entire generation had either fled the country or been killed samir jerked his thumb toward the backseat and watched the guards eyes open wide as he recognized the ruthless assef sayyed the young man gave a quick bow of respect and then ordered his colleague to move the barricade the block was sealed at both ends some had started to question the manpower and effort that went into this but all sayyed had to do was flash them one of his withering stares and they were silenced the syrian intelligence colonel was of the mind that this peace was more of a lull in the fighting and the second they let their guard down they would pay for it dearly he continually advised the other militias to reconstitute to find new recruits and to train them diligently and to use this lull in the fighting to stockpile arms and ammunition with each passing month it was becoming increasingly difficult to convince them to direct their resources to the next battle to the men under his command however there was no questioning his orders sayyed had made certain of that by putting a bullet through the forehead of one of his aides at a staff meeting just two months earlier sayyed tossed his cigarette in the gutter and entered the office building extension cords ran along the floor and the wall to bring power to various levels the place had been functional for just two weeks and sayyed did not plan to use it for more than another few days at the most the greatest vulnerability for his side was a complete lack of air power if some dog in israel found out where he was he could have jets scrambled and dropping bombs on him in less than twenty minutes he took the stairs down to the basement level the smell of raw sewage was an instant reminder that the city was still suffering the ills of almost fifteen years of fighting two men were in the hallwaystanding next to a kerosene lamp they were still without power in the basement without having to be told the men moved away from the door the older of the two snapped off a distinctly british salute colonel it is good to see you sayyed ignored the greeting where is colonel jalil the man jerked his head toward the door he is inside with the prisoner sayyed motioned for him to open the door the guard extended his hand in it was a black hood to hide your identity sayyed gave him a disdainful look and the man put the hood away and opened the door a man sat naked in the middle of the room tied to metal chair one man was standing beside him another in front both were wearing black hoods sayyed entered the room and walked directly to the prisoner he grabbed him by his hair and yanked his head up so he could see his face sayyed stood there searching the mans features for half a minute so far he only had a trickle of dried blood on his upper lip other than that he looked untouched who are you sayyed asked my name is nihad wassouf sayyed stared at him for a long time and finally said i think you are a liar in fact i think you are a jew no the man protested vehemently i am a syrian i doubt that i would not lie about such a thing check with the names i have given you sayyed was already doing just that but this man seemed like a rat to him and those lazy fools back in damascus could be tricked without warning sayyed walked over to a small cart a variety of tools were lying on the surface his hands danced from one to the next he did not want to do anything that would require medical attention at this point finally he settled on a pair of pliers sayyed walked back to the man and held the pliers in front of him i am not as nice nor am i as patient as these two men i will ask you only one more time what is your real name the man stammered for a second and then said nihad wassouf sayyed reached out and straightened the prisoners forefinger on his left hand he clamped the pliers down on the quarter inch of nail that extended beyond the tip of the finger and rocked it back and forth a few times the prisoner began to squirm a line of crimson blood appeared at the edge of the nail bed tell me your real name i already have i swear why are you looking for the american i was sent here to negotiate his release by who his company i think you are lying no i am not call my friends in damascus they will vouch for me i do not believe you please i am only a messenger they are willing to pay a great sum of money what if you are a spy i am not liar and with that sayyed tore the mans fingernail completely out of its bed chapter lake anna virginia the doctor peeled off his leather riding gear and stood on the porch listening to hurley recount the afternoons events he did so as passively as possible even though his concern grew on several fronts interrupting hed learned with hurley was a bad approach it was best to let him get it all out questions or comments could be perceived as a personal attack which in turn would elicit a spirited counterattack all of which the doctor knew was very counterproductive lewis had met the spook five years earlier the department of defense had shipped his oda team off to pakistan to help the black ops boys from langley who were trying to train and equip the mujahedeen in the treacherous border region between pakistan and afghanistan hurley in his typical gruff manner had expressed his amusement that the vaunted green berets were now attaching shrinks to their units he wondered if lewis was similar to the political commissars who were attached to red army units which was not exactly a compliment since the communist officers were political appointees and in charge of communist party morale among the troops they were also known to ship off to siberia anyone who did not show absolute devotion to the party they were feared and despised by their own men lewis had read clean through the rough bravado of hurley and rather than take offense he laughed along as the weeks passed however hurley began to consult the shrink with increasing frequency hurley soon learned the good doctor was a valuable asset to have around lewis he found out had a gift he could read people the doctor was a walking talking polygraph when hurley was finished giving the afternoons playbyplay he did not stop to hear the doctors opinion or let him ask questions he moved headlong into what he thought needed to be done i want you to sit down with him and run him through the wringer clear your calendar for the rest of the week if you have to i want to know what the deal is with this kid hes hiding something and i want to know what it is as was his habit lewis pursed his lips and stared off into the distance while he thought about other possibilities he respected liked and felt a sense of loyalty to hurley but he was not exactly a wellbalanced mentally healthy adult male kennedy on the other hand was possibly one of the most measured and thoughtful humans hed ever had the pleasure of working with before he did anything he wanted to hear her side of the story ill clear my schedule for tomorrow lewis said agreeing without really agreeing lets head inside im starving and i need to use the bathroom after lewis had relieved himself and washed his face they found kennedy at the kitchen table reading a file and picking at a plate of noodles lewis looked at the uninspired pasta and frowned one of his passions was cuisine and it pained him to watch his colleagues put so little effort into something so important without saying a word he began searching the cupboards for something anything that he could use to create a passable meal kennedy and hurley shared a brief smile lewis stuck his nose into the refrigerator and without bothering to turn around said stan would you be so kind as to fetch a bottle of wine from the basement a chateau dominique would be fine he took out a package of chicken and closed the door moving to the sink he paused for a brief moment and then said you might as well grab two when hurley was gone lewis looked over his shoulder at kennedy and motioned for her to join him at the sink so he said stans not exactly thrilled with your new recruit hes not the easiest man to please lewis turned on the water and began to rinse the chicken with a wry smile he said he thinks you set him up kennedy rolled her eyes this is the one you told me about the kid from syracuse yes lewis splayed the chicken open and let the water run through the crevices you never said anything about his fighting abilities kennedy sheepishly shrugged her shoulders and said i didnt know he had them thats a pretty big thing to miss lewis glanced up at her im not judging im not proud that i missed it but in the end isnt it a good thing maybe maybe not kennedy explained what she knew about rapp which admittedly wasnt a great deal but she pointed out yet again that a blank slate was not necessarily a bad thing that they could mold him into the man they needed she finished her verbal report as hurley made it back up from the basement lewis asked her to prepare a small salad while he went to work boiling noodles and slicing up the chicken and preparing a creamy white sauce hurley was left to open the red wine while lewis put the finishing touches on the main dish hurley and kennedy started up again they volleyed back and forth each one putting forth his or her version of what had happened and how the other one had screwed up like any good shrink lewis was a good listener and he played his part it helped that these two were rarely boring hurley was a onceinalifetime patient the kind of man who was so outrageously entertaining that you sometimes felt you should pay him rather than the other way around sure there was a flourish of exaggeration here and there but lewis had witnessed several of his exploits firsthand and knew the stories to be for the most part accurate kennedy was very different there was no cussing or anger or animated hand gestures accompanied by thespianlike facial contortions there was just a calm analytical intellectual way about her that put you at ease her answers were never rushed and almost always thoughtful she did not participate in personal verbal attacks or attempt to sway opinion by exaggeration wildly different in almost every way they did share a few qualities that served to exacerbate the situation both were deeply suspicious of everyone they encountered and did not find it easy to admit they were wrong on top of that their long history and familiarity served to bring both the best and worst qualities to the surface in a very raw way lewis would never admit this to them but it had become one of his great clinical joys watching these two argue it was verbal combat at an olympian level the table was set the wine poured and the food dished up kennedy picked at her salad while hurley and lewis devoured both the salad and the chicken and tomato fettuccine lewis ate in near silence while he watched the two joust he interrupted on three occasions but only for clarification when hed cleaned his plate and poured himself a second glass of wine he pushed his chair back and was ready to give them his take on the matter one of the things they had decided at the formation of the group was that they wanted lewis to have full operational input hurley was in charge but there was some apprehension in washington over his cowboy attitude hurley to his credit understood that he had certain weaknesses rather than cop an attitude about lewiss role expanding beyond weeding out the whackjobs hurley had told him i dont want any bullshit pc shrink stuff youre paid to voice your opinions not give me an endless stream of what ifs with that in mind lewis put his glass down and said two mistakes were made and you both know what they were kennedy nodded while hurley said i can think of one her not doing her due diligence whats the second one you cant think of a single thing you did wrong today lewis asked im not perfect but this ones not my fault hurley pointed at kennedy i am busier than shit trying to see which one of these boys has the right stuff im not responsible for the turds she dumps in my lap lewis was suddenly resigned to the fact that he would have to box hurley in a little tighter clearing his throat he said were left with two options either this kid is really good or youre losing a step lewis took a drink and asked which one is it hurleys jaw tightened i havent lost a step in a slightly embarrassed voice he added i just underestimated him thats all and thats what worries me the most lewis said in an accusatory tone dont worry i wont let it happen again im afraid thats not good enough hurley lit a cigarette and casually said lets not make this into something bigger than it needs to be bullshit lewis said with genuine fury come on hurley said trying to shrug the whole thing off dont come on meyou fucked up today and you fucked up bigtime kennedy leaned back her eyes wide unable to hide her surprise at lewiss strong condemnation lets not overreact hurley said easily trying to take some of the heat out of the conversation overreact lewis leaned forward im not sure it would be possible to overreact to this situation and what is really bothering me is that you know it but youre too pigheaded to admit it its not the end of the world lewiss indignation was growing with each denial youre supposed to be infallible these guys are supposed to fear you loathe you hate your fucking guts but the one thing they are never supposed to do is lay a shiner on you lewis pointed at hurleys swollen eye and they definitely arent supposed to beat you especially not five minutes after theyve walked through the gate he didnt beat me hurley growled well thats debatable from what ive heard he had you beat and the only way you got out of it was by cheating yeah well lifes not fair at this stage stan these guys are like young pups you know that when we lay down the rules we cant break them it sends the wrong signal hurley leaned back and stubbornly folded his arms across his chest i was suckered into this thing im not sure you were but for a moment ill go along with you lewis paused briefly and then said youre not supposed to get suckered youre supposed to run these dogs until theyre so tired they can barely stand youre supposed to watch them go after each other get a sense of what theyre capable of and then youre supposed bring them into that barn and smack them down just like when you and i went through boot camp this is delicate work god dammit and you know it theres a reason why we do things the way we do them and your ego has no place in the decision process my ego has nothing to do with this hurley shot back with a sour look on his face i just let my guard down thats all no lewis shook his head im inclined to agree with irene on this one you still see her as a little girl and you dont give her the credit she deserves she shows up with this new recruit and because he doesnt fit into your little box of where these recruits are supposed to come from you decided to skip steps one two and three kick his ass and send him packing lewis sat back took a drink of wine and then in a calmer voice asked does it mean anything to you that thomas signed off on this lewis was referring to the deputy director of operations embarrassed hurley said i didnt think of that do you understand the situation youve created hurley didnt react at first and then very slowly he began to nod kennedy was feeling better about her position but she wasnt entirely sure what they were talking about and asked lewis what do you mean by situation these things have a way of spinning out of control lewis said one recruit has some success putting a shiner on an instructor and all of the sudden the rest of them think that maybe they can take a shot that these guys are human throw in the fact that stan here had to cheat to avoid losing and we now have a potentially dangerous situation how so kennedy asked do you think its in our best interest to train your boy send him off and have him decide that when things get tough the rules dont really matter kennedy now saw the point fuck hurley mumbled to himself what do you want me to do youre going to get the hell out of here for about five days i want you to heal up you let me and the others run these guys down ill get a better sense of this rapp kid and his full potential and then you come back here and you head into the barn with him and you beat him fair and square and if he cant beat him kennedy asked lewis and hurley shared a look they were in unchartered waters lewis finally looked at kennedy and said that would be a nice problem to have chapter the first night didnt go so well at least as far as sleep was concerned victor had kept all of them up telling outrageous stories of his sexual conquests each one more graphic and bizarre than the already twisted story hed just finished after an hour or so he ran out of steam and called them all a bunch of faggots for not reciprocating victor then proceeded to launch into a symphony of unabated flatulence for a quarter of an hour before eventually falling into a deep snorting slumber rapp placed his pillow over his head and tried to block out the noise but it didnt work it was in those muchneeded sleepless hours just after midnight that rapp began to explore the idea of getting rid of victor at first he considered getting up and throttling the idiot right then and there but knew it would only result in further punishment from the instructors and disdain from his fellow recruits still the thought of spending the next six months with the lout was something that presented a very real problem a guy like victor could easily drag someone down with him and rapp had an undeniable feeling that the two men were on a collision course and not one of those collisions that could be avoided if one or both of them changed their behavior it was inevitable it was the kind you needed to brace yourself for either drop your hips lower your shoulders and make the other guy feel more pain than you or he would do the same to you and you were toast there was something undeniably odd about the man the idea of his participating in a covert op was preposterous if he could ever walk among the enemy undetected it would be a miracle rapp wanted this new vocation with every fiber of his body although he was smart enough to know that saying he would never quit and actually never quitting were two very different things he also knew he would be tested in ways hed never imagined hed be pushed to the full extent of his physical and mental abilities and it was likely that at some point when he was really in the hurt bag that pang of doubt would creep into his mind could victor create a climate in which at his lowest point he might consider quitting rapp didnt want to find out somewhere in the middle of the night as he was lying on his back watching bats dart around the rafters of the barn and listening to the snorting victor rapp decided the moron would need to quit and if he didnt do it on his own and do it quickly rapp would have to find a way to subtly nudge him in the right direction they were up before the sun two of the instructors came in and cursed yanked kicked and slapped them out of bed luckily for rapp he was half awake and heard the door open his feet were on the floor before the di could dump him out of his cot hed guessed this was how the morning would start but the yelling was nonetheless unsettling in between the barking and smacking rapp tried to make out exactly what it was that he was supposed to do somewhere in the middle of it he heard the words line and pt he threw on his workout gear and running shoes and was out the door like a shot the lawn was covered with a thick morning dew and the sun was only a gray veil in the east they werent allowed watches and there were no clocks in the barn so rapp guessed that it was somewhere in the vicinity of am the air temp had to be in the midseventies and the humidity was pasty it would be another hot one as rapp came to a stop on the line he was aware that he was the first and only one out the door he figured to start with there were certain things where it was smart to be first and others where it wasnt getting out of bed and getting on the line was an area to be first handtohand combat and fighting drills he would never hold back on but the endurance stuff like running and pt he would he needed to stay healthy and hold some things in reserve these guys didnt need to know he could run like the wind as he waited for the others he caught a whiff of coffee and turned to look at the house there standing on the porch was a new face a blondhaired guy who looked to be in his midthirties the man was staring intently at rapp rapp returned the stare and even at a distance of several hundred feet noted the blue eyes the guy was in a pair of jeans and a tshirt he was leaning against one of the porch columns sipping his coffee and making no effort to conceal his interest in rapp there was something different about the guy rapp could tell he was in shape but he was way more relaxed than the other dis who were marching around and that sadistic little cuss whod tried to neuter him one by one the guys tricked out of the barn and fell in victor was last which was becoming a common theme sergeant smith was walking quickly beside him giving him an earful in a hushed voice they had all been warned that there would be no yelling on the line this wasnt the only place on the lake and voices carried across the water inside the barn with the door closed however the decibel level went through the roof victor fell in at the far end from rapp sergeant smith stepped out in front of the seven recruits and with a clenched jaw said you puds better get your shit together or im gonna start knocking some heads ive seen cub scouts do better than this this is damn sloppy it shouldnt never take you morons more than sixty seconds to get your ass out of bed dressed and on the line when you go to bed you make sure your shit is ready you lay it out on your footlocker so its ready to go we start pt at five every morning rapp watched the dis eyes shift to the opposite end of the line he leaned forward and saw victor had his arm raised sarge when are we supposed to take a piss i gotta go so bad im about to drown sergeant smith walked over to victor and got in his face maybe if you had gotten your lazy ass out of bed when i told you to you would have had time to piss he stepped back and looked down the line were going to do a quick warmup as much as i hate you idiots the powers that be dont want you ladies getting hurt until they see if youve got some potential i have tried to dissuade them as you are the biggest collection of shitlickers ive seen come through here in some time sarge i gotta go real bad victor whined then piss yourself you big idiot his head snapped to the group if you cant take care of your business and get out here in sixty seconds im going to have to treat you like a bunch of toddlers so go ahead and piss yourself victor the rest of you who need to go i suggest you wait until we head out for our run you can pull over on the trail and take care of business now drop and give me fifty and if i see any of you pussies cheating well start over they did the fifty pushups followed by one hundred situps fifty updowns and then a few minutes of scissor kicks and a couple of stretches and then sergeant smith led them into the woods eight of them in a nice neat line with victor trailing rapp guessed they were moving at just under a sixminute pace he could keep a fiveminute pace for ten miles so he was feeling good they finished the fivemile run and found themselves standing in front of an obstacle course in the middle of the woods the place looked like a relic from an abandoned renaissance festival sergeant smith had his stopwatch out and was clocking them rapp positioned himself fifth in line carefully placing one man between himself and victor he wanted to see how these other four guys navigated the course guessing that theyd all done it when theyd gone through boot camp his idea kind of fell apart when sergeant smith started sending guys at thirtysecond intervals the course started with a low wall it was a tenfoottall wooden mossladen wall with two telephone poles stuck in the ground in front of it the first telephone pole stuck out of the ground about a foot and a half and was four feet in front of the wall the next telephone pole was two feet in front of the wall and stuck out of the ground three feet rapp watched as the first recruit headed for the wall picking up speed right before the telephone poles he did a quick stutter step and then as nimbly as you could imagine he placed his left foot on the first and shorter telephone pole using it as a step his right foot then landed on the second telephone pole and he launched himself up and onto the wall grabbing the top with both hands and pinning his knee to the wall just a few feet from the top it was like a controlled collision the recruit was up and over dropping to the soft ground on the other side the second guy did it the same way and the third tried something slightly different that involved doing a pullup after the low wall was a fortyfoot dash to a fifteenfoothigh wall with ropes hanging on the face there was nothing fancy about this one you just grabbed the rope put your feet on the wall and walked your way up next in line was barbed wire again pretty straightforward dive under keep your butt down and do an infantry crawl to the other end after that was a fortyfoot cargo net strung between two towering pines beyond that was a set of logs set up in a zigzag pattern about three feet off the ground they acted as a sort of foot bridge to test your balance rapp didnt have a chance to see what came after the balance logs because it was his turn to start he quickly dried the palms of his hands on his shorts and then when sergeant smith gave him the signal he ran toward the short wall mimicked the exact steps of the first recruit and threw himself up and at the top of the wall he caught it pulled himself up and over and landed with ease on the other side the second taller wall was easy enough to navigate and the barbed wire was about as primal as it got if a guy couldnt grasp the simplicity of crawling he should just quit and go home the cargo net proved to be the first real challenge about a third of the way up rapp realized there was too much slack in the middle so he moved over to the side after that it was easier the balance logs were a breeze the tires were nothing and the transfer ropes were playground then he came across something that looked like a set of uneven parallel bars like the kind female gymnasts use he paused not sure how to attack the two horizontal telephone poles and then almost on cue one of the dis was right there barking orders at him telling him what to do and to do it quickly based on what the di was telling him it sounded like a great way to break a rib but rapp could see no other way so he launched himself into the first pole and then the second and then it was more tires and a thing called the burma bridge after that there were more logs ropes and walls to negotiate and a sprint to the finish when rapp crossed the line sergeant smith was staring at his stopwatch and shaking his head he glanced at rapp contempt on his face and said you suck rapp was doubled over with his hands on his knees acting more tired than he was he wanted to smile but didnt he couldnt have done that badly the guy in the numbersix position had yet to finish rapp turned to see how the last two were doing at the edge of the course about fifty yards back he saw the blondhaired guy hed seen on the porch earlier in the morning the man was standing at the edge of the woods staring straight at him again making no effort to conceal his interest chapter langley virginia kennedy parked in the east lot and entered the headquarters building at exactly eightohthree shed used the hourandahalf drive up from lake anna to try to prioritize her everincreasing list of responsibilities both official and unofficial much of her job was off the books and that meant no notes and no files she had to keep it all organized in her own mind and every time she came back to hq she needed to have her story straight when the elevator doors parted on the sixth floor one of her bosses was waiting with a deeply concerned look on his face max powers nudged her back into the elevator and said problem powers was the near east division chief it had taken kennedy a while to get used to his style powers was famous for speaking in oneword sentences his colleagues who had worked with him over the years called him musket max kennedy stepped back and asked whats wrong her immediate fear as it was almost every time she entered the building was that her black ops program had been uncovered beirut powers said offering nothing more beirut could mean a lot of things but on this hot august morning kennedy was aware of one thing in particular john yep crap kennedy mumbled under her breath john cummins was one of their deepcover operatives who had snuck into lebanon three days earlier an american businessman who worked for a data storage company had been kidnapped the previous week this company it turned out was run by a texan with big contacts in dc the owner was oldschool former army and over the past thirty years he had freely and enthusiastically kept the cia and the pentagon abreast of all the info he and his people happened to pick up in their international dealings a lot of very important people in town owed him and he decided now was time to call in a few of his ious the pentagon had zero assets in the region and the cia wasnt much better they were still trying to recover from the kidnapping torture and death of their beirut station chief half a decade earlier langley did however have assets in jordan syria and israel cummins who had lived in syria for the past three years was the best bet hed built up some great contacts by passing himself off as a counterfeiter of us currency and smuggler of americanmade goods that were embargoed in the region from the jump kennedy argued against using him he was by far their most valuable asset inside syria and beirut although safer than it had been in the eighties was still pretty much the wild west of the middle east if anything went wrong cummins would be lost someone with a much bigger title had overruled her however how bad kennedy asked bad the doors opened on the seventh floor and kennedy followed powers down the hall to the office of thomas stansfield the deputy director of operations the door was open and the two of them breezed through the outer office past stansfields assistant and into the main office powers closed the soundproof door kennedy looked at the silverhaired stansfield who was sitting behind his massive desk his glasses in one hand and the phone in the other stansfield was probably the most respected and feared man in the building and possibly the entire town since they were on the same team kennedy respected but did not fear the old spy stansfield cut the person on the other end off said goodbye and placed the phone back in its cradle looking up at powers he asked any further word powers shook his head how did it happen kennedy asked he was leaving his hotel on rue monot for a lunch meeting stansfield said he never showed he missed his checkin this afternoon and i placed a call to my opposite in israel mossad did some quiet checking stansfield shook his head a shopkeeper saw someone fitting cumminss description being forced into the trunk of a car shortly before noon today kennedy felt her stomach twist into a wrenching knot she liked cummins they knew all too well how this would play out the torture would have commenced almost immediately and depending on how cummins held up death was the likely outcome i remember you voiced your opposition to this stansfield said but know there are certain things that even i wasnt told such as the ops boss shook his head letting her know he wasnt allowed to talk about it the important thing now is that schnozs syrian contacts back his cover story if they dont step up to the plate for him this will end badly cummins was half armenian and half jewish and had a nose to make a roman emperor jealous hence his unofficial cover name was schnoz double down powers chimed in get the texas boy on a plane with a couple suitcases filled with cash its a possibility that i already floated with the white house theyre getting nervous though and for good reason they should be kennedy said they just burned one of our most valuable assets trying to do a personal favor that as far as i can tell has nothing to do with national security bingo powers said stansfield was quiet for a moment i have a back channel i can use with the ceo he wants this employee back and i think when i explain to him what happened to our man hell offer to pay for both it should help cement the idea that schnoz was working as a freelancer it better happen quick kennedy said we never know how long someone will be able to hold out if they break schnoz she stopped talking and shuddered at the thought of the damage that would be done i know stansfield sighed rescue op powers asked stansfield looked slightly embarrassed not going to happen we knew it going in beirut is still radioactive what if we get some good intel kennedy asked thats a big what if but if we do kennedy pressed her point we need assets in place stansfield sadly shook his head corner office or sixteen hundred powers asked kennedy understood the shorthand question to mean was it the director of cia who was freezing them out or the white house white house stansfield replied our friends at the institute powers offered it as a suggestion theyre in the loop stansfield tapped the leather ink blotter on his desk while he considered the israeli option the institute was the slang powers used to refer to the institute for intelligence or as they were better known mossad im told they knew before we did maybe let them handle the cowboy stuff if it comes to that the fact that it had not occurred to him to have mossad handle the rescue spoke volumes about the complicated relationship if something concrete comes our way ill consider it but you dont want to owe them the farm powers said thats right they would more than likely demand something that im either unwilling or unable to give them may i say something sir kennedy asked stansfield wasnt sure he wanted to hear it but he knew he needed to let his people vent he nodded this problem is never going to go away until we send these guys a very serious message i assume you mean the kidnapping yes i told the director the same thing five minutes before you walked in the door but it seems we lack the political will at the moment to take a more aggressive approach pussies powers muttered and then looked at kennedy and said sorry no need to apologize she paused and then decided this was the right time to push her agenda you know what this means no its yet another example of why we need to get orion up and running how in hell can we expect our assets to operate in this environment its bad enough that we wont get tough with these guys its inexcusable that we wont even consider a rescue op hes one of our own for christs sake stansfield was not surprised that shed brought it up he would have done the same thing if he was in her place but during a crisis like this it was a common mistake to hurry things that needed time i want this to happen as badly as you do irene but it cant be rushed if we send a bunch of halfbaked assets into the field well end up spending all our energy trying to pull them out of the fire trust me i saw it firsthand back in berlin just try to be patient for a few more months if a couple of these guys can prove that they have the stuff ill greenlight it and support you every step of the way kennedy took it as a promise but couldnt get her mind off cummins and what he was enduring her thoughts for some unknown reason turned to rapp she hoped he was the one the weapon they could turn loose on these murderous zealots chapter lake anna virginia they each ran the obstacle course three more times and then doubletimed it back to the barn for breakfast they stuffed their faces with eggs and pancakes then were given thirty minutes to digest their food and make sure their bunks were squared away rapp was somewhat relieved that victor used this time to pester someone else then it was off to the pistol range which was a twomile hike back into the woods it was not a leisurely hike however they were given twelve minutes to get to the range and were told that anyone who was late could pack his bags rapp was starting to get the idea that they would be doing a lot of running which was fine by him he kept a pace or two off the lead and made it look as if he was struggling to keep up but he wasnt the range was adjacent to the obstacle course it was twelve feet wide and one hundred feet long and was as barebones as you could get basically a tractor had scooped out a tenfootdeep trench that ran between a row of pines it was lined with old car tires and covered with camouflage netting which in addition to the tree branches made the light pretty weak there were three shooting stations made out of pressuretreated plywood and lumber silhouette targets were already hung at twenty feet and silenced mm beretta fs were loaded and ready to be fired the first three guys stepped up and when sergeant smith ordered them to commence firing all three methodically emptied their rounds into the paper targets rapp swallowed hard when they were done the first two guys punched soupcansized holes through the chests of the black silhouettes the third target had a nice neat hole about the size of a silver dollar in the center of the face there was not a stray shot among the three rapp was impressed but the thing that really surprised him was the reaction of sergeant smith the instructor had a smile on his face sergeant smith stood beside the last shooter and said normally i dont like you seals but goddamn they sure do teach you boys how to shoot he gave the recruit a rough slap on the back and ordered the next three up the results were similarat least as far as the first two were concerned they had both punched nice neat holes in the chests of their targets rapps target however looked a little rough rapp lowered the pistol and took in his handiwork hed only started shooting a few months earlier and without any actual training from an instructor the results were lacking the target looked like a piece of swiss cheese with holes from the chest all the way down to the groin he set the heavy beretta down on the flat plywood surface and grimaced as the instructors fell in one on each shoulder definitely not a seal sergeant smith said nope sergeant jones replied not a d boy either might be a gangbanger though thats how those little fuckers shoot just spray it all over the place and hope they hit a vital organ definitely not the way we do things around here sergeant smith said son the taller of the two said where the fuck did you learn how to shoot rapp cleared his throat and admitted i dont know how to shoot sergeant you mean youve tried and suck or youve never been taught never been taught sergeant there was an uncomfortable pause while the two instructors tried to figure out what to do unfortunately victor took the opportunity to throw in one of his asinine comments he shoots like a girl underneath rapps bronzed skin his cheeks flushed he had known that due to his lack of training shooting would be one of his weaknesses still it embarrassed him that the others were so much better rapp looked to sergeant smith and asked any pointers the shorter man looked up at rapp and regarded him for a moment before nodding and saying lets see you do it again sergeant smith handed him a fresh magazine sergeant jones yelled all right victor you jackass get up here and show us what you can do the other five stood back and watched in silence while two fresh targets were put up sergeant smith stood at rapps side and quietly issued instructions he watched rapp squeeze off one shot and then reached in to adjust his grip elbow position and feet with each shot the instructor issued corrections and the grouping of shots grew tighter this time the holes were still loose but at least all of them were in the chest area as opposed to all over the entire target rapp heard someone giggle and he looked over at victors target the clown had shot eyes and a nose in the target and five more shots made a downturned mouth the remainder of the shots were concentrated in the groin area victor sergeant jones said what in hell are you doing longterm strategic planning sarge i doubt your peasized brain could attempt any such thing population control victor said spitting a gob of chew on the ground shoot the nuts off all the hajis and no more baby terrorists twenty years from now we declare victory brilliant if i say so myself sergeant jones put his hands on his hips put the weapon down victor and step back the big man did so and then sergeant jones continued in a disappointed voice since all of you appear to be decent shots and victor here thinks this is a joke were going to head back over to the o course where im going to run all of you until at least one of you pukes our earnest yet respectful virgin will stay here with sergeant smith and attempt to learn the basics of pistol shooting the big sergeant eyed the group and when no one moved he said well i guess you ladies would like to do some pushups first in a gruff voice he shouted assume the position all six men dropped to the ground and got into the plank position they were told to start and no one said a word except victor who continued to complain as they counted out their punishment while they worked through their pushups sergeant smith began instructing rapp on the finer points of marksmanship rapp listened intently digesting every word sergeant smith told rapp to aim for the head this time he slammed a fresh magazine into the hilt and hit the slide release when you have a fresh magazine in and hit the slide release a round is automatically chambered the sergeant offered rapp the weapon and said the hammers back so shes hot not every gun is like that but thats how the berettas work also that red dot right there red means dead so dont point it at anything youre not going to shoot at and always keep that finger off the trigger until youre ready to fire got it rapp nodded all right show me that stance keep those feet just so youre a lefty so put your right foot a few inches in front of your left create the power triangle with your arms and place that dot right in the center of the head some guys get all hung up on breathing in versus exhaling but i dont want you to think about that crap youre going to need to learn to shoot on the run so breathing in or out aint going to work the main thing right now is how you squeeze that trigger notice how i didnt say pull dont pull it squeeze it straight back and put a round right through the middle of the head this time rapp did everything he was told and the bullet spat from the end of the suppressor the muzzle jumped and when it came back down rapp was staring at a perfectly placed shot do it again sergeant smith ordered rapp squeezed the trigger and the bullet struck the target half an inch to the right of the first one again the third shot bridged the first and second rapp fell into a rhythm he didnt rush it but he didnt take too much time either it took him less than twenty seconds to empty the rest of the magazine and when he was done all of the rounds were within a sixinch circlea jagged hole punched through the face of the paper target rapp breathed a sigh of relief sergeant smith clapped him on the shoulder and said youre coachable kid nice work lets try this a few more times rapp was in the midst of reloading the weapon when by chance he turned his head and looked over his left shoulder about sixty feet away in the shadows of a big pine a man was watching them with the poor light rapp couldnt be certain who it was but he thought it might be the guy hed seen on the porch earlier in the morning rapp turned back to sergeant smith and was about to ask him who he was when he thought better of it it would be a mistake to confuse a little oneonone instruction with friendship chapter dr lewis walked into the office offered a faint smile to his visitor and closed the door behind him hed been watching the new recruit intently for the past three days at twentythree he was the youngest project they had attempted to run through the program and from what hed seen the last few days the man showed a great deal of promise before sitting lewis glanced down at the notepad and pen sitting in the middle of the desk next to them sat a file with rapps name written in large black letters it was impossible to miss and intentionally so they knew surprisingly little about the man but then again how much could you really know about someone this youngthis untested if he listened to the irascible hurley inexperience was a curse and if he listened to the more pragmatic kennedy it was a blessing lewis didnt know who was right but he had grown tired of listening to them bicker moving behind the desk lewis sat in the worn leather and wood desk chair and leaned back the chair emitted a metal squeak the doctor ignored it and moved his eyes from the subject to the contents sitting on his desk there were many tools in his tradelittle tricks that could be used to test the people he was assigned to evaluate some were subtle others more overt but all were designed to help him get a better glimpse into the minds of the men they were recruiting the file on the desk had been a test lewis had spent the last five minutes in the basement watching the recruit via a concealed camera rapp had sat sphinxlike in the chair he had glanced at the file only once and then adopted a relaxed posture that spoke of boredom lewis didnt know him well enough to gauge whether it was sincere but there was something about this mitch rapp fellow that suggested great possibilities there was a casualness on the surface that helped mask something far more complex lewis considered reaching for the notepad and pen it was a way of establishing authority and creating stress for the subject making him feel the pressure of possibly giving incorrect answers lewis decided against it from what hed witnessed over the last three days it was highly unlikely that the ploy would fluster this one nothing else had so far going on a hunch hurley clasped his hands behind his head and casually asked you know what youre getting yourself into rapp looked at him with his dark brown eyes and shrugged as if to say it wasnt worth acknowledging the obvious i dont read minds lewis said only half serious im going to need you to verbalize your answers hopefully youre going to turn me into a weapon a killer lewis considered the straightforward answer and then said not me specifically but in essence yes that is what we are going to do rapp gave a slight nod as if that was just fine with him and continued to look right back into the bright blue eyes of the man who had been watching him from a safe distance do you have any reservations not really lewis placed his palm on the desk and after staring at the back of his hand for a long moment said it would be normal if you did rapp cracked a thin smile i suppose it would so do you have any reservations it was a pretty vague question and rapp didnt like vague in terms of what this is a big commitment most of your friends are probably taking jobs with kodak or xerox more than a few of them were but rapp simply nodded lewis noted that rapp was not jumping out of his chair trying to please him with earnest answers nor was he displaying the open disrespect that many of the candidates would employ as a defense mechanism he was striking the perfect balance lewis decided to skip his standard twenty minutes of preamble and get to the heart of the matter have you ever wondered what its like to kill a man rapp nodded he had spent more time wondering about it than he would ever admit to this guy or anybody else do you think thats healthy this time rapp let out a small laugh lewis noted the classic deflection technique but didnt want to seem judgmental so he smiled along with rapp whats so funny i can answer your question six ways and depending on your mood you might find all of the answers acceptable or none of them how do you mean its all in the context context is important lewis agreed give me an example rapp thought about it for a moment and then said if im lying awake at night thinking about killing the guy who broke into my car and ripped me off its probably safe to say that i have some anger issues and a poor grasp of what constitutes just punishment rapp put his tanned arm over the back of the chair and looked out the window for a second wondering how much he should admit but if i lie awake at night thinking about sticking a knife through the eye socket of a terrorist whos killed a couple hundred innocent civilians rapp shrugged i think thats probably not so far out there lewis appreciated the blunt answer wanting a deeper reaction he asked do you miss your girlfriend rapp gave lewis a disappointed look and shook his head whats wrong did i say something that offended you no not really from the look on your face it would appear that i did i volunteered for this but i hate playing all these games games lewis asked with an arched brow youre a shrink right rapp didnt give him a chance to answer youve been watching me for the past three days ive noticed that you seem to be paying a lot of attention to me more so than the others you choose your words carefully and youve undoubtedly read that file thats sitting on your desk you know why im here lewis hid his surprise that rapp had guessed his profession its my job to ask questions but why would you ask if i miss her dont you think thats pretty obvious so thats why youre here im not here because i miss her i miss my father who died when i was thirteen i miss my grandparents and someday ill miss my mom when she dies and maybe if i get to know you ill miss you too thats part of life im here for a very obvious reason one that im sure youre already aware of lewis noted how he had taken charge of the conversation but was willing to let this play out revenge i prefer retribution but it all depends on the definition you choose lewis was pleased that hed made the distinction he was intimately familiar with the difference between the two words id like to hear your definition revenge is more wild less calculated deeply personal and retribution rapp thought about it for a moment and then answered in a very clear voice retribution is a punishment that is morally right and fully deserved and the men who conspired to bring down pam am rapp leaned forward placing his elbows on his knees and said every last one of them deserves to die lewis looked at the file on the desk and asked youre catholic yes so how do you square this with your lord your idea of retribution doesnt exactly conform to the turntheothercheek preaching of jesus christ nice try rapp grinned how do you mean ill tell you a little secret about me im not the most patient guy i have a lot to learn and im eager to learn it so when you start to hit me with selective theology you might get my back up a bit selective lewis asked yeah ive never understood the intellectual dishonesty of people who say the bible is the word of god and then choose to pull verses only from the new testament for example turning the other cheek is one of their favorites and they use it while ignoring a dozen old testament verses and a few new testament verses that say the men who brought down that plane deserve to die lewis conceded with a nod so if it comes to it you dont think youd have a problem taking another mans life that depends on what who the guy is and more important what hes guilty of chapter when the sun rose for the fifth day they were one man short it was dick rapp didnt know the guys real name much less where he was from or where he was going so it was hard to feel too bad when the guy stepped out of formation during a grueling set of updowns in the hot afternoon sun he simply approached one of the instructors announced his intention and the two men shook hands just like that the guy was done free of the pain the sweating the burning muscles the tired eyes and the battered ego it all seemed too easy and thats what scared the crap out of rapp it made him briefly wonder if he was capable of pussing out all it would take was a down moment a bad spell a cold or a fever or another sleepless night one misstep and he could be the one shaking hands and packing his bag while falling asleep that night rapp focused on the positive there was one man fewer to compete with they kept saying it wasnt a competition but rapp wasnt so sure if it wasnt a competition why did they count or clock everything they did the image of the fellow recruit bowing out after five days put rapp on guard against a moment of personal weakness it refocused him by showing just how rapidly this journey could come to a very unsatisfying end rapp awoke tired but ready to push ahead he was the first one on the line and was stretching his neck and shoulders waiting for the others when he noticed the two instructors having what looked like an unpleasant conversation when everyone was finally on the line sergeant jones stepped forward and with a disappointed look on his face said one of you screwed up real bad last night rapp began racking his brain trying to think of any mistakes hed made we have rules for a reason at this point you dont need to understand these rules you just need to follow them he paused to look each of them in the eye you have all been repeatedly warned to not divulge any personal information now were realistic enough to understand that you boys will discover certain things about each other some of you have a slight accent so its pretty easy to figure out what part of the country you come from as far as prior military experience we havent busted your balls over debating the healthy rivalry between the services but last night someone crossed the line he stopped and looked at the ground in a disappointed voice he said the one thing you are never supposed to do is tell someone your real name rapp heard someone farther down the line mumble something under his breath but he couldnt tell who it was and considering the mood of the two instructors he didnt dare look you are all smart enough to know this and you were all warned what would happen if you slipped up on this one this isnt a fucking summer camp this is serious shit sergeant jones said in a disappointed voice he looked to the far end of the line and said bill pack your shit youre gone the man they called bill whom rapp had pegged as the hotshooting navy seal from texas took one step forward and shook his head at the harsh punishment hed just received he looked as if he was going to say something and then caught himself sergeant jones started moving and told bill to follow him back to the barn sergeant smith stepped in to lead them in pt but before he could start bill turned back to the group victor youre a real asshole i told you i didnt want to talk but you just wouldnt leave it alone looking at sergeant jones he asked why isnt he getting the boot as well keep moving well talk about it in the barn this is bullshit he told me who he was and where he was from same as me bill complained victor laughed i gave you a fake name you stupid hick why the hell would you do that one of the guys farther down the line asked victor asshole someone else grumbled you guys should all be thanking me victor said in an easy voice one less guy to worry about sergeant smith silenced all of them with a growling order to assume the position the next one of you who opens his pie hole is gone now push em out rapp dropped his chest down to the dewy grass and pushed straight up quietly counting out each pushup as he went hed done so many in the past five days that they were becoming second naturealmost like breathing somewhere past number forty and before number fifty rapp began feeling some serious ill will toward victor if only the big jackass would stumble and break an ankle he was too risky to have around for the rest of the morning as they ran from one thing to the next rapp couldnt shake the feeling that he and victor were on a collision course with dick quitting and bill getting the boot that meant two fewer people to run interference victor could focus more of his time on pestering rapp the long run was actually nice since victor was the slowest of the group they were spared his running mouth when breakfast rolled around they all gave him the cold shoulder it didnt matter to victor though he stayed chatty continuing to dole out insults and the occasional wiseass comment that the instructors seemed to take better than they should have they spent an hour on the obstacle course and another hour on the pistol range before heading back in for lunch the attitude among the recruits was decidedly sour it was as if they had a traitor in their midst after lunch they went over fieldstripping various handguns and then it was announced that they were heading into the barn for a little handtohand combat for rapp it was his first time back on the mat since the day hed arrived he had wondered where the mean old cuss had gone and had almost asked sergeant smith but the guy wasnt exactly keen on sharing information jones and smith paired the men up since there were five someone had to be the odd man out and it turned out to be rapp the rules were simple no blows to the head or groin choke holds were encouraged but they warned the men to be careful not to crush anyones larynx if you wanted out all you had to do was tap the mat right before they started the blondhaired shrink quietly slipped into the barn the first two men up were roy and glenn rapp hadnt figured out where either of them was from and wasnt about to ask like all of them the two men were darkfeatured with black hair brown eyes and tan skin roy was fiveten and glenn was perhaps an inch taller rapp guessed they were both around twentyseven he was not overly impressed with their fighting styles they both used standard judo techniques lots of holds and throws but nothing that could be used to incapacitate an enemy in one quick flurry technically they were sound and they were both tough enough and in good enough shape to draw out a lengthy tiring boring match after about four minutes they ended up in a sweaty tangle in the middle of the mat and sergeant smith stepped in victor and fred were up next fred was six feet tall and about pounds and had done a really good job of keeping to himself he finished in the top three on every run handled the obstacle course with ease and was the top marksman after bill victor at sixtwo and pounds was by far the biggest of the group his neck was nearly as thick as his thighs which meant as rapp had noticed when he met him that he would be really hard to knock out with a shot to the head from all of the talking hed done rapp half expected to the see the second coming of muhammad ali victor bounded across the mat shadowboxing as he went you ready to get your ass kicked freddy fred said nothing he walked to the center of the mat in his bare feet and took up his fighting stance rapp pegged him for a wrestler by the way he moved victor was such an oversized peacock that it was impossible to tell what he was capable of most guys his size were not boxers but he did move pretty well on his feet sergeant smith dropped his hand and the two men charged at each other fred went low just as rapp expected him to victor tried to sidestep him but his right leg got looped by his opponent fred hooked onto victors knee and pulled it tight to his chest he stayed low and kept driving with his legs trying to tip the bigger man over victor hopped back on his left leg and started delivering punches to freds back the first few were misplaced and lacked power rapp watched victor lose his balance and begin to go down he changed his tactic and smacked fred in the back of the head with a closedfist punch fred appeared to slow for a split second but he didnt lose his grip victor went down and rolled immediately onto his stomach he flared his arms and legs out so he couldnt be flipped fred scrambled over the top of him and shot his right arm under victors neck he wrenched the bigger mans head back and placed his left forearm across the back of victors head the hold was commonly known as the sleeper hold and if it wasnt broken in short order it performed as advertised victor got hold of a couple of freds fingers and twisted with everything he had while turning into the man victor used his strength to reverse out of it at first it looked as if he was getting the upper hand and then rapp saw what fred was up to he had allowed victor to think he was initiating the move but in truth it was freds idea once on his back fred wrapped his legs around victors waist and clamped down with a vicious scissor lock victor only made things worse by trying to pull himself up and away as rapp had learned the hard way the best way to get out of that hold was with a wellplaced elbow to the inner thigh earlier in the summer his instructor had put him in the same scissor lock and made him pay dearly by pulling away you stretched out the torso which allowed the person initiating the hold to clamp down even tighter then you emptied your lungs to take in a big breath and the person squeezed even tighter the next thing you knew you were desperately in need of oxygen writhing in pain and genuinely concerned that you were about to end up with a broken rib or two victor made that mistake and it was obvious by the worried look in his eyes that he knew he was in trouble he swung hard trying to hit fred in the solar plexus but the blow was blocked next he tried to twist away which only allowed fred to tighten his hold a few more notches victors face was beet red rapp knew it would only last a few more seconds and he was silently hoping to hear a few ribs pop between now and then it looked as if victor was going to quit he started to wave his left hand and then just as fred relaxed a touch victor brought his big right fist smashing down the blow hit fred square in the face his head bounced off the mat and he released his legs then blood began to pour from his misshapen nose rapp took a step forward ready to kick victor in the head he was on the verge of delivering the blow when sergeant smith stepped onto the mat and began barking orders rapp took a step back and watched as victor rolled off fred flopped onto his back and began laughing chapter sergeant jones was attending to freds broken nose roy and glenn were talking quietly and shooting victor daggers rapp looked to the door and noticed the shrink studying him twice now rapp had seen the rules of engagement broken and so far there had been no punishment handed out not that the old codger could be punished but victor was one of them and if he could get away with it then rapp could as well it got rapp thinking that maybe it was time to bend the rules a little bit while he was working out the details of what he wanted to do sergeant smith ordered him onto the mat and then pointed at glenn i would rather fight victor rapp said well youre not running the show around here smith snapped hes doing you a favor victor said still out of breath a little pussy like you wouldnt last five seconds against me rapp stayed calm but there was something unmistakably ominous just beneath the surface lets find out he said evenly suicide victor retorted i think youre afraid shut up all of you sergeant smith said glenn get your ass on the mat rapp moved to his left cutting off glenn he stayed facing the wiry instructor and said im confused do rules matter around here or does victor get to do as he pleases we have rules dammit now get in the middle of the mat and shut up no disrespect sarge but this is bullshit how are we supposed to trust each other how are we supposed to trust you when he keeps doing whatever the hell he wants without getting punished you think theres any rules out there victor laughed in the real world hell no but in here we should just let you do whatever you want sarge victor said as he got to his feet i got this one dont worry i can take care of this little college puke with one arm tied behind my back sergeant smith looked as if he was about to lose it but the blondhaired shrink stepped in and said sergeant i think we should allow victor and irving to have a go at it the sergeants head snapped around rapp noticed a brief exchange of thoughts between the men before the sergeant retreated all right he grumbled both of you center of the mat square off and on my mark you start do we bother with rules this time or should i assume victor will break them rapp asked stonefaced the head and neck are off limits dammit i appreciate the effort sarge but id prefer no restrictions rapp said i dont care what you prefer i make the rules rapp hesitated he wanted clarification on this point and hed rather not have to worry about victor cheating and if victor accidentally punches me in the face god dammit the sergeant boomed this isnt a debate club do you ladies want to go for a nice long run rapp silently moved to the center of the mat satisfied that he had made his point but nonetheless wary that victor would do whatever it took to win a strategy was already forming in his head victor had shown that he was a fairly onedimensional fighter against the uninitiated he could probably hold his own on the mat but boxing was his preference that was plain enough to see victor was all smiles as he slapped one fist into the fleshy palm of the other im gonna kick your ass you little puke rapp brought his fists up close to his face like a boxer elbows in tight and if you cant victor oh theres no doubt youre going down rapp drew him in he feigned that he was out of position and allowed victor to initiate the first salvo two slow left jabs were launched straight for rapps face rapp blocked them with his right hand and then ducked under a big hook that would have knocked him off his feet if it had connected rapp noted that three punches had been thrown by victor and all three had been directed at his supposedly off limits head and more important sergeant smith didnt seem to care that victor was breaking the rules yet again that would make things easier for rapp he changed directions and bobbed back to his left as victor threw two hard right jabs the first one rapp dodged and the second one hit him in the left shoulder the blow was solid but rapp played it up intentionally stumbling to his right as if he were in trouble victor took the bait and charged in his left hand trying to push rapps hands out of the way so he could deliver a knockout blow with his right as victor brought his fist up by his right ear rapp sprang forward with such quickness that he caught victor completely off guard he grabbed the bigger mans left wrist with his right hand and threw up his left arm to block the coming punch rapp launched himself at victor his head arching back and then whipping forward his hard forehead slammed into the soft cartilage of victors nose making a sickening crushing sound before victor could counter rapp wrapped his hands around the back of the big mans neck pulling him down and in rapp delivered two harsh knee strikes to the big mans sternum before releasing him victor staggered back blood pouring from his nose gasping for air sorry about that victor rapp said egging him on i didnt mean to break your nose im going to fucking kill you victor screamed rapp simply motioned for victor to bring it on the big man charged rapp expected the bull rush he feinted to his right and then back to his left and as victor lumbered by he hit him with a punch to the kidney which stood him up victor pivoted to meet the next blow and rather than gain distance rapp engaged moving in and wrapping his left hand around the back of victors neck and his right hand around victors biceps victor reared his head back and was prepared to deliver a head butt of his own but before he could strike rapp did something that none of them expected he jumped up in the air swung his left leg under victors right armpit and then his right leg around victors neck as he allowed himself to fall to the mat rapp was now upside down hanging on to victors left arm and pulling him down on top of him rapp raised his hips and the pressure toppled victor to the mat rapp had him in a version of the same arm bar that he had put the mean old cuss in on the first day except that rapp wasnt looking for submission this time rapp grabbed victors wrist with both hands he twisted and pulled the arm until the elbow socket was on top of his right hip bone and then he raised his hips while pulling down as hard as he could with his hands rapp did not stop even when victor started to scream the entire thing took just under two seconds there was a loud pop and then rapp released the arm which was now bent at a very unnatural angle rapp got to his feet and looked down at victor the man was moaning his entire body rigid with pain rapp didnt smile or gloat there was a touch of guilt over what hed just done but victor was a bully and a jerk fred was sitting at the edge of the mat with cotton shoved up his nostrils and an ice pack on his nose fred nodded to rapp and flashed him the thumbsup roy and glenn wandered over each man quietly congratulating him for solving their problem sergeant smith was too busy attending to victor who was flopping around writhing in pain rapp had no idea whether he was in trouble he looked over at the shrink who was watching him intently the mans lips were pursed in thought as if he appeared to have drawn some conclusion about rapp the only problem was rapp couldnt tell if it was admiration or disappointment chapter lewis made the calls late in the afternoon after hed had an hour to put his thoughts and observations down on paper as darkness approached they descended one by one on the house by the lake in southern virginia kennedy was the first to arrive then deputy director of operations stansfield and finally hurley stansfields bodyguards remained on the porch they were two of his most trusted and knew to be very selective about what they saw and more important about what they remembered stansfield suggested in his typical quiet way that they all adjourn to the basement it was not a suggestion it was an order the four of them walked downstairs and proceeded to a freestanding room that sat in the middle of the basement it served as the surveillancecommunications shack for the property the inside walls and ceiling were covered with an eggcartongray foam that absorbed sound a bank of monitors and two listening stations occupied the wall on the right and an oval conference table for six sat in the middle when everyone was seated stansfield closed the soundproof door and threw the bolt the numberthree man at langley took the chair at the head of the table and loosened his tie he looked the length of the short table and said doctor lewis was leaning back in his chair his hands steepled in front of his face weve had an interesting development id say so hurley interrupted unable to contain himself i heard one of my instructors is out of commission for six months three titanium pins in his arm for christs sake he was one of my best hurley held up the appropriate number of fingers to punctuate his point three pins the doctors bright blue eyes locked in on hurley with the kind of allknowing stare that could only be flashed by a spouse or a therapist the message was clear i know you better than you do yourself shut up and let me speak sorry hurley apologized halfheartedly irenes recruit has proven himself quite capable lewis directed his comments at stansfield you heard what he did to stan earlier in the week no stansfield turned his inquisitive gaze on hurley the bruising on your face that was caused by this rapp fellow the swelling was down and the bright red bruising had turned dark purple with a yellow tinge hurley shrugged his shoulders i made a mistake it wont happen again you got thumped by a college kid with no military experience kennedy said i still cant get over it lewis interceded before hurley could blow his lid looking at stansfield he said let me give you the narrative lewis explained in detail what had transpired during the opening minutes of rapps arrival at the complex hurley tried to interrupt twice but lewis shut him down with an open palm stansfield for his part listened in total silence kennedy had nothing new to add and knew how stansfield hated too many people talking so she kept her information to herself in situations like this hurley was more than capable of scuttling his own ship now to victor lewis said turning his gaze from stansfield to hurley i have made it very clear from the outset that i am not onboard with your methods of deception i know you have hurley said and in your theoretical world im sure your points have merit but this is where the rubber meets the road i dont have all day to dick around with these kids i need to know who has the goods and the sooner i find out the better and using your system how many men have you found thus far kennedy asked unable to resist my concerns lewis said forcefully are centered on building a relationship of trust and if we introduce deceit into the training its not training hurley said with a scowl this is selection and besides this is what we do for a living we deceive people if these kids dont understand that they have no business signing up with us there is a major difference between deceiving each other and deceiving our enemy again strong relationships are built on trust we can work on the deception part later this is bullshit hurley said defensively you two come and go as you please but im the guy down here twentyfourseven playing nursemaid i dont pretend to know how to do your jobs do me a favor and stop trying to pretend you know how to do mine you are so thinskinned kennedy said with a tone of open contempt yeah well young lady this is serious shit it aint amateur hour we recruit our candidates from the best of the best and that means special forces and spec ops guys it doesnt mean some amateur who doesnt know the right end of a rifle from his ass or how to navigate his way through the woods in the dead of night or a thousand other things are terrorists living in the woods these days kennedy asked making it clear she was mocking him the last time i checked they were urban dwellers so im not so sure knowing how to start a fire with a knife and belt buckle qualifies you to hunt terrorists dont talk to me about training you have no idea what it takes to turn these guys into killers apparently you dont either well at least i know how to recruit which is more than i can say for you and what exactly is that supposed to mean it means you didnt do your job i did a little reconnaissance of my own the past few days do you know where your boy spent the last few months he was staying at his mothers house in mclean yeah and spending his days hanging out at a dojo in arlington and what pray tell would be wrong with that i told him he would need to be in shape and it would be a good idea to start taking some judo classes yeah well i spoke to his sensei you did what kennedy was irked that he had gone behind her back i went in and had a conversation with his sensei after going a round with him on the mat i could tell something wasnt right kennedy looked to stansfield for help he had no right to do that its my recruit i have worked almost two years on bringing him in and i havent left a single trail no one in his life knows that were interested in him and they still dont hurley said dismissively really how in hell did you introduce yourself i told him i was a trainer from richmond said i went a round with this young kid named rapp and was very impressed i wanted to ask his sensei what he thought and lewis asked suddenly very interested the kid doesnt pass the smell test his sensei says he came in three months ago and claimed he had almost no experience within a month and a half he had throttled everybody in the dojo except the sensei brazilian jujitsu lewis asked yeah howd you know i saw him take victor down today the style is hard to miss so he comes in here and almost bests me and then he snaps victors elbow im telling you the kid isnt who he says he is stansfields patience was wearing thin be more specific im not sure but it doesnt feel right what you think hes a plant a spy kennedy asked in a mocking tone im not sure im just telling you he doesnt pass the smell test you cant get that good that quick kennedy looked at stansfield lets cut to the chase he doesnt like him because hes my recruit she sat back and folded her arms across her chest hes a misogynist i dont like him because i dont know who the hell he is we need to know everything there is to know about these guys before we bring them in thats why military experience is a must that way we know exactly what theyve been doing for a minimum of four years and how is that working out for us stan kennedy shot back we dont have a single operative in the pipeline and weve been at this for almost two years i am well aware that i have failed to produce painfully fucking aware but that doesnt mean im going to rush things and have something this important blow up in our faces lewis in a neutral tone asked stan what is your problem with rapp he took a while to answer and finally said i cant put my finger on it its more of a feeling a bad feeling do you know what i think it is kennedy asked two things first i think you have major control issues you cant stand the fact that you werent involved in recruiting him and second you feel threatened what hurleys face was twisted into a mask of confusion hes you hes the man you were forty years ago and it scares the crap out of you hurley shook his head dismissively thats bullshit really well i can say the same thing about your gut feeling its bullshit what do you think the plo planted him in a dc suburb twentythree years ago raised him catholic and sent him off to syracuse to play lacrosse or do you think it was the kgb before the soviet union collapsed and now hes a rogue deep cover operative ridiculous kennedy dismissed the ludicrous idea with a flip of her right hand youre clutching at straws no one moved or spoke for five seconds while kennedys stinging remarks set in lewis finally said she has a point he pushed back his chair and stood id like to show you something i sat down and talked with him before all of you arrived i think you will find this very interesting lewis approached the surveillance control board and pressed a few buttons a blackandwhite image of rapp appeared on the screen he was sitting in the office on the first floor lewiss voice came over the speakers he was offscreen to the right that was unfortunate what happened this afternoon rapp sat still for a few seconds and then nodded do you feel bad at all about what you did to victor it took him a long time to answer and then he said were all big boys here so you feel no remorse i wish it hadnt happened but victor isnt exactly the nicest guy i see is it possible that you intentionally broke his arm intentionally is a strong word we were sparring and one thing led to another the thing that led to the other was you snapping his arm before he could tap out im not sure he would have tapped out you could be kicked out for what happened why sergeant smith thinks you intentionally broke victors arm i dont see how that would be fair no one said anything about what holds we could use or not use we were supposed to stay away from the head and the groin that was it if you intentionally broke another recruits arm that would be grounds for dismissal rapp looked at the floor for a long moment and then said i dont like playing all these games games yeah games how do you mean games you know what im talking about im not sure i do that file on your desk the other day rapp pointed to the clear surface the file with my name on it what about it you were testing me really yes rapp said in an easy tone ive seen the way you monitor whats going on around here you study everything rapp gestured at the desk youre not the kind of guy who leaves sensitive files lying around unless theres a reason im sure this place is wired for video and sound rapp motioned toward the bookshelf and then the overhead light when you asked to see me a few days ago and i was left sitting in here by myself for fifteen minutes you were probably sitting up in the attic or down in the basement watching me testing me to see if i would open the file and read what was in it lewis could be heard clearing his throat and then saying even if that were true i dont see it excuses your breaking victors arm i never said it excused anything what i said is that you are playing games with us you leaves files lying around tell us one set of rules and then let victor break them you were in the barn how was it okay for victor to punch fred in the face we will deal with that separately this is about what you did i saw the way you reacted when victor punched fred in the nose rapp paused and looked down at his hands do you know what i think i think victor doesnt fit in how so based on what ive seen since ive been here there are just two logical conclusions where victor is concerned either victor is a recruit just like the rest of us or hes part of your evaluation process part of the process he works for you guys hes one of the instructors and why would we do that so you could get a closer look at us you put victor in with us and his job is to tempt us into making mistakes ask us who we are and where were from try to get guys to screw up so you can get rid of the guys who dont have the discipline interesting either way it isnt good if i understand this program correctly victor is not the kind of guy youre looking for so if he is a recruit and you guys cant see that im not sure i want to work for people who cant grasp the obvious and if he is one of the instructors its a pretty fucked up way to train disciplined men lets assume youre correct for a second knowing all of that you decided to break his arm rapp shook his head i had my suspicions before but i wasnt sure after i broke his arm i saw the way you and the other instructors reacted and i pretty much knew he was one of you there was a good five seconds of silence and then lewis asked do you think you have a good moral compass rapp let out a small laugh here we go with your vague questions i know but please try to answer this one you mean do i understand the difference between right and wrong yes rapp hesitated i would say pretty much yes but here at this place it seems like that line keeps getting moved can you give me an example that angry old cuss the one my recruiter warned my about well im not here five minutes and the two of us end up in the barn hes telling me to quit and save all of us the effort i tell him no and suggest we should find out if i have what it takes he very clearly tells me that the head and groin are off limits while we spar we lock horns and twenty seconds into it i have him beat he was about two seconds from blacking out when he grabbed my nuts and practically turned me into a eunuch he never said anything to me about it in fact i havent seen him since then you have victor running around here breaking every rule he wants while the instructors are all over the rest of us again we go in to spar today and the instructors clearly tell us the head and groin are off limits and what does victor do fred is within seconds of beating him and victor punches him square in the face i saw the look on your face but the other two didnt say boo its screwy i dont know how you expect the rest of us to follow any rules and here i sit technically i didnt do anything wrong and im being threatened with the boot i didnt threaten you you said sergeant smith thinks i should get the boot id say thats a threat lewis hit the stop button and turned to face hurley with arms folded he said that was one of the more difficult sessions ive conducted do you know why hurley shook his head because i agreed with virtually everything he said chapter stansfield stood at the end of the dock looked up at the moon and ran through the list of transgressions although he didnt show it and he never did he was livid with what was going on down here he had allowed hurley far too much latitude and while much of his anger was directed at the snake eater more of it was directed back at himself how had he not seen the signs earlier this place this operation all of it was his responsibility kennedy had tried to warn him as respectfully as she could but his days were filled with a hundred other pressing issues of national security and he had a blind spot when it came to hurley especially on the operational side of things hed known stan longer than anyone at the company he knew his long list of talents and his short but potent list of faults thered been a few bumps over the years occasions when hurley had let him down but even the great ted williams struck out every now and then they had met in budapest in the summer of just as everything was heating up in the unwilling soviet satellite stansfield was in his thirties and was quickly rising through the ranks of the fledgling cia while hurley was in his early twenties fresh out of training and thirsting for a fight stansfield saw firsthand in the runup to the hungarian revolution that hurley had a real aptitude for mayhem he was talented and wild and a lot of other things some good and some bad but one thing was undeniable he knew how to get at the enemy engage them upset them bloody them and somehow make it back with nothing more than a few bumps in the espionage business it was easy to fall into a safe daily pattern begin the day at your apartment head to the embassy for work a local café for lunch back to the embassy maybe a cocktail party at another embassy in the evening a stop at a local café for a nightcap and then back to your apartment you could safely move about a foreign capital without ever risking your job or your life not hurley when he landed in a new place he headed straight for the rough part of town got to the know the prostitutes the barkeeps and most important the blackmarketeers who despised their communist overlords hurley fed him daily reports about the rising contempt among the citizenry and proved himself to be a firstclass field operative he became stansfields indispensable man tonight however stansfield was having his doubts budapest had been a long time ago sooner or later all skills diminished the obvious transition was to move him behind a desk but that would be like asking a race horse to pull a plow it would kill him stansfield looked back up at the house he had silently left the meeting and walked down to the lake on his own a simple hand gesture was enough to tell his bodyguards to wait at the top of the small hill hurley would know to come find him he did not have to be asked stansfield could tell his old colleague was well aware that he had disappointed him he was as down as hed seen him in many years and it could have been because of a variety of factors at the top of the list was probably that shiner on his face stansfield had to bite down on the right side of his tongue when hed found out that kennedys recruit had been the one whod painted him hurleys fighting abilities were unmatched by any man hed ever encountered his tolerance for pain his quickness his mean streak his homeric ability to find the weakness of another man no matter how big or strong had become the stuff of legend at langley looking back on it now stansfield could see where the mistakes had been made he had allowed hurley to create a cult of personality down here his own little fiefdom of special operations shooters all of them were extremely talented and useful but as a group they had the ability to create a toxic stew of contempt for anyone who had not walked in their shoes even doctor lewis a snake eater himself had voiced concern kennedy had repeatedly attempted to nudge him in the right direction she had the giftthe ability to glimpse where it was all headed she knew they needed to adapt change course and tactics and she had been trying to get stansfields attention the problem was as the deputy director of operations he was in charge of it all every valuable operative they had in every major city all over the globe and all of the support people who went with them virtually all of it was compartmentalized in some way and a good portion of it wasnt even put to paper it was a neverending chess game that was played in his head every day all day long stansfield heard the soft footfalls on the stairs coming down to the lake he turned and made out the image of hurley in the moonlight the platform swayed as he stepped onto the lshaped dock hurley approached his boss without a word and pulled out a pack of camels he offered his old friend one knowing that he liked to acquaint himself with his old habit when he was away from his wife the two men stood facing the lake looking up at the starry night sky puffing on their cigarettes for nearly a minute before hurley finally spoke i fucked up stansfield gave no reply just a simple nod of agreement maybe its time i call it quits stansfield turned his head a few degrees to look at hurley and said i will tolerate a lot of things from you but selfpity is not one of them youve never been a quitter and youre not going to start now i got my ass beat by a college puke you got your healthy ego bruised is what happened you dont understand it should have never happened i still cant explain how it happened im not getting any younger but even on an off day im still better than ninetynine point nine percent of the guys out there i know math was never your strong suit but the answer is pretty obvious what the hell is that supposed to mean if you can beat ninetynine point nine percent of the guys out there and he bested you that means hes in the point one percent hurley shook his head i dont see how its possible not enough training you dont see it because you dont want to i did a little checking on my own irenes find is an exceptionally gifted athlete hes considered a bit of a freak of nature in the world of lacrosse did you know hes considered to be one of the greatest college lacrosse players of all time what in hell does that have to do with fighting a great athlete can learn almost anything and do it a lot quicker than an average athlete stansfield said firmly your big problem though is that you allowed your personal disdain for anyone who hasnt worn the uniform to cloud your judgment still still nothing stansfield cut him off the boy is a threetime allamerican and national champ you got thumped by a worldclass athlete who has no real training you yourself said hes been taking classes rolling around some mat at a strip mall is not training stansfield let out a tired sigh it was his way of releasing pressure so he didnt blow some people you could gently tap a with a finishing hammer a few times and they would get the point not hurley though you had to hit the man square in the forehead with a sledgehammer repeatedly to get your point across sorry hurley said meekly im still having a hard time buying this kids story you are possibly the most stubborn person i have ever met and thats saying a lot you have used that to your advantage many times but it has also gotten you into a fair amount of trouble and before you get all sensitive on me this is coming from the guy who had to get you out of all that trouble over the years ive called in a lot of favors to pull your ass out of the fire so hear me when i tell you that this issue is moot the kid beat you and quite honestly i dont care how he did it or where he learned how to do it the fact is he did it and that makes him a very desirable recruit hurley finally got it what do you want me to do fix it how do i fix it if im not even sure where i fucked up stop being so conveniently modest you know where you made mistakes its just not in your nature to confront them so dig a little harder and theyll turn up and by the way i made a few mistakes of my own ultimately you are my responsibility stansfield glanced back up at the house that last hour in there was one of the most embarrassing of my career hurley was too embarrassed himself to speak were supposed to know better stansfield continued were the veterans and we just had two kids point out something that we both should have caught there was a day when i knew better to put it mildly you are an organizational nightmare you belong in the field i think this stansfield held his arms out and motioned at the nature around them lulled me into thinking that you were in fact in the field but youre not youre too corralled down here then let me go active again hurley said in an almost pleading voice stansfield mulled the thought over while taking one last puff there were any number of saying that could be applied to the espionage trade but few were as appropriate as the phrase nothing ventured nothing gained at some point you had to jump into the game stansfield had grown weary of receiving secure cables telling him that another one of his assets had been picked off by these radical islamists it was time to start hitting back stan these islamists arent going away ive been telling you that for ten years looking at the big picture theyve been a minor irritation until now but i sense something bigger they are organizing and morphing and spreading like a virus you can thank the damn saudis and the iranians for that that was true stansfield thought very few people understood the bloody rivalry between the sunnis and the shias each sect was growing more radicalmore violent they couldnt wait any longer stansfield lowered his voice stan in six months time i want you operational stop trying to run these kids down like its a special forces selection process irenes right i dont really care if they can survive in the forest for a week with nothing more than a fingernail clipper i want them ready for urban operations im going to task doc to you fulltime listen to him he knows what hes doing okay and after six months hurley asked with a bit of optimism in his voice im going to turn you loose we need to hit these guys back at a bare minimum i want them lying awake at night worried that they might be next i want you to scare the shit out of them hurley smiled in anticipation i know just what to do good and one last thing youre almost sixty this is a young kids game especially your side of the business our days are numbered we need to start trusting these kids more in another ten years theyre going to take over and well probably be dead hurley smiled im not going down without a fight chapter beirut lebanon sayyed mopped his brow with a rag the front of his white tshirt was splattered with the blood of the man who had just confessed to myriad sins the basement was warm and damp and hed been at it for most of the day he couldnt remember the last time hed had to work so hard to get a man to talk he was thirsty and hungry but both needs would have to wait they were gathered upstairs nervously waiting to hear what hed discovered sayyed dropped the pliers on the metal cart the device bounced and fell open the serrated clamps releasing a bloody fingernail there were eight total strewn about the stainlesssteel surface sticky and gooey with blood and tissue sayyed admired his work for a second every man was different for some the mere threat of physical pain was enough to get them to admit their deception others like this jewish pig took a little more work hed employed many different methods to get at the truth but he preferred fingernails and toenails for the simple reason that there were twenty of them and they grew back sayyed had seen torture practiced in a wide variety of forms most sessions were brutish and conducted without forethought or planning slapping and kicking was the most common method but employed against a man who had been desensitized to such things it was more often than not useless there were stabbing and slicing and shooting and although they worked they also required medical care if you were going to continue to interrogate the individual there was degradation such as shoving a mans head in bucket full of human excrement sticking things in orifices where they didnt belong and a long list of things sayyed found distasteful electrocution was the only other form that sayyed would use it was extremely effective and clean its only downside was the potential for heart failure and longterm brain and nerve damage sayyed liked to spend time with his subjects to truly debrief a prisoner took months sayyed could never understand why people would so casually throw away such a valuable commodity killing a subject after he admitted to his lies was foolish as an interrogator you had barely scratched the surface an admission of guilt was just that and often nothing more the truly valuable information lay buried in the subjects brain and needed to be slowly and carefully coaxed to the surface and to do that you needed time sayyed wiped his hands on a bloodsmeared towel and said to one of the guards clean the wounds and bandage the fingers i dont want him getting an infection he put on his black dress shirt and left the interrogation room he continued past the guards and up one flight of stairs there were a dozen men milling about the lobby most were in plain clothes a few wore fatigues but all were armed with rifles and sidearms sayyed continued up another flight of stairs to the second floor where he found more armed men milling about the hallway he frowned at the sight of them the presence of so many men was bound to draw attention his colleagues were far too onedimensional they were still thinking of their struggle as a ground battle between vying factions car bombs snipers and assaults must always be taken into account but the bigger threat at the moment was the jets flown by jews and the americans these men had not walked here which meant there were far too many cars parked in front of the building sayyed traveled with a light contingent of bodyguards for this very reason three or four were usually more than enough the others were either too paranoid too proud or too stupid to see the folly of traveling in such large motorcades eight guards were standing in the hallway outside the office at the back of the building sayyed approached one of the more recognizable faces and said i pray for the sake of our struggle that no more than six vehicles are parked in front of this building the man looked in the direction of the street and without answering took off at a trot sayyed was pleased that at least one of these morons knew how to take orders he opened the door to the office and found four faces instead of the three he had expected mustapha badredeen the leader of islamic jihad was at the head of the table to his right was the leader of islamic jihads paramilitary wing imad mughniyah and then colonel amir jalil of the iranian quds force he was irans liaison between islamic jihad and hezbollah the last man abu radih was not welcome at least not as far as sayyed was concerned he was the representative for fatah the extremely unreliable band of men who claimed to speak on behalf of the approximately five hundred thousand palestinians living in lebanon in sayyeds conservative opinion they were nothing more than a gang of organized mobsters who stumbled from one confrontation to the next leaving a trail of havoc in their wake they were only good for two things to use as a buffer against the jews to the south or as cannon fodder against the christian militias to the east well colonel jalil asked sayyed ignored the iranian and turned instead to mustapha badredeen cia i knew it radih said excitedly sayyed glanced at the imbecile who had created the problem and said you knew no such thing i did so radih said defensively how could you have possibly known what evidence did you have in your possession that pointed to the fact that this man was cia i have my sources sayyed laughed at him it was an empty claim and everyone in the room knew it and the businessman you kidnapped last week what has he told you he admitted that he is an american agent sayyed was dubious of the claim but the fool had just painted himself into a corner in that case i will need you to turn him over to me radih realized his mistake well he has admitted to a lot of things my men are not done interrogating him sayyed stared at him with a look that told everyone in the room that he didnt believe a word of it i will give you a report in a few days radih said sayyed dismissed him with a look of contempt and addressed the other men the man downstairs is an employee for the cia who has spent the better part of the last four years in damascus my government will want to assess the damage he has caused to do that thoroughly i will need radih to transfer his hostage to me im afraid this point is not negotiable but he is my hostage radih said half yelling it was my operation an operation that was not approved radih ignored the point and said he is extremely valuable he has told us his company will pay a large sum to get him back not if he is an american agent sayyed shook his head sadly and scratched his thick black beard as we know all too well the americans do not negotiate for hostages especially the cia pointing at the ceiling he added they are far more likely to track him down and drop a bomb on all of us the other men shared nervous looks the other american the one you grabbed in front of his hotel last week badredeen said to the fatah leader he has told you implicitly that he is an agent it is my suspicion radih said thankful for the breathing room what was he doing in beirut he works for one of their big telecommunications companies radih blathered on about his prisoner but sayyed was only half listening the cia man in the basement had verified the fact that the other man was a legitimate businessman but sayyed did not feel like coming to the aid of the twit from fatah he would only know for certain after spending months interrogating the men sayyed looked at mughniyah and said some men are very good liars it takes a skilled hand to discern the truth from these americans mughniyah nodded and spoke for the first time i dont like the coincidence we should turn him over to sayyed he will get to the bottom of it sayyed was quietly pleased mughniyah had a reputation for killing those who crossed him radih would not want to defy him the entire things gives me great concern the iranian chimed in sayyed could barely stand the man he was a selfproclaimed intellectual who was part of the rabble who had helped bring down the shah and bring about the islamic revolution of iran it cannot be a good sign that the americans are back jalil said as he caressed his bottom lip with the forefinger of his right hand nothing good can come from them poking around in our business i will find out what they are up to sayyed said confidently the three men exchanged looks ignoring radih who was growing more agitated by the second badredeen spoke for the group turning to radih he said please transfer your hostage to sayyed as soon as is possible that means tonight sayyed said not wanting to give the man an inch that is impossible radih said as if they were asking him to fly to the moon this man is too valuable i am more than capable of finding out his true identity with a casual flip of his hand he said i will give all of you a report within a few days that will not work sayyed held his ground i want him tonight i will not give him to you he is my prisoner mughniyah leaned forward in his chair and glared at the representative from fatah the temperature seemed to drop a few degrees i dont remember your seeking our permission to conduct this operation in the first place and when was the last time any of you came to me to ask permission to launch an operation with an icy voice mughniyah said i do not need your permission that hardly seems fair you are invited to these meetings as a courtesy nothing else the rest of you have taken hostages for years and have profited greatly while the rockets of retaliation rained down on my people and i did not complain to you now all i am asking is that i be allowed to share in the spoils of war you have not allowed me to partner on any of your other business ventures so i must take what is rightfully mine with a look of sadness he added i have given nothing but loyalty and this his how you treat me mughniyah threw his arms up in frustration he looked at badredeen and jalil talk some sense into him before i shoot him sayyed didnt let it show but he was enjoying every minute of this badredeen sighed heavily and said this is only temporary hand the man over to sayyed he is without question the best man to do the job when he is done if the man is in fact a businessman he will turn him back over to you and you can then negotiate a ransom that is fair radih shifted nervously in his chair he did not want to give up the man but he could not defy these four any one of them could have him killed before the sun rose again he could see what sayyed was up to the hostage could be worth as much as several million dollars if he did in fact work for the telecommunications company and once the man was out of his hands he would be lucky to get half of the ransom still half was better than being dead with great reluctance he said fine and then glancing sideways at sayyed he added you can interrogate him at my camp sayyed laughed nice try why not because i said so i do not need to explain such things to you he is being unreasonable radih said to the other three before they could answer sayyed said i need to inform damascus of this situation and i need to continue my discussion with the american agent i expect radih to have his prisoner here by ten oclock tonight so i can get to the bottom of this and i suggest you all leave as quickly as possible he glanced at the ceiling the four of us he said intentionally leaving radih out are far too tempting a target and with the american in the basement who knows what they are up to these days they may have other spies in the area moving toward the door he said with absolute finality i will have more answers for you tomorrow part ii chapter istanbul turkey of all the changes rapp had to make over the six months of his training adjusting to the solitude had been the most challenging as he became increasingly immersed in his new trade he drifted further and further away from his friends the big change was not that he did not see them as much it was a mental detachment with each new level of training they had less in common his new life was far from social rapps childhood had been fairly normal hed grown up in a nice uppermiddleclass suburb of washington dc and pretty much stayed out of trouble he did well in school although some subjects like french were far easier than math and science he excelled at every sport which guaranteed a certain level of acceptance among his peers there had been just one setback and it was a pretty big one when rapp was thirteen his father dropped dead of a massive heart attack it was a heavy blow but rapp didnt go into a complete free fall nor did he retreat into a shell the truth was his dad wasnt around much he was a workaholic who golfed on the weekends he was in no way a bad father he was fair and honest with his two boys and as far as rapp could tell he had been faithful to his mother and treated her with the respect she deserved it was neither bad or good it just was rapp had a tight group of friends in the neighborhood and his father had been wise enough to take out the right amount of life insurance so very little on the home front changed the awkward moments came at the sports banquets where he was the only one without a father and the holidays when the memories of his father inevitably bubbled to the surface but through it all he was more concerned about his little brother and mother there was one area where it definitely changed him he wanted stability in his personal relationships his friends became more important than ever not that they hadnt been before it was just that he had never had to think about it all he had to do was walk out his front door get on his bike and within a block or two he couldnt help but stumble onto a basketball or stickball game more than anything though his fathers death taught him that the clock was ticking everyone was going to die some a lot sooner than others but in the end there was no avoiding it and since he wasnt a hindu he pretty much figured hed better make the best of his one shot this drove him with amazing intensity and focus on fields and courts of his youth and then there was mary rapp met her when he was sixteen he was playing baseball and she was running track he didnt know if it was love at first sight because he hadnt a clue what love was but it was unlike anything hed ever experienced it was like every great emotion hed ever felt all rolled into one euphoric wave and it scared the crap out of him because he instantly knew he was not in control fortunately she was and she had the sense and stability to not jerk him around too much her father was a captain in the navy and a huge lacrosse fan with three daughters of his own he enthusiastically attended rapps lacrosse matches rapp and mary dated all through high school and then headed off to syracuse together where mary ran track and eventually landed in the newhouse school of public communications her ambitious plan was to become a sports announcer on a chilly december night in mary was returning home from a semester abroad when her plane was blown out of the sky killing passengers and crew and more innocent souls on the ground in lockerbie scotland the terrorist attack that became known as pam am lockerbie hit rapp like a hammer blow they had planned their entire life together theyd discussed kids ambitions and fears but never once did they think that one of them would be taken if hed made it through the death of his father relatively intact the opposite was true this time he crumbled he was already home for christmas break and planning on picking mary up at dulles after shed connected through jfk strangely enough when he received the news he never questioned it never challenged it never asked for proof the downing of the plane was all over the news and there was no doubt that she was on it shed called him from heathrow right before shed boarded he was a wreck for the first week he refused to see a soul including marys parents and then on the morning of her funeral he emerged from the basement shaved and wearing a suit and tie his mother and his brother steven accompanied him to the funeral where he sat stonefaced in a state of bewildered shock midway through the service though something happened the shock the pain the agonizing selfpity over the fact that he would never see her again never hold her never smell her the list went on and on and on like some pounding surf that threatened to drown him sitting in that pew that morning listening to all of the crying witnessing all of the pain and loss made him want to make a break for it he did not want to share his heartache with these people none of them knew her the way he did it was his dreams that had been dashed his life that had been turned upside down and wrecked selfpity was something he had never experienced before and it sickened him rapp took his pathetic selfabsorbed emotion and shoved it as far down in his gut as it would go and he plugged it with the first and only thing he had availableanger that anger slowly metastasized into a suit of armor for the first time since the news had hit him he saw a way out a faint light at the far end of the cavern he wasnt sure what it was but he knew he had to head toward it it was the only thing that offered him hope the rest of these people could sit around and feel sorry for themselves and each other but not him he wanted to hurt someone he wanted to make someone pay he didnt know for certain that he would achieve his goal but he knew with absolute certainty that he wanted to kill the men who were responsible for bringing down that plane rapp didnt know if it was right or wrong and he didnt care all he knew was that the anger kept the pain at bay rapp and hurley had developed a hatehate relationship the shrink had told him it didnt really matter as long as they were united in their hatred for the enemy it had been a strange six months and looking back on the journey rapp was amazed that hed made it through without any serious injury he was young enough going in to be fearless but coming out on the other end looking back at what hed been through was another story it was a little like being told not to look down while on the high wire you just take it one step at a time and when you get to the other side and reality sets in you think you must have been off your rocker to ever try it in the first place rapp could point to a specific date and time when the physical hell and mental abuse had all but vanished it was replaced by eighteenhour days that were structured to the minute and more academic than grueling there were still long runs and lots of pushups and pullups but they were designed to keep them in peak shape not to try to get them to quit the low point was the day after hed broken victors arm for the first week they were rousted at five every morning rapp didnt need an alarm he was on his feet as soon as the door was opened but on the morning after the incident with victor rapp found himself thrown from his cot and rolling across the dusty floor after landing with a thud he came up swinging it was still dark and his muscles were tight and he never saw the blow that came out of the darkness it hit him in the solar plexus and as rapp doubled over from the first strike another punch hammered his left eye rapp hit the floor and lay there gulping for air like a large mouth bass flopping around on a dock the lights suddenly came on and with them the insults came raining down from the mouth of the mean old cuss he stood over rapp his fists clenched a look of smug satisfaction on his face if rapp had had a gun at that moment he would more than likely have killed the man the four remaining recruits were ordered outside and for the next four hours were forced to endure unimaginable tortures one man collapsed from exhaustion and another simply quit it was now down to just rapp and fred that was when the bastard turned all of his attention on rapp by noon they were down to one it was an unwarranted slap to the back of the head that did rapp in as calmly as possible he turned to face the old man and told him if you ever slap me again im going to put you in the hospital the old man ordered rapp into the barn and they went at it again this time rapp lost fair and square or so he thought at first as he lay there on the mat bloodied and exhausted he realized what had happened the old man didnt think he could take him fair and square so he ran rapp into the ground first he dumped him from his cot at am and spent the next eight hours wearing him down and tenderizing him rapp never had a chance the old prick had made it personal and in rapps mind that did not reflect well on the organization he thought he was joining the whole thing was starting to look and smell like a shit show rapp got to his feet told the old bastard exactly what he thought of him and quit rapp packed his stuff and was almost to the gate when the shrink caught up with him he tried to talk rapp out of quitting and when that didnt work he outright asked him to stay rapp still didnt budge so lewis put all the cards on the table he formally introduced himself and admitted that victor was in fact one of the instructors he explained that he had vigorously protested using him to infiltrate the recruits rapp asked him for the old cusss name but lewis refused if you stay and make it through the rest of the training you will find out who he is but short of that i cannot oblige you when rapp held his ground lewis told him only that the old man was not the most likable guy but he assured rapp that he was exceedingly good at his craft he assured rapp that the nonsense was over and that from this moment forward they would be focusing on tradecraft rapp still wavered he simply couldnt see how it was possible for the old cuss to change his behavior lewis sensing rapps indecision said youre one of the best ive ever seen we could really use you in a way that might explain why hes so hard on you rapp finally relented it was down to just him and fred they still began every day with a workout but the rest of the time was spent either in the classroom in the barn on the pistol range or on field exercises to richmond and then to atlanta they employed their skills against random targetsunwitting businessmen they followed them surveilled their every move and looked for the right opportunity to dispatch them everything was analyzed and critiqued by lewis and the old man while at the lake house they were allowed to speak only arabic they honed their fighting skills with virtually every conceivable weapon they focused on knives and guns for the most part but they were also taught to inventory every room they entered for objects that could be used to defend or kill a day didnt go by where the old cuss didnt remind them of the endgamehe was turning them into killers they studied physiology until they had an intimate understanding of the best ways to either dispatch or incapacitate an opponent they became expert marksmen with a variety of pistols shooting with both left and right hands they were taught escape and evasion techniques explosives and the tricks of the countersurveillance trade as a final step rapp and fred were told that if anything went wrong they were on their own embassies and consulates were off limits the united states government didnt know they existed and it sure as hell wasnt going to claim them if they landed in hot water the mean old cuss asked them if they accepted this if they didnt they could walk away right now no questions asked after only brief consideration both men said they fully understood the need for plausible deniability they were in hurley then formally introduced himself and told rapp and fred they were now free to reveal to each other their real identities rapp and fred had already done this several months earlier but they went through the motions as if it were the first time after that they were forced to memorize a lengthy list of addresses and phone numbers across europe and the middle east a day did not pass without hurleys reminding them that the united states government had no knowledge of their existence if they were caught doing something illegal in a foreign country they were on their own there would be no cavalry or diplomatic effort to gain their release as often as hurley brought it up rapp did not dwell on it for the simple reason that he did not plan on getting caught chapter as planned rapp was the first one to arrive in the former capital city of the byzantine empire hed been given a long list of orders and one of them was to stay away from the safe house until it was dark it was february and the temperature was in the midfifties rapp took the tram to the beyoglu district found a mens room retrieved a few objects from his luggage and then deposited the suitcase in a locker and set about exploring the area which hed already memorized by map he was immediately taken by the scope of the city as well as its rich history hed traveled to london and paris previously and istanbul rivaled them in every way the images of london and paris were well known throughout the western world but istanbul far more rich in history had in a way been forgotten by people in europe and america after stopping for a quick bite at a café rapp made his way toward the galata neighborhood where their target lived hurley had given him specific orders to stay clear of both the targets apartment and his office rapp had not made a conscious decision to defy the order it more or less just happened as he turned onto bankalar daddesi or banks street he couldnt help but walk past the targets place of work along with several hundred other people who crowded the sidewalk rapp passed on the opposite side of the street and noted the bank guard standing next to the front door with that done he decided he might as well take a look at the mans apartment which was sixtenths of a mile from the office it was on a treelined street that reminded rapp of a much smaller version of the boulevard montmartre in paris it was a wealthy enclave and as in all such enclaves in cities the world over the occupants were protected from the riffraff by security guards ornate fences and iron bars on the firstfloor windows at first glance neither the office nor the apartment looked like the ideal place to strike when the sun finally set rapp found his way to the twobedroom flat via a back alley he went by once without stopping to check and see if there were any surprises and then circled back in the poor light he threaded the worn key into the lock and held his breath the first attempt did not work rapp jiggled the key a bit and then tried again this time the deadbolt released he stepped into the room barely breathing and closed the door behind him he stood statuelike all of his senses on high alert this apartment was the only definitive link to him in the entire city of twelve million people hurley had warned him that this was the secondmostdangerous moment when conducting an operation rapp asked him what was the most dangerous and the old man had replied with a devilish smile when you engage the target after dropping his bag he locked the door and found the wall switch two small wall sconces cast a yellow light over the room he fished a large rubber doorstop from his suitcase and wedged it under the door he couldnt help but smile to himself as he thought of hurleys rules the man even had rules about how to go to the bathroom some of them like the rubber doorstop made complete sense while others like which stall to choose and why seemed a bit much rapp checked the windows next they had bars which were padlocked there was only one way in and outthe door hed just come through that was not the best situation should the police come looking for them rapp made sure the shades were pulled tight on the two gardenlevel windows that faced the alley and then he went straight for the bedroom at the bottom of the armoire under an extra blanket and pillow he found what he was looking for rapp placed the tattered leather suitcase on the bed dialed in the combinations and popped the clasps inside was a shrinkwrapped file a small arsenal of pistols silencers ammunition knives and a surveillance kit rapp snapped on a pair of latex gloves and retrieved a beretta f from the foam cutout he checked the slide the chamber the firing pin and then the trigger the gun had been cleaned by a pro after screwing a silencer to the end he took one of the fifteenround magazines and inserted it chambered a round and checked the safety rapp then set about doing a complete examination of the apartment he retrieved the electric razor from his shaving kit pressed two buttons waited for the light to blink the shaver was actually a scanning device used to detect bugs hurley had explained that the flat had been rented by a freelancer which in this case was code for a retired agency employee the man was to sanitize and stock the flat but rapp had been ordered to go over the entire place again from top to bottom just to make sure it took him the better part of an hour to go over the entire apartment when the jet lag finally caught up with him rapp was too tired to make anything to eat so he took a quick shower and then tore the shrink wrap from the file he had been given a full briefing on hamdi sharif back in the states but this file he was told would be far more targetspecific the target was fiftyeight years old he was a turkish national and according to press clippings had made his money in real estate what the clippings left out was that the majority of his wealth had come from supplying arms to various regimes throughout the middle east and southwest asia british french and american intelligence agencies all had his number but sharif was in bed with the russians which made him a bit of a sticky situation none of the allies wanted to risk upsetting the russians so they tolerated him rapp frowned as he reviewed the section on sharifs ties with the tangled web of former soviet generals and ivancomelately millionaire businessmen all but a few were thugs and mafiosi and the legitimate businessmen were being dropped and squeezed out of their holdings on a weekly basis russia had become the wild west and the sheriff was in on the fix the kgb brutes had new business cards but other than that not much had changed the allies for some reason couldnt see that the more they turned a blind eye the more brazen these men were becoming rapp could give a rats ass about the russians and who they used to peddle their arms so long as those arms didnt end up in the laps of terrorists unfortunately for sharif that was precisely what he had been doing and in everincreasing shipments most of the file was a summary of what rapp already knew such as his ties to hezbollah but there were a few new snippets about a marxist outfit called dev sol in the past year the group had targeted the overseas offices of fifteen us corporations in istanbul the bombs were all military grade and the brits were saying sharifs outfit had supplied the goods sharif was a muslim and an ardent supporter of hezbollah hamas and fatah how he had ended up in business with a bunch of leftist godhating communists was a real headscratcher the file didnt draw any conclusions just gave the facts rapp was left to venture guesses on his own he supposed it was money first and then the old sayingmy enemys enemy is my friend the dev sol wrinkle gave rapp pause however he got the sense that this might be about more than just pan am lockerbie or at least that certain important people stateside dont care so much when innocent civilians get killed but by god if the daytoday operations of a couple of fortune companies were disrupted it was time to send a message those corporations contributed a lot of money to the coffers of important politicians in washington the more rapp thought about it the more he realized it didnt matter it was like sharif supporting dev sol as long as he and the corporations were going after the same enemy it didnt much matter rapp finished the file and stuffed it under the mattress he lay there for a long moment with his eyes open thinking about the detailed report it was written in english but it had not been written by an american the choice of words was distinctive and the sentence structure more formal rapp concluded the brits had put the report together and that they had taken a long hard look at solving the sharif problem they had conducted careful surveillance on the arms dealer his daily routine was detailed down to the minute the report didnt say how long they had watched him but he got the impression it was for several weeks rapp remembered that the shrink back at the lake house had told him you could discern patterns in almost any persons life in reading sharifs file those patterns jumped off the page and one in particular was almost impossible to ignore rapps mind began to wander down a path that he should have steered clear of but he found it impossible to resist after a few minutes he set the alarm on his watch turned off the bedside lamp glanced at the loaded pistol closed his eyes and began to drift away hurleys orders couldnt have been more clear but it would be two more days before he arrived in the city rapp began to imagine how he would do it the act of his first kill played out in his mind like a movie as he drifted off to sleep he decided he would go for a nice long run in the morning and he would break another one of hurleys rules chapter rapp awoke rested and went through the motions of his morning routine without coming to grips with what he had for the most part already decided he shaved drank a glass of orange juice and mixed some granola and yogurt into a small bowl he read the file again while eating he started with the summary and worked his way back to see if hed missed anything after reading it a second time he was even more convinced that it had been prepared by the brits which led to a very obvious question why had they decided not to act it could have been as simple as hurley or someone at langley offering to solve the problem for them rapp had been trying to decipher the organizational structure of the team that was centered on the lake anna house for some time now there had to be more people involved than the handful of operatives hed met after rapp had proved himself worthy of joining their endeavor the veil of secrecy was lifted a notch his recruiter gave him her real name although he had no way of knowing if it in fact was her real name irene kennedy was the only person in the small group who actually worked at langley according to her everyone else was a contractor rapp asked the obvious question what am i kennedy thought about it for a second and said does it matter to you maybe technically you dont work for the cia but i work for you thats correct the important thing is that you have no record of ever working for the federal government and wed like to keep it that way rapp thought long and hard about what he was about to say so im a hired gun kennedys squinting eyes showed that she wasnt exactly in love with the label rapp surprised her even more by what he said next how about assassin she frowned no by my estimate ive fired around twenty thousand rounds of ammunition since arriving here and youve become quite the marksman and whats the point of all of this training to keep shooting paper targets or to eventually sink a bullet into a targets head you know the answer he did remember the first time we met she nodded you told me there are people in washington who think that we need to take a more aggressive approach with these terrorists yes but they dont have the courage to say so publicly it would be foolish for them to do so we live in a civilized society they would be thrown out of office and a civilized society would never condone assassination even in instances where it involved national security not unless we were at war and even then it would be tricky rapp digested that for a moment and then said im not into semantics private contractor hired gun operative he shook his head killer the point of all of this is to go out find the enemy and put a bullet in his head right i suppose that is an accurate definition i suppose the answer is yes so im an assassin not yet she offered with a sly smile you havent killed anyone rapp looked in the mirror at his reflection and wondered if he really knew himself the college athlete looked back at him with the innocence of youth the public face in no way jibed with the thoughts of retribution that filled his head inside he was a much older man a jaded hard man who was now a trained killer he thought again of his conversation with kennedy and his new profession he was ready eager really but not in a reckless way more methodical perhaps than at any time in his life he asked himself again if he should proceed with his plan the answer came back a resounding yes rapp secured the silenced beretta in a shoulder holster and covered it with a lightweight blue and silver reversible running jacket he stuffed one of the surveillance kits into a fanny pack and strapped the pack to his waist he put a dark blue nike baseball hat on his head and checked himself in the fulllength mirror on the inside door of the armoire there was a slight bulge under his right arm where the mm was hoistered as a last measure he grabbed a white towel from the bathroom and looped it around the back of his neck he stuffed the ends inside the running jacket zipped it up and checked himself in the mirror the bulge was no longer noticeable rapp lowered the zipper turned to the side and stuck his left hand inside the jacket he gripped the beretta and attempted to aim the weapon the silencer caught on the jacket he tried again this time partially drawing the weapon but keeping it hidden inside the jacket he found it worked best if he raised his right arm as if he were checking the time on his wristwatch rapp practiced the move fifty more times until he was completely comfortable with it finally he checked the alley and then left the apartment locking the door behind him he decided to skip stretching before the run no sense in giving the neighbors time to observe him whenever possible reconnaissance is best done on foot a satellite cant give you the smells and sounds of a neighborhood and it cant see what might be lurking behind a window or under the awning of an apartment building a car isnt bad but then again cars usually travel at fairly high speeds placing them in the area of concern for a few seconds at most often they were the only choice but in this situation walking the neighborhood was the best option or in rapps case running it he took off at a trot from studying the file rapp knew there was a park a block down the street from sharifs apartment the previous night hed found a low wall that offered a decent vantage point where he could stretch and keep an eye on sharifs building without drawing too much attention to himself it was a mile and a half to the park after one mile rapp stopped at a public phone and punched in an international calling card number using the knuckle of his forefinger when he heard the dial tone he punched in the number for the phone service five seconds later he heard the prerecorded greeting at the beep he left a coded message in arabic that told hurley everything was proceeding according to plan which technically was the case but probably not for much longer rapp carefully placed the phone back in the cradle and took off for the park he circled the entire area twice and saw nothing that would lead him to believe that there was any surveillance there were a few doormen who were out sweeping a couple of early morning exercisers and some people walking their dogs but no police rapp entered the park at sevenfortyone and settled in by the wall he started stretching his calves first his right for thirty seconds and then his left hed positioned himself so that he had a clear view of the front of sharifs apartment building there was no wind and rapp guessed the temperature was in the high fifties according to the brits sharifs apartment was one of two on the fifth floor it was a big place totaling fortyfive hundred square feet his mother his wife and one of his daughters lived with him rapp started on his calisthenics and kept track of the people entering and leaving his corner of the park every minute or so a pedestrian passed just outside the park none of them paid him an ounce of attention it was the same the world over most of these people had been sound asleep thirty minutes ago and they were now off to start their daily grind they would be lucky if they were fully awake by the time they reached their offices rapp did fifty pushups followed by fifty situps and then stretched some more at eight he checked the apartment door and his pulse quickened just a touch at eightohfive he frowned and started to doubt the accuracy of the surveillance report then at eightohseven the apartment buildings doorman stepped outside and held the door open for a plump man and a little brown dachshund the man was wearing sunglasses and a long black trench coat he had his collar turned up against the morning chill the sunglasses coat and dog all matched the photos from the surveillance report it was sharif rapp glanced at the open park bench about eighty feet to his left and started doing more situps every time he rose he could look over the wall and see sharif moving closer with his dog every time he lowered himself to the ground he thought of his orders the plan was for rapp to arrive two days early and conduct countersurveillance to make sure they werent being watched he would then call the service and flash them the allclear hurley and richards would arrive on the third day and they would begin direct surveillance on the target for a minimum of five days if all went well they would then make their move rapp let out a slight grunt even though the situps were easy sharif was almost to the bench rapp lowered himself to the ground and rested for a second the entire operation seemed far too complicated far too many moving parts as his college coach liked to say too many places where something could go wrong rapp began another set of twentyfive situps sharif was just arriving at the bench the man bent over undid the dogs leash and tossed a small blue ball into a grassy area the little brown sausage took off after it when rapp came up the next time rashid had a mobile phone out and was punching in a number kennedy had played a tape to rapp and richards two weeks earlier on which sharif implicated himself in a number of illegal dealings with known terrorist organizations rapp asked her where she got the intel and she politely told him it was classified information rapp guessed it came from these morning chats on his mobile phone rapp did another situp and thought of dr lewis the shrink the man must have asked him in every conceivable way how he thought he would cope with taking another human life rapp had answered that question so many times he finally said to the shrink well i guess i wont know until i kill someone thats right rapp muttered to himself the whole idea behind the orion team was that it would have a small footprint it would cut through all the bureaucratic bs and get things done in a more expeditious manner and of course deniability was paramount rapp finished the set of twentyfive and lay flat on his back for sixty seconds playing the entire thing out in his minds eye the longer they were on the ground in istanbul lurking around sharifs apartment and office the greater the chance theyd be noticed he didnt like that one bit he also didnt like the idea of dragging this thing out when the solution was so obvious he thought of how mad hurley would be and dismissed the thought almost immediately the man was always mad about something rapp thought of the past three years all the sleepless nights when he had yearned for the opportunity to meet just one of the men behind the downing of pan am when he had imagined down to the most minute detail what he would do to them and now he had the man who had supplied the plastic explosives and militarygrade fuse and detonator sitting in his sights hed waiting long enough when the best course of action was staring you in the face you should take it rapp hopped to his feet and did a couple of side bends before walking over to a tree he stretched one thigh and then the other stealing a glance at shariff as he did so the man was too busy yapping on the phone to notice rapp rapp did a few more stretches and took a quick inventory of his surroundings he counted four people within two hundred feet the closest had just passed by on the sidewalk rapp waited to give the woman a good head start and then stepped out from behind the tree his feet fell silently on the dirt jogging path that ran in front of sharifs bench he unzipped his jacket a foot and slid his left hand inside his thumb found the safety he flipped it up rapp then pulled his hand out of his jacket and kept moving toward the target who had yet to notice him twenty feet away rapps pulse was as steady as it had ever been his eyes narrowed a bit and he took in a deep breath he could hear the man clearly now it was same voice hed heard on the tape kennedy had played for him he was talking about an extremely valuable shipment rapp never flinched never wavered for a second he was only ten feet away when sharif finally looked up rapp gave him a friendly nod and then raised his right wrist to look at his watch a split second later his left hand slid between the folds of his jacket and found the grip of the beretta he swung the gun up the holster acting as a sling the blue fabric of his running jacket bulging just slightly rapps finger was prepared to squeeze the trigger when he changed his mind he wanted to look into sharifs eyes he wanted to confront the man the two men locked eyes for a second rapp smiled at him and then changed directions took two steps and casually sat down on the bench next to the arms dealer rapp leaned forward and jabbed the end of the silencer into sharifs ribs a look of panic washed over the turks face his mouth was agape the mobile phone held in his right hand a half foot from his face a mans voice could be heard squawking from the tiny speaker rapp elevated the silencer a few inches and squeezed the trigger the bullet pierced the fabric of the running jacket leaving a small hole and then a millisecond later it shattered the cell phone sharif let out a yelp dropped what was left of the phone and clutched his bloody hand rapp jabbed the silencer firmly into the mans ribs and in a menacing voice said how do you sleep at night what sharif asked in total confusion you heard me you piece of shit how do you sleep at night do you think of all the innocent people youve helped kill do you think of their faces rapp poked him hard with the silencer do you think of their final seconds how they react when a bomb goes off in the cargo hold of a at thirtyone thousand feet rapp saw the recognition and then fear in the mans eyes i dont know what youre shut up rapp commanded i know who you are and i have no desire to listen to your lies but this time rapp jabbed the silencer so hard into the mans ribs that sharif let out a small cry i only want to know one thing rapp said do you ever think about them have you ever felt an ounce of guilt over all the people youve helped kill sharif shook his head slowly and parted his lips to speak rapp didnt want to hear his lies he squeezed the trigger and sent a bullet into sharifs chest the turk grunted and clutched his chest with both hands rapp stood lifted his right arm again as if he were checking the time and squeezed the trigger three times in quick succession the bullets spat from the end of the silencer all three of them striking the arms dealer in the nose the hollowtipped rounds were designed to pancake on impact and triple in size a pink mist exploded from the back of sharifs head a good portion of the mans brain was now in the bushes behind the bench rapp flipped the safety into the up position and moved off down the path without even the slightest bit of remorse chapter langley virginia the counter terrorism center was tucked away in the basement of the old headquarters building at cia it was underfunded understaffed under decorated underground and pretty much isolated from all the major players in the building by both geography and attitude eight diligent souls worked there and that was counting an overworked administrative assistant and irene kennedy who was loosely attached to the group as an expert on all things arab and islamic kennedy had spent her youth moving from one diplomatic post to the next all of them in the middle east and all of them save one in arabicspeaking countries her father had diplomatic credentials but in fact worked for the cia kennedy was reviewing a particularly bad translation that had been kicked downstairs by someone on the intel side of the building the translation was so poorly done that kennedy finally sat back and looked at her colleague andrew swanson the tall blondhaired dartmouth grad was leaning against the wall of her cubicle tugging at his curly hair hed been up all night trying to make sense of the intercept you keep pulling your hair like that and youll go bald kennedy said without looking up swanson pulled his hand away and tried to stand still after a half minute he couldnt take it any longer and said the thing doesnt make any sense thats because the translation is wrong kennedy scratched a few more notes in the margin i knew it kennedy closed the folder and tapped it with her pen im going to need the tape swanson groaned in frustration shit she looked at the designation on the folder whats the problem its frickin nsa i see that ill be lucky if i get the tape before the fourth of july kennedy grabbed a postit note and wrote down a name and number she stuck it to the front of the folder and handed the whole thing back to swanson call kathy tell her i said she owes me and ask if she can messenger the tape over this afternoon and if she tells me to get in line like everyone else kennedys phone rang she looked at the small rectangular monochrome screen and saw that it was stansfields extension she wont i promise now run along and bug someone else i need to take this kennedy grabbed the handset and said good morning sir good morning would you please come upstairs theres something we need to discuss kennedy instantly recognized the touch of intensity in her bosss voice the average person would not have noticed but she knew him so well that she was instantly alert ill be right up she hung up her phone locked her desk and started for the door on the elevator ride up she reviewed the various operations that she was currently running or involved in there were fourteen active operations that she was associated with to one degree or another it could be any one of them or something entirely new she really hoped it wasnt anything new she didnt know if her marriage could take much more of her job she barely saw her husband as it was kennedy passed through stansfields outer office his assistant meg was on the phone and motioned for her to go in kennedy entered and closed the door behind her stansfield was standing at the map table behind his desk reviewing a document the corner office was devoid of any personal touch with the exception of a family portrait of his wife and kids that he kept on his desk and even that faced away from visitors as langleys top spy he was very cognizant of those who collected information and ferreted out secrets kennedy had done some digging three years earlier and came up with a long list of medals citations ribbons and awards that stansfield had received dating back to world war ii not a single one of them was displayed either here or at home thomas stansfield was an intensely private man please sit he said without turning around theres tea on the table help yourself kennedy went to the leather couch opened the bamboo box and selected a green tea after tearing open the package she dropped the bag in a cup and filled it with steaming hot water stansfield crossed the office a piece of paper in hand he sat in the chair to kennedys right slid the sheet of paper across the cherryinlaid coffee table and clasped his hands in front of him kennedy stopped dunking the tea bag and looked at the very top edge of the sheet as someone who was on the operations side of the business she was intimately familiar with what she was looking at it was a secure cable these sheets came in all day long from us embassies and consulates the world over they were sent using some of the most secure and classified encryption software mathematicians could design the designation across the top told her not only the sensitivity of the information but where it had originated this particular place of paper had come from the us consulate in istanbul kennedy swallowed hard as her eyes raced through the body of text hamdi sharif was dead gunned down in a park across the street from his house is my memory falling me stansfield said or was i misinformed about the operational timetable kennedy read the cable again and went over the dates in her head finally she looked up at her boss and said to the best of my knowledge stan and richards arent even in the country where are they greece stansfield sat back and ran his right hand over his blackandbluestriped tie where is rapp incountry he thought about that for a second when did he arrive yesterday afternoon youre sure she nodded he checked in last night and then again this morning his time or ours it would have been around midnight our time stansfield looked out the window for a moment and then removed his black glasses he set them on his lap and rubbed his eyes jumping to conclusions wouldnt do him any good anything of course was possible when it came to a character like sharif he had made more than a few enemies over the years but the notion that two separate camps had decided to go after him at the exact same time was a tough one to swallow before stansfield could say what was on his mind his office door burst open max powers the near east chief strolled in without offering an apology big news what now stansfield asked our favorite arms dealer is no longer with us out of the corner of his eye stansfield saw kennedy withdraw the secure cable and fold it in half which arms dealer would you be referring to sharif that fat turk powers said with a satisfied grin someone blew his head off in istanbul this morning his entire head kennedy asked taking the comment literally the back of it at least powers placed the palm of his right hand on the back of his head and tapped his bald spot several times i have a good source who works for turkish nio says someone plugged him up close one in the heart and theyre not sure how many in the face but more than one right here powers tapped the space at the top of his nose between his eyes tight grouping very professional blew the back of his head off nio was turkeys national intelligence organization do they have any idea who carried it out kennedy asked not a clue but the rumor mill is already working overtime candidates stansfield asked usual suspects jews frogs iranians iraqis syrians and us of course russians my guy said they were thick as thieves also said he got a call from your old friend at kgb you mean svr kennedy reminded him of the russian intelligence services new name yeah but he referred to them as kgb same assholes as before just a new name what did mikhail want stansfield asked referring to mikhail ivanov the deputy director of directorate s perhaps the most ruthless outfit in the espionage business not happy powers said with an emphatic shake of his head i guess he made some pretty heavy demands such as he wants to know who did it and he expects full cooperation said hes going to make life very hard for anyone who doesnt cooperate fully pushy bastard any witnesses kennedy asked not one powers said with a grin he looked at his watch the turks been dead for five hours it looks like it was professional five hours means the guy who pulled the trigger is long gone theyre screwed guy kennedy asked powers shrugged just my guess no offense but its pretty much an exclusively allmens club kennedy smiled to let him know she wasnt offended stansfield asked your source hes good great very dialed in loyalties to the almighty dollar but he prefers to do business with people he likes we can trust him keep me posted i want to know what mikhail is up to if he starts swinging his velvet hammer we might be able to win over a few more hearts in ankara good idea anything else ill have my gang put together a full workup for you thank you stansfield looked to the door letting powers know he wanted to get back to his meeting with kennedy as soon as the near east chief was gone kennedy was on her feet she made a beeline for stansfields desk and grabbed the handset of his secure phone she started punching in numbers pausing for prompts and then hitting more numbers after an interminable twenty seconds she accessed the voicemail kennedy listened intently to rapps brief coded message and then slowly hung up the phone stansfield twirled his glasses in his right hand and asked well kennedy nodded cleared her throat and said in near disbelief it was him chapter the handsome young man loosened his tie and nudged his beg toward the customs desk at john f kennedy airport he casually yet carefully studied the face of every officer who was checking passports and clearing people through customs he had a us passport and thus was spared the more stringent and crowded queues that were serving foreigners seeking to visit the united states he chose this particular line not because it looked like the fastest but because the officer manning it looked to be the oldest and most uninterested of the six currently on duty when it was his turn he stepped to the elevated desk and slid his passport across the cheap blue laminate surface the officer a fiftysomeyearold grayhaired man gave him a serious look and then glanced at the passport he was all business in a voice devoid of real interest he asked did you have a good trip mike the man gave a relaxed shrug and said business what do you do computer software workforce management stuff the man asked a few more standard questions before getting back to his second one workforce management whats that sorry scheduling software they tell me workforce management sounds more cutting edge the officer let out a small laugh while he applied the appropriate stamps he closed the passport slid it back across the surface and said have a nice day thanks you too the software salesman headed for the main door and a connection to one of the domestic terminals he was just another man in a blue suit white shirt and burgundy tie trying to earn a living other than the fact that he was tanned and fit there was nothing that made him stand out he found a stall in the mens room outside the delta ticketing desk he carefully pulled back the magnetized liner on his black travelpro carryon bag he deposited the passport for mike kruse along with a wallet stuffed with matching credit cards a maryland drivers license a bent and tattered uva college id and a brandnew blockbuster card he extracted a thin money clip with just one credit card a virginia drivers license and eight hundred dollars in cash after closing the suitcase he left the mens room and proceeded directly to the delta ticket counter where a very enthusiastic young woman with a southern accent asked how she could be of service id like to purchase a ticket on your next flight to dulles he placed his drivers license on the counter the woman was already pecking away at her keyboard she nodded at her screen and then looked at the license well mr rapp we have a flight that leaves in one hour and fortyeight minutes she went on to give rapp the time of arrival and cost of the ticket plus tax he simply smiled and slid four hundreddollar bills across the counter three minutes later he was on his way with his change and ticket hed spent the last three days traveling across europe pretending to be someone else he was relieved to be back on us soil but was not naive enough to think that his problems were over hed taken a roundabout way back to the flat after hed executed sharif and hed forced himself to run at a much slower pace than he was used to a man running a subfiveminute mile in any city of that size would look as if he were running away from something back at the flat rapp snapped on the latex gloves and wiped down and disassembled the beretta he placed the magazine slide and frame back in the worn leather suitcase along with the surveillance kit he locked the case and put it back in the armoire under the pillow and blankets the barrel and firing pin were tightly rolled up inside the running jacket and placed in a brown grocers bag the rest of the clothes that hed worn to the park including his shoes were placed in a second grocers bag rapp took a fast shower and put on his suit after taking two minutes to walk through the flat and make sure he wasnt missing anything he stuffed the two paper bags in his black duffel and attached the duffel to the top of his black wheeled carryon suitcase fortyone minutes after executing sharif rapp locked the apartment and headed for the tram the closest stop was three blocks away and rapp had two major decisions to make the first was to find the right place to dispose of the two brown bags and to do it quickly the second decision involved getting out of the country three different plans had been researched the first was to simply fly out of the country the second was to take the train and the third was to rent a car rapp did not like the car rental as an option unless it was to be used to drive to ankara eight hours away where he would leave it at the airport and grab a flight using the car to cross the border would create a different set of problems that he wanted to avoid it put a name in a system that the police could trace it would be a fake name of course but even the false identities that they had manufactured were to be protected heading straight for istanbuls airport would be the faster way out of the country but it would also involve standing in close proximity to a large number of police who he didnt think had a description of him but he couldnt be sure a half block from the tram stop he ducked into a bakery and purchased a coffee newspaper and breakfast roll he paid in liras and took the coffee black and in a togo cup outside he removed the lid blew on the hot coffee and watched a nearby public garbage can he had enough credits left on his tram card that he didnt need to worry about buying a new ticket the digital readout above the stop told him he had two minutes before the right tram arrived rapp put the lid back on his coffee and partially opened the black duffel bag he extracted the more damning of the two paper bags and stuffed it under his left arm the hum of the approaching tram caused everyone to look and that was when rapp moved he headed toward the flock of passengers who were waiting to board pausing for a split second near the garbage can he released the suitcase grabbed the bag and stuffed it in the big circular receptacle the tram stopped the throng moved forward in unison and ten seconds later they were all on their way to sirkeci station when they pulled into the grand old home of the orient express rapp searched the crowd for police officers who were showing unusual signs of alertness there were none to be seen which he took as a good omen he exited the train and went straight to the nearest kiosk rapp had the departure times for greece and bulgaria memorized and knew that the express trains for both countries left in the evening hanging around the busy transportation hub for the rest of the day just to grab an express train was foolish it was better to start working his way toward the border a train was leaving for alpullu in fifteen minutes rapp bought his ticket and made a quick stop at a bank of pay phones he punched in the long series of numbers and then in arabic left the coded message that would tell richards and hurley to not bother coming to istanbul then threading his way through the busiest part of the terminal he slid past a trash bin and got rid of the second paper bag that contained his running gear after that he found the right platform boarded his train and took his seat he pretended to read the newspaper while keeping a close eye on the platform when the train finally pulled out of the station rapp relaxed a touch with the comforting thought that he was putting distance between himself and the crime distance he had been taught by hurley was your greatest ally and your numberone objective after taking someone out as the train rolled through some of istanbuls less desirable neighborhoods he thought of hurley the man would lose it when he retrieved the message rapp spent the rest of the afternoon hopping westbound trains until he crossed the greek border at two in the afternoon the greeks and turks did not have good relations diplomatic or otherwise so for all intents and purposes he was safe he was sick of riding in trains and listening to other people yammer so he decided to rent a car it would be returned at the macedonia international airport in thessaloniki and as long as he didnt kill anyone in greece no one would care that an american by the name of mike kruse had rented a crappy little red fourcylinder flat rapp pointed the tin can south and headed for the coast as he neared the ocean he cracked the window and smelled salt air the landscape before him didnt look anything like the travel brochures hed thumbed through back at the rental agency the city of alexandroupolis lay before him an industrial fishing village with a few archeological sites of significance istanbul it was not it was gray and brown and dirty and dead and it didnt affect his mood one bit rapp was not the kind of person who allowed geography or climate to depress himas long as he didnt have to stay in one place too long he rolled through alexandroupolis just before sunset and continued up the coast for another fifteen kilometers until he found a small light blue seaside hotel it was off season so the place was not busy and the rate was cheap rapp wheeled his bag straight into the reception area which also doubled as the bar and dining room a heavyset older gentleman waved to rapp from behind the bar rapp walked over and the two of them worked out the details in broken english the proprietor then held up a bottle of liquor and asked rapp if he would like a drink rapp wondered for a brief second what hurley and richards were doing in athens and then decided that a drink was a great idea he ordered a beer the barkeep placed a bottle of mythos in front of him along with a full bottle of ouzo and two shot glasses he filled both glasses and slid one closer to rapp it was the beginning of a long night three beers and as many shots into the evening rapp looked at the house phone and considered calling hurley at his hotel he dismissed the idea as a bad one and ordered some dinner fortunately two college kids from england showed up and the bartender now had to divide his attention among the three of them four beers and a few more shots later rapp looked up and caught a reflection of himself in the mirror it was at that exact moment that he realized a killer was staring back at him he studied the reflection for a long moment and then held up a shot glass filled with ouzo he toasted the man in the mirror and went to bed he did not awaken until almost noon the next day chapter vienna virginia the world headquarters for international software logistics inc or isl was located in a new office park on kingsley road the campus as the developers called it consisted of five buildings they were all made of brown brick and reflective glass three of the buildings were strictly office space while the other two were a mix of office and industrial the developers were an llc out of the bahamas who had quietly set aside the southernmost building for software logistics it was at the far end of the office park and it backed up to a ravine nice and private the building had twentytwo thousand square feet of space the front quarter was built out with a reception area six offices a conference room an area for cubicles a break room and a bathroom the warehouse occupied the remainder of the space and for the most part sat vacant there were plans however to do some expansion stansfield looked at the building through the windshield of a dodge caravan and suppressed his concern these front companies were laborious to set up the llc he was part of had directed legitimate funds into the development of this piece of land the other owners were likeminded men of his era who had made millions and now in that final season of their lives were suddenly very concerned with where their country was headed all five of them had fought in world war ii under the command of wild bill donovan who ran the office of strategic services after the war they went on to have successful careers in defense politics finance and in stansfields case espionage he went to great lengths to make sure they were protected should the orion team ever be exposed but they all understood that if you were going to run an effective clandestine operation you actually had to lock horns with the enemy and possibly get your hands very dirty kennedy told him she could handle the meeting but he had his doubts it wasnt that he didnt think her capable while it was perfectly fine to send people off with messages words had a funny way of being interpreted differently by different people often in a way that gave them the outcome they were seeking and there was a very real chance that his old friend would steamroll her even so his desk was full and he did not want to go through the deceptions it would take to actually get to the meeting kennedy left his office and stansfield began to systematically move through the stacks on his desk and map table that required his close attention as the afternoon ticked away he periodically found himself staring out the window thinking about the new recruit there was something about this rapp fellow he hadnt seen any of his people this fired up about anything in a long time the kid was either a diamond in the rough or a disaster waiting to happen depending on who you listened to kennedy was possibly biased by the fact that he was her find and hurley was surly on a good day and an intolerable bastard on a bad day so it was hard to see who was right lewis was steady analytical and unfortunately had no desire to run things he had no doubt that kennedy was right for the job but she needed a few more years under her belt before she would be ready stansfield stewed over their personalities for a good five minutes and then decided he needed to go to the meeting the outcome was preordained hurley had never liked this rapp fellow and while kennedy and lewis were formidable hurley would wear them down with his bombastic stubborn ways and in truth it was his call as the person in charge of field ops he needed to be able to trust his men without question stansfield became stuck on the team concept for a second through all of the bickering and managing of egos they had lost sight of one very important factthe new recruit had not only succeeded but had done so on his own he arrived in istanbul and less than twentyfour hours later he had successfully removed a very nasty thorn in americas side there were a number of allies who would be cheering sharifs death as well and stansfield hoped that at least one of them would be blamed as much as stansfield would love to take the credit for the assassination of istanbuls merchant of death he couldnt the orion team needed complete anonymity or they risked investigation and exposure which would in short order render them useless that was why these new recruits could have no link whatsoever to langley but what was the sense of any of it if you didnt engage the enemy and make him bleed stansfield had to be cautious with his hopes though how much of this was wishful thinking he had yet to meet the young man who was to say this rapp fellow wasnt in reality an uncontrollable asset who would eventually blow up in his face lewis didnt think so and that was worth something but still stansfield realized he needed to meet this fellow and find out for himself what he was made of if he was as good as some of them were saying it would be a tragedy to throw him away stansfield asked his security detail to prepare for the vehicular version of a shell game langley kept a number of nondescript windowless vans in the motor pool for just this type of thing as the operations boss stansfield did not have to inform anyone of his needs his security detail only had to show up and take what was available the detail had access to extra license plates and a variety of magnetized decals to help facilitate the deception at sevenohfour they left the back service gate at langley in a white van with the red carpet linen service logo on the sides they headed for tysons corner and once inside the busy parking structure stansfield was moved to a ford taurus fifteen minutes later he found himself standing alone under a tree next to the main entrance of george mason university the dodge minivan was parked across the street stansfield waited for five minutes and then the vehicle flashed its brights after climbing into the backseat he handed joe head of his security detail a piece of paper with an address on it the driver memorized the address and handed the paper back to his boss he briefly consulted his road atlas and then put the car in drive five minutes later they were at the office park joe stansfield said leaning forward take us around back theres a call box and a code for the door when they reached the back of the building stansfield got out and punched in the code he trusted joe but the fewer people who had the numbers the tighter the circle remained stansfield motioned for joe to pull in and then pressed the big red button to close the door four cars and a motorcycle were already parked inside to the right shelves like the kind youd find in a library jutted out from the near wall they were filled with software titles that were legitimately being shipped overseas to the left were pallets and boxes and then a sea of darkness stansfield headed for the offices and asked joe to stay with the car there was a cipher lock on the door he punched in the fourdigit code leaned into the door and was immediately aware of loud shouts coming from just ahead stansfield frowned and wondered first and foremost why the conference room hadnt been soundproofed he also wondered why these supposed professionals were incapable of keeping their tempers in check as he stepped into the room he almost didnt notice the man sitting at the break table reading a magazine theyve been at it like that for almost an hour stansfield recognized the face instantly mr rapp i presume chapter rapp didnt know who the man was but there was something about him that instantly garnered respect the gray hair charcoal suit shiny wing tips discerning eyes and the fact that hed just walked unannounced into the secure building told him he was standing before someone who more than likely had an office on one of the top floors at langley after he gave him the onceover he couldnt help but think the man reminded him of a more slender version of spencer tracy rapp decided hed better stand he offered his hand and said yes and you are stansfield gave him a grandfatherly smile george rapp studied him with suspicion thats not your real name is it no stansfield said after a moment rapp said any chance youre the guy running this show stansfield gave him a relaxed smile when you get to my age you better be running something or its time to retire please sit he motioned with his right hand toward the chair rapp had been sitting in rapp returned to his seat stansfield smelled coffee and found a pot on the counter he helped himself would you like some no thanks after joining him at the break table stansfield blew on his coffee and said i hear youve been making waves again rapp wasnt sure how much he should say so he shrugged his shoulders and kept his mouth shut would you care to walk me through your decision what decision would that be why you decided to act on your own in istanbul rapps dark eyes narrowed he studied the old man for a few seconds he was in enough hot water for breaking their damn rules he wasnt about to break another im afraid i dont know what youre talking about stansfield grinned im afraid you do im at a bit of a disadvantage if youre who i think you are you know i cant discuss any of this with someone unless they give me the green light rapp jerked his head toward the conference room door good point you dont know me and thats for good reason but i know you rapp gave him a dubious look that changed into a humble one as the silverhaired man recited his life story including date of birth social security number parents names a long list of athletic accomplishments and his relative strengths and weaknesses it wasnt until the last part though that rapp began to feel vulnerable three days ago you used a mm beretta pistol to execute a man at pointblank range here and here stansfield touched his heart and then tapped the bridge of his dark glasses he looked at the door to the conference room and said you have one avid supporter another who thinks you have great potential and one very forceful detractor they are in there deciding your fate right now if you want to continue on your current career path i am more than likely your best hope so if you have anything youd like to say now is the time to do it that this man knew so many details about his life and was able to recite them chapter and verse without a single note told rapp all he needed to know you seem to have most of the facts he carefully turned the question back on george by saying im sure youve formed some opinions stansfield sat back and crossed his left left over his right im hearing conflicting stories that is why i decided to meet you in person what are the conflicting stories you appear to be a man who is possibly uniquely suited for this line of work you also appear to have a hard time following rules and that young man can be a dangerous thing rapp nodded it was becoming apparent that spencer tracys little brother really was the guy who ran this entire show which meant he needed to get him in his corner and do it before hurley sank him once and for all sir would i be totally off the mark if i guessed that at some point in your career you spent some time in the field stansfield grinned but did not answer the question and when you were in the field did things always go as planned stansfield saw instantly where he was headed theres a big difference between adapting and disregarding orders rapp nodded and was sullen for a split second that was exactly what hurley had screamed at him with a few colorful words thrown in to boot if doc lewis hadnt been there rapp was pretty certain they would have come to blows to be fair stansfield continued i use great caution when i evaluate a decision that someone has made while operating in a highstress environment the mans choice of words gave rapp pause he considered them carefully and then said highstress yes im not sure id call it highstress sir stansfields eyes sparkled with amusement you snuck into a foreign country using a false identity killed a man at close range and then made it out of the country all on your own you didnt find any of that stressful the gettingout part maybe a little but really only getting out of istanbul after that the odds of getting caught were pretty low why did you decide to act on your own i didnt go to istanbul thinking that i would handle the job on my own it happened it evolved i saw the opportunity and i took it what do you mean you saw the opportunity stansfield was keenly interested in the young mans next words i read the surveillance briefing that the brits gave us stansfield held up his hand and stopped him who told you the brits gave us that report no one then why did you say the brits gave it to us rapp shrugged as if to say it was obvious i could tell by the way it was written stansfield nodded for him to continue and made a mental note to revisit the subject later i read the report and there it was it jumped right off the page there what was the opportunity the report said that the target took his dog to the park every morning he sat on a park bench and talked on his cell phone while he threw a ball to his little dog rapp turned his palms up and said how does it get any easier than that no bodyguards to deal with no drivers or armorplated cars no security cameras very few witnesses and the few who are around are busy living their own lives and it didnt occur to you to pass this information on to stan it did but it also seemed like it was too good to pass up if youd brought it to stan you wouldnt have been passing it up youre not serious completely if i had brought my idea to stan he would have called me a moron and told me to shut my mouth the young recruit was probably right stan is very good at this type of thing this is not his first dance so ive been told rapp said unimpressed you have some problems with hurley i hear who doesnt the point was more accurate than not still he has a lengthy resume im sure he does but the entire thing was more complicated than it needed to be the whole idea here is that we are supposed to get in get it done and get out without anyone noticing we were there if wed stuck with stans plan we would have followed the guy around for five days and come to the same conclusion that was right there in the brit report and our odds of screwing up somewhere being noticed would have increased fivefold at least he was probably right but stansfield didnt tell him so he would have to deal with hurley later when did you read the report when i got to the safe house that first night yes and you decided that night that you would handle it on your own no i saw the possibility that was all and when you decided to go to the park armed the next morning i thought there was a chance i wanted to see with my own eyes and then decide but when you left the safe house you were prepared to kill him if the opportunity presented itself rapp hesitated and then admitted the truth yes stansfield took a sip of the coffee and slowly set the mug on the table any other reason why you chose to act on your own how do you mean stansfield gave him a knowing grin i was your age once a long time ago i was asked to do certain things for my country and until i actually did them i wasnt sure i had it in me rapp looked down and studied the pattern in the grayandblack carpeting it was not in his character to be this open with someone hed just met especially on a subject like this but there was something about this guy that made it difficult to be anything but forthright i wanted to kill him he finally said revenge rapp shrugged his shoulders in a noncommittal way remember we recruited you for a reason i know what you went through i know how you were affected by pan am lockerbie revenge justice i dont know i just know when i left for the park that morning i wasnt sure and then as soon as i laid eyes on him i wanted to kill the bastard i was sick of all the planning and talking it made no sense that it had to be so complicated stansfield took off his glasses and looked at rapp with his grayblue eyes any other reason that may have pushed you over the edge rapp looked at the carpeting again he hadnt even admitted the next part to himself at least not fully without looking up he said in a soft voice i was afraid i wouldnt have the guts to do it with the understanding of someone who had walked the same path stansfield gave him a sympathetic nod it had been a long time since stansfield had killed a man but he remembered the doubt that gnawed at him until he pulled that trigger for the first time how do you feel now how do you mean now that you have taken a human life rapp gave a nervous laugh and checked his watch do you have a few hours you know laughter is often a defense mechanism used to deflect rapp thought of doc lewis ive heard that somewhere else recently this isnt a good time to deflect rapp noticed the concern on the old mans lined face he fidgeted with his hands and then said this isnt exactly a topic im used to discussing no youre right about that stansfield himself had never spoken to a soul about the men he had killed it simply wasnt his way there were others though whom he had worked with over the years who were quite different in that regard some spoke with an intensity that was more academic as if they were simply trying to perfect their craft for the sake of perfection others took a more lighthearted or twisted approach to their playbyplay analysis of how they had killed a man the best ones stansfield had always felt were the ones who kept it to themselves this is very important stansfield said how are you up here the old man tapped his temple i think im fine no problem sleeping no in fact ive slept better than i have in years good i want you to understand something very important hamdi sharif chose to get into the arms business and he knowingly sold weapons to terrorist groups that were going to use those weapons to kill innocent civilians i know i am every bit as responsible as you for his death rapp frowned and gave him a look that said he wasnt quite buying it stansfield had expected that who do you think sent you on that operation i dont know i did i was the judge and the jury you were merely the executioner never forget that he spoke with intensity for the first time in the entire conversation he was almost pleading for rapp to grasp the gravity of what he was saying finally rapp nodded even though he wasnt sure he fully grasped the mans meaning stansfield stood and said why dont you go home now what about their decision dont worry ill smooth things out just try not to cause any problems for the next few months chapter thank god lewis announced upon seeing stansfield enter the room i cant spend another minute trying to talk sense into these two with pure disappointment stansfield glared down the length of the table first at hurley who was on the left and then at kennedy who was directly across from him they were both on their feet sit he commanded kennedy sat hurley remained standing the first person who raises his voice is being sent to yemen for the rest of his career you cant send me anywhere hurley snarled stansfield directed his full attention to hurley and communicated his resolve with an icy stare that silently communicated the fact that he could do a lot worse than sending his ungrateful ass to yemen of the three hurley was the only one who had seen this look before it had been nearly three decades ago but hurley still remembered that his stupidity had almost cost him his life and if it hadnt been for stansfields magnanimous attitude he would have died that day hurley slowly sank to his seat have i failed you two so poorly that it has come to this stansfield said in a calm but disappointed voice you scream at each other like children trying to bully their way to victory he cocked his head in kennedys direction i expect far more from you what did i tell you about losing control of your emotions that its a weakness correct and how has it worked for you this evening screaming at one of the most hotheaded men in all of our nations capital did your logic become more clear did your points carry more weight did you somehow persuade him to see things your way by shrieking at him like some wild banshee kennedy shook her head her embarrassment complete stansfield turned his icy gaze on hurley and you are you happy that you have succeeded in getting young irene to finally sink to your depths thats bullshit shes a grown woman she can fight her own battles i resent the fact that every time she doesnt like what im doing she goes running to you hurley pointed at him you know the rules as well as i do im in charge in the field what i say goes im god and that toosmartforhisowngood college punk wandered so far off the reservation hes lucky i dont put a bullet in his head thats our litmus test these days when an operator doesnt follow orders to the letter we put a bullet in his head you know what i mean he went way beyond his operational parameters he basically threw them out and flew off the handle and succeeded lets not forget that part shit hurley scoffed at the point even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a blue moon this is how you would like to argue with me by mixing squirrel and moon metaphors you know im right you are partially right and you have also become an intolerable bully whom im not so sure i can keep around say the word and ill resign im sick of this bullshit and then what will you do stan the deputy director of operations leaned over and placed his hands on the table become a fullblown alcoholic another bitter discarded spy who closes himself off from an ungrateful citizenry youre already halfway there you drink too much you smoke too much you piss and moan like some miserable woman whos mad at her husband because shes no longer young and beautiful and theres the meat of the problem isnt it stan whats the meat of the problem i think you may have heard this before he reminds you of yourself who the college puke stansfield nodded slowly and he might be better than you thats what really scares you thats bullshit stansfield should have seen it sooner he stood up abruptly and said so your recommendation is that i cut him loose absolutely hes too much of a loose cannon sooner or later hes going to cause you a lot of problems and who do you have to replace him hurley waffled a couple of decent candidates stansfield looked to lewis who was at the head of the table doctor lewis shook his head neither of them have his skill set even if we worked with them for a year i dont think they could match him thats not true hurley said while looking as if hed just taken a bite out of a lemon irene stansfield asked she didnt speak just shook her head stansfield pondered the situation for a moment and then said here is my problem we are flying blind in lebanon and syria the director and the president overruled me and sent cummins in to negotiate for the release of that texas businessman stansfield stopped speaking for a second he couldnt get over the stupidity of that decision and all of the damage that had been done after cummins himself had been taken hostage our assets have been getting picked off one by one for the past six months our network that we worked so carefully to rebuild is now in shambles this situation has to be turned around and i need men in the field to do it i need shooters on the ground weve all spent enough time over there to know that weakness breeds contempt that stops today i want these guys looking over their shoulders wondering if theyre next i want the leadership of islamic jihad and hezbollah afraid to pop their heads out of their holes for fear that they might get those heads blown off i want them on notice that if theyre going to grab one of our assets who is negotiating in good faith and torture him for months on end dammit we are going to come after them like crazed sons of bitches he turned his attention back to hurley i dont want to lose you but i need this kid hes too good to just throw away he knows how to take the initiative initiative thats what you want to call it oh for christs sake stan could you please get hold of your ego and hypocrisy and listen to me this is bigger than you we have a gaping hole in our operational abilities a big nasty neighborhood in the middle east that is breeding terrorists like rabbits and we have nothing i need to get back in there youre calling me a hypocrite you have an extremely convenient shortterm memory tell me stan how many times in your first two years did you get yourself into trouble by ignoring orders or running off and launching your own operations it was a different time back then we were given far more latitude and you still got in trouble stansfield shook his head as if trying to reconcile an irreconcilable thought does the truth matter to you at all or do you just want to go round and round all night until you wear everyone down you dont remember all the times i had to go to bat for you and bail your ungrateful butt out of trouble and now youre coming down on this new kid as if you were some saint hurley started to speak but stansfield cut him off im not done if the kid had screwed up we wouldnt be having this conversation hed be gone but he didnt screw up did he he made all the right decisions he took care of our problem and didnt leave a speck of evidence and made it back here all on his own hes a natural and you want to throw him away hurley stubbornly shook his head stansfield was done arguing with him irene he said turning his attention to kennedy what about running him on his own break him off from the team let stan and richards work together hurley didnt hear kennedys answer because he was too busy reliving all the various times hed landed in hot water with a station chief or someone back at langley there were too many to even begin counting that was part of the reason why stansfield and charlie white had set him up as a freelancer almost twenty years ago hed worn out his welcome at every embassy from helsinki to pretoria simply put he wasnt good at following rules so white and stansfield had removed him from the system they had gone to bat for him against leslie peterson that ivy league prick who wanted to gut the clandestine service and replace it with satellites he liked to say satellites dont get caught breaking into embassies yeah well satellites cant seduce an ambassadors secretary into working for the cia or kill a man at least not yet anyway hurley grudgingly saw the plain truththat he was an ingrate i can work with him hurley announced and if i cant ill turn him back over to irene and she can run him stansfield was speechless for a moment kennedy and lewis were thunderstruck dont look so surprised hurley grumbled no one hates these fuckers more than i do chapter moscow russia sayyed stood just inside the glass doors he looked through the frosted window as a gust of wind whipped up a cloud of dirty snow it moved like a ghost through the dark night and caused a shiver to run up his already frigid backside he did not like moscow had never liked moscow and would never like moscow not in summer and definitely not in winter his warm mediterranean blood found it to be perhaps the most inhospitable place he had ever visited he could practically feel his skin cracking with voyeuristic awe he watched an abnormally round woman waddle by she was wrapped from head to toe in the dark fur of some animal he couldnt quite pinpoint why did these people live here he would endure a hundred civil wars if he could avoid ever coming here again a vehicle entered his field of vision from the left the handler reached out and touched his elbow he gestured to the waiting suv and grunted the way big russian men do sayyed was fairly certain hed smelled vodka on the mans breath when hed met him at the gate that was another thing about these russians they all drank too much sayyed was not the kind of muslim who ran around telling everyone what they could or couldnt do he enjoyed a glass of wine from time to time but never in excess they would want him to drink tonight he knew it he didnt want to drink and he didnt want to go outside but he had no choice he had been summoned and his bosses in damascus had eagerly offered him up with great effort he clutched his long black coat around his neck and stepped into the cold moscow night the bite of the cold wind snatched at his ears and cheeks his eyes filled with tears and he could have sworn the hair in his nose had turned to icicles in under a second he opened his mouth narrowly to catch a breath but his teeth ached from the subzero temperature so he lowered his head and shuffled toward the car hed learned that the hard way on the last trip you never ran on a moscow sidewalk in winter no matter how cold it was you shuffled half skating half walking it wasnt until he was in the backseat that he realized he was sitting in a brand new range rover apparently capitalism had been very good to the svr the kgbs bastard offspring the man who had fetched him from the gate tossed sayyeds suitcase in back and jumped in the front passenger seat i take it you dont like the cold a voice asked in decent yet accented english sayyed had his head shoved so far down into his jacket that he hadnt noticed the diminutive man sitting next to him how do you people live here the man smiled popped a shiny cigarette case and offered one to his guest sayyed grabbed one anything that would provide a scintilla of warmth was to be taken advantage of after hed taken a few long drags and had stopped shivering sayyed sat back and said i do not think we have met before no we have not i am nikolai shvets sayyed offered his hand i am assef i know the boyishlooking man replied with a smile i take it you work for mikhail yes the deputy director is a very busy man he will be joining us later that was fine by sayyed mikhail ivanov the deputy director of directorate s was not someone he looked forward to dealing with sayyed had done everything in his power to get out of the trip and then to delay it when he was told he had no choice two days ago ivanov had called his boss at the general security directorate in damascus and told general hammoud he would consider it a personal insult if assef sayyed was not in moscow by weeks end the last the general had heard the meeting had already been scheduled he was not a happy man and he made sure sayyed understood just how unhappy he was the deputy director is very much looking forward to speaking with you he has been talking about it for some time sayyed couldnt pretend happiness over seeing the old spider so he said its too bad you did not travel to damascus it is very nice there this time of year i would imagine the man glanced over his shoulder and looked out the back window your mediterranean blood is too thin for our moscow winters the boy man made idle conversation as they worked their way around one of the ring roads that circled the big metropolis sayyed barely glanced out the window even though it was his habit to be constantly alert for surveillance it wouldnt matter in this iceberg of a city at this time of night street lights and headlights were amplified by the white snow blinding him every time he tried to see where they were this truly was a miserable place no wonder communism had failed how could any form of government succeed if everyone was depressed they finally stopped in front of a hotel in the heart of old moscow a doorman in a massive black fur hat and red wool coat with two rows of shiny brass buttons yanked open the door and sayyed felt a blast of cold air hit his ankles with a second doorman shuffling along with him he walked through the front door of the hotel and did not stop cold air was still whistling through the doors and he wanted to get as far away from it as possible eight steps into the lobby he found himself drawn in the direction of heat and then finally spied a roaring fire on the far side of the lobby he actually smiled and shuffled over his brain not realizing the lobby was ice free what do you think sayyed parked his backside directly in front of the flames he took in the opulent lobby and nodded it was much nicer than the dump he had stayed in the last time he was here very nice it has just reopened it is hotel baltschug very historic very expensive shvets left out the fact that his boss owned a piece of the hotel he owned a piece of most things in moscow these days at least the nice things a group of russian austrian and swiss businessmen had purchased the hotel just after the collapse and had tried to renovate after a year of getting turned down for permits and dealing with theft and workers not showing up one of the russians went to ivanov for help the problems disappeared almost overnight all they had to do in return was sign over percent of the hotel sayyed did not want to leave the fire but he had to get ready for dinner he was finally convinced to move when they informed him that his room had two fireplaces that were both lit and waiting for him the room was as nice as the lobby with gilded plaster and handpainted murals on the ceiling tapestries on the walls and a commanding view of the kremlin and red square it was fit for a pasha that was when it hit him ivanov the spider never did anything nice unless he wanted something in return and he was being extremely nice sayyed took a steaminghot shower and wondered what the man was after hed heard stories lately that the svr was worse than the kgb that once they sank their talons into you they owned you for the rest of your life he suddenly longed for the bombedout rubble of beirut there he was a lion here he could end up being someones lunch chapter sayyed had just one wool suit it was black and was worn for special occasions he was wearing it tonight because it was his warmest suit and also because to a man like ivanov appearances were exceedingly important he lectured his people about taking care of themselves and was known for firing people who put on too much weight or women who wore too much or too little makeup sayyed had carefully trimmed his beard and slicked his black hair back behind his ears at forty he was still in decent shape or at least he wasnt out of shape the black suit and white shirt and tie helped hide those few extra pounds hed put on over the last couple of years as he walked toward the restaurant he immediately picked out the men from ivanovs security detail there were four in the lobby one by the front door one by the elevators and two bracketing the entrance to the restaurant the boy man suddenly appeared from behind a large plant his cigarette was hanging from the side of his mouth and he was smiling sayyed had been in such a rush to avoid the cold earlier that he had failed to notice that nikolai was extremely handsome more pretty really in kind of a movie star way there were none of the usual rough edges that were standard with the lackeys in the russian state security services his skin was fair his eyes a greenish blue and his hair a light enough brown that he would probably be blond if he lived in a warmer climate your room is nice yes shvets asked very shvets popped his cigarette case with one hand and offered one to his guest sayyed took one as well as a light director ivanov is waiting for you at your table i hope you are hungry yes very much so it is the cold weather please follow me the restaurant was decorated in deep reds and sparkling golds most of it in velvet it was typical russian heavyhanded and desperate to impress this backwater behemoth knew nothing of understated class sayyed was no snob but he was proud of where he came from the ottoman empire had lasted for more than six hundred years after fewer than one hundred years these brutes had gone from one of two superpowers to a mob state a haze of bluegray smoke hung in the air every table was occupied there were easily several hundred people in the restaurant and they all appeared to be in various states of inebriation it occurred to sayyed for the first time that the russians were loud people especially when they laughed sayyed didnt recognize any faces but he guessed they were all very important that was the russian way even during the height of the great workers paradise the ruling elite had lived an opulent life separate from the workers they enjoyed luxuries that the little people never dreamed of two towering men stood watch near a booth in the back corner red velvet curtains were pulled open and fastened with tasseled ropes to marble columns sayyed glimpsed ivanov sitting between two young beauties the man was nearing sixty and was showing no signs of slowing down he was a consumer of all things that interested him in a way he was the perfect man to run an intelligence service assuming his interests were in line with those of the state sayyed had been told that ivanovs power had grown significantly in recent years in the days of the politburo the black market was tolerated but never flaunted during the transfer from centrally controlled markets and government plans to pseudocapitalism no one was better positioned to take advantage of the new wealth than the men at the kgb they had the guns the enforcers and the spycraft to break blackmail or frame any man who did not welcome them to the buffet and ivanov had an insatiable appetite ivanov saw him coming and yelled his name he tried to stand but was stuck between the two girls so he gave up and sat back down assef it is good to see you the russian threw out a large hand with rings on the forefinger and pinky and you too mikhail sayyed lied he reached across the table and clasped ivanovs hand if you had turned me down one more time i was going to send my men after you ivanov said with a hearty laugh although his eyes werent smiling sayyed laughed and tried to play along the comment was without a doubt meant for him to remember and keep remembering every time ivanov called on him sayyed so badly wanted this evening to end and it had only just begun ivanov ordered an expensive bottle of bordeaux and introduced sayyed to the girls the blonde one was alisa and the redhead was svetlana the redhead was suddenly very interested in the spy from syria that was how ivanov had introduced himas a spy of all things the russians might have found the moniker intriguing but to sayyed it was an insult one of many he was sure he would be forced to endure on this cold winter evening more wine was ordered along with plate after plate of food sayyed was full by the time the main course was served ivanov steered the conversation away from anything serious and svetlana steered her hands toward sayyeds groin sayyed had no illusions about his ability to woo women he was handsome enough but not enough to garner the attention of a twentyyearold runway model ivanov had undoubtedly ordered her to take care of him sayyed wondered if she would be beaten after he turned her down when the plates were cleared ivanov nudged alisa out of the booth and ordered svetlana to follow he told the girls to go to the bar and order dessert as they walked away he slapped each girl on the ass they turned around one giving him a dirty look the other pouting ivanov laughed at them and watched them hold hands all the way to the bar and then as if a switch had been flicked he turned all business after whispering something in one of his bodyguards ears he plopped back into the booth and moved around so that he was sitting a mere foot from sayyed the drapes were pulled shut and they were alone you have been avoiding me hed said it with a crooked smile but that menacing glint in his eye was back sayyed deflected by saying i do not enjoy travel and the cold weather is something my body is not used to i meant no offense ah i know what you mean in the summer i find damascus to be unbearable but dont worry i wasnt offended ivanov said lying to himself more than sayyed i just wish it hadnt taken this long we have many important things to discuss yes i know sayyed said trying to be agreeable ivanov took a gulp of wine and asked how long have we known each other a long time sayyed said looking into his own glass twelve years i think thirteen actually and we have fucked with the americans like no one else ivanov made a fist and shook it every time they have tried to stick their nose in your business we have sent them running away like a scared dog that is true sayyed said making no mention of all the times the russians had stuck their long snouts into his business and now they are back again sayyed was still looking at the expensive french wine in his glass he could feel ivanov watching him with intensity he shrugged and said not really that is not what i have heard what have you heard i have heard you captured one of langleys deep cover operatives sayyeds mind was swimming with thoughts of murder the idiots in damascus no doubt had passed the information to the russian did anyone in his government know how to keep a secret knowing he was trapped he said we caught one of them snooping around im not sure he was an agent of any particular importance ivanov smiled i think you are being modest sayyed didnt know how to answer so he took a drink of wine i am told this man worked in their directorate of operations that he reported directly to deputy director stansfield that he worked in berlin and moscow for a time someone in damascus really did have a big mouth as you know from experience these men are trained to lie i cannot say with any certainty that his claims are truthful they usually try to understate their importance not overstate it that was true the important thing is that we have bloodied them yet again and as you know they do not have the stomach for this kind of thing ivanov gave him a dubious look im not so sure these days sayyed was do not worry yourself with such little fish this might be a bigger fish than you think ivanov said with a hint of inside knowledge what have you heard things rumors here and there nothing concrete but ive been in this business long enough to smell a rat what things hamdi sharif sayyed thought of the recently deceased arms dealer yes i knew him well who do you think killed him sayyed had heard two rumors mossad more than likely but there was something else i picked up what sayyed was not afraid to repeat the rumor a man like ivanov would take it as a compliment that he was stealing from you and you had him killed ivanov looked at him with unblinking focus but did not respond if that was the case sayyed said then that was your right ivanov shook his head if he was stealing from me i would have known and i would have killed him but he was not stealing from me so it was the jews no i dont think so who then ivanov sat brooding for a half minute and finally said i would like to speak to the american rat you are keeping in that basement in beirut he had not told a soul in damascus where he was keeping the cia man which meant either that ivanov had obtained the information from one of sayyeds supposed allies or that it was a good guess whichever was the case he would need to move the american as soon as he got back you are more than welcome to speak to him you are welcome in beirut any time you know that ivanov began shaking his head at the mention of beirut i cannot there are far too many things happening here in moscow things that need my urgent attention sayyed tried to deflect by saying so you think the americans are trying to get back in the game i dont think so i know so sayyed looked skeptical how because thomas stansfield is finally in charge of their clandestine activities you think one man is capable of turning that mess around they dont have the stomach to get back into lebanon this man i caught ivanov pounded his fist on the table cutting him off let me tell you something about thomas stansfield i had to go up against him early in my career the man plots on more levels than you or i are capable of comprehending he is a master of deception operations he gets you running around like a dog chasing your tail ivanov circled his hand around his wine glass faster and faster you become obsessed with traitors in your midst and you forget to do your job you see shadows everywhere you turn and you become completely defensive and that is just one facet of the man there is another side where he is more russian than american sayyed had no idea what he meant more russian than american he is the last of a breed of americans who knew how to be every bit as dirty as the dirtiest enemy dont let his grandfatherly image deceive you the man is a street fighter with a big set of russian balls sayyed wasnt sure why the mans balls were russian beyond that he thought ivanov was overreacting the americans havent bitten back in years sayyed scoffed i know and that was because we had the cia in a box and stansfield didnt have the power but he is in charge of their clandestine service now and im telling you he is going to stick his nose in our business and we cant allow that to happen trust me if he gets so much as a toehold we will be in for the fight of our lives sayyed still wasnt convinced ivanov leaned forward then grabbed the syrians hand i am asking you this one time i will only ask it once will you give me the american so i can find out what he knows i know your iranian friends want him but i will make sure you are compensated this was why sayyed did not want to come to this godless frozen city there was nothing in it for him especially since he was not done dissecting the mind of agent john cummins unfortunately there was no way out if he did not bend to ivanovs wishes he might not make it out of the country in one piece with a heavy sigh he told ivanov that he could have the american chapter hamburg germany the hamburg operation was significant for a number of reasons not the least of which was that certain people began to take notice a single murder can be an accident or an aberration two murders in as many weeks separated by time but connected by relationships is a tough one to swallow for people whose job it is to be paranoid the second reason it was significant was that rapp finally realized stan hurley was extremely good at what he did hurley had given them five days to get their affairs in order they were going on the road and would not be coming back to the states for several months the old clandestine officer announced with a gleam in his eye weve been kicked out of the office by management they dont want to see us back in washington until we have some results to show for all the money and time thats been spent on your sorry asses rapp was not given all the details but he got the distinct impression that langley was upset about something hurleys attitude had changed even before they left the states they were to engage the enemy and make them bleed and the prospect of finally getting back in the game had transformed hurley this time rapp and richards went in together or at least their flights arrived the same afternoon rapp arrived second he saw richards waiting for him on the other side of customs rapp was carrying an american passport on this trip and he handed it to a nicelooking older gentleman who flipped through the pages with german efficiency the backpack jeans and beatup wool coat must have been enough to tell the man he was not here on business because he didnt ask that standard question business or pleasure he applied the proper stamps and slid the passport back not a glance or a question rapp laughed to himself if only it was always this easy the two men shook hands and made their way to ground transportation where they took a cab to the harbor promenade or landungsbrücken as it was known to the locals a big cruise ship was coming into port tourists lined the sidewalk gawking at the massive ship that looked completely out of place so close to all the old brick buildings rapp and richards did not gawk they were on the move toward the warehouse district where hurley was waiting for them they passed a prostitute working the riverfront richards turned to rapp and said isnt this where the beatles got their start rapp cracked a small smile he liked richards the guy was quirky in a normal way they were in hamburg to kill a man and richards wanted to talk about the beatles never heard that rapp said pretty sure they did they played some strip club for something like two months straight rapp didnt say anything id like to see it while were here rapp cocked his head and gave richards a long look before couldnt help himself and started laughing what richards asked rapp lowered his voice and said were here to kill a man and you want to go hang out at some strip club where the beatles played thirty years ago whats wrong with that that we do what we do for living doesnt mean we cant do what normal people do richards had a much easier time transitioning between their two worlds you have a point i cant wait to see the look on stans face when you ask him ha you watch if it involves booze and strippers my bet is hes all in youre probably right the flat was located in one of the hundredyearold warehouses that had been converted into condominiums near the river it was damp and cold a lot like london hurley informed them that the majority of the units in the building were as yet unsold the one they were using was owned by an american company that had purchased it as an executive apartment rapp didnt concern himself with certain details beyond the target but richards was more curious he tried to find out which american company the unit belonged to and if it was a former spook who let them use it hurley said if there was something he needed to know hed tell him otherwise dont worry about it rapp and hurley hadnt exactly made peace it was more of a truce after the night hed met george or whatever his real name was rapp richards and hurley had gone back down to the lake house to begin prepping for the hamburg operation hurley from time to time still looked at rapp as if he were mentally retarded but he had cut back on his yelling and cussing rapp took this as a sign of détente after five days hurley asked rapp to take a walk have you gone over the last op in your head you mean istanbul how many ops have you been on hurley asked him with a wakeup expression on his face sorry rapp said yeah ive thought about it anything you would have done different rapp stared at the ground while they walked im not sure i know what you mean the fact that you acted on your own is behind us i already told you that part of my job is make sure you get better what im asking you is a tactical question when you look back on what happened in the park that morning once you decided to kill him is there anything that you would have done different i dont know rapp answered honestly it all just kind of happened hurley nodded having been there before thats good and bad kid it might be that youre a natural at this ice in your veins that kind of shit or you got lucky only time will tell but theres one thing you did that jumps out as being pretty stupid whats that rapp asked hurley had his full attention i read the police report rapp didnt know why he was surprised but he was the shot to the heart it was pointblank literally the report was conclusive the muzzle of the weapon was in direct contact with sharifs coat rapp nodded he was there he remembered it well why would you do that because i wanted to kill him hurley stopped and faced him kid ive seen you shoot youre not as good as me but youre damn good and you keep getting better you dont think you could have popped him from say ten feet rapp didnt answer why did you sit down next to him im not sure bullshit hurley said with a smile you allowed it to get personal didnt you rapp thought back to that morning not even a week ago the feeling came back that splitsecond decision to sit next to sharif so he could look into his eyes he slowly nodded yeah i guess i did hurleys jaw tightened while he processed the admission im not going to stand here and tell you there havent been times times that i took a certain amount of joy in sending some of these scumbags to paradise but you have to be really careful pick the right environment never in public like you did he could have had a gun somebody could have seen you sitting next to him a lot of things could have gone wrong i know remember in public the key is to look natural thats why i showed you the shoulder holster technique thats why we practice it you look at your watch and no one thinks twice about it youre a guy checking the time you sit down on a park bench that close to another guy and someone might notice just enough to cause him to look twice and thats all it might take the next thing you know the carabinieri are chasing you down the street shooting at you hurley gave him a deadserious look trust me ive been there hurley shuddered at the memory what rapp asked you ever been to venice yeah the canals hurley made a diving motion with his hands you dove into one of those canals rapp asked while recalling their putrid shade of green and this was thirty years ago theyre a lot cleaner now than they were back then the condo was raw exposed brick with heavy timber beams secured to each other by sturdy iron brackets with big bolts the floors were wide plank more than likely pine stained light to add a little brightness in contrast to the dark mudred bricks the furniture was utilitarian grays and blues wood and metal frames long sleek lines and the kind of fabrics that could be cleaned pure bachelor efficiency it was a corner unit so it had two small balconies one off the master bedroom and another off the living room there was a second bedroom and a loft space with a desk and pullout couch when they arrived hurley had everything prepared the diningroom table was covered with a sheet hurley carefully pulled it back to reveal what hed pieced together in three short days the target was a banker by the name of hans dorfman he looked innocent enough but then again to rapp most bankers did dorfmans crime as hurley stated it was that hed decided to get into bed with the wrong people youre probably wondering hurley asked why a welleducated man who was raised a christian would decide to help a bunch of islamic whack jobs wage terrorism richards looked down at a blackandwhite photo of the sixtythreeyearold banker and said yep well officially its none of your goddamn business when were given an assignment its not our place to question right both rapp and richards gave halfhearted nods wrong hurley said i dont care what anyone tells you hq can fuck up and they can fuck up bigtime beyond that youll run into the occasional yahoo who doesnt have a clue how things work in the real world when you get a kill assignment youd better question it and youd better be damn careful we dont do collateral damage women and children are strictly off limits rapp had heard this countless times from hurley and the other instructors but people make mistakes they do he agreed and the more difficult the job the greater the chance that youll make a mistake but if you want to make it out of this one day with your soul intact follow my advice on this question the assignments they give you were not blindor robots richards was still looking at the photo of the banker stan are you trying to tell us this guy isnt guilty this guy hurley waved his right hand from one side of the table to the other hell no this nazi piece of shit is guilty as hell in fact guys like this piss me off more than the ones who shoot back this prick lives in his fancy house takes two months off every year goes to the nicest places and sleeps like a fucking baby every night he thinks its no big deal that he helps these scumbags move their money around no he shook his head this is one of those times when i will enjoy pulling the trigger chapter hurley explained to them that the process wasnt so much about finding the best option as it was eliminating the bad ones that is if you had the time to go through all the alternatives after two days together hurley made the decision and they both agreed sunday night was the perfect time to make their move and it would happen at the house it was located thirtyfive minutes outside of hamburg a nice wooded oneacre lot rapp was pretty sure hurley had known from the getgo that this would be the appointed hour but he wanted some push back he wanted rapp and richards to tear into his plans and make sure there wasnt a better time to go after dorfman for two days thats pretty much all rapp and richards did for rapp one of the more enlightening exchanges happened when he asked the salty hurley what about the dogs dogs hurley said with a devilish smile are a doubleedged sword take this fuck stick for example hurley pointed to dorfmans blackandwhite photograph hurley had taken a black marker and drawn a hitler mustache on him the night before hes an anal retentive nazi prick if ive ever seen one wants complete order in his life so he gets two poodles why he looked at rapp and richards because they dont shed richards answered exactly hans is a neat freak wants everything just so wakes up the same time monday through friday and saturdays and sundays he allows himself one extra hour of sack time he thinks hes too smart for the religion his parents raised him on so on sundays instead of going to church he reads two or three newspapers studies his value lines or whatever it is that a german banker studies and he takes his dogs for a walk along the river and comes back and takes a nap he has pot roast mashed potatoes and green beans for dinner watches some crappy tv on the couch and then lets the dogs out one last time at ten oclock and then its lights out richards looked at the surveillance info how do you know all these details i dont see any of it here hurley smiled this isnt my first banker rapp set that thought aside for a second and asked but what about the dogs oh yeah the dogs the dogs run the show they need to be let out four times a day every morning at seven on the dot a couple more times during the day and then one more time before they turn in what does he have to do every time before he lets them out turn the alarm off rapp answered you two see any alarms at the lake house no rapp answered thats because they can make you lazy you ever see me lock my hounds up no what good does a dog do you if hes locked in his kennel if hes a guard dog not much thats right hurley looked at rapp and said i bet i can guess your next question you think we should take him while hes walking the dogs by the river the thought occurred to me theres three reasons why i would prefer to avoid that option the first is that its harder to control things in a public setting not to say we couldnt do it we might get lucky and have no witnesses like you did in istanbul but that cant be guaranteed but two and three are why the park wont work i need to talk to him and a public park is hardly the place for the kind of conversation were going to have this came as a complete surprise to rapp and richards richards asked why ill explain it later whats the third reason rapp asked we cant let anyone know hes dead before am monday why richards asked rapp answered for him hell tell us when were done the dorfman file was shredded and burned late saturday night by sunday morning the ashes were cool enough that they could be scooped into a bag and thrown down the garbage chute they spent two hours that afternoon sanitizing the condo if they had to come back they could but hurley wanted to avoid doing so if possible at eight in the evening they packed the last of the gear into the trunk of the rented fourdoor mercedes sedan and left rapp was the wheel man for the evening hurley and richards were going in it occurred to him that he was being punished for taking the initiative in istanbul but what could he say someone had to stay with the car on the drive down the e hurley went over the plan one last time every minute or so he threw a question at rapp or richards asking them how they would react if this or that thing did not go as planned traffic was almost nonexistent so they made it in just thirty minutes it was a dark cold windy night with temperatures expected to dip near freezing they were all dressed in jeans and dark coats hurley and richards also had black watch caps on their heads the neighbor behind dorfman was a widower with cats but no dogs the plan was to access his property from her backyard at nine they did a final radio check and then at ninefifteen rapp turned the silver mercedes onto the winding country road the dome light was set to off rapp downshifted and coasted to a near stop several hundred feet from the widowers house richards and hurley stepped from the slowly moving vehicle carefully nudged their doors closed and then disappeared into the trees rapp continued a little less than a minute later he turned onto dorfmans street and did a slow driveby the house was set back from the street about seventyfive feet the front of the house was dark but faint lights could be seen beyond what they knew was the living room and dining room rapp pressed the transmit button on the secure motorola radio alls clear up front hurley and richards found their way through the overgrown property of dorfmans neighbor with relative ease this was not hurleys first trip and he didnt feel the slightest bit guilty for not telling the new recruits they did not need to know everything he had personally put together the surveillance package on dorfman eight months earlier the stuff about the dogs he knew from many years of experience and as far as bankers being anal retentive it was a fairly accurate statement the stuff about dorfman having left the church that his parents raised him in and being a nazi prick hed learned by keeping an eye on the man for close to two years to run an effective organization you need money hurley and kennedy had been working overtime trying to map out how these various groups moved their money around the globe and they had decided dorfman was the key in this the ultimate asymmetric war where they could not use even a fraction of the might of the united states military they needed to get creative if they couldnt openly bomb the terrorist training camps in the bekaa valley then maybe there was another way to hurt them hurley and richards took up position near the back door at ninethirty if they had missed him somehow hurley was prepared to cut the phone line and break in that option presented two problems however if he busted the door in the security system would be tripped and although an alarm would not be received at the monitoring station the houses siren would begin to wail and would likely arouse the attention of one of the neighbors dorfman also owned a pistol a shotgun and a rifle that dorfman might react quickly enough to stop the intruders was unlikely but hurley didnt like unlikely the back light above the kitchen door was turned on at tenohone hurley was crouched closest to the door on one knee and richards was right behind him from where he was positioned hurley could hear the chimes on the keypad as the digits were entered the door opened and the two standard poodles bounded out the door and onto the patio hurley had to trust richards to do his job and stay focused on his he sprang from his position and put his shoulder into the door before it could be closed he hit it with enough force that it bounced back and hit an unsuspecting dorfman in the face over his shoulder he heard the dogs begin to growl he grabbed the door by the edge and looking through the glass came facetoface with a stunned dorfman the growling had turned to barking and hurley resisted the urge to turn around to see how close they were to taking a bite out of his ass instead he pulled the door toward him and then smashed it into dorfmans face there was a scramble of nails and paws on the brick patio and then the welcome sound of compressed air forcing a projectile down a muzzle one shot and then a second each followed by short yelps and then some whimpering hurley saw the light switches to his left there were three of them he raked his silencer down the wall knocking all three into the off position and relegating them to semidarkness quickly he slid through the door partially closed it and stuffed the silencer into the shocked and open mouth of dorfman chapter the mercedes was the same color and model as the one dorfman drove rapp cruised the neighborhood listening to hurley and richards with one ear and the police scanner with the other his german was nonexistent but as hurley had pointed out the only thing he needed to listen for was a car being dispatched to dorfmans address no car was dispatched so rapp pulled the rented mercedes into the driveway and turned around in the small car park so it was facing out hurley reasoned that if any of the neighbors saw the car they would assume it was herr dorfmans rapp walked around the side of the house to the backyard and helped richards carry the second poodle down to the basement a small dart with red fins was still stuck in the animals rib cage it rose and fell with the animals heavy breathing rapp had been tempted to say something to hurley two days earlier when he informed them that they were going to use a tranquilizer gun to take out the dogs but he kept his mouth shut he knew that hurley loved his dogs but still they were going to kill a man tonight from a bigpicture standpoint it didnt make a lot of sense to him hurleys way was going to take a little more effort and would not silence the dogs as quickly hurley knew what rapp was thinking and noted that the surveillance report said that the dogs usually barked when they were let out of the house especially at night it wasnt as if they were storming a terrorist stronghold it was just a german couple in their fifties so rapp kept his tactical opinion to himself rapp was now looking down at one of the germans frau dorfman was blindfolded gagged hogtied and shivering from fright he glanced at the knots richards had made they were well done her wrists and ankles were bound and attached with a length of rope the only reason rapp knew anything about them was that his little brother had been fascinated by many things as a child but knots and magic were the two that became his passion after their father died rapp saw it as his duty to take an interest in stevens various hobbies even if they werent his the basement had been finished as a rec room with a bar and a small pool table richards had been nice enough to deposit the big german woman on an area rug rapp saw a blanket on the back of the couch he grabbed it and paused on the wall behind the couch was a postersized photo of dorfman and his two dogs he was holding a trophy and the two dogs were licking his face rapp covered the woman with the blanket it was going to be a long night for her and an even longer morning but unlike her husband she would live rapp grabbed the phone next to the couch and yanked the cord from the wall he quickly coiled the cord around the phone as richards reappeared from the utility room flashing him the allclear sign they were not to speak a word in front of the woman rapp climbed the stairs to the first floor turned off the basement lights and closed the door per the plan all of the lights had been turned off on the main floor except for the single light over the kitchen sink as was the dorfmans habit upon going to bed rapp walked through the formal living room past richards who was keeping an eye on the front of the house the french doors that led to the study were cracked an inch rapp pulled his black mask down to cover his face entered and closed the door behind him dorfman was on the floor in his light blue pajamas his combover hair was all askew and his nose was bleeding a leather reading chair had been tossed to the side and the rug pulled back to reveal a floor safe dorfman looked up at rapp with tears in his eyes again rapp didnt understand german beyond a hundredodd words but he could tell the whimpering idiot was asking about his dogs and not his wife rapp looked around the office and counted no fewer than ten photos of his dogs there was one fivebyseven of the wife and two kids that had to be fifteen years old rapp counted seven trophies and a dozenplus ribbons dorfman was still desperately asking about his hunde rapp raised his silenced beretta and said shut up hurley squatted down on his haunches and tapped the dial of the safe with the tip of his silencer his german was perfect he ordered dorfman to open the safe dorfman closed his eyes and shook his head they spoke for another twenty seconds and still he refused hurley looked up at rapp and said go get his wife rapp shook his head hurley frowned let me take a shot at this what do you say i grab one of your dogs and put a bullet in his head rapp saw the flicker of recognition in the bankers eyes thats right you idiot im going to get one of your dogs and bring him up here rapp reached into his coat and pulled out a tactical knife he bent over and stuck the tip in front of dorfmans face ill do you one better im going to lay your hund at your feet and then im going to cut out one of his eyes and forcefeed it to you nein nein dorfman looked truly frightened if you dont open the safe im going to start with your poochs eyes and then his tongue and then his nose and then his ears and if you still havent opened it by then im going to shove all of it down your throat and then ill start in on the second dog and if that doesnt get you to do it then ill start in on you dorfman closed his eyes as tight as he could and shook his head in defiance patiently waiting for dorfman to decide to open the safe wasnt in the cards rapp flipped the knife up in the air and caught it reversing his hold he then slammed the tip of it down into dorfmans thigh the bankers entire body went rigid with pain and he opened his mouth to scream hurley gave him a quick backhanded chop to the throat successfully choking off the shriek of agony ten seconds passed before dorfman was calm enough to talk to last chance open the safe rapp said dorfman was now slobbering muttering something and shaking his head fine rapp said as he moved to the door well do it your way rapp went back the basement turned on the light and stood over the two poodles and the wife he wasnt sure which one to grab so he picked the one on the left rapp cradled it in his arms and went back to the office richards opened the door for him rapp gently laid the pooch at his masters feet the sight of his precious dog in the arms of the masked maniac sent dorfman into a nearapoplectic state hurley slapped him hard and once again pointed at the safe at least this time dorfman didnt shake his head rapp retrieved his knife and held the tip in front of the dogs face left eye or right eye you choose dorfman was now bawling like a child reaching out for his dog rapp wasnt sure he had the stomach for this but what the hell else were they going to do he glanced at hurley whose dark eyes alert with uncertainty framed by his ski mask seemed to be pleading with him to stop rapp got the impression that hurley would rather torture the banker than harm the dog rapp cradled the dogs head in his arms and slowly started moving the blade toward the poodles left eye he was within a centimeter of piercing the outer layer when dorfman finally relented he literally threw himself onto the safe and began spinning the dial rapp waited until hed entered the correct combination and then released the dog dorfman crawled to his dog and pulled him in kissing him on the snout and the top of his head what the fuck rapp muttered to himself and then asked dorfman you care more about that damn dog than you do your wife dont you dorfman either didnt hear him or chose to ignore the question rapp looked at hurley who was emptying the contents of the safe i told you hurley said as he pulled out three objects and held them up for rapp to see an ss dagger and insignia nazi prick a poodleloving nazi who helps terrorists great rapp started to raise his gun but stopped is it in there hurley held up some files computer disks and an external hard drive i think so he leafed through the files quickly yep its all here jackpot dorfman rapp said as he pointed his gun at the bankers head i bet if those damn terrorists were running around killing dogs you would have thought twice about helping them please dorfman said i am just a businessman who helps terrorist move their money around so they can target and kill innocent civilians i knew nothing of such things youre a liar thats for certain hurley said as he stood with the bag full of files and disks he placed the rug back over the closed safe and while moving the chair back said you have their names their accounts hurley shook the bag you knew exactly who you were dealing with i was doing my job for the bank like a good nazi hurley gave him a big smile and pointed the beretta at dorfmans head and im only doing my job hurley squeezed the trigger and sent a single bullet into dorfmans brain the man fell back against the hardwood floor with a thump that was louder than the gunshot a puddle of blood began to seep out in all directions hurley looked at rapp and said lets get the fuck out of here we need to be in zurich by sunrise whats in zurich same thing thats always in zurich money and assholes chapter moscow russia i vanov carefully lowered himself into his chair at svr headquarters in the yasenevo district of moscow last night had been a wild one he had closed a very lucrative business deal a group of foreign investors were looking to pick up some natural gas contracts and were willing to give ivanov a sevenfigure retainer and a nice piece of the action if he could guarantee the acquisition now all ivanov had to do was talk some sense into one of his countrymen who had already made a nice profit on the fields and if he couldnt talk some sense into him he would have shvets and a crew of his loyal officers pay the man a call and make him an offer he couldnt refuse ivanov smiled as he thought of his favorite movie the godfather he would very much like to meet francis ford coppola some day the man had captured the essence of power perfectly that was what russia was all about in the wake of the collapse of the soviet union the two systems were not at the end of the day all that different from each other both were corrupt to the core and both systems served to line the pockets of the powerful under the old soviet system the inefficiencies were ridiculous people who had no business holding a position of authority did so often and their inability to make smart decisions doomed the communist experiment from the start there was no motivation for the talented to rise to the top in fact it could be said that there was the opposite motivation if you dared criticize the foolish systems put into place by some imbecile who held a post because he was the brotherinlaw of an important official you were more likely than not to get your meager pay cut everyone wallowed in that subaverage world except the lucky few today things were dynamic money was to be made everywhere and lots of it startup companies were popping up at an incredible rate and foreign investors were lining up to get into the game the game though was a treacherous one remnants of the soviet system were still in place sucking off the system and causing a huge drain on the efficiency of the new economy and then there were the corrupt courts police and security services it was the godfather the wild west and s gangster america all rolled into one these bankers and businessmen could either wallow in that inefficiency and red tape for months costing them valuable time and money or they could come to ivanov and he could make their problems go away unlike the army of jew lawyers who had descended on the city who claimed they knew what they were doing ivanov could actually follow through on those claims and deliver real results to his new partners and they were always partners depending on the deal ivanov would sometimes lower his fee but never his percentage the percent ownership stake was nonnegotiable he was not alone in this and that was yet another parallel to the academy awardwinning movie there were others in moscow and across the vast country who were doing the same thing although ivanov would argue not as well ivanov was not shy about touting the importance of his role in this brave new world and defended it as a natural extension of his state security job someone needed to keep track of all these foreign investors and make sure they werent stealing the motherlands natural resources after all he was far more deserving of the profits than some twentyfiveyearold businessschool graduate at least that was what he told himself shvets entered the office looking far too rested and handsome which had the effect of worsening ivanovs mood good morning sir shvets remained standing he knew better than to take a seat unless he was ordered get me some water ivanov grumbled while shvets poured a glass he asked you look like you stayed out all night would you like some aspirin as well yes he snapped his long tanned fingers to spur his assistant to move faster he could feel his headache passing from one temple to the other and then swinging back as if he were being scanned by an irritating beam he downed the three pills and the water for a split second he thought of adding vodka it would definitely help with the headache but it was too early to surrender shvets and the new breed would take it as a sign of weakness i heard you got them to agree in principle to the partnership yes ivanov moaned would you like me to have maxim bring the contracts over yes and so i want to know when you are leaving for beirut and who youre bringing with you tomorrow and im bringing alexei and ivan ivanov thought about that alexei and ivan were two of his best former spetsnaz theyd fought with valor and distinction in afghanistan but had gotten in trouble when their regiments political officer had turned up with his throat cut one morning they had more than likely done it political officers were notorious for being assholes and in those final days of the ussr more than a few of them simply disappeared ivanov was always looking for men who were good with their hands and these two were better than good why alexei and ivan because theyre from georgia and they look like they could be lebanese that was true but ivanov didnt like having his two best gunmen leaving his side in moscow these days the only thing you could count on was that sooner or later someone would try to take you out it was just like the american mobsters the vision of sonny corleone being mercilessly gunned down at the toll booth betrayed by his own brotherinlaw the snake sent chills down ivanovs back he shuddered and then decided he would keep alexi and ivanov close they were his luca brasi times two take oleg and yakov shvets frowned why cant you just follow my orders in a calm voice shvets said when have i once failed to follow your orders you know what i mean your face i am in no mood for it this morning ivanov lowered his big head into his hands and groaned i might as well go by myself that is a brilliant idea travel to the kidnapping capital of the mediterranean by yourself so they can snatch you off the street and hold you for ransom brilliant is it my fault that you stay out drinking and screwing until sunrise dont start i am half your age and i cant keep up with you you are half my size too so were even you need to slow down or there will be problems ivanovs head snapped up is that a threat no shvets said shaking his head with a pathetic disappointment in his boss why must my loyalty always be questioned i am talking about your health you need to take some time off go someplace warm maybe come to beirut with me beirut is a hellhole it was once a great place not anymore you will see i heard its coming back ha ivanov laughed not the part where youll be going the famous green line looks like leningrad in its a bombedout shell our friends are trying to reconstitute it before the christians take it over it is not a nice place before shvets could respond there was a knock on the office door it was pavel sokoll one of ivanovs deputies who worked exclusively on state security financial matters and if his ghostly complexion was any hint he was not here to bring glad tidings sir sokolls voice cracked a touch it did that when he was afraid he was going to upset ivanov we have a problem what kind of problem god dammit sokoll started to explain and then stopped and then started again when he realized there was no good way to spin the bad news we have certain accounts that we use to move money overseas for our various activities that is im not an idiot sokoll we have accounts all over the place which ones are you talking about the ones in zurich specifically the oneshe glanced at his notesat sbc he closed the file and looked at his boss ivanov glared at the pasty man they had accounts with the swiss bank corporation which accounts dammit sokoll opened the file again rather than trying to read the numbers which even he didnt understand he reached across the desk and handed the paper to his boss ivanov looked down at the list of accounts there were six and he was intimately familiar with whom they belonged to what am i supposed to learn from this there is nothing just account numbers actually sirsokoll pointed nervously at the sheeton the far side those are the balances of each account ivanovs eyes nearly popped out of his head this says these accounts are empty thats right sir how ivanov yelled as he jumped to his feet swiss interbank clearing executed the order at nineohone zurich time this morning the money was emptied out of these accounts electronically i know how it works you fucking moron where did it go we dont know sir ivanov made a fist as if he might come over the desk and bash his deputy over the head well find out we cant sokoll said fearing for his life once the money is gone it is gone there is no way to trace it swiss banking laws shut up you fool ivanov yelled i am well aware of swiss banking laws and i dont give a shit youd better find a way around them or you are going to be either dead or looking for a job sokoll bowed and left without saying another word the vodka was on the sidebar it was always on the sidebar five different kinds ivanov could barely see his head hurt so much and he really didnt care which bottle he was grabbing vodka was vodka at this point he poured four fingers into a tall glass sloshing a bit over the side he took a huge gulp clenched his teeth and let the clean clear liquid slide down his throat no one was supposed to know about those accounts let alone have the ability to drain them of their funds this could seriously jeopardize his standing within not just the security service but the entire government as well it could potentially destroy all of his investments without the power that came with his office he would be worthless to his partners the long list of enemies that hed made over the years would think nothing of coming after him his hand started to shake shvets finally asked how much money ivanov had to take another drink to gain the courage to speak the number twentysix million dollars roughly and it belonged to it took ivanov a moment to answer our friends in beirut shvets thought of the different militant terrorist groups their money or ours both both yes think of it as a joint venture we invested money with those zealots shvets asked not bothering to hide his surprise its control you idiot i dont even know why i bother explaining sometimes we put in money so we would have a say in how it was used think of it as foreign aid it was more complicated than that but ivanov didnt have the time or clarity of mind to explain the complicated arrangement this morning or the fact that approximately ten million of it was kgb money that had been siphoned off over the years foreign aid to terrorists lovely stop with your judgments you know nothing they put money in the accounts as well in fact most of it was theirs ivanov had helped them find new revenue streams by peddling black market items such as drugs guns and porn the drugs and guns were shipped all over the middle east and north africa and the porn was smuggled into saudi arabia if the majority of the money was theirs why did we have control of it ivanov gave an exasperated sigh as it occurred to him that he would have to go upstairs and tell the director he tolerated these side business deals but only to a point this he would not like very much in fact there would be a great deal of suspicion that ivanov had stolen the money for himself if for no other reason than that they could all imagine themselves doing it shvets repeated his question and ivanov said it was part of the deal if they wanted our help we wanted to know what they were doing with it and we wanted them to put their own funds in as well it was only a half truth but ivanov did not feel the need to go into details with one of his deputies im assuming the twentysix represents the bulk of their assets yes ivanov took another gulp the vodka was starting to lubricate the gears in his brain he began to make a list in his head of who he would need to talk to who had access to the account information and pass codes they did and i did any withdrawal of more than twentyfive thousand had to be authorized by each of us separately so you had one pass code and they had the other yes shvets was asking too many questions who had access to both sets of pass codes no one the headache was starting to come back although this time it was in his neck he began rubbing the muscles with his left hand while he took another drink of vodka it was intentionally set up so that neither party would have both pass codes shvets considered that for a moment and then said someone had to have both codes someone at the bank how else could the codes be verified and the money moved ivanov stopped rubbing his neck why hadnt he come to the same conclusion sooner dorfman who the banker ivanov looked up dorfmans office number and punched it in as fast as his fingers could move it took more than two minutes three people and a string of threats to get an answer that told him things were not good dorfman had not shown up for work and they had been unable to reach him ivanov hung up the phone and laid his head down on the desk shvets opened the office door and asked the secretary to bring them coffee he then walked over to the desk and took the glass of vodka ivanov tried to stop him this is not helping shvets said in a paternal voice i am tied to you whether i like it or not and if we are going to avoid being interrogated by our colleagues in the federal security service we need to clear your head and get you thinking straight ivanovs entire body shuddered at the thought of the fss goons dragging him into the basement of lubyanka the oncefeared grand headquarters of the kgb he knew all too well what went on in those prison cells in the basement and he would kill himself before he ever allowed that to happen chapter southern germany the trip was uneventful in the sense that they pointed the hood of the big mercedes south and stopped only twice before reaching the swissgerman border for eight hours they cruised at an average speed of kilometers an hour down the smooth twisting autobahn near some of the larger towns they had to slow and when they neared the mountains to the south the winding rising road slowed their progress only slightly they were thankful that there was no snow they skirted hannover kassel frankfurt strasbourg and a blur of other towns while hurley pored over the treasure trove of information hed retrieved from the bankers safe richards fired up the laptop and used the decoding software to uplink the information on dorfmans disks via the satellite phone kennedy had a team assembled in dc who were translating and filtering the information richards was done sending the information by the time they reached kassel he slept for the next two hours rapp listened to the snippets of conversation coming from the backseat and wondered what the next move would be hurley liked to operate on a strictly needtoknow basis and rapp and richards rarely needed to know at least as far as hurley was concerned halfway through the trip hurley ordered rapp to pull over and switch with richards they topped off the gas used the mens room and hurley bought coffee and some snacks for him and richards rapp didnt mind driving but hurley was insistent an hour or two of downtime was crucial one never knew when things would get interesting as was often the case though hurley did not listen to his own advice and continued to work at a feverish pace rapp climbed into the backseat and after a few minutes of silence he asked hurley what are we doing uncharacteristically hurley laughed ill explain before we cross the border right now i need to figure this shit out it occurred to rapp that the man was punchdrunk but he didnt dwell on it within minutes the hum of the tires rolling at high speed on the concrete surface of the autobahn sent rapp into a trance he rolled up his jacket wedged it in between the door frame and his head and fell asleep for the next few hours he drifted in and out of sleep the shrill ring of the satellite phone interrupting dreams of poodles bad combover hairdos and trussedup plump german women at one point he was drifting off to sleep and wondered what frau dorfman would do with the dogs now that her husband was not of this world for some reason that made him think of the expanding pool of blood under dorfmans head how far had it stretched would it begin to dry in the arid winter air how much blood was actually in a human head one pint before he could decide on an amount he drifted off hurley never slowed he reviewed every document every file postit note and receipt hed filled close to an entire notepad with the most pertinent information at am they stopped at a roadside motel outside freiburg and got two connecting rooms where they cleaned up and changed into suits and ties for the border crossing hurley ordered them to pack their weapons in the hidden compartments inside their suitcases by six they were back on the road with fresh coffee and rolls and hurley was ready to explain what they were doing unfortunately he chose the wrong military campaign to illustrate his point you two familiar with shermans march to the sea rapp was behind the wheel having been raised in northern virginia he didnt really consider himself a southerner but he was a proud virginian and that meant he knew his civil war history to a true southerner like richards who had been raised in covington georgia the mere mention of william tecumseh sherman was enough to start a fight total war hurley said just like sherman if our enemy wont come out and meet us on the field of battle we need to bring the war to their doorstep we need to destroy their capacity to fight we need to spook them into maneuvering in the open so we can crush them rapp could see both mens faces in the rearview mirror hurley was oblivious to the revulsion on richardss face are you trying to tell me richards said that were sherman i sure as hell hope so said hurley in a state of near elation he won didnt he rapp couldnt take it anymore and started laughing what the hells so funny hurley asked when he got control of himself he said youre sitting next to one of georgias finest its like singing the praises of andrew jackson to a bunch of indians oh hurley said as he realized his mistake no offense intended well have to debate that one over beers one night sherman was a badass throwing him a bone he added and lee and jackson were two battlefield geniuses cant deny that then he changed tactics and asked youve hunted birds right yeah why do you bring a dog into the field to get the birds up exactly hurley said these guys have done a damn good job keeping their heads down the past ten years while langleys been focused on central america and avoiding those dickheads up on capitol hill i told you about our operative that got snatched off the streets of beirut a few months back well thats not the first time thats happened we got soft in the eighties and let these assholes get away with way too much shit glancing at rapps face in the mirror he said april of our embassy gets hit sixtythree people killed langley lost eight of its best people that day including our near east director and station chief hurley left out the fact that he had been in the city that day that he could have easily been one of the victims he also left out the fact that kennedys dad was one of the men theyd lost it was not his place to share something so personal if she wanted to tell them one day that was her business our response we send in the marines october of the marines and french forces get hit by a couple of truck bombs two hundred and ninetynine men wasted because a bunch of fucking diplomats conned the command element into thinking too much security would send the wrong message mind you not a single one of those dilettante pricks ever spent a day in that godforsaken city our response after the barracks bombing we say were not going to leave we drop a few bombs and we leave hurley swore to himself and they get it in their heads that they can fuck with us and get away scotfree march of they grab my old buddy bill buckley our new station chief korean and vietnam war vet amazing guy hurley looked out the window for a moment with sadness in his eyes they tortured him for almost a year and a half flew him over to tehran the bastards taped it ive seen parts hurley shook his head as if trying to get rid of a bad thought they sucked every last drop of information out of him and then they sold it to the russians and anyone else who was interested bill knew a lot of shit the info they got from him did a boatload of damage i cant even begin to tell you how many nights ive lain awake wondering how i would have handled it they brought in a socalled expert a hezbollah shrink by the name of aziz alabub trained by the russians at the peoples friendship university the names these assholes come up with just boggles the mind alabub pumped him full of drugs and poked and prodded the word is he had two assistants who helped him they turned it into a real science project bills heart eventually gave out but not before they extracted some of our most closely held secrets one by one assets started to disappear highly placed sources in governments around the region and beyond and how did we react we didnt do jack shit and the result was they became more emboldened qaddafi that quack then decides to plant a bomb in a disco in berlin and finally we decide to hit back and drop a few bombs on his head unfortunately we missed and then in july of that cowboy captain of the vincennes decides hes going to start racing all over the strait of hormuz chasing tenthousanddollar fiberglass gunboats with a halfbilliondollar aegis guided missile cruiser hurley had to stop and close his eyes as if he still couldnt believe that ugly piece of history rapp finished it for him iran air flight two hundred and ninety civilians yep hurley said realizing that having lost his girlfriend later that same year rapp would know the story not our proudest moment i dont care what anyone tries to tell you that one was our fault instead of owning up to it and using it as an opportunity to show the iranian people that we werent out to get them we denied the entire thing went so far as to blame it on them now they werent without fault but that captain had two choppers on board to deal with those gunboats the strength of the aegis cruiser is distance you dont close with the enemy to use your world war iiera guns if theres really a threat you back off and fire one of your missiles and thats what led us to pan am lockerbie rapp said hurley nodded its a little more complicated than that but in a nutshell yeah so richards said we fit in how lets just say some people in washington have seen the error of their ways this terrorism especially the islamic radical shit has some people spooked and it should they saw what happened last time when we allowed someone like buckley to get snatched without lifting a finger it gives people the wrong idea now the schnoz has been grabbed and its starting all over again im not supposed to tell you guys this but what the fuck five of our sources have been killed in just the last few months weve had to recall another dozenplus were flying blind and once again by doing nothing weve reinforced the idea that they can do whatever they want to us and we wont lift a finger and the stuff youve been working on all night how does that fit in rapp asked lets suppose for a second that you have five million dollars sitting in a swiss bank account that money represents years of extortion drug and gun running counterfeiting and a host of illegal scams youve worked yourself to the bone squirreling away this money what would you do if you woke up one morning and found out that account your account was empty rapp looked at the winding road and said id flip you think you might pick up the phone and start demanding some answers yeah damn right you would right now these pricks are sleeping soundly in their beds thinking their money is safe in switzerland at some point in the next twentyfour hours theyre going to find out that their illgotten gains have vanished and they are going to pick up the phone and they are going to go absolutely apeshit and when they dohurley pointed skywardwe will be listening chapter zurich switzerland as promised by hurley the border crossing was uneventful dour serious anglos in nice suits in a nice car crossing from one efficient european country into an even more efficient european country they continued to wind their way toward the banking capital of the world as the sun climbed in the sky and hurley explained in more detail what they were up to after another forty minutes they arrived on the outskirts of zurich hurley told rapp which exit to take and where to turn a few minutes later they pulled up to the gates of an estate whats this an embassy rapp asked no hurley said smiling the home of an old friend the car had barely come to a stop when the heavy blackandgold gate began to open rapp eased the sedan slowly up the crushedrock drive the garden beds were bare and the manicured arborvitae wrapped in burlap to protect them from the heavy wet snows that were common this time of year the place must have been magnificent in the summer the house reminded him of some of the abodes of foreign ambassadors that dotted the countryside west of dc hurley had him pull the car around the back where one of six garage doors was open the stall empty anticipating their arrival carl ohlmeyer was waiting for them in his library the man was tall thin and regal at first glance he was more britishlooking than german but his thick accent washed that thought from rapps mind almost as quickly as it had appeared he was dressed impeccably in a threepiece suit hurley had given them the mans brief history they had met in their twenties in berlin ohlmeyer had been fortunate enough to survive world war ii but unfortunate in that his family farm was twentyone miles east of berlin rather than west he had received his primary education at the hands of jesuit priests who had drilled into him the idea that god expected you to better yourself every day luke was a big one for of those to whom much is given much is required since ohlmeyer was a gifted mathematician much was expected of him when he was sixteen the russian tanks came down the same dirt road that the german tanks had gone down only a few years before but going in the opposite direction of course and with them they brought a cloud of death and destruction two years later he enrolled as a freshman at the prestigious humboldt university in the russiancontrolled sector of berlin over the next three years he watched in silence as fellow students and professors were arrested by the russian secret police and shipped off to siberia to do hard time for daring to speak out against the tenets of communism the oncegrand university which had educated statesmen like bismarck philosophers like hegel and physicists like einstein had become nothing more than a rottedout shell buildings that had been partially destroyed during the war sat untouched the entire time he was there all the while in the west the americans british and french were busy rebuilding ohlmeyer saw communism for the sham that it wasa bunch of brutes who seized power in the name of the people only to repress the very people they claimed to champion hurley recited for them ohlmeyers stalwart claim that any form of government that required the repression imprisonment and execution of those who disagreed with it was certainly not a government of the people but in those days following the war when so many millions had been killed people were in no mood for another fight so ohlmeyer kept quiet and bided his time and then after he received his degree in economics he fled to the american sector a few years later while he was working at a bank he ran into a brash young american who hated the communists even more than he did his name was stanley albertus hurley and they struck up a friendship that went far beyond a casual contempt for communism ohlmeyer upon seeing hurley dropped any pretense of formality and rushed out from behind his desk he took hurleys hand in both of his and began berating his friend in german hurley gave it right back after a brief exchange ohlmeyer looked at the other two men and in english said are these the two you told me about hurley nodded yep these are mike and pat yes im sure you are ohlmeyer smiled and extended his hand not believing their names were mike and pat for a second i cant tell you how exciting it is to meet you stan has told me you are two of the best he has seen in years ohlmeyer instantly read the looks of surprise on the faces of the two young men with mock surprise of his own he turned to hurley and said was i not supposed to say anything hurley looked far from enthused over his friends talkativeness you will have to excuse my old confidant ohlmeyer said putting a hand on hurleys shoulder he finds it extremely difficult to express feelings of admiration and warmth that way he doesnt feel as bad when he beats you over the head rapp and richards started laughing hurley didnt please make yourself comfortable there is coffee and tea and juice over there on the table and fresh rolls if you require anything else do not hesitate to ask stan and i have some work to do but it shouldnt take too long then i suggest all of you get some sleep you will be staying for dinner tonight no ohlmeyer turned to hurley for the answer i hope nonsense you are staying hurley hated to commit to things id like to but who knows what might pop up after this morning true and i will have my plane ready take you wherever you need to go tomorrow morning you are staying for dinner that is final there is much we need to catch up on and besides i need to tell these two young men of our exploits that might not be such a good idea nonsense ohlmeyer dismissed hurleys concern as completely inconsequential he looked down at the briefcase in hurleys hand with a devilish look he asked did you bring the codes no i drove all the way from hamburg just so i could stare at your ugly mug of course i brought them ohlmeyer started laughing heartily before turning to rapp and richards have you ever met a grumpier man in your entire life nope rapp said without hesitation while richards simply shook his head while rapp and richards retired to the other end of the fortyfootlong study to get some food ohlmeyer and hurley were joined by two men whom rapp guessed to be in their midforties they looked like businessmen probably bankers the four of them huddled around ohlmeyers massive desk while the silverhaired german issued explicit instructions in german forty minutes later the two men left each carrying several pages of instructions at nineohfive they received the anticlimactic call that the seventeen accounts had been drained of all funds but that was just the beginning over the next three hours the computers continued to execute transfers each account was divided into three new accounts and then split again by three until there were new accounts the money had been flung far and wide from offshore accounts in cyprus malaysia and hong kong and across the caribbean each transfer ate away at the balance as the various banks charged their fees but hurley didnt care he was playing with someone elses money the important thing was to leave a trail that would be impossible to untangle with all the different jurisdictions and separate privacy laws it would take an army of lawyers a lifetime to slash through the mess by noon the number of accounts had shrunk to five with a net balance of million chapter beirut lebanon sayyeds lungs and thighs ached as he climbed the crumbling concrete stairs his week had gone from miserable to intolerable starting with his trip to moscow and ending with his superiors in damascus issuing one of the most idiotic orders he had received in all of his professional career with the ceasefire finally looking as if it was going to take hold the cursed maronites had decided to accelerate their land grab their focus it appeared was the historically important area known as martyrs square in beiruts central district damascus ordered sayyed to get to the square plant his flag and plant it as quickly as possible like some battlefield general who had been ordered to hold a piece of land at all costs and then given no support sayyed was left to sort out the how fifteen years in this city had taught him the importance of keeping a healthy distance between himself and the other factions rifles and machine guns were nasty things and placed in the hands of teenage boys they were extremely unpredictable the idea of taking up one side of the square while the maronites grabbed the other made his skin crawl one errant shot one young crazy eastern catholic who wanted to avenge the death of a brother or the rape of a sister could plunge the entire city back into war orders unfortunately were orders and as much as he would have liked to he could not ignore them so sayyed sent samir and ali to choose an adequate building and while he was contemplating how to fill it with enough men to deter the maronites he was struck with an ingenious solution shvets would be coming from moscow to collect the cia agent in just a few days that would leave him with the american businessman zachary austin he was not an agent of any sort sayyed was sure of that the only question that remained was how much they could get for him and how that money would be split with that fool abu radih the fatah gunman had been crying like a little girl over the fact that hed been forced to surrender the telecommunications executive if sayyed brought him in it would be seen as a great gesture of maturity and goodwill by the others and maybe he could negotiate it in such a way that he could get the fatah rats to come hold the entire western end of the square the two had sat down over tea the previous afternoon radih had brought no fewer than twelve mena ridiculous number for the current level of tension sayyed first explained the situation with the maronites moving into martyrs square he was hoping that the emotionally charged piece of land would spur radih to action and he was not disappointed the man was so eager to show his passion for the cause that he leaped at the chance to hold the western half of the square without so much as seeking a concession in return he pledged fifty men to the operation the number surprised even sayyed and he was tempted to hold back his offer to hand over the american radih was an emotional fool to commit so much without gaining a single concession but sayyed had a problem he couldnt very well hold the west side of the square and leave the two americans in the basement of the office over on hamra street with only a few men guarding them he had served three years in the army before joining the general security directorate and he recalled something theyd told him in infantry school about consolidating your forces it would only be for a few days until the russians could pick up the cia spy after that sayyed didnt really care what happened to the businessman just so long as he got his share of the ransom sayyed looked across the small bistro table and said i have finished interrogating the businessman from texas so is he a spy radih asked no i am certain he is in fact a businessman good then i can commence negotiations for his release sayyed did not speak he waited for radih to make him an offerthe same arrangement theyd had in the past i will guarantee you percent of the ransom sayyed was tempted to ask for fifty the others would likely back him but he needed radihs help with the maronite problem i think thirty would be fair considering everything else before radih could counter sayyed said i will bring him to the new building tonight along with the other american it can be your new command post for a few weeks it was an honor radih would never be able to refuse he would be considered the vanguard in the struggle to reclaim the city from the christians the building itself would have to eventually be destroyed it listed at a fivedegree angle toward the square and looked as if a strong wind might topple all seven stories into the street but it was built out of sturdy concrete and would have to be blown up before it would fall of all the buildings that bordered the square it was perhaps the secondstrongest position unfortunately the maronites had the best position no more than three hundred feet directly across from them radih had already made one mistake and sayyed blamed himself for it the selfpromoter had left his sprawling slums near the airport in a tenvehicle convoy and arranged for the peasants to send him and his men off as if they were valiant muslims on a mission to evict the crusaders instead of a quiet arrival they had pulled into the square flying the bright yellow fatah flag the chances for escalation were now ripe that was not sayyeds preference the last thing he needed with shvets coming to pick up the cia man was open conflict the prisoners had arrived the previous evening transferred in just two cars the proper way very low key and then for the next few hours men and supplies were slowly transferred over from the office on hamra street they had successfully moved the bulk of their stuff without tipping their hand and then in one fell swoop with a gesture of egotistical grandeur radih had announced to the entire city that they were staking out their turf while that might accomplish the shortterm goals of damascus it also might plunge the city back into chaos as sayyed reached the roof he realized that it also might get him killed he peered around the corner with his left eye and looked across the street the maronite building was one story taller and with a glance he counted no fewer than five heads and three muzzles along the roof line it had just been reported to him that they were filling sandbags and barricading the windows and doors on the first floor of course they were thats what he would do and was in fact doing it would be really nice if they could get through this little standoff without a shot being fired because if just one shot was fired the entire square would erupt in a fusillade of lead projectiles hed seen it happen before literally thousands of rounds would be exchanged in minutes he would have to remember to tell the men to keep their weapons on safe sayyed found samir around the other side of the blockhouse at the top of the building it was the place most shielded from the position across the street samir handed sayyed the satellite phone that ivanovs effeminate deputy had given him before sayyed left moscow hello he said as he placed it to his ear my friend how are things sayyed frowned it was ivanov and he sounded as if he was drunk it was only midafternoon fine sayyed said as he stole a quick look around the corner the sun had reflected off something across the street and he got the horrible feeling it was the front end of a snipers scope how are things in your fine city sayyed pulled the phone away from his ear and looked at it with skepticism something was wrong with ivanov the man hated beirut he sighed and put the phone back to his ear a little tense at the moment but nothing i cant handle what is wrong just a land grab by one of the other militias it has created a bit of a standoff fellow muslims no sayyed said irritated by the implication ivanov liked to get drunk and lecture him on history specifically that muslims loved nothing more than to kill each other and the only time they stopped killing each other was when they decided to kill jews hindus or christians maronites ah the wood ticks of the middle east havent you been trying to exterminate them for a thousand years what do you want my package ivanov said slurring the words is it ready you havent decided to negotiate with the persians have you i am standing by our deal when can i expect it to be retrieved i assume you are still sending someone yes although i am considering coming myself there was a long pause and then you did offer didnt you oh sayyed said surprised that ivanov was taking him up on his insincere offer absolutely good i will be there in three days maybe sooner fantastic sayyed lied i will have everything prepared i must go now there is something urgent i need to attend to please call if you need anything else sayyed punched the red button and disconnected the call he looked around the desolate landscape with its pancaked and shelledout buildings and wondered how he could ever play host to ivanov in this pile of rubble then as he turned to go down the stairs he came facetoface with imad mughniyah the coleader of islamic jihad mughniyah not known for levity looked as if he was ready to kill someone imad sayyed said what is wrong mughniyah looked back into the stairwell and motioned for his two bodyguards to give him some privacy who was that he said looking at the phone i heard you talking ivanov what did he want to insult me i think but i did not take the bait anything else he was going to send one of his men to pick up the spy now hes changed his mind and hes going to come himself he just changed his mind right now yes sayyed said wondering what all the questions were about what is wrong mughniyah again looked over his shoulder to make sure no one would hear him in a raspy voice he said my bank accounts in switzerland they are empty what do you mean empty empty gone nothing sayyed knew there must have been a mistake impossible i have checked three times already and it is not only the two islamic jihad accounts my personal account you helped me set up is also empty there was a hint of accusation in his words this cant be there has to be a mistake have you called hamburg mughniyah nodded my cousin tried six different times today did he get hold of dorfman he shook his head herr dorfman is dead dead killed in his own home last night sayyeds knees felt week he was the one who had suggested dorfman to mughniyah and the others you are the only one of us who knew this banker you specifically said we would never regret investing our money with him sayyed could see where this was going they would need to blame someone and he was the easiest target are you sure hes dead as sure as i can be from here sayyed didnt like the way the islamic jihads heavy was looking at him we will get to the bottom of this i promise you i had nothing to do with this come with me sayyed said wanting to get off the roof lest mughniyah decide to throw him off well go to my bank here in town im sure there has been a mistake i had money with him as well tell me again what is the connection with dorfman sayyed had already reached the first landing he stopped dead in his tracks and looked at mughniyah ivanov introduced me to him six years ago and he just called you and mentioned none of this not a word fucking russians always scheming chapter zurich switzerland rapp and richards missed most of the excitement with the time change and lack of sleep over the past few days both of them took ohlmeyer up on his offer of a room rapp had just enough energy in him to slip out of his suit and pull back the covers but not enough to brush his teeth or anything else he didnt even bother to close the curtains he did a face plant on the big kingsize bed and was out cold he could do that sometimes just lie down on his stomach close his eyes and it was good night irene the only problem came when he woke up lying on his face like that caused his sinuses to drain and blood to pool around his eyes his arms were pinned beneath him he cracked one eye and thought of the ultimate yin and yanglife and death he wondered if it was normal to think about it so much or if he should bring it up to lewis when he made it back stateside that was if he made it back that thought brought a smile to his face he had no idea why he found it amusing that someone might kill him but he did probably because there was a betterthaneven chance that whoever the man was he had no idea the kind of fight he was in for rapp didnt discuss it with anyone not even lewis or kennedy but he was good at this kind of work and he was getting better at twentythree he was already intimately familiar with death there was his father and then mary and now less than a week ago hed stared into the eyes of a man and pulled the trigger and as life drained from the mans face he had felt nothing at least not guilt or sorrow or nerves it was as if a calm had passed over him and then last night the bizarre home invasion of herr dorfman when hed signed on with kennedy he hadnt had that type of thing in mind killing a man in the manner that hed killed sharif hed dreamed of at least a thousand times dorfman never never once had his fertile imagination predicted that he would see a man shot in the head while he clutched his prized poodle without warning or any real conscious decision he jumped out of bed assumed the position and started doing pushups he thought of the old saying if youre not busy living youre dying it felt good to be living he ripped through fifty pushups flipped over and did fifty situps and then decided he needed to take a run he dug out his gear it was fourthirtyseven in the afternoon his running shoes were virtually brandnew as the last pair had been stuffed in a garbage can in istanbul with a house this big rapp assumed they had to have a workout room he was right a staff member must have heard him coming down the stairs and met him in the foyer he escorted rapp back upstairs down the hallway past his room to the far wing of the house the room had windows on three sides a treadmill a bike and a rowing machine as well as a universal machine and some dumbbells rapp got on the treadmill picked the mountain course and hit start for the next thirty minutes the ramp rose and fell and all the while he kept a sixminute pace when the digital readout told him hed run five miles he punched the red stop button and jumped off his chest heaving sweat dripping from his face he didnt even have enough left for a cooldown as he stood hunched over his hands on his knees he wondered for a brief moment if he might vomit and that was when she walked into the room rapp stood up straight a pained look on his face and tried to take in a full breath here you are she said in near perfect english i have been looking all over for you rapp could hardly conceal his surprise here standing before him was possibly the most attractive woman hed ever laid eyes on and she was looking for him still out of breath he started to speak but stopped the nausea came back and he decided rather quickly that he needed to open one of the windows or he really was going to vomit in front of this beauty he held up a single finger and said excuse me rapp cranked one of the windows open and took in the fresh cold air a couple of deep breaths later the nausea began to pass sorry he said as he turned back around im a little out of shape the blond beauty placed a hand on her hip and gave him an appraising look i dont see anything wrong with your shape rapp laughed nervously and not knowing how to respond said you look great too i mean you dont look like you need to work out is what i mean thats what came out of his mouth inside his brain he was screaming at himself youre a moron thank you she flashed him a perfect set of white teeth that was when rapp noticed the dimple on her chin her overall looks had knocked him so offkilter that he was just now getting around to categorizing her individual features blue eyes platinum blond hair pulled back in a high ponytail prominent cheekbones like some nordic goddess werent these people all related somehow a tiny little upturned nose the dimple on the chin though that had caught his attention for some reason my grandfather sent me to find you that was where he had seen it herr ohlmeyer had that same dimple or cleft or whatever it was that they called it somehow it looked much better on her rapp smiled and offered his hand im mitch i mean mike get hold of yourself his brain screamed at him greta pleased to meet you the smile made him a bit wobbly in the knees of course you are rapp thought to himself the image of greta in pigtails and lederhosen with a white blouse and ample cleavage holding a couple of beer steins flashed across his mind what the hell is wrong with me he noticed her face muscles tighten a bit and then she looked down at their stillclasped hands oh im sorry rapp said as he released her hand he hustled over to the shelf where the towels were and grabbed her one instead of giving it to her he began mopping her hand im so sorry she laughed nervously and took the towel from him my grandfather wanted me to tell you drinks are being served at six sharp in the library jacket and tie are required his rules not mine okay rapp replied and then feeling some irrational need to keep talking he asked what are you wearing she crinkled up her nose and said you are funny and then she was gone in stunned silence rapp watched her leave he didnt know how it was possible but she looked every bit as good from behind she was in a pair of jeans that were tucked into brown leather riding boots the door closed with a click that snapped rapp out of his trance he slapped himself in the head twice what are you fifteen you moron he tried to finish the workout but his mind wasnt in it so he went back to his room took a cold shower and thought about greta romance companionship call it whatever you want it was not something he had put a lot of thought into since losing mary hed had a few flings here and there but they were purely physical they all wanted to fix him that was the problem they knew who he was and that hed lost his highschool sweetheart in the attack that had so devastated syracuse being the captain of a national championship lacrosse team at a school that was crazy about the sport virtually guaranteed that a certain number of women would end up in his lap unfortunately they eventually wanted to talk about his feelings about how he was coping with the loss and heartache nothing could have been more unappealing to him his feelings his personal agony were no one elses business it had been almost four years now maybe that was what was going on time really was healing the wound or maybe it was sharif and dorfman maybe tossing their bodies down that big hollow pit in the back of his mind had helped stay the pain or maybe it was simply the fact that greta was so stunning shed blinded him into forgetting his past for a moment no that couldnt have been it at least not all of it hed met plenty of gorgeous women the past few years and none of them had hit him with this kind of lightning bolt rapp knotted his tie in the mirror and decided to leave the question there it was a riddle an unsolved problem more than likely all the above or some of the above and what did it really matter hed felt something he hadnt felt in years and wasnt sure he would ever feel again the spark of a crush or love at first sight he had no idea he had a hard time buying the latter more than likely it was simple lust two young attractive people their pheromones in overdrive was there a chance she felt the same thing he recalled the look shed given him as she gave him the onceover staring at his reflection he asked what does any of it matter im leaving in the morning going on safari rapp cinched the windsor knot just so and decided to enjoy the evening he would forget about yesterday and tomorrow the pain and the obligations and just try to live like a normal person for one night chapter moscow russia ivanov placed the handset back in the cradle and reached for the glass of vodka it was snatched from his grasp a split second before his hand got there his fingers closed and found air he blinked several times before looking up and seeing shvets holding the glass mine was all he could manage to say shvets wanted to tell him he spoke like a toddler when he was drunk but it would do no good at this point what did he say he has no idea your sure shvets should have listened on the extension when his boss got like this he was extremely unreliable whats there to be sure about he pushed himself away from his desk and leaned back in his highback leather chair the man is a camel jockey he is not smart enough to steal this money from us shvets would have loved nothing more at this exact moment than to tell his alcoholic boss that sayyed was smarter than him but hed seen him shoot people for such insolence i should go to hamburg no i need you here send pavel now there was an idiot shvets thought pavel sokoll was fine with numbers and balance sheets but borderline retarded when it came to everything else in life sending him to hamburg would get them nowhere we need answers and im afraid sitting here will not get us any sending pavel will only add to the confusion you wont allow me to discuss this with anyone other than you or pavel so getting those answers is going to be very difficult but i need you here there will be no here in a few days he said with some force once word gets out that the money is missing the phone will start ringing and sooner or later it will be kicked upstairs or worse across town and once that happens they will pull you in us you mean us he half screamed your wagon is hitched to mine trust me a minute doesnt pass that i dont think of it and i have been good to you yes you have shvets said halfheartedly and i will continue to take care of you we just need some answers what we need is money he said trying to get ivanov to see the fundamental problem answers might lead us to the money but we will not get those answers sitting here in moscow stop speaking in riddles just let me go to hamburg and see what i can find out i will fly out tonight and if all goes well ill be back on the first flight in the morning and what am i going to do shvetss solution was suddenly very clear go out and get drunk order up some women and go to hotel baltschug ivanov frowned he was in no mood to socialize you must keep up appearances you know how this town is if rumors start that you are in trouble and no one sees you in public they will believe the rumors if they see you out acting as if everything is normal they wont believe the rumors shvets was willing to say almost anything to convince him sitting here in this office was getting them nowhere hed seen his boss in these funks before usually only for a day or two always a pity party but somehow the heaps of despair and recrimination eventually focused him and he came out of it like a bear ready to charge and when that happened shvets had better have a better understanding of what had happened or he could end up being the casualty he suggested bring alexei and ivan they will make sure you are taken care of yes ivanov thought my two luca brasis no one would dare challenge me with them as my companions ivanov felt better just thinking of his two loyal soldiers and besides some flesh might be the remedy for his dismal attitude and he wanted a drink fine he relented but i want you to call me as soon as you hear something shvets turned tentative theyd done enough talking on the phones today and in this new era of electronic surveillance there was no telling who was listening i promise he lied as he started for the door and remember act like nothing has changed tonight chapter zurich switzerland rapp entered the study a few minutes before six and found hurley alone a phone in his left hand and a drink in his right staring out the french doors at the snowcapped mountains in the distance hurley glanced casually over his shoulder the phone pressed against his left ear to see who it was and then went back to what he was doing rapp glided across the room stepping from the hardwood floor onto a large persian rug the library was on two levels the second floor consisted of a catwalk that accessed the stacks of books lining the four walls there wasnt a dust jacket on a single book a large woodpaneled door to rapps left opened with a click herr ohlmeyer appeared a warm smile on his face he held up one of his long fingers and silently motioned for rapp to join him rapp glanced at hurley to see if the man wanted to discuss anything but he was still on the phone so he followed ohlmeyer into a much smaller windowless office something about the room felt different off in some way when ohlmeyer closed the door there was a click of finality and then near total silence only the faint hum of a cpu rapp became aware of his own breathing and then realized the room was soundproof the floor was elevated a few inches and the walls and ceiling were builtin and covered in fabric behind the desk with the triple screens was a bank of blackandwhite security monitors three high and five across in front of the desk was a small conference table maybe fortyeight inches across it had four bland wood chairs the room was such a stark contrast to the rest of the house that rapp couldnt help but take notice ohlmeyer could see the younger mans interest and said in my business one must take certain precautions he pulled out one of the chairs told rapp to sit and then grabbed a file from his desk placing it on the conference table he said i admire what you are doing this is not an easy life you have chosen rapp nodded in a noncommittal way but other than that did not respond do you have any regrets so far without hesitation rapp said no no problems sleeping no second thoughts im not a big sleeper ohlmeyer smiled and scratched the dimple on his chin your type rarely is my type yes the hunter it is imprinted in your genetic code almost everyone has it dormant for thousands of years in many there isnt enough of it left to do them any good they spend their days in sedentary jobs that challenge them neither physically or mentally they do not have your abilities and your drive of course rapp supposed there was a good deal of truth in his words he simply had not put a lot of time into thinking about it i have some documents here ohlmeyer said as he tapped the file stan knows about this but he does not want to know the details details rapp asked wondering what hurley was up to now you are in a very dangerous line of work you are but a small vessel in a harbor packed with giant supertankers those supertankers bump up against each other sometimes causing little harm to themselves but to you it is the end he clapped his hands together signifying the destruction of rapps boat in your work you need a special kind of insurance and do you know why rapp could hazard a guess but he got the idea ohlmeyer would prefer to do the talking not really because those supertankers dont really care about you they may lament your misfortune but only briefly the tanker the ego of the captain all comes before you think of it as the ship of state if you will you are young and if you are lucky your career will last for another four decades during that time your handlers will come and go and the political winds of change will reverse directions more times than you will be able to count and sooner or later it is likely that someone within your own government will begin to think of you as a problem ships of state do not like to be embarrassed and if that means sinking a small vessel every once in a while well that is a price they are willing to pay rapp had a bad feeling he looked at the file and said whats that all about it is your insurance policy ohlmeyer opened the file and clipped to the first sheaf of documents was a swiss passport stan has assured me that your french is perfect rapp nodded and your italian german and arabic my italian is good my german is weak and my arabic is pretty good ohlmeyer nodded that matched with what hurley had told him i have prepared three separate legends for you swisshe slid the set of documents out of the file followed by two more french and italian you will need to memorize everything in these files and most important you will need to visit paris and milan in the coming weeks why you now own a safety deposit box in each city and one in zurich but i will take care of that one for you you will want to place certain things in these safety deposit boxes things that will help you survive should you need to go underground as they say rapp frowned does stan know about this it was his idea mine as well but we did the same thing for him years ago he slid over a blank sheet of paper with three names on it the first two were french and the third was italian please practice signing each of these a few times before i have you sign the signature cards rapp took the pen and began practicing the name paul girard why isnt stan handling this he does not want to know the details why because every man in your profession needs a few secrets even from his own boss and government especially from your boss and your government rapp was wondering how he was going to keep all of these different aliases straight hurley had already given him two and here were three more he practiced a few times on the other names and then signed the cards in each box ohlmeyer said will be twenty thousand dollars in cash various documents such as birth certificates in case you lose the passport and a matching set of credit cards and drivers license as i said you will want to add certain things to each box but you should talk to stan about that there is also a numbered account here in switzerland that i will be administering a numbered account rapp said barely able to conceal his surprise yes stan has requested that as well and told me that it is up to my discretion to release the funds rapp was tempted to ask the size of the account but instead said may i ask you a personal question ohlmeyer nodded with a smile as if he already knew the question why are you doing this helping us we will discuss it over dinner tonight but the short answer is that i believe in freedom freedom rapp said as he turned the word over in his mind for a second thats a pretty vague term not really but if it helps you understand my motivation youll need to understand that i grew up in east germany i saw what the soviets were really like rapps mind was filled with a menagerie of blackandwhite atrocities courtesy of the world at war shows he saw as a kid so you hate the russians ohlmeyer gave a little laugh and said lets just say i believe in good guys and bad guys chapter hamburg germany by early afternoon they learned that dorfman was dead the news sent ivanov into a fit of rage he went on for a good five minutes ranting that he had never trusted the man which caused shvets to silently ask himself why the fool had let a man he didnt trust handle such a large sum of money after that ivanov whose job and nature was to be paranoid spewed out no fewer than a dozen conspiracy theories in as many minutes he was convinced that dorfman had gotten drunk and whispered secrets in the wrong persons ear that this person had then decided to bump dorfman off and take the money for himself but then again there were supposed to have been safeguards in place so the criminals had to have had a certain level of sophistication ivanov had a long list of enemies that he ran through there was a cuban general hed screwed over in an information swap five years earlier how that man could possibly fit into this scenario was beyond shvets but hed asked for the list of possible suspects so he simply listened and let ivanov purge the information from his vodkasoaked brain there was a german industrialist whom hed fleeced a year earlier a spanish tycoon as well and then there were a host of jews and bolsheviks who had been out to get him for years none of it appeared to be useful but then again maybe it was shvets took the information and boarded a lufthansa flight to hamburg before leaving hed called their man at the consulate and told him to work his contacts with the local police and get him a copy of the crime scene report when he arrived at fivethirtysix that evening petrov sergeyevich was waiting for him the report in hand shvets had met petrov briefly a few years earlier after a polite exchange shvets told him to drive him to the bank he sat in the passenger seat and read the report herr dorfman had been stabbed in the thigh and shot once in the head his wife was found bound and gagged and locked in the basement she reported two men wearing masks entering the house at approximately ten in the evening she did not hear them speak and could not give police a description other than the fact that they were roughly the same size the dogs strangely enough were unharmed one was locked in the basement with the wife and the other was found wandering around the first floor at some point the latter dog stepped in the pool of blood by dorfmans head and then tracked it around the first floor there was no sign of forced entry and none of the neighbors had seen a thing shvets found it interesting that the wife and dogs were unharmed that more than likely ruled out the vying factions in moscow although if shvets was advising them he would have tried just this thing to throw off a man like ivanov whoever they were dealing with was very professional shvets finished the report closed it and decided it was nearly useless anything was possible dorfman could have told someone about the money and that someone could have gotten the idea in his head to steal it twentysix million dollars could do that to certain people shvets had thought about it himself he had the skill set to make it work it would have been so much easier if dorfman had stolen the money and tried to disappear they would have tracked him down they always did the fools habitually ran off to some beachside resort where they naively thought they would blend in with the locals and tourists they reached the bank shortly after sixthirty and shvets weighed the benefits of having sergeyevich accompany him into the building he decided against it there was no need for muscle at least not yet he hoped and besides the fewer who knew about ivanovs vulnerable position the better the bank was typical tall covered in glass and imposing all meant to give the impression of stability and security it was one of many things shvets was counting on the armed guard who tried to stop him in the lobby told him the bank was closed but shvets assured him that he did not wish to make a financial transaction he was tempted to add that that was of course unless the guard could somehow refund the million that had been stolen from shvetss employer and associates but shvets was fairly certain that this man was incapable of making that happen so he instead asked to see the head of security when the security guard hesitated shvets said of course this has something to do with herr dorfmans death that changed things significantly and in less than a minute shvets had been escorted to the top floor where he came facetoface with another much older security guard same white shirt with black epaulets and black pants shvets flashed his svr credentials and told the man secrecy was of the utmost importance he was then told that the bank president was extremely busy no doubt meeting with the board of directors the uncomfortable look on the mans face gave him the answer he was looking for i will wait no more than two minutes tell him now and tell him that it involves herr dorfman there are some very influential people in russia who require some immediate answers shvets sent the man off to deliver the message less than a minute later the guard came back down the hall with a welldressed man who looked as if he had been through a difficult day the guard stood awkwardly nearby while the bank president said i am herr koenig how may i help you i am nikolai shvets i am with the russian government he again flashed his gilded badge and then nodding toward the receptionist said is there a place where we can have a word in private yes the banker offered nodding enthusiastically please follow me shvets was disappointed when they ducked into a glasswalled conference room instead of the mans office there was nothing to learn from this bland space no photos of loved ones not a single hint of personal information he would have to ask sergeyevich to look into the mans life for some leverage koenig remained standing obviously impatient to get back to the board what is it you wish to discuss i understand shvets said that herr dorfman had a very unfortunate evening last night the man nervously cleared his throat the police have advised me not to discuss matters surrounding the murder of herr dorfman would you like me to inform the police that million of mother russias money went missing this morning or would you like me to go straight to the press with that announcement shvets was well aware of his lie but he could hardly tell the man the money belonged to various terrorist groups and the head of the svrs feared directorate s the bankers gray pallor deepened and he steadied himself against the back of a nearby chair while he mouthed the number i do not wish to go to either the police or the press but that is up to you herr koenig what would you like to know how much money is missing counting your twentysix million fortyseven but none of the money was actually in our bank koenig said defensively in fact we are trying to sort out what hans has been up to for all these years what do you mean the money was not in your bank the deposits were all in swiss banks or offshore accounts in the caribbean and far east but herr dorfman managed the accounts in his official capacity as a vice president of this bank koenig raised a cautionary finger we are not sure on that point so far we have found no official records of any of these accounts in our system shvets wasnt so sure he believed the man up until a minute ago you were thinking your exposure was roughly twenty million it has now more than doubled what makes you think it wont double again before tomorrow i disagree with your use of the phrase your exposure as best we can tell herr dorfman was in no way acting as an officer of this bank while he managed these various accounts herr koenig shvets said with a sad laugh you and i both know that will not stand up those deposits may not have sat in your vault but you had an officer of this bank who was managing on a daily basis a minimum of fortyseven million and quite possibly more this bank earned fees off that money but please let me finish herr koenig i am not here to assign guilt i am here to catch whoever took this money so we can get it back to its rightful owners probably for the first time since midmorning a touch of color returned to koenigs face as there always is in these situations a financial forensic investigation is under way how long will it take to complete it could take some time please be honest with me i am going to head back to moscow tomorrow and the men i work for they are not nice they could never have a conversation like this they would much prefer to strap you to a chair and attach things to your testicles so i suggest you tell me what you know switching to a friendly tone he added then i can go back to them and tell them you are a reasonable man someone we can trust koenig struggled with what he was about to say and then blurted it out im afraid we will never find that money why the banker threw his arms out it has been spread to the wind i have never seen anything like it in all my years the initial round of transfers was executed via fax in three waves they came from all over the world where hong kong san francisco new york london berlin paris istanbul moscow new delhi moscow yes i would like to see the faxes the banker shook his head shvets sighed ohhhh why must we do this the hard way herr koenig i know where the accounts were held your branch in geneva you are not as innocent as you would like me to believe you will show me those faxes and if you dont some people will come visit you in the middle of the night and do to you what was done to herr dorfman koenig swallowed hard i think i can make that concession good now why do you say we will never find the money my legal counsel has informed me that not a single bank that we transferred the money to today has consented to our request for information certainly theres a way it would involve years of lawsuits and even then you would be lucky to track down a fraction of the funds well maybe you need to turn up the pressure koenig watched as his words seemed to have the opposite effect from the one hed intended koenig stiffened i should warn you that a faction of the board feels very strongly that this is dirty money dirty money shvets asked as if the accusation were an insult there are rumors that herr dorfman was an agent for the east german stasi before the wall fell rumors are bad things and there is another rumor that he worked for your gru as well that he helped certain people launder money shvets gave him a wicked grin dorfman had in fact been a spy for the kgb not the gru where have you heard such things from people who know such things koenig answered cagily would you like to talk to them shvets suddenly got the feeling that hed lost the upper hand he needed to say something to fluster koenig back to these banking laws for a moment i assume these very same laws could be used to conceal gross incompetence of your branch in geneva or better yet that one of herr dorfmans colleagues at the bank helped himself to millions of dollars that did not belong to him dont they say that most bank heists are inside jobs that is pure unfounded speculation as is your gossip about herr dorfman being a gru spy checkmate koenig squirmed for a moment and then offered would you be willing to talk to the people who have sworn that herr dorfman was a spy absolutely he said even though he had no such intention but i would like to see those faxes first especially the one that originated in moscow koenig studied him cautiously for a moment and then said i will have copies of the faxes made for you give me a minute he left the room glancing back over his shoulder with a frown shvets paced while he waited this was starting to look like a big mess once these thieves in suits confirmed that dorfman had worked for the kgb they would not be the slightest bit inclined to repay a single dollar the germans hated the russians almost as much as the russians hated the germans koenig came back a few minutes later he had two other men with him this time and shvets knew the jig was up koenig handed over the stack of faxes they were blank except for the sending and receiving fax numbers the man might as well have written fuck you in large letters across the top sheet still it was better than nothing chapter zurich switzerland they had drinks in the library although rapp thought of it more as shots like he had done back in college except instead of a smelly bar in upstate new york he was in a mansion on the outskirts of one of the most refined cities in the world herr ohlmeyer did not believe in ruining fine spirits with anything other than ice so the liquor was served either up on the rocks or neat which rapp learned was basically naked meaning nothing but the booze rapp chose a glass of sixteenyearold lagavulin single malt scotch and asked for it on the rocks ohlmeyer liked playing host and told rapp it was a fine choice rapp took the glass smiled and said thank you greta had not made her entrance yet so rapp took the opportunity to corner hurley who was standing by the massive granite fireplace speaking with one of ohlmeyers two sons he approached hurley from behind and tapped him on the shoulder we need to talk hurley said something to ohlmeyers son in german that rapp did not understand and after he had walked away hurley turned to rapp and asked whats up rapp jerked his head in the direction of the small soundproof office what was that all about hurleys jaw clenched as was his habit when he didnt want to talk about something reluctantly he said its part of the deal dont worry just listen to carl he knows what hes doing does irene know about it or spencer tracy that guy who im not supposed to know that was how rapp referred to the man he had met briefly at the offices of international software logistics the man who he assumed was running the show the question caused the veins on hurleys neck to bulge which in turn caused rapp to take a step back that particular physical cue was often a precursor to hurleys blowing his top hurley felt the older ohlmeyers eyes on him and told himself to take a deep breath through his nose and exhale through his mouth it was a trick lewis had taught him it helped him center himself ohlmeyer despised public outbursts listen kid this is a tough business theres certain things they dont need to know about and quite frankly dont want to know about rapp considered that for a second before asking can it get me in trouble pretty much everything we do can get in you in trouble with someone this is about taking care of yourself no one else needs to know about this other than carl and his two boys rapp took a sip of his scotch and was about to ask another question but thought better of it dont look a gift horse in the mouth hurley wished he could say more but the kid would have to figure it out the hard way as he himself had had to do back in the day he took a big gulp of bourbon and thought about how much easier it would have been if someone had just pointed a few things out to him hurley changed his mind and decided to let it fly kid youre good and thats no small thing coming from me my job is to find faults and try to beat them out of you at some point in this line of work i dont care how good you are i dont care how just your cause sooner or later youre going to land yourself in a big pile of shit it might be your fault although more than likely itll be some asshole back stateside out to make a name for himself so he can advance his career hell put a target on your back and trust me on this one even though youre going to want to stand and fight you need to run run and hide lie low wait for things to blow over and then what you live to fight another day or maybe you just disappear for good rapp frowned and hurley knew exactly what he was thinking were not that different kid the idea of running away for good isnt in our veins but its nice to have options you bide your time you find out who it is whos out to get you and then you go after them rapp absorbed the advice and looked around the courtly library when are we shipping out tomorrow morning i was going to tell you guys later where to back to the scene of the crime beirut rapp whispered yep hurley held up his glass although i might have a small job for you first what kind of job we might have a lead on someone who i dont want to say yet come on nope no sense in getting your hopes up irene is flying over in the morning to brief us if shes verified it i will send you on a quick oneday detour and then you can join up with us in beirut and the intel on beirut its good really good these guys have been singing like birds all day the men spent another thirty minutes in the library ohlmeyer took the time to introduce both of his sons to rapp and richards the older one was august and the younger was robert and both were vice presidents at the bank and held positions on the board the patriarch of the family assured the two young men that they could trust his sons and hurley seconded the opinion ohimeyer knew that they would be leaving in the morning and suggested that they reconvene at the earliest possible time to work out the protocols and to make sure that each man understood the details of his various legends chapter shortly before seven they moved from the library to a sitting room that was decorated in the french baroque style the white carved flowers leaves and shells on the furniture and molding were in stark contrast to the deep natural woods of the library sitting on one of the rooms four sofas was greta next to her was an older woman whom rapp took to be her grandmother and thus carl ohlmeyers wife greta smiled at him from across the room rapp in control of his faculties this time flashed her a crooked grin and walked over shaking his head good evening ladies rapp offered his hand again this time it was dry greta you look lovely thank you mitch i mean mike rapp laughed youre good id like you to meet my grandmother elsa rapp offered his hand very nice to meet you frau ohlmeyer you have a lovely home rapp thought he noticed something wrong with her eyes when she smiled a certain disconnect her grip was also a bit weak and he wondered if she might be ill herr ohlmeyer was suddenly at rapps side michael i see you have met greta yes we bumped into each other this afternoon and my wife ohlmeyer placed a hand on her shoulder yes looking back at his granddaughter he said greta is our pride and joy i can see why she is very sharp yes and so far the only one of my grandchildren who has shown any interest in getting into the banking business for the next five minutes rapp got the family history carl and elsa had two boys and two girls one daughter was married and lived in london and the other was divorced and in spain august and roberts wives were currently on vacation with their sisterinlaw at her spanish villa there were eleven grandchildren of which greta was the thirdeldest elsa did not speak although she did smile a few times richards hurley and the two brothers were at the opposite end of the room no doubt discussing matters of far greater importance but rapp didnt beat up on himself too badly standing this close to greta was worth it every chance rapp got he stole a look her high ponytail had been changed out for a loose clip in the back that made her look much more mature than when hed met her earlier in the day she was wearing a cobaltblue silk blouse and a black skirt with gray tights he thought herr ohlmeyer caught him at least once ogling her and he had no idea what elsa was thinking she just kept smiling at him with that faraway look in her eyes the ohlmeyers were kind enough not to ask him any personal questions about his own family as he would have been forced to tell them a lie herr ohlmeyer decided it was time to sit for dinner he asked for his wifes hand but before she stood she pulled her granddaughter close and whispered something in her ear greta giggled while her grandmother pulled away and flashed rapp an intriguing smile before pulling her granddaughter close again she whispered another few lines before finally taking her husbands hand and standing elsa took a step toward rapp and to his surprise she reached out and gently patted him on the cheek she gave him a warm smile and then walked away without saying a word rapp turned to greta you have a very interesting grandmother greta reached out and grabbed his arm pulling him close and walking him toward the dining room but in no rush to catch up with the others granny elsa is an amazing woman unfortunately she is not well whats wrong rapp said as his stomach did flips over gretas touch she has alzheimers im sorry no need to be sorry these things happen such is life i suppose rapp said turning toward her she smelled so good he wanted to bury his face in her mane of shiny blond hair she has no regrets she led a very active life up until just a year ago i am living here now and working at the bank this way i can spend time with her while she still remembers me thats nice we spend our evenings going through letters and photos there is so much family history that only she knows my grandfather is a brilliant man but he has a hard time remembering the names of his own grandchildren not yours you can tell he thinks the world of you well i work for him i would hope he remembers my name as they entered the dining room rapp said do you mind me asking what your grandmother whispered in your ear greta gave him a nervous laugh and rested her head against his shoulder before releasing his arm maybe after a few drinks rapp followed her like a puppy dog down the right side of the long table there were chairs for twenty but they were only eight so they clustered at the far end with carl at the head of the table and elsa to his left followed by greta and rapp hurley was to carls right followed by august then richards and finally robert the wine glasses were filled and conversations that had been going continued while new ones were started richards got rapps attention at one point and gave him a youluckybastard shake of his head while darting his eyes at greta rapp for his part struck up a rather boring conversation with gretas uncle who was sitting directly across from him when greta had finished her glass of wine rapp leaned over and asked so can you tell me now greta slid her hand over and patted his thigh one more glass i think she held up her glass and one of the servants filled it so how does an allamerican boy such as yourself end up in this nasty line of work we get recruited like any other profession so your background is military rapp shook his head and smiled im a fine arts major with a minor in poetry gretas face lit up in surprise for a moment and then she caught herself you are teasing me yes i am why she asked playfully because you know i cant talk about my past and i tend to tease people whom i like so you like me she said with an approving nod he didnt know why he decided to say it maybe it was the wine maybe it was his newfound confidence that he was finally making a difference that he was part of something important but he did nonetheless rapp leaned in close so only she could hear and said i dont know what it is about you but ive had a hard time thinking of anything but you since we met this afternoon she smiled at him her cheeks flushing just a touch you are different not so guarded rapp laughed im probably the most guarded person youll ever meet just not with you for some reason is that good or bad i think its good at least it feels good rapp looked into her blue eyes she was smiling back at him he was about to really open up when herr ohlmeyer tapped his wine glass with his knife several times and stood ohlmeyer raised his glass and started giving a toast rapp turned his chair slightly so he could face him and his right knee moved to within a few inches of gretas thigh then her left hand slowly slid over from her lap and found his knee from that moment on rapp didnt register a single word that came out of herr ohlmeyers mouth nor did he hear anything hurley said when he rose to make his toast the main course arrived it was a braised beef of some sort served with mushrooms potatoes gravy and vegetables the kind of meatandpotatoes meal rapp loved there was only one problem he had just stuffed a forkful of beef in his mouth when greta leaned over and told him what her grandmother had whispered in her ear my granny thinks you are extremely attractive she told me i should sleep with you rapp would have been fine if it had ended there but it didnt as he tried to swallow the meat greta leaned over once more she said that if i dont she will rapp froze his eyes bulged and a piece of meat got stuck in the crossroads of his throat his brains autopilot kicked in and the hunk of meat came flying back up as fast as a majorleague fastball the only thing that saved it from pelting richards in the face was rapps quick hands a fit that started out as a cough morphed into eyewatering laughter greta smacked him on the back a few times and had to hold her napkin over her mouth to conceal her own laughter and amusement that she had set the chain of events in motion conversation ceased and all eyes settled on the young duo greta saved them by announcing i am sorry she dabbed at her eyes i told him a bad joke rapp finally got hold of himself and everyone went back to their conversations rapp noticed hurley giving him a few cautious looks but other than that no one appeared to notice the flirting shortly after dessert was served elsa tapped greta on the arm and told her she was tired everyone stood while the two women made their exit and then ohlmeyer suggested they retire to the library hurley disappeared into the small soundproof office and it was rapps turn to talk with the two uncles they gave rapp a message service to call if he needed to contact them he was never to call the office directly especially if he was in trouble rapp kept looking over his shoulder hoping to see greta but she did not return about an hour into it the brothers thought they had made enough progress and agreed they would sit down again when rapp came through town again in the coming weeks it was just before ten when the two brothers left rapp thanked herr ohlmeyer for an interesting evening and headed upstairs with one thing on his mindgreta he stood in the long hallway outside his room for a moment loitering hoping she would suddenly appear he had no idea where her room was but suspected that the guests were in this wing and the familys rooms were in the other wing of the house after another fifteen seconds of standing there feeling stupid he gave up and opened his door rapp peeled off his suit coat and tie draping both over the back of the desk chair with the water running he started brushing his teeth and unbuttoning his white dress shirt he walked back into the bedroom and was dropping the dress shirt on top of the tie and coat when he thought he heard a sound at the door he froze hoping it was greta a few seconds later he heard the footsteps of someone walking away he walked to the door and listened for a few seconds before checking the hallway it was empty rapp closed the door and stood there resting his head against the door after nearly a minute he decided he was acting like a fool he twisted the lock from midnight to three and climbed into the big bed wishing greta was next to him he yawned and rubbed his eyes he was tired after all rolling over he extinguished the bedside lamp and thought about tomorrow the side trip that hurley had alluded to had his interest he wondered who the target was and if hed had a direct role in the pan am attack the happy thoughts of ending that type of mans life sent him drifting off toward sleep and then suddenly there was a faint knock on the door rapp threw back the blankets and rushed to the door the knocking grew a bit louder rapp twisted the lock and opened the door a crack the sight of gretas blond hair put an instant smile on his face she pushed through not wanting to be discovered in the hall closing the door behind her and locking it rapp opened his mouth to speak but she put a finger on his lips and a hand on his chest she pushed him back toward the bed and then rising to her toes she kissed him on the mouth rapp responded with a soft gasp and pulled her close wrapping an arm around her waist hands started to roam and the kissing became intense and then rapp pulled her head back and rested his forehead against hers he looked into her eyes but before he could speak she gave him a wicked smile and pushed him back onto the bed rapp watched as greta undid her robe letting it fall to the floor she was naked he reached out for her and she slowly climbed onto the bed he pulled her close kissing her neck and running a hand down her perfect smooth naked backside a low rumble of approval passed his lips as he nibbled on her ear and then other parts holding her tight he took control and rolled over rapp held her exquisite face in his hands and looked into her eyes at that moment there was nothing beyond the here and now there was no yesterday or tomorrow he hadnt felt this alive in years chapter beirut lebanon they were to meet two hours after sunrise sayyed asked mughniyah why two hours and he told him it was because the cowardly americans only attacked with the cover of darkness and the jewish dogs with the rising sun at their backs sayyed had seen the jews attack at all hours of the day but he wasnt going to argue with mughniyah at least not considering his current mood sayyed looked down at his little cia guinea pig the man was not doing well none of the nails had grown back enough to use the pliers so hed been forced to drill a hole through one of the agents nail beds to try to get him to respond to his questions instead the man had passed out there were parameters in these situations but they were only parameters you could never tell when you had an outlier on that note sayyed still wasnt sure about cummins given the less than sanitary conditions it was entirely possible that he was seriously ill aziz alabub had taught him how a subject could become sick to the point of the nervous system shutting down once that happened the only thing you could do was nurse the subject back to health and then start over unfortunately mughniyah and the others wanted answers that were simply not here at least not in cumminss head they were distrustful of ivanov and his constant plotting but there was still a deepseated hatred of the americans and jews and they wanted to know if this man knew anything about their missing money beyond that there was a fundamental problem that they had overlooked which was not unusual for the collective group they were far too onedimensional and always looked at a situation as if it were a street battle in beirut attack retreat dig and fightthis was the extent of their military repertoire in the espionage business sayyed had to analyze in three dimensions and project possible outcomes this john cummins was going to eventually end up in the hands of ivanov if for no other reason than that ivanov was used to getting his way sayyed had to be very careful what type of questions he asked with an eye to the fact that the subject would eventually inform ivanov of what hed been asked sayyed would have to start the subject on a cycle of antibiotics the others could talk all they wanted about not handing cummins over but sayyed was done with him there was nothing more to learn and he did not wish to be put in the middle of this fight he wiped the small splotch of blood on the front of the white butchers apron and wondered what he should tell damascus they would want to be fully briefed on the situation but they did not have to deal with all of these crazy palestinians that was the paradox of lebanon in general and beirut specifically the palestinians were supposed to be in palestine not lebanon the palestinians had upset the balance that the turks had kept for centuries their displacement by the jews shattered the fragile peace and plunged the country into civil war and now more than fifteen years later that civil war was over and the palestinians were growing cocksure with relative peace damascus was losing its sway over how all these vying factions conducted themselves damascus for its part was slow to realize what was plain to see the child was now an adult and did not appreciate much less need the consent of the parent fortunately for sayyed he was more like an unclea very nonjudgmental uncle especially this morning sayyed knocked on the metal door and waited for it to be opened by the guard he stepped into the hallway and closed the door behind him looking at the two guards he said he will need medical attention pass the word to the others i want him treated like a baby no more kicking or punching the two men nodded and sayyed moved off down the hallway still struggling with what he should tell damascus he could hardly share the details of the past few days the swiss accounts that had been so carefully set up were now empty damascus had contributed zero to the accounts but they were aware of their existence they did not know however that sayyed had set up an account for himself with the aid of sharif and ivanov he took a cut of every arms shipment that came into the country by helping assure that the various syrian factions would leave the merchants be damascus needed to be kept in the dark as long as possible he stopped in the small sandbagged lobby on the first floor the door was completely blocked and the floortoceiling windows on each side were now nothing but small portholes just enough to allow a man to take up a rifle position oh how he wished those pesky maronites would go away he climbed to the second story and followed the extension cords and phone lines to the makeshift command post once again the hallway was filled with armed men but this time they did not upset sayyed he needed them to deter the christians from doing anything stupid they were living in abject squalor there was no running water electricity or phone service the men were relieving themselves in the basement in random rooms and corners no wonder cummins was sick electricity and phone service would have to be brought in from three blocks away via a series of patched cords and lines that had been spliced into the service of an apartment building the guards stepped aside so he could pass and he entered the command post the men were standing around a sheet of plywood that had been placed on top of two fiftygallon oil drumsmughniyah and badredeen from islamic jihad jalil who was sayyeds iranian counterpart and radih from fatah each man had benefited handsomely from his association with the turkish arms dealer and now they were once again paupers close the door mughniyah commanded sayyed did so and joined the men at the makeshift table well mughniyah asked nothing nothing radih asked obviously dubious sayyed looked at the little toad from fatah and said i have been informed that some of your men have taken certain liberties with my prisoner over the past few days your prisoner radih shouted he is my prisoner the prisoner sayyed said has been kicked and brutalized by your men and due to the lack of sanitary conditions from your men defecating all over the basement like a pack of wild dogs it appears the prisoner is now ill badredeen made a foul face and said really you should institute some basic hygiene at least have the men go on the roof the sun will take care of it for you do want to walk up seven flights of stairs to go to the bathroom radih asked enough yelled an impatient mughniyah he looked from one end of the table to the other making it clear to all that he was not in the mood for petty arguments someone has stolen millions of dollars from us and you want to argue about where the men should shit i was only silence mughniyah screeched with his fists clenched he turned on radih i am sick of it all of the complaining and fighting the bickering and for what it gets us nowhere millions are gone sharif is dead our banker is dead and that vulture ivanov is now talking about coming to beirut for the first time in years am i the only one who finds this a bit disconcerting he told me he had nothing to do with sharifs murder sayyed offered and since when do you believe anything that comes out of a russians mouth i have no trust in the man but on this point he did seem to be upset that someone had killed sharif maybe someone else did kill sharif and that was when ivanov decided that with our turkish friend gone it was the perfect time to take all of the money sayyed considered that one for a moment it was possible ivanov had proven many times that he could be ruthless add to that these damn christians deciding to make a show of strength mughniyah gave a swift shake of his head i like none of it something is very wrong and we know far too little why would ivanov want to visit beirut badredeen asked land all eyes fell on colonel jalil of the iranian quds force explain mughniyah ordered there is a great deal of valuable land here in beirut and many are saying that with war finally behind us there are huge sums of money to be made why cant these people leave us alone mughniyah asked no one in particular what about the americans radih asked we have one of their agents in this very building who was sent here to negotiate the release of the businessman you kidnapped sayyeds tone suggested what he thought of the idea that is the story he has given you sayyed turned his head to look at radih you doubt my ability to get the truth out of people none of us are perfect so you think the american is holding back on us that his coming here is all part of a master plan by the americans to take over beirut i did not say that you did in so many words looking back toward the leaders of islamic jihad he said we do not have enough information to know what is actually happening it could be anyone at this point but based on what we do know we have to assume that ivanov is the front runner so what should we do badredeen asked sayyed thought about it for a moment and then said let him come to beirut keep our eyes and ears open and see what we can find out mughniyah was scratching his beard thinking about what had been said beirut is our fortress spread the word to our people at the docks and the airport i want to know of anything that looks suspicious americans russians jews i dont care and we should alert our allies the iranian said everyone should be extra careful until we know exactly what is going on i agree mughniyah said quietly spread the word to our people in europe especially anyone who has a connection to sharif let them know of our concerns that someone might be targeting us it was the right decision but sayyed needed to add something no mention of the money though at least not yet one by one they all nodded as he knew they would to a man they were too proud to admit that they had been duped out of such a large sum of money chapter zurich switzerland the gulfstream landed at zurich international airport and proceeded to the fueling pad rather than customs the flight plan stated that the plane was stopping for fuel before continuing to kuwait the truck was waiting and while one of the men began to unwind the hose a second man in blue coveralls approached the planes fuselage opened his hand and slapped the side of the plane three times a second later the hatch opened and the stairs lowered the man bounded up the steps and hit the button to pull the stairs back up and close the hatch he checked to make sure the cockpit door was closed and proceeded into the cabin hurley took off the baseball cap and sat in one of the two open chairs across from irene kennedy they were separated by a table good morning hurley tapped the thick file that was sitting in front of the young counterterrorism analyst i assume thats for me kennedy pulled the file closer to herself and said before we get to this there are a few things we need to discuss well lets make it quick because i have a schedule to keep and we need to get you back up in the air before customs comes poking around she nodded as if to say fine and then asked what was the final dollar amount for you know damn well what for oh the thing hurley looked around the cabin as if he was trying to add it all up in his head i suppose somewhere in the neighborhood of hurley flashed her a four with one hand and a five with the other roughly of course a lot of it gets siphoned off along the way fees and whatnot youre sure kennedy asked fairly confident that he was lying to her irene to be frank its really none of your business this is between tom and me well thomas wanted me to ask you facetoface since youre so paranoid about using phones he knows damn well why i dont use phones the same reason he doesnt true but he still wants to know why hurley asked because he thinks youre holding back on him hurley laughed stansfield knew damn well hurley would never give him an official accounting to handle all the blackbag stuff they threw his way he had to have access to piles of cash darling niece i think you are either bending the truth or trying to bluff me which one is it kennedy studied him with a crooked frown none too happy that he had figured out what she was up to a little of both i suppose and why are you trying to stick your pretty little nose where it doesnt belong because some day not too soon i hope you and thomas are going to die and somebody will need to make sense of the tangled web youve left behind if anything happens to me in the next few days tell thomas i said to visit our old friend from berlin who now lives in zurich hell have the answers you need her bluff called kennedy grabbed a file sitting in the seat next to her unlike the bland manila one on the table this one was gray kennedy placed it in front of hurley and opened it to reveal a blackandwhite photograph of a man exiting a car on an unknown city street look familiar hurley glanced at the photo and lied not really this is nikolai shvets name ring a bell a soft bell i have a lot of russian names floating around in my head its hard to keep them all straight kind of like reading war and peace sure kennedy replied not buying a word of it care to guess where this photo was taken hurley glanced at his watch we dont have time to play twenty questions young lady so lets get on with it hamburg a certain bank that drew a lot of interest yesterday any idea why one of mikhail ivanovs top deputies would show up yesterday of all days hurley shook his head he threatened the banks president about some missing funds kennedy searched his face for some recognition and if your answer is still no i wont bother playing you the tape of your old friend ivanov talking to a certain terrorist that weve been looking for hurley frowned he didnt like being forced to answer this kind of question by someone so junior thomas told me kennedy said that you would be reluctant to talk about this but nonetheless i have been ordered to get an answer from you what kind of answer how many people did you piss off yesterday other than the ones we know about it was a thick file hurley shrugged some accounts had names attached to them others were just numbers so your earlier estimate might be a little light get to your point it looks like youve pissed off some people in moscow and you know how they can be when theyre upset the dont play nice if they get so much as an inkling that we were behind any of this she shook her head well be in serious trouble so you want me to confirm what you dont want to hear i just want to know the facts so i can go back and brief thomas he needs to tell our embassy people if they are in danger of reprisals and anyone else who might get stuck in ivanovs crosshairs hurley swore under his breath and finally said yes i took some of the bastards money and with any luck itll be the beginning of the end of him kennedy took the news without comment and placed a small tape player between them now you will be very interested to hear this brief conversation kennedy pressed play and the slurred voice of mikhail ivanov could be heard asking my package is it ready you havent decided to negotiate with the persians have you i am standing by our deal kennedy pressed the stop button you recognize the first voice hurley nodded ivanov correct the second voice no colonel assef sayyed hurley was impressed what the hell are they doing talking on an open line they werent but you didnt hear that from me then howd you get it i cant say kennedy pressed play again when can i expect it to be retrieved i assume you are still sending someone yes although i am considering coming myself you did offer didnt you absolutely good i will be there in three days maybe sooner kennedy hit stop theres more tapes of ivanov and sayyed and others as well youll want to listen to all of them but thomas does not want you bringing the tapes into beirut understood did you happen to pick up badredeen or mughniyah unfortunately no but we have a few others that i think will please you kennedy retrieved another folder from her briefcase and laid it before hurley tarik al ismael music to my fucking ears please tell me you ided the prick hiding right under our noses a few kilometers down the road where hes been working at the un office in geneva attached to the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs if you can believe it he lost a few pounds cut his hair and beard and ditched his contacts for eyeglasses you have to admire his tradecraft kennedy fingered the old photo from his days when he was running operations for the libyan intelligence service and then the new photo its a pretty good effort you sure its him ninety percent on the photo and ninetynine point nine on the voice id and he was calling about money missing from his account if we hadnt had the big ears focused on these banks i dont think we would have ever caught him hurley thought of their conversation last night and frowned so you want to send rapp after him not just me ismael is near the top of thomass list i dont know irene hurley said with obvious reluctance ismael could bite back hes not some fat arms dealer hes a real killer in a perfect world thomas would send all three of you after him but we dont have that luxury right now why lets put beirut off for a few days like a vegas dealer kennedy slid the gray file off to the side and moved the manila file front and center in the transcript you heard ivanov ask if his package was ready yeah he asked sayyed if he was going to negotiate with the persians instead yeah remember what they did to buckley rememberi think about it all the time i was just telling mitch and bobby richards about him well thomas thinks the schnoz is the package they are referring to everything stopped hurley didnt so much as twitch for a good ten seconds hed known the schnoz for close to twenty years and there was a running shopping list in his head of all the operations hed been involved in after a quick assessment of the potential damage he leaned back and dropped the f bomb cummins had worked in moscow before damascus if the russians got their hands on him they would be screwed in some of their most sensitive operations he shook his head to get over the shock and said we cant let that happen thomas agrees he has a source that says schnoz is still alive emaciated and battered but still alive shit thats why he wants you and richards to get to beirut asap as we discussed last night rapp will join up with you tomorrow or the next day in the meantime you two start poking around if you cant find anything in fortyeight hours thomas wants you to use some of the new funds to negotiate for the schnozs release very quietly though of course hurley was still trying to calculate the damage what about backup hes agreed to send a sog team but doesnt want to put them incountry until you have something solid understood sog stood for special operations group there was a good chance hurley would know the men air cover if you need it hell get it last resort though before hurley could comment there was a banging on the side of the plane and he realized it was time to go kennedy passed him two files those are for you this one she said as she handed him a third is for mitch make sure he knows to destroy it before he makes contact with ismael will do hurley stood anything else kennedy joined him in the aisle she didnt want him to go but he was a good soldier so there was no stopping him so much of their shared sorrow revolved around that oncebeautiful city on the eastern shore of the mediterranean hurley could see that she was concerned and he knew why he gave her a hug and said dont worry everything will be fine yeah she said not really believing it herself and holding back the tears beiruts still a nasty place she stayed strong for him there was no turning back now that he knew the only thing to do was support him she kissed him on the cheek and said be careful chapter geneva switzerland when it was all done rapp would swear that he felt the zip of the bullet as it passed his left temple it was that close the only thing that saved him was the awkward movement that the libyan made as he drew his pistol the fake was weak he looked over his left shoulder a bit too dramatically and then swung back to his right drawing his gun his long overcoat flaring like a matadors cape the other reason rapp didnt fall for it was that mean old cuss stan hurley it was the first time rapp could honestly say he was grateful for all the shit hurley had heaped on him all of that damn methodical shitty training paid off in the split second it took ismael to draw his gun and turn on him the fact that rapp didnt want to kill the wrong man also contributed to the harsh reality that he was now cowering behind a swiss mailbox rounds of an undetermined caliber thudding into the metal receptacle at an alarming rate and hurley had been right of course he had told them that there were two ways to win a gunfight either land the first shot or find cover and conserve your ammunition hurley had put them in a situation so similar to this that it was now damn near calming to listen to his opponent mindlessly fire one shot after the next into a foursided box of steel that had survived every change of season for the past fifty years back in the woods of virginia the idea was to find cover while hurley fired live shots at you and mind you he didnt fire them safely over the horizon he liked to hit things close to you not rocks or anything hard enough to cause a lifeending ricochet but soft things like dirt sandbags and wood the object of the lesson was to teach you what it felt like to be shot at so you could keep your head when confronted with the real thing as a bonus you learned to count not just the number of rounds you fired but the number of rounds your opponent fired as well at first the exercise was unnerving but after a while as with most things in life you adapted and got the hang of it rapp squatted his back pressed firmly against the mailbox and counted the number of shots which had been eight so far he was waiting for the inevitable calm in the storm there was a problem however while rapps pistols were equipped with silencers the libyans gun was not eight extremely loud gunshots had rung out in a city with one of the lowest murder rates in the entire industrialized world it might as well have been an artillery barrage there was no telling how many extra magazines the libyan had in his possession but he doubted the man could match the seventytwo rounds rapp carried rapp released the grip of his stillholstered beretta and stabbed the big gray button on his timex digital watch just as hurley had taught him it was set for stopwatch mode the average response time for a police car in a city of this size was roughly three minutes and that was assuming there wasnt one nearby there were rules that were flexible and there were rules that couldnt be broken and killing a police officer was one of those unbreakable rules hurley had told them if you kill a cop i will kill you before they do the first eight shots had come in rapid succession by the sound they were mm or maybe caliber at the most rapp never heard where the first one landed after it flew past his head but the second shot had blown out the driversside window of the white bmw parked a few feet away which was now chirping and beeping like a car with tourettes syndrome the next six had hit the mailbox not a smart move unless he had a second gun and he was closing on him rapp though that unlikely ismael was spooked and on the run which in itself bothered rapp the drive from zurich had been easy just under three hours counting a quick stop to call the answering service and confirm that the target was at his place of work the file was straightforward they were monitoring the calls he made at work they knew where he lived and the make and model of his car hurley gave rapp specific instructions tail ismael after work and follow him to his apartment if he comes out for an errand or an evening stroll and theres an opportunity take him if not wait until morning and shoot him while hes getting into his car rapp had followed the instructions to the letter and when ismael bowed out of his apartment at tenohnine that evening rapp watched him round the corner and then pursued on foot a block later rapp noticed that ismael had a duffel bag slung over his left shoulder it was at that point that the wheels started to turn in rapps head he asked himself if it was normal to leave your apartment on a crisp winter night when you should be getting into bed it wasnt unheard of for someone to head out after ten but it was far from common especially on a tuesday night throw in the overnight bag and you now had someone who might be running that was pretty much what rapp was thinking when ismael pulled his lame matador move that and wondering if he could rush him at the next intersection shoot him in the back of the head and be in france before midnight now because he had failed to head hurleys warnings he was crouched behind a mailbox counting bullets and wondering if ismael had one or two guns one more shot thudded into the mailbox and then there was a twosecond pause rapp stuck out his gloved hand to see if he could draw a shot he pulled it back as a tenth bullet whistled harmlessly past it sparked off the stone sidewalk and skipped down the street rapp thought he heard the clank of a slide locking in the open position but he wasnt sure a split second later he heard the heavy footsteps of someone running that was it he was either reloading or out rapp drew the silenced beretta from under his right arm and bolted between the two parked cars to his left he stayed low glancing over the roofs of the cars he caught a glimpse of the libyan as he took a left turn at the next corner that put a smile on rapps face run all you want he thought the more distance we can put between us and those ten muzzle blasts the better rapp rounded the corner wide and fast trying to keep the parked cars between himself and ismael they were on the left bank or rive gauche and ismael was headed toward the rhone they had just turned off a street that was purely residential and onto one that was a mix of retail and apartments the shops were all closed and fortunately the sidewalk was deserted rapp stayed in the street and broke into a full sprint geneva because it was wedged between two mountain ranges on one end and a lake on the other was even more cramped than your standard european city the streets were barely wide enough for two small cars to pass an american suv was out of the question ismael was a good hundred feet in front of him not an easy shot standing still let alone running and aiming at a moving target rapp kept the pistol at his side long black coat black pants black shoes and a black gun black on black nothing to see he was gaining on ismael with every stride staying low the top of his head just barely visible over the roofs of the vehicles and then ismael saw him as rapp passed from one car to the next there was now no more than seventy feet of separation just over twenty yards either the man was really slow or rapp was really fast or probably both sixty feet and closing was the best rapp could figure when they locked eyes rapp started to raise his pistol to fire but before he had it leveled ismael was swinging the bag around and then all hell broke loose the bag exploded spitting redorange flashes on the dark street rapp turtled dropping behind a nice piece of german steel counting shots was not an option with whatever it was in the overnight bag the rate of fire told rapp that it was probably an uzi or a mac to the uninitiated a gun was a gun but in his new line of work caliber was every bit as important as rate of fire since the mercedes had no problem stopping the rounds rapp concluded it was a mm uzi if it had been the mac he would have felt the punch of the caliber rounds as they penetrated the body and rattled around the interior of the car rapp glanced at his watch as glass rained down on him from the blownout windows he could picture in his minds eye the libyan backing up as he laid down fire the uzi he was firing used either twenty thirtytwo or fortyround magazines the forty was unlikely because it probably wouldnt fit in the bag and if it was twenty he would be done already so that meant it was thirtytwo rounds and he was almost out and once rapp heard the click it would be over there was no way the guy could pull a weapon like that out of a bag and reload it before rapp was on him the bullets stopped the noise replaced by a half dozen car alarms that were now chirping and beeping and screeching and flashing rapp came up with his weapon this time his finger on the trigger ready to fire ismael was gone rapp caught a glimpse of him farther down the block and tore off again staying in the street so he could use the cars for cover the clock in his head was marking time as he pressed his advantage he closed again to within sixty feet ismael looked over his shoulder raised the bag and let loose another burst rapp went into a crouch behind a car but kept moving rapp couldnt be sure if it was a four or fiveround burst but it had stopped and ismael was on the run again rapp thinking the gun was out of bullets or close to being out ran tall now more worried about speed than cover ismael made it to the corner and turned left rapp stayed wide again and when he cleared the corner he came upon the unwelcome sight of ismael standing there with his left arm wrenched around a womans throat rapp didnt look at her he didnt want to look at her old young fat skinny none of it mattered ismaels right hand was still in the duffel bag gripping the uzi which might or might not be out of bullets ismael started screaming at him to drop his weapon or he would kill the woman rapp continued to close as he had been taught his pistol was up directly in front of his face an extension of his left eye which was attached to his brain which was still counting the seconds and telling him to finish this and get the hell out of there the woman was now screaming and for the first time rapp noticed she had a small dog on a leash that was yipping and snapping at ismaels legs he had no doubt that ismael would kill the woman but what purpose would it serve if ismael had any bullets left in that gun he would turn it on rapp right now and zip him with a nice burst to the chest if he shot the woman he was a dead man and he didnt want to die as he had proven very loudly over the last half minute his only way out of this was to kill the man who had been chasing him he was nicely shielded by the woman all he had to do was swing the bag around and unload rapp stopped at twenty feet and decided that since ismael hadnt taken aim at his chest he was bluffing in the end it was the dog that tilted things in rapps favor ismael wisely tried to create some distance between them by stepping back what he didnt know because he hadnt bothered to look down was that the little yipping dog had run a couple of circles around them and his leash had formed a nice little lasso around the libyans ankles ismael stumbled and jerked to his left to catch himself for a brief second the side of his head was clearly visible rapp was now only twenty feet away he squeezed the trigger once and that was all it took chapter beirut lebanon hurley stepped onto the roof a bottle of jack daniels in his hand his thoughts already traveling back in time the hotel was in a neighborhood called bourj hammoud it was controlled by the armenians which was why hurley had decided to stay here for the night the armenians were one of the few factions that had managed to stay neutral during the civil war there had been a few shots fired between the armenians and their maronite neighbors but no major battles it had been a strange daythe meeting with kennedy the briefing with rapp before sending him off and the analysis of the intercepts there was nothing like stealing a mans fortune to get him riled up voices they hadnt tracked in years had popped up beirut was going to be a very targetrich environment before they could leave though they had to look the part he dragged richards to one of zurichs secondhand clothing stores where they purchased some illfitting suits and dress shirts wellworn shoes and some beatup luggage hurley added some gray to his hair and both men skipped shaving they boarded a flight for paris and then on to beirut just two men in a sea of travelers they arrived as the sun was setting on the far end of the mediterranean feeling a mix of anticipation anger and apprehension thats what beirut did to hurley hed spent time in the city before the civil war back when it was a thriving mecca of christians and muslims living side by side socializing raising families enjoying life and for the most part getting along then the plo began to radicalize the slums and demand a say in how things were run the maronites had no intention of sharing rule with these gypsies and the battle lines were drawn no one not even hurley had thought the disagreement so egregious that it would plunge the city into a fifteenyear civil war but it did more than a million had fled were killed hundreds of thousands of people were wounded and crippled and the economy and much of central beirut were laid to waste that such a great city could be so thoroughly destroyed was enough to shake the faith of even the most optimistic at the airport there were a few signs that things were headed in the right direction the part of the terminal that had been severely damaged during the israeli shelling of was now torn down and reconstruction was under way hurley and richards trudged down the metal stairs with their fellow passengers tired and bored lebanese militiamen flanked the travelers and directed them toward immigration and customs the last time hurley had been here immigration and customs consisted of a single portly bureaucrat sitting behind a metal desk on the tarmac his job had been less about border security than about collecting the bribes needed to enter the country now they filed into the airport where there were posterboards announcing ambitious rebuilding plans they threaded through the customs lines trying their best to look tired and bored richards passed with barely a glance he handed over his cash that they called a fee but was more of a bribe because it never saw its way into the treasury hurley had to answer a few questions from the customs official but nothing that was too alarming he thought he caught one of the supervisors standing behind the three customs agents paying him a little too much attention but that after all was his job in the end it was nothing to worry about the man did not intervene or follow them to baggage claim they collected their luggage and stood in line once again this time they were both searched then outside at the cab stand hurley slipped the man a twentydollar bill and told him in arabic that he wanted to pick his own cab for no reason other than the fact that it was random hurley chose the fourth cab in line they took it to the underrenovation intercontinental hotel where they went inside and bought a drink this was also where hurley persuaded the bartender to sell him the bottle of jack daniels from there they found another cab skirted the central business district and had the man drop them off three blocks from the mar yousif inn hurley would have preferred to have had the safe house ready but there was no getting around it not if he wanted to use someone he could absolutely trust besides there was only so much he could control setting up a new base of operations was never easy and was even more difficult in a town like this with shifting battle lines hurley looked out across the skyline he couldnt swear but there seemed be quite a few more lights than there had been a few years earlier perhaps progress was being made he heard some voices and stepped around the top of the blockhouse that encased the stairs a few of the hotel workers were clustered around a folding table sitting in plastic chairs they waved to hurley he flashed them a smile and walked to the far edge beirut was like most densely packed cities in that the inhabitants used roofs to try to escape the claustrophobic feeling of being shut in there was another plastic chair in the corner where he was standing but he didnt feel like sitting he looked north over the rooftops at the ocean way out there on the horizon to the northwest he could make out the glow of the lights on cyprus back to the south the airport was lit up receiving its last few flights for the day a notsowelcome memory started to bubble up hurley gripped the bottle tightly held it to his lips and took a swig of jack with the hope that he could drown it out after a minute he started up a heater and tried to remember the last time hed been in the city he wasnt counting his last trip two years earlier as he had been in and out in less than a day hardly enough time to look up any of his old contacts the city brought back so many memories a few good a lot bad he took another swig but it didnt work this time his gaze was drawn to the west where the old embassy had stood hed been here that dayhere being the bourj hammoud district hurley had met one of his contacts for coffee that morning a man named levon petrosian the armenian crime boss who kept things working during the civil war in addition to making sure the neighborhood had power water and food petrosian handled all of the gambling and prostitution and of course collected a pretty penny in protection money after their meeting hurley decided to take the crazy armenian up on his offer to sample some of the merchandise hurley had been in bed with two women from the armenian highlands of eastern turkey when the explosion rocked the room his worst fears were realized when hed scrambled onto the roof still pulling on his pants bombs were becoming increasingly common back in but this one was much bigger than the average mortar round or rpg the plume of debris and smoke was close enough to the embassy that hurley was certain it had been the target the only question was the amount of damage done hurley raced back to the bedroom to collect the rest of his stuff and then down to the street where his driver was asleep behind the wheel of the company jeep hurley bumped him out of the drivers seat started the jeep and tore off down the street when he arrived and looked up at the sevenstory building his heart was in his throat the front entrance was gone a gaping hole from the seventh floor all the way to the first a big gash between the main part of the embassy and one of the wings strangely enough the roof for the most part was intact he remembered something about its being reinforced to handle all the communications gear theyd put up there as the dust settled the first of the survivors began to crawl out of the building hurley was still holding on to hope at that point it would be two full days before they grasped the extent of the damage by then the hope that hurley had felt in those moments after watching the first survivor come out of the building was entirely gone along with one of his best friends irene kennedys father and sixtytwo others as was standard for the lebanese civil war the locals took the brunt of the blast but in terms of american personnel the cia took the heaviest toll eight agency employees were killed and the near east section was decimated stansfield had been associates deputy director of operations at the time and he had rushed over to assess the damage the guilt hurley felt was overwhelming he tried to resign but stansfield would hear none of it he didnt care that hurley had missed a one oclock meeting at the embassy there was some speculation about that was islamic jihad lucky in their timing or did they have inside information that langleys top people would be meeting at that time and if so some had spoken out loud that it was very convenient that hurley missed the meeting hurley was placed under a microscope by a few higherups but stansfield covered for him his operative was meeting with petrosian the armenian and the meeting had gone longer than anticipated that was as much as anyone needed to know the fact that he was in bed with two hookers while the van crashed through the gate was inconsequential they had already lost enough good people they didnt need to lose another because of his vicesvices that stansfield was well aware of hurley knew stansfield was right but that didnt mean he could simply ignore what had happened he was an operational wreck for those next few months stansfield received a report that muslim men were turning up dead in areas of the city that were known to be relatively peaceful completely randomly and at all hours of the day one man was shot while reading the paper on his small terrace another was strangled in the bathroom of a public restroom another killed leaving a nightclub all three men had loose connections to islamic jihad stansfield called hurley back to dc to ask him if he knew anything about the murders and to his astonishment hurley admitted to the killings stansfield could not allow one of his oldest friends and best operatives to go running off halfcocked killing whomever he wanted even if the targets were somewhat legitimate as hurley had pointed out islamic jihad had declared war on the united states he was simply obliging them by participating in the war there was a bit of logic in his thinking but langley couldnt afford any more scrapes with the press and the politicians at the moment the solution was easy things were heating up along the afghanistanpakistan border and hurley knew the russians better than anyone so stansfield shipped him off to peshawar to help train and equip the mujahedeen and now almost ten years later here he was full circle right back in this stew of religious fascists who all fervently believed they and they alone knew what god wanted hurley had been trying to warn langley for years that these islamic wack jobs were the next big problem hed seen both fronts up close beirut and afghanistan and the afghanis made these guys look like pikers any culture that swaddles its women from head to toe and refuses a drop of booze while exporting opium around the globe is seriously screwedup another of hurleys rules was to be extremely distrustful of anyone who didnt drink afghanistan was an entire society that didnt drink and it scared the piss out of him hurley took a pull from the bottle and shook out another cigarette he lit it blew the smoke up into the ocean breeze and thought about tomorrow the safe house should be set up and equipped by then and the backup would be ready by early afternoon hed have to see what kind of info the agency guy had and if it wasnt enough hed go pay petrosian a call hurley had heard he owned more than two thousand apartment units in the neighborhood that would generate a lot of income but a guy like petrosian could always use more money and that was one thing that hurley finally had a lot of what he didnt have was time if they were going to save the schnoz they would have to work fast sometimes working fast could be used to your advantage but you had to mix it up and theyd been moving at a pretty good clip for about a week sharif dorfman and by now ismael they might as well stay on the attack for a few more days hurley looked at the bottle of tennessee whisky and wondered if hed come back to beirut to die all the times hed cheated death all the men hed killed over the years all the gods real or imagined that hed pissed off if it was anyones time it should be his looking skyward he said dont piss off the gods he poured some of the whisky down his gullet and smiled if it was his time so be it chapter martyrs square beirut sundown was shortly after five in the evening and sunrise shortly after six in the morning with limited power in the building and no curtains on the windows there wasnt much to do after sundown so sayyed had gone to bed early loyal samir had scrounged up a mattress and a lantern and set up a room for him on the fifth floor away from all of the men and most of the noise hed checked on the two prisoners briefly to make sure they were following his orders the businessman was faring much better than the spy sayyed had brought a doctor in to take a look at cummins and the prognosis wasnt good due to the beatings poor diet and unsanitary conditions the doctor feared he was suffering from liver failure the news upset sayyed he had been warning the guards for several weeks to lay off the prisoners but they somehow couldnt get it through their thick heads that the two men were worthless to them if they were dead add to that the stress of the missing money and ivanov coming to town and it was enough to make sayyeds temper flare out of control he gathered the men in the basement and told them he would execute the next man who dared lay a hand on either prisoner he caught one of the men rolling his eyes at the order and before the imbecile knew it sayyed had the muzzle of his markov pistol pressed firmly against his forehead the others finally got the point sayyed went to bed wondering if they would rebel or follow his orders it was just another thing to add to his general discomfort he did not sleep well his dreams vivid and bizarre taunted and tortured him he was running he must have been on the beach because no matter how fast he told himself to run his legs plodded along as if they were stuck in deep sand there was a dense fog so thick that he could see no farther than the end of his hand jets were overhead screeching and dropping deafening bombs in the distance bright flashes erupted through the marine layer the noises of the big bombs muted by the moisture in the air why was he running toward the bombs what was he running from he woke up with a start his heart pounding out of his chest covered in sweat sayyed looked around the office where hed decided to spend the night a soft moonlight spilled in from the blownout window there was a pile of garbage in the corner where samir had swept the glass and debris scavengers had taken everything the furniture even the carpeting had been pulled up leaving only the bare concrete floor and the dried glue that had been used to hold the carpeting down the whole thing was depressing the geniuses in damascus should all be forced to live like this for a night sayyed decided to get some air he pulled on his shirt but didnt bother to button it up he climbed two flights to the roof and with a murmur greeted the two men standing watch all was quiet across the street he lit a cigarette and wondered what ivanov was up to the man was always plotting given the choice between making a fortune the honest way and stealing it from someone he was convinced ivanov would prefer to steal it he was a thief at heart it was in no way a stretch to think of him plotting to kill sharif and then with the turk out of the way killing dorfman and taking everything for himself sayyed sighed he wished he could skip ahead a day or two be done with this mess and go back to damascus for a few weeks his two girls were grown and married and had very little to do with him and that was fine he didnt particularly care for their husbands beyond that he had never been around when they were growing up so there was no real connection his wifethey barely spoke the women in life werent the draw civilization was the draw running water and functioning toilets and sleeping in a clean bed without fear of two thousand pounds of steel and high explosives being dropped on your head thats what he needed a vcr and a stack of movies and some sleep he needed to recharge if he could run he would walk out of this hellhole of a city and leave it all behind hed considered it many times as his pot of money grew with herr dorfman another year or two and he would have made it he could have gone back to damascus retired and used the money he had stashed away in switzerland to invest in opportunities as beirut stabilized he could have lived like a wealthy sheik all of those years of hard work gone in an instant it was almost impossible to bear he finished his cigarette and looked at the stars he did not like having to stay in one place like this especially a place so primitive the food was horrid and infrequent the conditions ripe for illness and he couldnt sleep and if he couldnt sleep he would make mistakes mistakes were not something he could afford these next few days he did not want to go back to the depressing room with the soiled mattress but he had to at least to close his eyes and rest sayyed plodded down the steps and into the dark room he took his shirt off setting it on the floor and then lay back down on the dirty mattress trying to ignore the stench the crux of the problem was the money and it was a bigger problem than any of them realized they were all lamenting their loss of personal wealth but the dire situation lay in their inability to pay their people there were a few mentally unstable militants who would work for free but the bulk of the foot soldiers would walk away they were paid in cash every week and payday was thursday they would be able to scrape together enough to get through this week but then they would be bankrupt the following week they had to pay their monthly bribes to the police politicians bureaucrats and spies in the other camps there would be hundreds if not thousands of hands extended waiting for the money and behind them families waiting to put food on the table if they did not rectify this situation quickly it could be a major disaster the maronites and the other factions would swoop in and pick up territory it had taken them years and thousands of men to gain everything they had worked for would unravel he would have to tell damascus and of course leave his personal loss out of it they were likely to punish him by banishing him to yamouk the bleak palestinian refugee camp on the outskirts of damascus that was teeming with the pushy tribe in search of a permanent home he heard footsteps down the hall and then some voices they sounded as if they were going from room to room looking toward the open doorway he saw the beam of a flashlight sayyed grabbed his pistol and sat up hes up here somewhere he heard a voice in the hallway say who is it sayyed asked its me ive been looking all over for you sayyed recognized radihs voice and lowered his gun im in here radih appeared in the doorway three other men were behind him assef you are not going to believe the news i bring you radih clapped his hands together sayyed looked for his watch but couldnt find it what time is it nearly two in the morning you must get up i have amazing news sayyed sighed he half rolled off the mattress looking for his watch he found it strapped it on and then grabbed his shirt it better be good i need some sleep you will not be disappointed sayyed felt like crap he needed water and then coffee and then some food in that order and then maybe he could think clearly he motioned for radih to get on with the story radih told his men to leave and in a hushed voice said do you remember an american who went by the name bill sherman did he remember him the man had purportedly killed sayyeds predecessor while he was enjoying his breakfast one spring morning of course my spies at the airport one of them says he saw sherman tonight at the airport yes he came in on a flight from paris along with another man sayyed was dubious there had been rumors here and there that sherman had been back to the city in fact anytime someone met his end at the hands of an assassin shermans name somehow became attached how can you be so sure it has been many years since anyone has seen him my man says he has aged his hair has gone gray but the eyesradih pointed to his ownhe said they are those same eyes eyes of the devil he said he remembers him as a very nasty man with many vices sayyeds lips felt unusually parched he found the jug of water that samir had left in the corner and took a drink why would the americans send sherman to beirut after all these years the most obvious answer was in the basement of this very building they wanted their agent back but why send an assassin like sherman the man was a harbinger of death not a negotiator turning back to radih he asked did your spy happen to know where he was headed with a selfsatisfied grin radih said i put out the word yesterday after our meeting i told everyone to be on the lookout for anything suspicious my people know how to do their jobs they followed him and the other man to the intercontinental and they had a drink at the bar and he bought a bottle of jack daniels from the bartender and then got into a cab one of ours he had the cabble drop him off in front of a hotel on daoura after the cabbie was gone they walked three blocks to a different hotel which one the mar yousif inn and he is there right now yes they got two rooms for one night i just spoke to the manager they are still there are you sure sayyed asked skeptically the bill sherman i remember would never allow himself to be followed my men are good we have trained them to use radios they have a system set up the airport when they see someone who might be a fat target they follow him and pass the word to me we then swoop in and grab them i have men heading to the area now theres only one problem what the hotel is in bourj hammoud sayyed needed to wake up normally he would never ask such a stupid question the sherman he remembered was tight with the armenians this would have to be handled delicately if we get in a gun battle in bourj hammoud we might not make it out alive radih did not disagree we can wait and follow him if he leaves the bourj we can grab him they had been lucky enough to stumble across him that luck would not hold with a man like sherman he would see them sooner rather than later and then he would kill whoever it was who was watching him and disappear tell your men to hold radih seemed relieved and then what the chief of police owes me a favor they can operate in bourj hammoud without too much trouble this time radih shook his head im not so sure normally you would be correct but there are some things that you are unaware of some influential armenians owe the chief a few favors as long as we arent going in to take one of their own we will be fine if a single shot is fired radih winced at the thought sayyed finished it for him the entire neighborhood could erupt such was the reality of beirut the city was always one gun battle away from plunging back into chaos and civil war chapter when he hit the midway point of the last run of stairs that led to the small lobby hurley noticed the man sitting in the chair with his back to the door it was probably nothing but then again hurley had survived all these years by noticing the little things if enough of them piled up they usually led to trouble there was a couch and three chairs the man was in the chair the farthest to hurleys leftthe same seat he would have chosen if he was to keep an eye on any guests coming down hurley watched him intently as he crossed the redtiled floor the man slowly closed his eyes and went back to dozing rather than head straight out hurley stopped at the desk no one was there he looked through the open door of the small office and couldnt see anyone but could hear a tv looking back over his shoulder he checked to make sure the fat man in the chair was still in his position he had his eyes closed again and appeared to be dozing hurley checked him off his list the pay phone was behind the man in a quaint claustrophobic alcove rather than use it hurley decided to head outside and take in the lay of the land when he reached the front door he paused to see if there were any goons loitering if there were he would head back up to the room grab richards and they would head to the roof they could make it two buildings in either direction by hopping from one roof to the next and then use any of the adjoining apartment buildings to make their escape the sidewalk in front of the hotel was empty so he stepped outside tapped out a camel and fired it up he casually looked up and down the block he counted eight cars that he had seen the night before and one new one and it was only a small twodoor hatchback nothing to be alarmed about right or left it was funny how often thats what it came down toa flip of the coin he chose left it was slightly uphill not that it mattered but he remembered seeing a small market in that direction the night before and it had a pay phone out front he flipped the butt of his heater into the street to join the menagerie of discarded brands and started moving it was before eight and the street wasnt busy it was empty in fact he saw two cars drive through the next intersection moving from right to left and then a man with a briefcase hustled across the street hurley couldnt remember if it was normal or abnormal for a city like beirut to be so slow at this time every city had a different pulse some were bustling by seven but most mediterranean cities were a little slowerpaced especially one that had endured as much trauma as this one there was a boy standing in front of the market hurley guessed him to be about eight as hurley approached the boy held out a paper and started giving him his pitch hurley smiled at him he didnt care where he was you had to admire a kid who got his ass out of bed to sell something he reached into his pocket to grab some money and right about the time he had a firm grip on his wallet alarm bells started going off there was movement to his left from the market two or three car engines turned over and then there were footfalls hurley looked left then right and then noticed that the cute little kid was backpedaling to get out of the way two men came out of the supermarketbig burly guys in uniforms who stopped just out of his reach car tires were now squealing and engines were roaring as vehicles closed in from three directions hurley turned with the idea of running back toward the hotel but there were two more men hoofing it up the sidewalk one of them had a big german shepherd on a leash thats new he thought never having seen a police dog in the city in less than five seconds he was surrounded by ten men and three sedans six of the men were wearing police uniforms and four were in civilian attire the civilians had pistols drawn they could be either part of a militia or detectives or worse syrian intelligence officers the uniformed police were wielding wooden truncheons interesting hurley thought to himself not a single one of them attempted to lay a hand on him hurley calculated the odds while he slowly reached for his cigarettes even if he had had a gun he wasnt sure he could have gotten himself out of this jam they all looked nervous which in itself told him something someone had prepped these guys told them to keep their distance which was not standard operating procedure in this part of the world normally it was club first and ask questions later hurley lit his cigarette with the steady hand of a brain surgeon he greeted the men in arabic and asked what seems to be the problem good morning announced a smiling man in a threepiece suit who appeared just beyond the phalanx of men we have been waiting for you mr sherman he glanced ever so slightly at the two men behind hurley and gave a them a nod hurley turned and blocked the first blow with his left hand wrist to wrist and then delivered a palm strike to the mans nose he ripped the truncheon from the mans hand and ducked just in time to miss the blow from his partner the man was out of position from swinging so hard and had left his ribs exposed so hurley rammed him with the truncheon and sent him to the ground just as he turned to face the others he was cracked across the head and then the back he dropped to one knee and then to the ground as the batons and feet came crashing down as they took the fight out of him hurley lay bleeding and hoping that richards had enough time to run chapter rapp rocked the clutch of the little silver renault clio and closed the gap between himself and the next car waiting to get through the checkpoint to beirut proper it was his third checkpoint since the syrian border the little liter engine was about as big as the one on his dads old john deere riding mower if he had to run from the authorities it would be a very short chase hed been in line now for about fifteen minutes inching his way forward a few feet at a time the car didnt have any airconditioning so he had the windows rolled down rapp slapped his hands on the steering wheel to the beat of some atrocious techno music that hed picked up at the airport the title of the album was euro trash and he agreed he would have preferred a little u or maybe some bob seger but the idea here was to make them think he was french not some american assassin on safari third in line now he leaned out the window to get a better look at the teenager holding the ak assault rifle rapp had no idea which faction he belonged to but the kid seemed calm enough the first checkpoints were manned by the syrian army and then as he neared the city the militias were in charge hed found a pay phone at a gas station along the way and called in to check on things the automated voice told him his room was ready and gave him the address and the location rapp wrote it down memorized it while on the road then crumpled it up and threw it out the window the file told him to expect four checkpoints counting the border each one would cost him between five and twenty dollars so far whoever had put it together was right on the mark the line snaked ahead and rapp yawned it was finally catching up with him after sinking a hollowtipped parabellum into ismaels head rapp had steadily retreated keeping his gun leveled at the woman who was temporarily frozen with shock rapp wasnt going to shoot her and wasnt worried that she would shoot him he kept his weapon raised to conceal his face and to deter her from looking too closely at him people in general did not like to look down the barrel of a loaded gun when the woman finally glanced down at the man who had threatened her life only moments before rapp turned and ran he didnt turn the corner because he did not want to head back down the street where ismael had just fired the uzi half the block was likely to be looking out their windows and a few of them would be on the phone with the police so he ran straight at an allout sprint for two blocks the gun at his side then he took a hard right turn and stopped his breathing was heavy but under control he holstered the pistol while he looked for a place to reverse his jacket twenty feet ahead on his right there was a stoop that would offer some concealment rapp ducked into the shadows tore off his overcoat and turned it inside out he tossed the clear blackrimmed glasses to the ground and mussed up his slickedback hair before emerging from the shadows wearing a khaki trenchcoat he headed back to the corner hed just rounded the distinctly european police klaxon could be heard screeching in the distance rapp calmly crossed the street looking to his left he could just barely make out the woman she had been joined by three or four people rapp acted as if he didnt notice after he cleared the intersection he picked up the pace but not so much as to draw attention he looked like a man out for a brisk walk the rhone was now only a block and a half in front of him with each step the sirens grew in force but rapp wasnt worried they would go to the body first and then they would check the damage caused by the libyans uzi and then they would begin to look for a suspect rapp reached the river which at this point was fairly wide he turned right and after looking up and down the block to make sure no one was watching he casually slid his left hand between the folds of his jacket and grabbed the beretta hed used to kill ismael rapp waited until he was in the shadows between two street lights and then drew the gun he flipped it casually a good twenty feet into the icecold water and kept moving a block after that he disposed of the second gun then had to make his first big decision just on the other side of the river one mile away was geneva international airport if he hustled he might be able to catch the last flight out to paris airports made him nervous though there were always cameras and police and if you were going to get on a plane you had to buy a ticket and show a passport and that left a trail his legends were to be cultivated and protected not used for convenience sake so he turned back for the rental car and rehearsed what he would tell the police if they stopped him fortunately the story was never needed police were flooding the area but they were still headed to the crime scene on his way back he didnt see a single police car heading out to look for suspects when he climbed behind the wheel of the rental car he checked his stopwatch four minutes and thirtyseven seconds had elapsed since hed taken refuge behind the mailbox not bad once behind the wheel he had a lot of options the primary plan was to cross the border into france and then drive to lyon but he was too pumpedup and with the border crossing so close they might be looking for a man of his general description again there was no longer any hard evidence that could tie him to ismaels death but why push it rapp wasnt sure he could calm his nerves for the border crossing the reality of what hed just been through was setting in there was no queasiness or feeling of nausea he was simply pumped the feeling very similar to the way he felt after scoring a gamewinning goal but better he cranked the music and headed back for zurich greta was on his mind but there wouldnt be time hed have to grab the first flight to paris or istanbul and then on to damascus he made it to zurich just before four parked in the rental car lot and tried to grab a few hours of sleep before things opened at six it didnt work though and he sat there with his seat reclined playing it over and over in his head until he had analyzed every second of what had happened with ismael each mistake was noted and alternatives explored but as his old highschool coach liked to say a win is a win it doesnt matter how ugly it is strip it all down and thats what it was rapp won and ismael lost as the sun started to rise rapp looked out from the concrete parking structure and realized that one day he might be in ismaels shoes hed pretty much spent the rest of the morning thinking of ways to prevent himself from ending up with a fate similar to that of the libyan intelligence officer from zurich to istanbul and then damascus and all the way down this hot dusty road to beirut he played a game of chess with himself what should ismael have done and how should he have reacted if ismael had done something different exhaustion was finally catching up rapp let out a long yawn and then the kid motioned him forward rapp greeted the kid in french he couldnt have been more than sixteen rapp smiled while he tapped out the techno beat and chomped on his gum what is your purpose the kid asked with a lack of enthusiasm youd expect from someone who was expected to stand in the sun all day sucking on emissions and asking the same question over and over business what kind of business software the kid shook his head whats that computer stuff rapp reached over and picked up the flashy color brochure theyd ordered from a french company he showed the kid who was by now bored with their conversation i like your music really rapp said surprised are you here every day the kid nodded rapp looked over at the kids dusty boom box and then reached over and ejected the tape he slid it into the case and said ive been listening to it for a week straight knock yourself out ill pick it up when i drive back out in a few days the kid was excited and lowered his rifle thanks for you half price today he flashed rapp five fingers rapp paid him smiled slipped the little car back into gear and drove away it took him another twenty minutes to find the safe house based on the stories hed heard from hurley he was surprised that during that time he didnt run into any more armed men as per his training he did a normal driveby and barely glanced at the building all he wanted to do was go to sleep but it had been drilled into him that these were the precautions that would save his life so he continued past and then circled back checking the next block in each direction it was a fivestory apartment building among four five and sixstory apartment buildings rapp was too tired to care if it had any architectural characteristics beyond a front and back door he parked the car grabbed his bag and entered the building he didnt have a gun on him at least not yet so there was pretty much only one thing to do climb the stairs if it was a trap hed have to throw his bag at them and lie down and take a nap no one was waiting for him when he got to the fifth floor there were three doors on the left and three on the right they had the two on the right toward the back or so he thought after checking above each door he came up empty so he checked the ones across the hall and found two keys that was when he remembered he was supposed to enter from the back of the building that snapped him out of it a bit that and the lesson that he might be ismael some day he told himself to slow down and stop rushing things he checked his watch it was twoeleven in the afternoon he hadnt slept in more than a day and the day before that only a few hours he opened the door and closed and locked it behind him he could barely keep his eyes open but he still dug out the doorstop and wedged it under the door not bothering to check the rest of the place he went into the bedroom and opened the closet there on the floor was a suitcase that looked a lot like the one from istanbul rapp placed it on the bed opened it and found three beretta fs with silencers and extra magazines it was the same suitcase rapp loaded one of the guns and put the suitcase away with his last bit of strength he stripped down to his boxers and climbed under the covers of the twin bed he shoved the pistol under the pillow and wondered who the person was who went from city to city dropping off their tools of the trade would he ever get the chance to meet this mystery man or woman probably not as hurley liked to say they were on a needtoknow basis and there wasnt a lot they needed to know rapp began to drift off to sleep even though he knew that hurley and richards would probably be there in a minute he figured any sleep was better than none chapter the bag theyd placed over his head offered a mix of putrid smellsfeces vomit snot and blood all mixed together with the sweat of all the men who had worn it before him and it wasnt the perspiration of exertion it was the ripe sweat of fear an allout assault on his olfactory system designed to make him pliable to whoever it was who would walk through the door and begin asking questions hurley had no idea where he was other than the fact that he was in a basement hed felt the stairs as theyd dragged him from the trunk of a car and into the building it was the second car hed been in that morning in the midst of his pummeling by the police he blurted out the only name that he thought might help levon petrosian i am a friend of petrosian the clubbing and kicking stopped almost immediately and then one of the men asked him what hed said hurley could tell it was the portly one in the threepiece suit even though he couldnt see him the man ordered him cuffed and placed in the backseat of one of the cars they were not gentle but hurley did not expect them to be so it wasnt too bad that was when they placed the first hood on his head it wasnt too bad really it could have used a good cleaning but at least it didnt smell like a bowl of shit he marked the time in the back of the car counting the seconds and trying to make sense of the noises beyond the glass windows the metal cuffs were biting into his skin he twisted his wrists around and tried to see if he could get out of them but it was no use twentyseven seconds later the car doors opened hurley couldnt be sure but he thought two men got in the front seat and one man joined him in the back he felt something hard jabbed into his ribs dont move or i will kill you hurley couldnt be sure if the object at his side was a gun or a truncheon fuck you the object was jabbed even harder into his side you shouldnt talk to a policeman like that the voice came from the front seat it was the older pudgeball policeman hurley said with open disdain if youre cops what am i being arrested for for striking a police officer one of my men has a broken nose you mean the one who was going to crack me over the back of the head with his stick i have a great idea dont bullshit me and i wont bullshit you striking a police officer is a very serious matter yeah so is kidnapping so why dont you just pull over and let me go and ill make sure no one puts a price on your head are you threatening us just telling you the truth i make it a habit not to kill cops that is unless they are corrupt hurley doubled over as the man next to him delivered a stinging blow with whatever it was that he was holding hurley recovered and said i cant wait to tell petrosian about this the first thing im going to dohurley turned to his right as if he could actually see the man next to himis take that stick of yours and shove it up your ass although youd probably like that wouldnt you hurley expected it this time and folded his arms up quickly locking the object between his right biceps and forearm then he reeled his head back and smashed it in the general direction of the other mans head they hit forehead to forehead like two pool balls a loud resounding crack despite the pain that hurley felt he started laughing wildly and kicking and thrashing that was when they decided to pull over and put him in the trunk not long after that maybe ten minutes they stopped pulled him out of the trunk and stripped him down to his birthday suit hurley endured this part without comment he had a sinking feeling where this was all headed and it was bleak to say the least he held out hope though that richards had been able to get away they wasted no time tossing him into the trunk of a second car and speeding off it was a bumpy ride and it must have been an older car because the fumes grew so strong that hurley started to think he would suffocate it occurred to him that that might be the best possible outcome fall asleep and die from carbon monoxide poisoning he could skip all of the degradation and take his secrets with him unfortunately he had survived and they had dragged him into this dank basement that smelled like an outhouse theyd switched out the hood that the police had used and put this disgusting burlap bag on his head hurley took in shallow breaths through his mouth and focused his mind throwing up under this thing would be extremely unpleasant but then again there was a really good chance that he was about to endure the most repugnant degradation the mind could imagine so why worry the mind hurley knew could only take so much before it simply opened up and let the secrets spill out they said everyone eventually broke but hurley didnt think of himself as everyone he was a mean nasty man who might have lost a step but he was still very much in control of his mind under the smelly hood he smiled at the challenge ahead of him he went through the long nasty list of the things they would do to him he committed himself to fighting them every step of the way and if he was lucky theyd either intentionally or accidentally kill him and that was a victory he would take in a heartbeat hurley sat there for at least an hour he was bored because he knew what they were doing and hed just as soon get on with it isolation was a standard interrogationtorture technique and while it worked on most people it was useless on hurley because of the simple fact that he really didnt like people all that much there were a few here and there that hed met over the years who could hold his interest but most others were either boring or irritating there were noises on the other side of the door footsteps some talking but nothing he could make out and then the door opened hurley tried to count the different steps his best guess was three or four men they spread out around him someone approached him from behind and hurley resisted the impulse to flinch the man grabbed the burlap bag and yanked it from his head hurley blinked several times and took a look around the room an industrial lamp hung from the ceiling a brown extension cord snaking its way to the door hurley looked at the three men he could see two were familiar gentlemen there must be some misunderstanding here hurley announced in an easy tone i thought hostilities in beirut were over the two men in front of hurley shared a brief smile the older one said mr sherman i have been looking forward to this for some time so have i sayyed so you know who i am sayyed asked with a raised eyebrow i sure do youre the gsd goon here in beirut and you mr sherman are a cia assassin hurley looked as if he had to think about that for a second and then he nodded and said that would be correct i kill people like you for a living in fact i killed your boss hisham sayyed nodded this was going to be very interesting it really was a shame that you werent at the embassy that afternoon we planned the entire operation with the hope that you would be there yeah it was a real shame although ive tried to make up for it over the years by killing as many of you assholes as i can sayyed gave him an affable smile it looks like your killing days have come to an end possibly hurley surveyed the dank room things dont look so good but im always up for a challenge this is a challenge you will not win and you know that im afraid i dont you see im a fuckedup guy im not okay in the head and i pretty much hate you limp dicks more than i love life so this is gonna be a tough one really mr sherman your false bravado is so american so hollywood hurley winced at the word hollywood as if it pained him to be associated with the town no false bravado here sayyed i am going to fuck with you until i take my last breath im going to feed you so much disinformation you wont know what to believe youll be killing your own people before its all over you wont sleep at night and when you do youll be dreaming of traitors around every corner spies in your own camp this is going to be a blast really yep hurley gave him a nod to confirm his conviction the two of us are going to take a little trip into the bowels of my sick mind and trust me you wont make it out unscathed ha sayyed laughed this was a first fine i think we should begin our journey dont you absolutely the sooner the better thats my motto why have you decided to come back to beirut after all these years you know why im here lets not assume i know your motives hurley smiled you have something i want and what would that be hurley had thought about this while he had sat under the putrid hood ivanov was due to show up the day after tomorrow and he would be desperate they were all desperate because hurley himself had drained their little secret bank accounts he just hoped they hadnt gotten their hands on richards and if they had that he would be smart enough to leave hamburg out of his interrogation he needed to make this seem to be about exactly what it was without the money coming up i am here to negotiate the release of john cummins and why would i give him to you hurley tilted his head back and looked up at the ceiling well lets think about that if you give him back to me i wont kill you this elicited laughter from all including hurley sayyed stopped laughing abruptly and snapped his fingers he looked at one of his men and pointed at the door the men left and came back a few seconds later wheeling the small stainlesssteel cart sayyed took it from him and positioned it next to the subject he smiled at hurley and picked up the pliers opening and closing them manicure hurley asked i like to call it twenty questions youre so clever sayyed hurley said his voice dripping with mock admiration kind of like a game show i cant wait to get started good lets start with your real name jack mehoff hurley offered straightfaced jack mehoff sayyed repeated that is your real name of course it isnt you fucking moron jack mehoff jack me off come on lets go off with the first fingernail you win i lose lets go sayyed searched the subjects face for a sign of stress he had never had a prisoner ask to have his fingernail torn off his demeanor would change in a second though sayyed chose the forefinger on the left hand and wedged the grip of the pliers in under the nail bed last chance your first name dont change the rules on me very confusing for your subjects you said twenty questions i blew the first one come on lets go hurley said with a smile sayyed clamped down hard on the pliers and began to rock the nail back and forth oh yeah hurley announced lets get this party started sayyed gave it one good yank and ripped the entire nail off holy mary mother hurley unleashed a string of swear words and then started laughing damn that stings if that doesnt wake you up nothing will this is great his laughing grew to the point where he couldnt control it he was shaking so hard his eyes started to tear up oh i cant wait for the next one this is fucking great sayyed remained undeterred your name bill donovan really nope really mr sherman what is the harm in your telling us your first name probably nothing at this point but its my nature to fuck with guys like you i will ask the question again sayyed stayed steady what is your real name ulysses s grant you are lying of course you fucking idiot dont you read history sayyed moved in for the second fingernail he wedged the pliers under the nail bed wiggled it again to make sure he had a good enough grip and then looked into hurleys eyes he didnt like what he saw it was the wildeyed look of a crazy man do it come on hurley egged him on what are you waiting for youre not turning into a pussy on me are you part of sayyed knew he should stop and come back later when he could control the situation the men were here however so he needed to pull this second nail and then let this lunatic sit and stew for a while probably come back and use electricity he tightened his grip and yanked the second nail free hurley howled again with the laughter of a madman the shrieking turned to cackles and then uncontrollable laughter his eyes were filled with tears as he yelled eighteen more to go heeee hawwww sayyed dropped the pliers on the cart thats right well give you a little rest before we start with the others he started for the door hurley looked at the other man who was standing in front of him is that you abu abu radih i havent seen you in years i heard you have your own little terrorist group now fatah look at you all grownup hurley said admiringly radih smiled and shook his head he clearly thought the american insane hurley tilted his head to the side as if trying to recall some distant memory i bet you werent more than four feet tall when i used to fuck your mother did you tell your friends that she was a prostitute hurley craned his head to look at the other two men his mom could suck cock better than any whore i ever met and trust me ive been with a lot of whores the smile left radihs face in an instant he lashed out with his right fist hitting hurley in the mouth hurleys head rocked back from the blow and then before radih could throw another punch sayyed grabbed him from behind no sayyed ordered do not let him get to you hurley shook the sting and fog from his head and came up smiling one of his top middle teeth had been knocked out and his mouth was filling with blood look hurley yelled showing them the gap in his top row look you knocked my tooth out radih and sayyed stopped struggling for a second and that was when hurley unleashed a gob of blood and the one busted tooth from his mouth the bulk of it hit radih in the face with his arms tied behind his back and his legs taped to the chair hurley started bouncing the chair an inch at a time toward the two men snapping his teeth and barking like a dog chapter moscow russia it was almost noon and ivanov was still in bed he claimed he wasnt feeling well moaned something about the snow and the cold and the gray depressing moscow sky of course it had nothing to do with all of the vodka and wine and heavy foods hed consumed until well past midnight shvets would have liked to throw him in a cold snowdrift and shock him back to the here and now the young russian didnt understand depression he couldnt see how people allowed it to get so bad that they couldnt get out of bed was unable to understand that the drinking and the sleeping were all intertwined like a big sheet wrapped around your body until you couldnt move and then you started sinking stop the drinking get out of bed and work out have a purpose in life it was not complicated shvets crossed from one end of the parlor to the other glancing at alexei who was onehalf of his bosss favorite bodyguard duo they were in a corner suite on the top floor of hotel baltschug he looked out the big window across the frozen moscow river at the kremlin red square and st basils cathedral shvets had never understood why the bolsheviks had let the cathedral stand they were so anticzar so antireligion why let this one church remain while they destroyed so many others the answer probably lay in their own doubts about what they were doing the people has risen up and helped them grab power but the people were a tough beast to tame shvets thought they probably feared it would bring about another revolution frost had build up around the edges of the window it was minus twenty degrees celsius and the wind was blowing whipping up clouds of snow but so what that was february in moscow only a weak man allows the weather to affect his mood shvets let out a long exhalation his breath forming a fog on the window that froze within seconds ivanov was about to drag him down take him under like some fool walking out onto the melting march ice of the moscow river these werent the old days of deportation to a siberian work camp and executions against the back wall at lubyanka but the government was by no means just the new regime was just more astute at pr they could still be beaten senseless and be forced to sign false confessions of crimes against the state and whatever else they decided to trump up then they would be taken to the woods and shot far away from the ears of the people and the new press ivanov would of course try to save his vodkasoaked hide that was his nature he would blame anyone but himself and since shvets was the person most directly in the line of fire the only person other than ivanov who had actually met herr dorfman he would be the scapegoat gripped with an unusual fear shvets had a sudden urge to flee he paced from one end of the parlor and back trying to calm himself but he couldnt the idea of running was suddenly in front of him like a big flashing road signing warning the bridge is out turn now or crash but he had a wife and two boysnot that he saw them very much or really loved them or more precisely her the boys were too young to judge his wife on the other hand had been a mistake shed gotten fat and lazy and shvets spent as little time with her as possible he could certainly live without them but could he live with himself if anything happened to them he wasnt sure about that one so he set it aside starting over was the other problem as ivanovs top deputy he was poised for lofty heights within the svr and like his boss he could leverage that for personal gain in the notsodistant future that was something he did not want to give up without a fight but the rumors were starting and by next week they would be undeniable he had either to run or turn on ivanov go to svr headquarters and ask for a facetoface with director primakov even as he thought about it he knew it would be far riskier than running it was easy to trick himself into thinking they would reward him for doing the right thing but the svr was not all that different from the old kgb you were rewarded for plotting conspiring and crushing your political and professional opponents not for doing the right thing if he turned on ivanov in such a manner he would not be rewarded he would be punished not right away but eventually they would send him away no one would want to look at him because he would be a reminder of their failures he didnt even consider going to the federal counterintelligence service the fsk would jump at the chance to embarrass their flashy sister agency especially if it meant taking down someone as big as ivanov but shvets had no desire to be branded a traitor for the rest of his days the men who turned against the security service had an extremely high occurrence of suicide shvets was pragmatic to the core but this sitting around could only spell disaster some type of action had to be taken he turned away from the window and looked at alexei the thicknecked bodyguard alexei do you trust me the bodyguard lifted his heavy head and looked at shvets he shrugged in the way a man shrugs when he finds a question not worth answering do you know what is going on with our boss another shrug you know hes in trouble yes this time big alexei nodded hes in a great deal of trouble and he doesnt want to admit it he would prefer to drink himself silly and shut himself in with the hope that the problem will simply go away the problem isnt going to go away in fact it is only going to get worse shvets was tempted to tell him what was going on but wasnt prepared to go that far i need your help alexei i need to get him out of bed and sober him up enough so that he can defend himself do you understand that yes good shvets said satisfied that he had gotten somewhere with the man now dont shoot me or break my neck but im going in there to wake him up alexei pursed his big lips while he thought about that one he told me no one including you your job is to protect him right well if he put a gun to his own head would you try to stop him yes thats what hes doing right now by getting drunk and sleeping the day away hes killing himself as surely as if he put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger you need to help me save him what do you want me to do nothing just sit here and dont hurt me shvets didnt wait for an answer he went to the bedroom door knocked twice and then opened the bed was huge and with all the pillows and blankets and two prostitutes and poor light he couldnt tell what was what so he went to the window and yanked open the heavy velvet drapes gray light poured into the room and shvets heard ivanov moan he searched the tangled mess and still couldnt find the mans head sir shvets announced director primakov is here to see you a flurry of activity erupted from under the blankets one or both of the girls screamed as ivanov dug his way out all elbows and knees his red face appeared midway down the length of the bed what he asked a mask of horror on his face you cant be serious no i am not but if you dont get out of bed and do something about this situation he will show up sooner than you think or maybe you would prefer director barannikov to show up with the fsk boys and drag you downtown ivanov pulled his head back under the covers go away no i will not you have been pouting for three days now we need to come up with a plan of action or we are doomed we are worse than doomed we are fucked stop being such a baby be careful what you say to me nikolai or i will get out of this bed and throw you out the window not a bad way to go when compared to what the fsk will do to me unfortunately you have neither the strength nor the courage to throw me out the window so it looks like i will be tortured in the basement of lubyanka he looked over at the bed but there was no movement or reply please boss i beg you do to do something anything defend yourself tell director primakov the money is gone you are a fool i will be put under an examination that i wont be able to withstand then place the blame on the dirty palestinians you know how primakov hates them tell him they killed sharif over a bad business deal and took all of the money blame the americans the brits the french the germans i dont care just blame someone and start investigating what you are doing what was that ivanov snapped as he popped his head back out blame someone and start investigating before that at the beginning blame the arabs you are right primakov does hate them but my money what about that shvets was pleased with his small victory now he needed to bait the hook i have some ideas about that as well he started walking toward the double doors i suggest you get out of bed and shower i will order an extremely late breakfast we can discuss your finances over coffee and eggs chapter beirut lebanon rapp was in his boxers pistol at his side staring at the door of the apartment and trying to decide what to do it was dark and he had no idea how long he had slept whoever was trying to get into the apartment had picked the lock rapp raised the pistol and took aim either that or he had a key he eased his finger off the trigger maybe it was a nosy landlady or hurley was testing him no it wouldnt be that if they were still in training it would be something hed gladly try but not in the thick of it like this for all he knew rapp might use it as an excuse to shoot him rapp stayed in the hallway that led to the bedrooms so he could use the wall as cover the door started to move and then stopped the rubber stop hed placed underneath it was doing its job the door opened a crack and rapp heard someone saying something whispering as if they were talking to someone else but then rapp heard hey open up in english part of the problem was that he had no idea how long hed slept and consequently what time it was he had awakened with a start as he heard some soft knocking on the door followed by the sound of metal on metal and now whoever was out there was talking to him and getting louder hey shithead open the damn door weve got big problems the contraction of we have was what caught his attention it was not hurley or richards so the we thing threw another level of mystery into the equation i know youre in there open this fucking door so i dont have to break it down rapp quietly crossed the room on the balls of his feet the door was cracked about an inch who is it fucking goldilocks weve been compromised open the door i need to get you the hell out of here rapps heart started trotting goldilocks compromised what the hell was going on whats the password rapp heard the word shit followed by a heavy sigh im not part of your merry little band i dont know the password there was a pause and then theres a leather case in the bedroom closet with a few handy things in it youre probably holding one of the silenced berettas right now im the guy who put it there rapp frowned were you in istanbul a week ago there was a pause and then yeah was that you nice little garden flat with alley access case was in an armoire with a pillow and blanket on top rapp said bingo let me close the door first and then ill let you in roger rapp pushed the door closed and kicked the doorstop out of the way with his pistol in his right hand he opened the door and then stepped back holding the gun in a twohanded grip the guy entered the room and closed the door behind him he was wearing brown pants brown shirt and brown baseball hat where had rapp seen that outfit before the visitor dropped the box he was carrying and raised his hands kid could you lower the gun if i was a terrorist i would have blown the damn building up looking over the iron sights of the beretta rapp said a few more questions whats going on youve been compromised i was ordered by washington to come get you who irene rapp lowered the gun why follow me the man said as he picked up his box and started for the bedroom stan and your other buddy were picked up at their hotel this morning this morning rapp asked dumbfounded what time is it almost sixthirty they were grabbed by the cops and then handed over to those assholes from islamic jihad rapp stopped moving say that again dont stop moving kid they could be on their way here right now and i dont think we want to be standing around talking when they show up he opened the box and pulled out clothes that matched his here put these on ill grab your shit he tossed the clothes on the bed and went to the closet retrieving rapps suitcase as well as the beatup leather case rapps mind was swimming upstream trying to process what hed just learned but the man turned on him a frightened wild look in his eyes no buts he hissed no questions no nothing we need to get the fuck out of here and i mean now rapp nodded and began putting on his clothes this stranger was right of course he quickly put on the brown uniform and stuffed his clothes in his suitcase while the stranger wiped down the doorknobs in just under two minutes they were out the door and on their way to the street the stranger went out first and after casually looking up and down the street motioned for rapp to follow they threw the suitcase and empty box in the back of a simple white minivan then left rapp glanced at his rental car and almost said something but thought better of it they had bigger problems chapter mughniyah refused to come to martyrs square so they had to go to him sayyed could hardly blame him he couldnt wait for the standoff to end and the hostages to be out of his care he was tied to them like a mother to her breastfeeding brood still there was something very exciting about the work that lay ahead bill sherman was a onceinalifetime experiment the american intrigued and horrified him at the same time sayyed had participated in close to a hundred interrogations and hed never seen anything even close to what hed witnessed today the other man the younger one was fairly straightforward a few threats some punches and kicks and one fingernail was all it took to get him talking hed gotten a name out of him several actually it was possible that they were both fake but he didnt really care at this point the important thing was that the great and powerful america had once again failed they had tried to interfere in the affairs of tiny beirut and he had beaten them at their game yet again and this one would hurt cummins was one thing but bill sherman would have secrets to tell secrets that moscow would have to pay for they were in the cellar of a bistro on general de gaulle boulevardthe west end of town just a block from the ocean the civil war followed the same patterns as any war but on a much smaller scale two blocks either side of the green line was virtually destroyed buildings blown to pieces from highexplosive artillery shells and mortar rounds nearly every building had the pockmarks of smallarms fire but beyond the green line you could find a street devastated by the war yet there would be one building untouched that one would survive while six or eight in either direction fell made no sense but it was an undeniable fact of war that some men and some buildings seemed to have an almost invisible shield around them farther away from the green line entire neighborhoods had made it through the war with far better success losing only a building or two from the random shelling mughniyah loved these buildings he noted them and used them for his most important meetings this restaurant was that kind of lucky building sayyed had been initially irritated by all of the extra security measures they were brought to three different locations and forced to switch cars before they arrived at the bistro mughniyah was the most paranoid of the group by a long shot they found him in the back room with badredeen plates of hummus ackawi roasted nuts kibbeh baba ghanouj and spiced fish were waiting after the last few days sayyed could barely contain himself he dug in using the flatbread to scoop up the hummus and then some olives and cheese mughniyah watched with interest as sayyed devoured the food and radih sat sipping his water he had heard of the deplorable conditions at martyrs square hed spent the better part of his life living in abject poverty so it wasnt that he was above slumming it with the men and he despised the maronites as much as or more than any of them it was the american prisoners who kept him away those men would attract too much attention the americans would be looking for them and if they got luckywell the building would be leveled with everyone in it radih mughniyah asked why arent you eating im not hungry mughniyah could tell there was something else bothering him but he was extremely unsympathetic to the problems of others he stabbed out his cigarette and asked can we be sure he is the same bill sherman who escaped the embassy bombing in sayyed nodded while he washed some baba ghanouj down with a glass of water its him and did you learn anything from him today we should kill him radih said he is the devil himself we should not tempt fate a second time give me the word and i will kill him tonight mughniyah had no idea what had precipitated such a drastic statement from a man who loved to barter for the lives of hostages he turned to sayyed and what do you think mr sherman is an interesting man a professional liar and provocateur for certain but he is also an extremely valuable asset the man is a curse on all of us radih proclaimed i am telling you we should rid ourselves of lies and kill him tonight thinking it would be a good idea to change the subject sayyed asked where is colonel jalil he will not be joining us mughniyah turned and shared a knowing glance with badredeen they had been conspiring that was plain enough to sayyed and if it meant leaving the iranian out that was fine with him sayyed watched as mughniyahs mood turned dark hed seen it before and when he was sour like this he could be prone to violence like some fifteenthcentury sultan he could on a whim ask for someones offensive head to be separated from the rest of his body no hierarchy had ever been established for the group but there was nonetheless a natural order to things mughniyah sat atop the food chain for the simple reason that he was the most ruthless among a group of men who were no strangers to violence the key sayyed had learned was to think very carefully before answering him when he was in one of his exceptionally surly moods what do you have in mind mustapha before he could answer radih said for the third time i think we should kill him he did not bother to look at the others his voice was eerily devoid of his normal youthful passion i think the man is the shaitan himself we should take him out to the statue tonight and disembowel him leave him to a slow death he can howl his lies at the moon let him be an example to the americans and anyone else who wants to send their assassins to beirut sayyed held his breath his eyes darted back and forth between the upstart and the lion radih was not a deeply religious man and his proclamation that the prisoner was the devil was likely to give the duo from islamic jihad pause but then again mughniyah did not like being interrupted assef mughniyah asked sayyed sayyed pulled in a quick breath and said im not sure i would go as far as to call the man satan but on the other hand there is undeniably something very wrong with mr bill sherman glancing at radih he added i can appreciate why abu might think that would be a good idea but im afraid we would be destroying a very valuable commodity mughniyah grinned knowingly they were of the same mind before we decide on something so brash badredeen said in his easy tone we need to assess a few things such as our finances mughniyah held out his hand and said we will get to that in a second but first i want to talk about sherman why is he back after all these years sayyed straightened up he says he is here to kill us but it is unwise to listen to much of anything that comes out of his mouth he glanced at radih and gave him a reassuring nod what sherman had said about the young mans mother did not have to be repeated his associate though is far more truthful and he says they are here to negotiate the release of agent cummins radih was rubbing his swollen knuckles i do not believe either of them you dont think they are here to negotiate the release of agent cummins mughniyah asked i dont believe anything that comes out of their mouths sayyed could see mughniyahs legendary temper begin to simmer do you understand the term unintended consequences the young leader of fatah shrugged as if he couldnt care less how about luck as in good or bad luck radih nodded this time well let me explain to you why your mood is starting to upset me six months ago you decided to kidnap an american businessman who as it turns out is just that he is not a spy you kidnapped him without coming to us for approval for that reason alone i could have you shot that single kidnapping has set in motion a series of events agent cummins was then sent to try to negotiate the release of this businessman you decided to then grab cummins rather than negotiate a fee and end it fortunately or unfortunately we found out that mr cummins is a cia spy how could that be unfortunate radih proclaimed more than asked mughniyah sat back and gripped the armrests of his chair almost as if he were trying to hold himself back i am in a rather bad mood tonight so i suggest you keep your interruptions to a minimum abu or i might lose control and snap your scrawny little neck he let a moment pass and when he was sure that he had the younger mans attention he continued where was i yes as it turned out mr cummins was not who he said he was he is in fact an american spy now when we are a few days away from handing cummins over to the russian the notorious bill sherman and another cia lackey show up are you following me so far radih nodded all of this was set in motion by one event your kidnapping of the businessman these are what we would call unintended consequences how many more unintended consequences are going to pop up are there any more americans in the city or on their way to the city will the four of us survive the week these are the questions that we will not know the answers to until this thing plays itself out your heart is in the right place and you are eager but you need to understand that your actions have consequences have i made myself clear yes now the unfortunate thing is that the americans appear to have learned their lesson after they let us ship their old station chief off to tehran so we could thoroughly interrogate him and then dismantle their network of spies this time it appears they are going to try to get one of their own back the only surprise is that they didnt try to do it sooner but now that we have the legendary mr sherman i think the stakes have been raised considerably how so radih asked trying not to sound confrontational mr sherman is a particularly nasty man who no doubt has many nasty secrets bottled up in his sick little head the cia will not want those secrets to get out so i am afraid they will try to get him back as well so badredeen said picking up the conversation we must move quickly and carefully to rid ourselves of all these americans and that is where the russian comes in mughniyah stared at sayyed assef when was the last time you you heard from the russian sayyed wiped the corners of his mouth yesterday i was not able to get hold of him today has he mentioned anything about dorfman and the empty accounts no mughniyah and badredeen looked at each other and nodded in agreement badredeen spoke dont you find his silence on the subject a bit strange i do there are three possibilities badredeen held up one finger the first the russian has no idea our banker was murdered in his home on sunday and that the very next morning millions of dollars were emptied out of accounts that he himself helped us set up does anyone believe for a second that the russian is that clueless when they were all done agreeing badredeen moved on to his second point the russian being the greedy man that he is killed dorfman and took all of the money for himself mughniyah held up two fingers and said i am going with option two what about option three sayyed asked someone unknown to us killed dorfman and stole the money the only problem with this theory is that dorfman was very secretive about his clients the man had no social skill he cared only for his dogs still someone an enemy could have found out sayyed tried to keep the options open let me ask you mughniyah said leaning forward can you think of anyone you know who has a reputation for cheating people out of their money i dont want to be in the position of defending ivanov but i think we need more evidence before we settle on him as the thief you didnt answer my question sayyed nodded you are correct mikhail ivanov is not exactly the most honest man i know and lets not forget the little fallingout he had with our turkish friend badredeen added sayyed was the one who had passed on the information hed picked up from damascus hamdi sharif the arms dealer whom they had worked with for close to a decade had reportedly had a fight with ivanov over a business deal a month later sharif ended up assassinated on a park bench in front of his house he had asked ivanov about it but of course the man had denied any connection mughniyah placed his big hairy right hand on the table he tapped a thick finger and said moscow is a den of thieves i warned all of you about this years ago the collapse has turned it into a freeforall where the most brutal simply take what they want sayyed could not argue with what he had said so what do we do you say the russian will be here friday yes good we are going to have a little auction the word seemed to wake up radih what kind of auction the kind where we sell the american spies to the highest bidder what bidders sayyed asked dont worry mughniyah cautioned just make sure the russian is here and ill take care of the rest what about damascus i must report this missing money mughniyah shook his head not yet give me a few days and then you can tell them chapter rapp stepped out into the hot afternoon sun and looked over the edge of the veranda the narrow street that snaked its way up the hill was barely wide enough for a single car to pass down at the bottom maybe a hundred yards away he could see the toyota pickup truck blocking the street the houses on this little goat hill were all flatroofed clotheslines were strung up and shirts and pants and other garments flapped in the breeze beneath him in the tiny courtyard three vehicles were packed in with no more than a few feet in between the tenfoot wall had a ring of razor wire strung from one end to the other he looked to his right and found a stack of green fiberglass crates stenciled on the side in black letters were a string of numbers and letters that he didnt understand then a few that he did each crate contained multiple m law antiarmor weapons next to those were a crate of rounds for an m grenade launcher that was leaning against the wall above that affixed to the wall was a handdrawn laminated map that marked the distance and elevation to certain landmarks up to a mile away rapp was wondering what all this stuff was for when he heard the voice of the man who had pulled him out of the safe house the night before we call this the sky box not anymore really but during the height of the war we would sit up here and watch it all unfold rapp turned around to find rob ridley sipping on a bright red can of coke sky box ridley approached the edge of the balcony pointed toward the ocean to the north and then drew his hand south see that big ugly scar that runs from the north to the south yeah thats the famous green line wed sit up here and watch them fight like a football game thats why we called it the sky box rapp pointed to the stack of us army crates looks like you guys did more than watch that shit is more for selfdefense although i saw some badass snipers roll through here thats the unwritten story about this little war the snipers they did most of the damage we found that they were getting a little close hurley pointed up at the overhang they started sending rounds in here on a daily basis we put up sandbags and then after one of our guys got killed we put in a request for a couple of those badasses from fort bragg two of them showed up five days later ridley pointed at the map on the wall they put that thing together in six days they had thirtyone recorded kills and that pretty much solved the problem kinda like bringing in an exterminator ridley laughed and then added thats classified so dont go around telling that story to just anyone how long have we had a presence up here youd have to ask stan that question i was still in the marine corps when they blew our barracks up ridley pointed to the south right over there i showed up in that was when we started rotating sniper teams through here they loved it in fact this is where the d boys battletested the first barrett cal he shot a guy just over seven thousand feet away thats more than a mile onepointthree and some change hurley looked off toward the green line strange breed those snipers pretty quiet lot kept to themselves for the most part but that night they got shitfaced and naked i guess seven thousand feet is a pretty rare club at any rate i think weve been up here since i thought we pulled out rapp said langley never pulls out or at least rarely shit this little outpost is what stopped this thing from being a complete disaster we knew everything damascus was up to we helped blow up supply convoys target the occasional asshole who wandered too far away from his home turf we even taught these guys how to use indirect fire and the other side knew we were here too thats why they sent those snipers after us so this is where youre based rapp asked thinking it didnt make a lot of sense no ridley shook his head not for over a year things are too quiet around here now so what exactly do you do for langley im kind of here and there i guess you could call me a floater rapp had no idea what that meant and got the distinct impression that ridley wasnt going to enlighten him any further rapp let out a yawn his nights and days were upsidedown after their mad dash from the apartment ridley had filled in some of the blanks the problem was that beyond the obvious fact that hurley and richards had been picked up ridley had very few details rapp had pressed him hard wanting to know what langley was doing to find them ridley had to admit not much of anything langley was sending a small sixman sog team and they were actively trying to collect any intel that would aid in a rescue ridley worked his sources well past midnight but every single one of them seemed to have conflicting information finally at am he sent rapp to bed and told him to get some rest he assured rapp hed been through more than a few of these abductions and they tended to progress slowly especially for the first few days rapp had a hard time falling asleep he couldnt stop himself from imagining what hurley and richards were going through as part of his training hed spent two days tied to a chair guys would come in randomly and smack him around they even gave him some lowvoltage shocks from a small engine battery there was nothing remotely enjoyable about the experience and hurley had cautioned them that it paled in comparison to what they would go through at the hands of a sadist or a skilled interrogator finally around sunrise he had dozed off listen i know what youre going through rapp gave him a sideways glance ridley was a few inches shorter and a decade or so older rapp couldnt quite figure out if he was an optimist or a pessimist he seemed to kind of float back and forth between the two ive known stan for six years id do anything to try to save the guy but we need to get some good intel before we can even consider lifting a finger back in training if someone had asked him to lay down his life to save stan hurley he would have laughed at him but now he wasnt so sure any idea where they are ridley pointed east the other side of the big ugly scar indian country you ever go over there ridley gave him a nervous laugh i try not to so youve been occasionally its nowhere near as bad as it was back when the shit was really flying he searched rapps face wondering what he was thinking its still a nasty place for a stranger like you kid rapp nodded even though he really wasnt listening so it wouldnt be such a good idea to wander over there and start asking questions that would be about the dumbest thing you could do kid ridley could see the upstart wasnt listening to him he reached out and grabbed his arm ive been to that little lake house down in southern virginia ive seen the way stan takes badasses and grinds them up and spits out little pussies so im guessing if you made it through his selection process youve got some serious skills am i right rapp looked at ridleys grip until he released his arm whats your point i dont care how good you are going over to indian country on your own is a suicide mission well end up looking for three of you instead of two well im not good at sitting around so somebody better come up with a plan and come up with it quick the triple beep beep beep of a car horn caught their attention and they both looked to the base of the hill where a threecar convoy had just pulled up to the roadblock finally ridley said who is it a local who knows more about this hellhole than anyone chapter moscow russia shvets anxiously checked his watch theyd been in there for more than an hour and each passing tick of the clock only added to his apprehension for starters he didnt like sitting in the waiting room of director primakovs office on the top floor of svr headquarters any trip to these lofty heights would test a mans nerves but considering the events of the past few days shvets worried that he might be leaving the building in shackles he doubted that primakov knew about the missing money or the other mistakes that were piling up the svr was an entrenched organization with thousands of operations and ivanov was regarded as a daring man who knew when to be ruthless and when to smile and in the years between stalins violent mood swings and the collapse of the cccp that would have been more than enough now he wasnt so sure this was a brave new world the money grab was in full swing oligarchs were popping up and riding the wave of decentralization but not without problems the peasants were growing dissatisfied with what they saw as unbridled greed and corruption and the one thing every muscovite feared more than even a tyrant like stalin was the rage of the mob the mob was like some ancient god who needed regular sacrifices the men in charge knew that and in order to satisfy that mob and keep it from bubbling over into the streets they would look for a few bodies to throw them one or two public executions would go a long way toward calming the hordes it was shvetss plan after hed forced some real food into ivanovs gullet the previous afternoon he began to sketch out their strategy it would be centered on primakovs distrust of islamic jihad and its sister organizations the missing funds would be laid at their feet along with the assassination of the banker as ivanovs devious brain began to work he hit upon the idea of blaming them for hamdi sharifs murder as well shvets wasnt so sure he was from the new generation ivanov was from the old whose motto was if you are going to lie lie big the tricky part was this agent they were offering up they had confirmed through one of their sources inside the cia that mark cummins did in fact exist and that he had worked in moscow before being stationed in damascus if ivanov could deliver someone like that primakov might be willing to forget the missing funds the only problem was coming up with the money to pay off the palestinians ivanov would have to convince primakov to give him the funds necessary to complete the transaction and then this morning sayyed called and things became infinitely more interesting he explained that he was now in possession of two more americans who had been sent to try to buy the release of agent cummins one of the men was nothing more than an underling but the other was the catch of a lifetime when pressed sayyed refused to give details saying he would only discuss the matter in person when they arrived in beirut still there was no mention of dorfman and the missing money sayyeds continued silence over the missing funds had caused ivanov to rethink the issue what if islamic jihad and fatah no longer feared him what if they thought russia too disorganized to care there had been plenty of heated feuds between the various palestinian factions over the years and sayyed was the man who had profited the most by peddling arms to all sides what if that thug mughniyah had decided to take what he wanted kill dorfman take all the money solidify his position and thumb his nose at ivanov that thought had caused ivanov to reach for the vodka but shvets had stopped him he was scheduled to meet with primakov in less than an hour and he needed to be sober the problem had become clear to shvets as well why else would sayyed stay quiet over the missing funds if his money was gone as well he would be demanding answers the only logical reason for his silence was that they had taken the money and they were daring ivanov to bring it up ivanov had to assume they had every last shred of damning information that dorfman had kept all of the various accounts and how ivanov had bilked his own government out of millions on the arms shipments by playing the middleman with sayyed that information alone could sink him ivanovs hands were tied at least for now that was how shvets had counseled him go along with this ruse go to beirut and look the liars in their eyes and then ask them where the money had gone bring a show of force that will make them think twice about stealing from you ivanov liked the idea as he walked into primakovs office he turned and told shvets to wait outside shvets knew his boss too well to think he was anything other than a duplicitous snake as he nervously checked his watch the minutes ticking by he figured out what ivanov was up to he was in there right now blaming him for the missing funds hed probably already ordered someone to begin creating a false trail between him and dorfman that way when it really did blow up ivanov could step back and blame his inept deputy shvets shvets didnt know if he was more upset with ivanov or with himself for not seeing it sooner he should have left him in bed and gone to primakov and taken his chances when the door finally opened ivanov appeared with a stoic look on his face he never broke stride as he headed for the elevator as he walked past his deputy he snapped his fingers for him to follow shvets hopped to his feet and buttoned his jacket hustling to catch up once in the elevator shvets asked well it was good he understands what must be done shvets started to ask another question but ivanov shook his head in a very curt way that told him this was not the place to talk when they entered ivanovs office less than a minute later the director of directorate s went straight for the vodka shvets did not try to stop him this time it was approaching midafternoon and he took it as a victory that hed kept him sober this long he waited for his boss to consume a few ounces when ivanov looked relaxed enough shvets asked what did he say ivanov yanked at his tie he sees things our way he knows the true character of those palestinian carpet monkeys shvets was used to his boss uttering racist slurs so he paid them little attention he also knew that his boss was paranoid enough in general but especially today he was worried his office was bugged so what is the plan we leave in the morning alone shvets asked honestly scared no ivanov had a huge grin the director has been quite generous he is sending along some spetsnaz one of the crack vympel units shvets wasnt sure if that was good or bad news the vympel units specialized in assassination and sabotage among other things why a vympel unit because hes sending us with cash how much ivanov smiled and held up five fingers really shvetss surprise was evident on his face dont be so shocked i have no doubt it will be counterfeit probably being printed as we speak shvets had heard rumors about the old kgb printing presses that could turn out francs deutsche marks pounds and dollars on demand will they be able to tell if the americans cant tell how will the palestinians be able to tell shvets wasnt so sure but he went along with it dont look so nervous ivanov came over and put an arm around shvetss shoulders i told him how useful you have been to me i have no doubt that when we return with these mystery americans you will be given a nice promotion shvets smiled even though he didnt feel like it the truth was there was probably a better than even chance that hed be given a dirty dank cell chapter beirut lebanon according to ridley it was very poor spycraft to meet a source at a safe house but for this particular source they made exceptions the reason was fairly straightforward the source owned the house levon petrosian had the complexion of someone who was born further north but had lived long enough in the sunbaked city that his skin was deeply lined and had taken on the appearance of a permanent sunburn his white hair had receded almost to the midpoint of his head and he was a good fifty pounds overweight he entered the house out of breath a cigarette dangling from his lips his four bodyguards moving in tandem two in front and two behind the bodyguards were young big and fit two looked like locals and two had petrosians northern complexion petrosian walked over to ridley grabbed him by the shoulders and kissed the american on both cheeks and then refusing to let go he stared into ridleys eyes and spoke to him his face didnt so much as twitch his eyes didnt blink only his lips moved after the intense onesided exchange the armenian gave ridley one more hug and then his eyes lifted and settled on rapp he released ridley and asked is this the one ridley nodded petrosian sized rapp up and then announced i must shake your hand the man spoke perfect english but with one of those clipped heavy russian accents rapp couldnt come up with a single good reason why this man would want to shake his hand but he stuck his right hand out as a polite reflex in a voice only the two of them could hear he said i have hated that turkish pig hamdi sharif for almost twenty years i want to thank you for putting a bullet in his black heart when i heard he was dead i wept tears of joy rapps own heart began to beat a little faster how in hell did this man know he had killed sharif rapp tilted his head to the left to so he could get a look at ridley the man shrugged his shoulders as if to say he was sorry so much for secrecy i am very sorry about bill rapp had to remind himself that to these people stan hurley was bill sherman thank you have you found any information that may help us he winced as if disappointed in himself im not sure if it will help but maybe i confirmed that it was the police that picked our friend up in front of his hotel this morning in fact it was the police chief that pig gabir haddad haddad is not a bad man ridley said for rapps benefit just extremely corrupt he works with us sometimes he works with anyone if they have enough money petrosian said levon anything to drink no thank you my stomach is upset today so this haddad rapp said who gave him the order i am fairly certain it was your friends from islamic jihad but i will know more later i am having dinner with haddad this evening his idea or yours ridley asked his he is afraid he has offended me which he has of course he knows he cannot simply come into my neighborhood and grab my friends it would have been nice if you had told me bill was coming all of this could have been avoided i know i already told you i was sorry he was planning on seeing you today he didnt want word getting out that he was back and how did that work out for him i know but just be careful with haddad we cant afford to lose you i am always careful it will be at a restaurant of my choosing and i will make sure the street is blocked off trust me hes the one who needs to be nervous thats what worries me what if hes desperate he has always been a desperate little man he knows what he did this morning was wrong he will be full of fear and i will play on that fear to get every last piece of information from him any idea where they took him rapp asked that is the question isnt it where did they take him petrosian shuffled across the stone floor and out onto the veranda beirut is not a small city it is not like your new york or chicago but it is not small have you figured out how they found him no ridley said he flew in last night shortly after nine thats all we know i have talked to the people at the hotel and i am satisfied that they did not know who he was somebody must have spotted him at the airport from the old days he made a big enough impression in certain circles and those little palestinian rats do all the dirty work at the airport baggage and fueling cleaning the planes and the terminal they treat it like their own little syndicate petrosian said with contempt i have heard rumors that some of the cab drivers are involved in a kidnapping ring would they have any pull with haddad ridley asked thinking of the police chief no petrosian answered as he flicked a long ash over the edge and onto the cars below that would have to be someone much higher up my guess is the same people who grabbed your other man the schnoz isnt that what you call him yes you mean islamic jihad correct with the help of a few others anything else little things here and there petrosian paused and chewed on his lip for a moment have you heard about this standoff at martys square i heard a little something yesterday but not much it is a funny thing petrosian said while looking off into the distance what you talking about rapp asked ridley pointed to the north follow the scar to the sea one block short you can see an open area thats martyrs square before the war it was a beautiful place full of life petrosian said in a sad voice it was the scene of some of the heaviest fighting during the war ridley added the buildings are all empty shells now now that the ceasefire has held certain groups have gotten the idea that it is time to grab land while they still can the maronites started earlier in the week and they began occupying the buildings along the east side of the square the muslims got word and started moving their people into a building on the west side rapp looked at the spit of land he guessed it was around two miles away does that mean a fight is brewing part of me wishes they would all just kill each other so the rest of us can pick up the pieces and get back to where we were before this mess started but i know that this is not the answer we need the peace to hold and how does this martyrs square situation figure into our other problem it might not but then again manpower is an issue manpower rapp asked not understanding these groups are like any organization they have limited resources they have to collect garbage collect taxes man their roadblocks punish those who arent behaving the list goes on and on the point is if they are forced to hold the west end of martyrs square they will be weak in other places rapp wondered how he could use that to his advantage as the sun moved across the afternoon sky he got the sinking feeling that they were losing an opportunity that if they didnt act didnt do something bold and do it soon richards and hurley would share the same fate of bill buckley chapter hurley had lost track of time after the fingernail incident theyd left him alone turned off the light and shut the door he sat in the chair his arms ducttaped to the armrests and his ankles to the two front legs his chest and shoulders were also taped to the chair back big loops of silver tape as if he were a mummy for the first few hours he tried to catalogue everything hed seen said and heard abu radih was what hed expecteda thinskinned overwrought child in a mans body if he was lucky he could provoke the man into killing him that was the first priority he had to enrage the man to the point where he defied the orders of the others go down fighting he dozed off thinking of his own death what a beautiful death it would be if he could pull it off exercise his will over a free man inflict enough mental pain on radih to get him to do something he himself knew was wrong the thought brought a smile to his swollen lips and then he let his chin rest on his chest and went to sleep he awoke some time later it could have been an hour three hours or half a day and what did it really matter the stink in the room was horrendous but it was far better than the hood he needed to go to the bathroom so he whizzed right there letting it splash over the seat of the chair onto the concrete floor that helped him relax a little bit but his fingers were starting to really sting so he started talking to god to take his mind off the pain hurley had no illusions about his potential for sainthood he pretty much knew where he was headed when it was over and yes he did believe in the man upstairs and the man downstairs hed seen too much nasty shit in his life to think for a second that there wasnt both good and evil in this world where he fit into that paradigm was a little more complicated one of his favorite aphorisms involved sending boy scouts after bad men good people needed men like hurley even if they couldnt bring themselves to admit it maybe god would take pity on him maybe he wouldnt hurley bowed his head and asked for forgiveness for any of the innocent people hed killed over the years but that was as far as he was willing to go the assholes he would not apologize for he then nodded off to sleep again he awoke later to the sounds of a man screaming he knew instantly that it was richards what they were doing to him hurley could only imagine the screams came and went rising and falling like waves crashing into the rocks and then hurley could tell by the steady rhythm what they were doing they were electrocuting him and they werent bothering to ask questions they were just trying to wear him down listening to the pain of one of his own men was the most difficult thing of all hurley bowed his head again and asked god for the strength to kill these men it went like this for four or five cycles he tried not to obsess over the time when he was awake he tried to prepare himself for what would come next with an almost endless string of awful possibilities there was one in particular that had him worried and when the door finally opened it was if his captors had read his mind a man entered plugged in the cord for the light and there in the doorway was a bloodied and battered richards two men were at his sides holding him up his wrists were bound in front of him with duct tape the red marks on his chest confirmed what they had been doing although it wasnt all richardss face was beaten and swollenone of his eyes completely shut sayyed entered the room a man following him with a chair similar to the one hurley was in he showed the man where to place it and said to hurley how are you feeling today great hurley said with enthusiasm you guys really do a nice job of making people feel comfortable yes sayyed smiled im sure you would show us the same hospitality if we were in your country slightly better hurley said flashing the new gap in his teeth you know how competitive we americans are we didnt put a man on the moon by making our women walk around in sheets all day and blowing ourselves up we all know that was faked sure it was hurley said agreeably as they placed richards in the other chair one of the men produced a knife so he could cut richardss duct tape hurley wanted that knife and in arabic asked wheres my buddy radih either of you boys ever get a blow job from his mom hurley then launched into an invectivefilled description of the sex acts that radihs mom used to perform for him sayyed would never admit it but this americans descriptive abilities were in a league of their own in fact the descriptions were so detailed that even he wondered for a second if it could be true hurley read the unsure looks on the faces of the two goons and said you really didnt know radihs mother was a whore you should try her some time shes getting a little up there in age not quite as tight a fit if you know what i mean hurley winked at them as if they were of the same mind that will be enough sayyed said he ordered the men to finish taping richardss wrists to the chair when they were finished he told them they could wait outside hurley smiled at them and waited until they were at the door and then shouted dont forget to ask radih about his mother dirtiest piece of ass ive ever had the door closed with a click sayyed placed his hands on his hips and let out an exasperated sigh its true hurley said punctuating his words with an emphatic nod the woman was a sex machine she should have paid me doctrine told sayyed he should ignore the comments but he felt that he needed to say something you are a very interesting man mr sherman you must be very unsure of yourself why do you say that colonel it is so obvious do i really have to say it well unless ive learned how to read minds since we last saw each other i suggest you spit it out you are afraid you wont be able to stand up to my methods so you are trying to enrage my colleague to the point where he kills you hurley screwed on a confused look colonel you give me way too much credit im not that smart im just a horny bastard whos slept with a ton of prostitutes one of whom just happens to radihs mom sayyed laughed at him you are an unusual man what do i have to do to get you guys to take me seriously im going to lie to you about a lot of shit but i am dead serious about radihs mom and im not knocking the woman she was amazing and besides you cant blame a woman for trying to put some food on the table can you sayyed thought about that for a second and simply shook his head it was time to take charge again he wheeled his little cart over and checked his instruments when he was ready he broke open some smelling salts and stuck them under the other americans nose richards snorted and opened his eyes turning back to the foulmouthed older one he said your friend mr richards was kind enough to give us his name never heard of him yes well lets see if we can jog your memory this is what we are going to do sayyed picked up the tin snips and said i will ask you a question if you refuse to answer or lie i will cut off one of his fingers cool hurley straightened up as much as the tape would allow id like to see you cut one off right now go ahead lets get started mr sherman what is your real name come on cut his finger off cut his wrist off that would be really awesome richards was awake now a panicked look in his eyes what the hell sayyed said he has already told us your name but i want to hear you say it fine william tecumseh sherman are you happy now can we go home no that is not the name he gave us i think id know my own name last chance sayyed placed the tin snips around the first knuckle on richardss left hand william tecumseh sherman wrong answer sayyed pushed the two red handles together and there was a quick snip and the pinky fell to the dirty floor richards started screaming and sayyed quickly moved the snips over to hurleys pinky your turn he yelled name hurley had already turned his head away as if he couldnt bear to watch what was going on he started to move his lips and mumbled a name louder i cant hear you hurley slowly turned his head made eye contact with sayyed and then looked down at his pinky the distance was about right he pretended he was starting to cry while again mumbling and when sayyed moved just a touch closer offering up his good ear so he could hear better hurley lunged forward tilting his head to the right he caught the top third of the mans left ear between his teeth and clamped down with all of his strength grinding and chewing and growling and then yanking his head back sayyed screamed and broke free his hand clamped around his bloody ear he stumbled away and then turned to look at his subject what he saw horrified him bill sherman had a chunk of his ear hanging half out of his mouth the insane american smiled at him and then started chewing on the ear crunching it like a potato chip chapter rapp looked out across the city night had fallen and that scar known as the green line now looked like a wide formidable river a black swath of darkness that cut the city in half but travel two blocks in either direction and there were signs of life buildings lit up with inhabitants traffic moving about the city horns blaring and underpowered engines revvingall the normal sights and sounds of a city but not in that desolate corridor only twice in the last hour had he seen a car dare cross nomansland it appeared the ceasefire was activated as they usually are by segregating the various factions he could not see the eastwest streets to the north and it was likely that more cars had crossed in that sector but not enough to change what was obvious this was a literally a city torn asunder the problem as rapp saw it was fundamental geography he was on this side and they were on the other sidethe they being hurley and richards the only way to save them was to go over there but ridley had explained to him that going over there was a very bad idea going over there would result in his being captured tortured and then killed in that order rapps response to ridley was so youre pretty much admitting that stan and bob are going to be tortured and killed im admitting no such thing the hell youre not rapp said his frustration finally boiling over ridley shot back i know youre the new wonder boy so this might be hard for you to understand but there are things that are going on that you have not been read in on like what things that are way above your pay grade rookie ridley caught his mistake and tried to temper his words by adding listen i dont make the rules there are certain protocols that i have to follow langley tells me who i can share things with if youre not on that list my hands are tied like petrosian for instance im sure you cleared that with langley you telling a foreign national that i was the man who killed sharif rapp watched as ridley looked away are you fucking kidding me theres no way in hell you got approval from irene to give him that information ridley sighed we need petrosian on this one and the man does not trust strangers so i gave him a little piece of information that i knew would please him he hated hamdi sharif more than any person on the planet it goes back to the beginning of the civil war here they were both arms dealers and they agreed not to sell weapons to fatah petrosian lived here and he felt that a militarized fatah would only prolong the fighting about six months into the war he found out that sharif had broken their agreement and was selling weapons to the radical palestinians petrosian was right it prolonged the war destroyed the city killed thousands more and sharif became a very wealthy man petrosian vowed to kill him but sharif never set foot in the city again fine so you used what i did for your own benefit which means you owe me i deserve to know what in hell is going on rapp could see ridley was at least thinking about it so he pressed him a little harder that could have just as easily been me that got picked up i deserve to know what langley is doing to try to get them back theyre working on different levels signal intercepts applying pressure where they can calling in favors what in hell does all that mean its complicated is what its supposed to mean and on top of that stan your friend bobby and you arent even supposed to exist how the fuck do you expect them to go to the state department with that one excuse me he said in a falsetto two of our black ops guys who dont actually exist were kidnapped in beirut could you help us get them back bullshit bullshit what in hell is that supposed to mean it means its bullshit if you think the state department is the answer to our problems if langley thinks theyre our solution were fucked i didnt say they were the only game i told you its complicated and what the hell would you know youre a damn rookie a rookie whos smart enough to know this is bullshit rapp yelled you know what the solution is you just dont want to say it because yourapp pointed at himand all of the other pussies back at langley dont have the balls to follow through on it please enlighten me boy wonder whats the solution we do what the russians did what the russians did ridley mocked him yeah back in the mideighties after four of their diplomats were kidnapped ridleys gaze narrowed whered you hear that story stan for christs sake ridley muttered obviously not happy that hurley had told rapp the story two diplomats and two kgb guys get snatched by one of the palestinian factions one of them happens to be the kgbs station chief here in beirut the russians know what happened to the cias station chief when he got kidnapped because they paid for the information that the iranians sucked out of him they dont want to see all of their operations exposed so they send in a joint force of spetsnaz and kgb goons and they start whacking people ridley was shaking his head thats not the answer really since you appear to know the story tell me how it ended ridley shook his head nope one was killed and the three were released rapp said and how many russians were kidnapped after that zero ridley reluctantly admitted thats right and how many americans ridley shrugged not zero so whats the lesson to be learned were not the russians thats your answer listen i know youre frustrated im frustrated but i am telling you this is way above both of us there are a lot of really important people who want this ceasefire to last they will never allow us to go around shooting people like the russians did but the palestinians can keep kidnapping our people rapp waited for ridley to give him an answer that wasnt coming anytime soon like i said this is bullshit that had been more than three hours ago rapp and ridley had not exchanged words since then rapp had dumped his anger into studying maps of west beirut reading the intelligence reports and trying to come up with some way to prevent this disaster from following the course of the previous hostage negotiations anyone who didnt understand where this was headed was either deluding himself by ignoring history or just too stupid to connect the dots out of this frustration came the realization of what it would all mean to his own future hed spent years thinking of little more than how he would make the other side hurt and now after all of his training right when he was getting started it would be derailed hurley and richards would end up telling them everything they knew about him his career would be over the anger welled up inside him and as he looked out across the city he could feel himself drifting further and further away from the people pulling the strings in dc their half measures and dithering disgusted him it was like hurley had told them on the drive down from hamburg we got soft in the eighties and let these assholes get away with way too much shit apparently washington still hadnt learned its lesson ridley joined him on the veranda he was holding two beers he set one in front of rapp and took a swig out of the other rapp eyed the beer and then said im not in the mood shut up and drink and listen for a change ive been doing some thinking this thing isnt going to end well cummins was bad enough stan the shit that guy has in his brain the stuff hes seen over the years ridley shuddered at the thought of the enemy getting their hands on all that information i cant even begin to calculate the damage he paused took a swig of beer and shook his head someone needs to do something and you seem like just the kind of crazy asshole that would volunteer for a mission like this although its actually not a mission theres nothing official about it in fact im going to get so pissed tonight that i pass out and then when i wake up in the morning and youre not here ill call langley and tell them youve gone awol and where will i be rapp asked petrosian will be here in one hour he has arranged to take you over to the other side the police chief no less is taking you rapp was surprised the same asshole who snatched stan one and the same can i trust him absolutely how because this time he has given petrosian his word that nothing will happen to you and i should be impressed by that yes you should the chief will drop you off at a small hotel a few blocks west of nijmeh square and then youre on your own my advice is you spread some cash around telling the hotel manager and the vendors that you would like to meet with colonel assef sayyed they will claim theyve never heard of him but they all know who he is they will tell him you are looking for him and he will have someone collect you before the day is out then it will go one of two ways ridley took another drink and organized his thoughts he will either sit down and negotiate with you in which case petrosian has agreed to bankroll you to the tune of one million dollars youre kidding me no he is a man who likes to show his gratitude and besides you just eliminated one of his top competitors hes bound to pick up a few more contracts will a million do it doubtful but it will let them know we are serious and they all know petrosian is not a man to be fucked with so if its not enough money ridley waved him off im going to be working on getting more langley maybe but we have some other options i just need to see if i can pull it off rapp thought about the money that hurley had taken from the swiss bank accounts he almost told ridley but decided to keep it to himself for now thats option one whats option two they throw you in the dungeon and they torture you and eventually kill you but im a rookie so how much harm can i really do it was a statement not a question something like that a pawn for a bishop ridley shrugged maybe you even get lucky and take a few of them down with you ridley drained his beer and looked to the west theres one last thing the story about the russians yeah stan didnt tell you the whole thing the russians they wiped out a couple of families women and children included fucking butchers ridley shook his head trying to get rid of the bad memories were not the russians we dont kill women and children at least not intentionally never forget that chapter sayyed held the small mirror in his hand turned his head to the right and checked his bandage carefully fingering the edges the morning sunlight came through the window of his room providing ample light there was no hope of reattaching the jagged hunk of cartilage and skinat least thats what the doctor had told him although sayyed suspected that the man was not well versed on the most recent medical advances when all of this was over which he hoped would be very soon he would have to go to paris and see if there was a plastic surgeon who could do something about the nub that was now his ear growing his hair out would help but sayyed did not want to live the rest of his years with such a permanent reminder of his time spent with bill sherman that was still the only name he had to go on the other man mr richards had told them he did not know his bosss real name as to whether he was telling the truth sayyed would only know that after a few more sessions and depending on how the bidding went he might not get that opportunity one thing was certain mr shermans sanity was no longer up for discussion in the nearly twenty years that sayyed had been doing this he had never encountered anyone close to this animal the man was clearly insane how else could you explain biting off someones ear and then chewing it the alltoofresh memory caused sayyed to shudder hed never experienced anything so strange in his life the pain had been bad excruciating at the time but it had faded the image though of another person chewing on his ear had only grown stronger he did not like it one bit and it made him all the more anxious to get through this day and be done with this bill sherman or whatever his real name was sayyed finished buttoning the fresh white shirt that ali had fetched for him and then put on his suit coat he heard footsteps coming down the hall and turned to see radih standing in the open doorway you wanted to see me yes how are our neighbors across the street nothing new we estimate they have between thirty and fifty men and us thirtytwo sayyed nodded and thought the number enough to handle a problem should one arise changing subjects he said you have heard about this new american the one who is staying at the shady cedar radih nodded two of my men have been following him this morning he held up a twoway radio they have sent me regular updates they say the man is a fool a fool sayyed said finding the word an interesting choice he is wandering around the streets asking merchants for information about kidnapped americans and mentioning your name hes handing out money and telling people where he is staying telling them he is here to negotiate their release sayyed was not surprised that his name was being mentioned chief haddad had told him everything the fact that petrosian was sticking his nose into their business did not surprise him he had known when he sent the chief into the bourj to grab the two americans that there would be repercussions that was why he had to pay haddad such an outrageous sum sayyed could tell something was bothering radih so he asked what is wrong i am worried that some other faction will grab him in fact i will be amazed if he makes it to lunch and if someone else gets him he made a pained expression and a clicking noise it could complicate our negotiations yes haddad had told sayyed that the new american was young inexperienced and very nervous radih was right if one of the other factions grabbed him they would try to ransom him which would make things more complicated especially if he wanted to complete the entire transaction today there was another angle that he had just considered but could not share with the others if the americans were serious about bidding they were likely to drive the price far beyond what he was hoping to get in the end it was unlikely that mughniyah and badredeen would agree to hand them back to the us government but it was worth a try the smart thing to do was to take this new variable out of play and see what the americans were willing to offer why dont you pick him up but be very careful you know how sneaky the americans can be take him someplace first and strip him down make sure he isnt carrying any tracking devices then bring him here and show him the rabid dog in the basement find out how serious they are about making an offer you are not seriously considering handing them back to the americans maybe not but sayyed was at a minimum willing to consider his options america was a very wealthy country maybe they could make up all of their lost funds and then some sayyed could put himself back on the road to a life of opulence knowing how unhinged radih was about the american sayyed knew he would have to keep these thoughts to himself no i am not but i would like to see if the americans can help drive the price up a bit radih stared at him for a moment and said you should let me kill him remove all temptation can i trust radih with these prisoners today was the question sayyed asked himself yet again it would be nice if he could convince mughniyah to come keep an eye on things but he wanted to be part of the negotiations at the airport sayyed understood his colleagues anger but he could not understand his persistence the man simply did not understand what was at stake here today he supposed a great deal of it was due to his youth he could crawl back to sabra and shatila and rely on his black market trades and the payoffs he received from all of the impoverished refugees he had many years ahead of him and many opportunities to rebuild his wealth and he did not have to answer to damascus for missing funds still none of these points would matter to him his judgment was clouded by his hatred normally he would chastise radih or humiliate him but not this time they just needed to get through today and then things would return to normal he decided on a more mature approach not wanting to argue with him he said i understand your anger but you are better than this abu radih shook his head i do not think so my heart is filled with nothing but hatred for this man i will not sleep until i have killed him and that is understandable but you must take comfort in the fact he will die a thousand deaths at the hands of whoever buys him today he will experience more pain than we can even begin to imagine none of that matters to me i must kill him with my own hand a compromise occurred to sayyed one that he would never have to honor but one that might be enough to keep radih from ruining their chances of refilling their coffers i promise you abu that whoever buys him today i will make the transaction contingent on the other party agreeing that when they are done with mr sherman you will be given the honor of killing him sayyed watched the palestinian turn this idea over in his hatefilled mind he could see that he was not quite convinced so he said and i will allow you to spend some time with him today so he can be taught a proper lesson before he leaves a thin smile creased radihs lips and he said i would like that very much good sayyed said placing his hand on his shoulder now go get this other american and make sure no one is following you bring him back here and we will see what he has to say and then i will give you some time to take out your frustrations on mr sherman chapter rapp sat on the edge of the hotel rooms bed tapping his foot it was tenohnine in the morning and he was having a hell of a time trying to calm his nerves all hed brought along was a small duffel bag that ridley had helped him pack petrosian had come back to the safe house after his dinner with the police chief to go over the plan he was not optimistic that rapp would succeed but agreed that doing nothing was a worse alternative so shortly before midnight rapp was shuttled from petrosians armorplated sedan to the beirut police chiefs fourdoor peugeot rapp was not thrilled about the idea at first but when petrosian explained that the chief was eager to make amends for his lack of judgment the day before rapp went along with it petrosian also knew that the chief would tell the right people that another cia man had shown up and was looking to negotiate the release of his colleagues they made it through the checkpoint fine but rapp had to resist the urge to shoot the smug little turd of a police chief and both of his men it would have sent a nice message but ultimately the wrong one considering his final objectives and besides he had a role to play so as they neared the hotel rapp fired off one anxious paranoid question after another the chief did his best to calm his guest but rapp played the inconsolable nervous wreck better than he could have hoped they reached the shady cedar hotel at twenty minutes past midnight ridley had handpicked the hotel because it was smack dab in the middle of indian country all three men escorted rapp into the lobby the chief asked to have a private word with the manager and the two men disappeared behind the closed door of the small office behind the reception desk the other two policemen stood chainsmoking by the door while rapp stood at the front desk and did his best to look nervous as hell which was no easy thing considering the fact that he really wanted to kick down the door and pistolwhip the doubledealing police chief after five minutes chief haddad appeared stroking his mustache and assuring rapp that everything was taken care of the little kissass hotel manager joined in telling rapp that all would be fine rapp got the distinct impression that all would not be fine and that both of these men would look to make money by turning him in to islamic jihad but that was the point of the whole crazy exercise so rapp anxiously shuffled his feet and kept rubbing his neck as if he was a wreck pointing toward the door rapp asked cant one of your men stay the night im afraid that is not possible besides you will be safe here rapp acted even more worried but truth he told he didnt have a worry in the world he could sleep in peace and then in the morning he could begin to ask around for information the idea that the chief wouldnt tell the very people who had asked him to grab hurley was ludicrous but rapp played dumb the elevator was out of order so he took the stairs to the fourth floor he closed and locked the door to the room and wedged the rubber doorstop into the small gap at the bottom next he opened the curtains to see what kind of exit the window might provide it was a good twentyfive feet to the street ridley had sent him off with a grab bag of things including a thirtyfoot coil of rope rapp tied one end to the foot of the bed and left the rest of it coiled by the window then he took out his silenced beretta and motorola radio he set the gun on the night stand and keyed the transmit button on the radio ridleys voice came over the radio a few seconds later rapp told him hed made it to the hotel and was in his room the radios werent secure so they kept the conversation vague and short rapp confirmed that he would check in at eight and then every two hours after that if he missed any of the checkins ridley should assume rapp had made contact after that it was anyones guess how things would turn out rapp brushed his teeth and lay down on the bed with his clothes on he didnt expect to sleep but if he did all the better he lay there in the dark with his eyes closed going over all of his options in his minds eye he could see how things were going to proceed and if he had any chance at all of making it back alive he would have to stay calm and seize the opportunity if and when it presented itself when it presented itself he amended petrosian had said it himself the fatah and islamic jihad factions had grown thin during the ceasefire men were leaving their ranks and finding jobs it was very possible that they would make a mistake it was simply up to rapp to see it coming and make his daring move rapp did fall asleep he had no idea when he had dozed off or for how long but it was enough to recharge his battery he checked in with ridley at the appointed hour and then not wanting to lose his nerve he left the hotel and proceeded directly to maarad street a few blocks away the vendors were manning their tents selling all kinds of produce and food rapp worked his way up and down both sides of the street speaking english and playing down his french when he had to speak it he continued to play the role of the dolt almost to a man people shunned him as soon as he asked about colonel sayyed there was one man though who had opened up he was selling electronics small radios tape players and twoway radios like rapps motorola rapp stepped into his small tent and said hello there was a polite exchange and then rapp asked him do you know anything about the two americans who were picked up a few days ago the man pointed to two radios and loudly asked rapp which one do you like better and then in a much quieter voice he said yes i know of the americans he then stuck out his hand for cash rapp peeled off seven onehundreddollar bills the man pocketed the bills and picked up a small alarm clock radio he began to explain its various features in between lauding the various components he lowered his voice and said there is a rumor that the americans are being held in the basement of an old building on the west side of martyrs square before rapp could ask another question the man was stuffing the alarm clock in a bag and sending him off that was when rapp noticed the two guys with stern faces and distinctive bulges under their jackets he went straight back to the hotel he wanted to pass on this nugget of information before he was picked up as he reached the street that the hotel was on he turned left which was the wrong way he took two steps and then acting as if hed just realized his mistake he turned left again and saw the two men halfway down the block just standing there staring at him rapp kept moving so as to not let them know that he was onto them it was not lost on him that the two men following him had made no effort to conceal their interest rapp hustled up the next block and when he entered the hotel he noticed a new manager behind the desk who gave him a very unpleasant look rapp supposed the man thought someone might blow up the hotel just because of his presence as he climbed the stairs to the fourth floor he realized you could hardly blame the guy he was like some saloonkeeper in one of those old western movies where the troublemakers were all gunning for the new sheriff when got up to the room he sat on the edge of the bed and collected his thoughts trying to prioritize the various bits and pieces the vendor was the only real highlight and even that might be worthless was it a wild rumor or was it fact rapp knew that unless he had a chance to talk to the man he would never be able to figure it out the two men trailing him had him worried were they on their way up to his room right now preparing to kick his door down and drag him off rapp thumbed the transmit button and said curly this is moe over the three stooges monikers was ridleys idea im here moe whats up i just got back from the market two guys tailed me back to the hotel not a surprise how was the market pretty much treated me like a leper just like you said yeah bad part of town they havent seen a gringo around there in some time im sure you were a big hit i did pick up one piece of information rapp paused trying to figure out the best way to pass it along without giving too much away on an open channel remember last night when our armenian friend talked to us about the manpower issue there was a slight delay and then yep i remember he referenced a local standoff a land grab kind of a standoff at the ok corral im with you there was one vendor cagey fellow told me on one side of the corral the guys are keeping some things in the basement i think i copy can you give me more on the source he sold electronics boom boxes small radios clocks that kind of stuff ridley asked for a description of the man and his stall and rapp gave it to him then ridley said ill pass this on to the american and see what hes heard anything else no rapp said as he crossed over to the window and pulled back the curtain the two men who had followed him had taken up positions directly across the street those guys i mentioned have decided to camp out in front of the hotel not a surprise you sure you still want to do this rapp had just been asking himself the same question but like his highschool lacrosse coach used to say you cant score unless you shoot im fine rapp said into the small radio if i dont check in at noon youll know im either dead or in the middle of negotiations lets hope its the latter roger that over and out rapp took off his khaki sport coat and went into the bathroom to splash some cold water on his face he patted the drops of water with a towel and looked at himself in the dusty cracked mirror rapp eyed his fractured reflection his thick head of black hair the beginnings of a beard his bronzed olive skin and his eyes so dark that they were almost black he could walk among the enemy without getting so much as a suspicious glance but that would all change if he didnt do something very carefully he patted his hair and then using his index finger he probed little deeper he could barely feel the small section of metal ridley had taken a flexible fourteeninch bandsaw blade and cut it down to a neat little threeinch piece an eighth of an inch thick and only a half inch wide the black metal section was then threaded into his dark head of black hair rapp played ridleys words over again in his head we know from debriefings that these things follow a certain pattern it usually starts with a whack across the back of the head but not always youre then tossed in either the backseat or the trunk taken somewhere and stripped naked and then moved one or two more times theres a good chance youll never be in the same building as them then again they might be two doors down and youll never know theyre there unless you get free rapp stared at his reflection and questioned his sanity are you fucking nuts rapp couldnt remember if hed ever talked to himself out loud like this in the mirror maybe drunk but never sober it all flashed before him in that moment he could slip out the back door and find his way back to the other side of town like ridley had told him last night if you get cold feet no one will judge you except for himself of course rapp did not want to live the rest of his life that way this wasnt like making a mistake in the heat of battle this would be making a conscious decision to run from the field of battle and not just to run but to desert two of his fellow soldiers and leave them for dead rapp knew himself well enough to understand that a failure of this magnitude would haunt him for the rest of his days he pushed himself away from the mirror before he lost the courage he checked the window again they were still down there and had possibly been joined by another guy who was standing at the far end of the block rapp looked over at his gun which was on the night table it had been suggested that to complete his performance he should leave the gun in the room but he didnt like that idea hed rather walk out of the hotel bucknaked than leave the gun he could explain it away as a precaution everyone else in this town walked around with a gun so why shouldnt he the radio was the only other thing to decide on he chose to bring it with him if he didnt get picked up right away he might need to call ridley with an update as a precaution he changed the channel and turned it off rapp quickly scrawled a note and left it on the small desk in the corner then put his sport coat back on and checked all the pockets everything was where it should be lifting the back of his jacket he wedged the beretta into his waistband and gathered his sunglasses the map and a large wad of cash and headed for the door he hesitated for a split second then told himself not to think id rather go down swinging he muttered as he shut the door if he survived this little ordeal hed have to ask lewis if talking to yourself was a symptom of losing your mind rapp moved quickly down the four flights of stairs to the lobby there was a new man behind the front desk and he looked nervous as all hell which rapp took as a sign that someone had talked to him this was it showtime rapp continued out the front door into the blazing daylight and held his map above his head to block the sun while he looked up and down the street looking out from behind the sunglasses he pretended not to notice the duo from islamic jihad with his face buried in the map he turned to the right and started heading east as if he was going back to the market within half a block rapps nervous system began sending his brain alarms each more frantic than the previous one now he was talking to himself again but this time it was in his brain the conscious hereandnow higherfunctioning part was talking to the ingrained lowerfunctioning part like a jockey talks to a thoroughbred as its being led into the starting gate easy he repeated to himself over and over it took every ounce of control to override his training and millions of years of basic survival instincts that were embedded like code into the human brain up ahead rapp recognized a black car that was parked across the street earlier in the morning the car had been empty rapp ignored the man behind the wheel and turned down a narrow side street just thirty paces ahead a roughlooking man was stationed in front of a shop his left leg was straight and firmly planted on the pavement and the other bent up behind him and placed against the side of the building his big frame was resting against the wall while he took a long drag off his cigarette the man had dusty black pants and a white dress shirt with sweatstained armpits and there was something vaguely familiar about him rapp wondered if he had been in one of the photos ridley had shown him the street was otherwise empty the survivors of the bloody civil war could smell trouble and they had wisely decided to stay indoors until the mornings sideshow was concluded rapp heard the men behind him their thick shoes pounding out their progress and pace on the sidewalk suddenly a car engine revved and the pace of his pursuers quickened with every step rapp could feel them closing in from behind his brain ran through options and avenues of escape and he denied each one willing himself to stay the course like a deranged ships captain headed for the shoals at full speed they were close now rapp could feel them the big fellow up ahead threw his cigarette to the ground and pushed himself away from the building he smiled at rapp and produced a leather truncheon from his back pocket it was at that moment rapp realized who the man was rapp dropped the map in feigned surprise and turned to flee the two men were exactly where he expected them to be guns drawn one pointed at rapps head the other his chest the sedan skidded to a stop just to his right the trunk and front passenger door swinging open rapp knew what was next he closed his eyes and clenched his jaw as the truncheon cracked him across the back of the head rapp stumbled forward his sunglasses clattering to the pavement he fell into the arms of the two men with pistols he let his legs go limp and the men struggled with his weight he felt the arms of the big man wrap around his chest and yank him upright his mm beretta was pulled from the back of his waistband and he was dragged the short distance to the cars trunk rapp landed headfirst with a thud the rest of his body was folded in on top of him and then the trunk was slammed shut the engine roared and the rear tires bit through a layer of sand and dirt until they found asphalt rapp was thrown back as the vehicle shot away he slowly cracked open his eyes and as expected found himself enveloped in darkness his head was throbbing a bit from the blow but not too badly there was no fear on his face or doubt in his mind though just a smile on his lips as he thought of his childhood friend cal berkley and his pet snake cals pride and joy was his pet boa constrictor buckeye when they were bored during the hot summer months theyd go over to cals house and watch him feed rats to buckeye well one day cal came home from school to find buckeye dead with a hole in the side of his body and a bloody white rat still alive in the tank apparently buckeye had gotten lazy and swallowed the rat before it was dead once inside the rat had then chewed its way out rapp couldnt help but smile at the thought of doing the same thing to these assholes this was either going to be the most spectacular success of his life or the end of it fear and debate no longer had a place in his thoughts there was no turning back no more handwringing this was all about deception and action the game had started he was descending into the belly of the beast the only question was would he be able to eat his way out chapter the aeroflot tupolev tu was cleared for landing on beirut international airports only operating runway ivanovs bullish attitude was back primakov was backing him all the way on this little excursion these palestinian dogs thought they had everything figured out but as usual ivanov was three steps ahead of them ivanov blamed himself for just one mistake during this entire mess why hadnt he thought of killing dorfman first all of that money could have been his how could he have missed such an opportunity ivanov supposed he had been blind out of necessity in his world a talented banker who knew how to skirt laws and hide money was absolutely essential that was another problem he now had to deal with where was he going to find another man with those capabilities he would have to fly to hamburg soon after he delivered the americans to primakov he would sit down with dorfmans boss herr koenig and make him see that certain reparations were in order shvets had come up with that idea get koenig to authorize a few loans to shell companies that were in ivanovs name and were run out of switzerland loans that would never be repaid shvets explained that a bank of this size wrote off more than a hundred million dollars a year in bad loans if handled the right way he could bleed herr koenig out of several million dollars a year this opened up a whole new avenue of possibilities for ivanov he could apply the same principle with a few of the new bankers in moscow in only a few years he could have all his money back and then some that shvets was a smart boy maybe too smart ivanov watched shvets exit the cockpit and close the door as his deputy sat in the aisle seat next to him he noted the way shvets glanced at his glass of vodka barely able to hide his contempt we will be on the ground in less than a minute shvets announced while he fastened his seatbelt good i am eager to get this over with and get back to moscow shvets wondered what kind of man wished to be gone from a place before hed arrived glancing out the window ivanov asked do you think we could persuade herr koenig to visit us in moscow early next week doubtful shvets said with a shake of his head well try and if he wont come to us then i will go to him as always though i would like to try to do this the civilized way first two businessmen exploring an opportunity in some countries they call it a shakedown ivanov drained his glass and gave shvets an unhappy frown shvets realized the sulking ivanov was gone and the ruthless one was back sorry ivanov did not reply at first he had picked up on the mans growing insolence over the past year but it seemed to have grown exponentially over the past week maybe it was time to replace him the question was with whom the private sector was exploding with opportunity and the svr no longer had the pick of the litter he decided he shouldnt give up on him so easily a good lesson or two might restore the proper attitude and if that didnt work hed think about having him shot cutting him free would be foolish shvets knew too many of his secrets the plane landed on the relatively short runway and braked hard while they taxied to the designated area shvets leaned over and asked what is our plan if the bidding goes over five million dollars ivanov laughed it wont how can you be so sure because i am smarter than these dogs shvets was intrigued what have you been up to sir lets just say i made a few calls to my friends in tehran and baghdad and they have agreed that it would be foolish to pay for something that i am willing to give them for free shvets was dubious are you sure you can trust them the plane stopped in front of an old rusty hangar the doors were open and light streamed into the interior from the holes in the roof sayyed stepped from the shadows and waved at the plane ivanov laughed at the sight of him there are two things you need to know to understand the middle east the first is that they all hate the jews the second is that they have nothing but contempt for the palestinians chapter it couldnt have been more than five minutes the trunk opened and they were on him rapp couldnt tell how many but it was more than two and fewer than five the punched grabbed and pulled finally yanking him from the space and throwing him to the floor rapp tried to block the blows as best he could but they were coming from too many directions and besides the goal was not to show them how skilled he was at fighting it was to play possum to that end rapp started screaming and begging them to stop the asskicking did stop but only because they began stripping him when they were done rapp lay on the hard dusty floor whimpering as best he could tell they were in some type of bombedout building all of his clothes and possessions were thrown into the trunk of the car that he had just been yanked from the vehicle started up again and then the driver floored the gas and sprayed rapp with loose gravel the four men who were standing around him all started laughing a fifth man walked into the circle rapp recognized him as the one who had been leaning against the building he was a senior member of fatah why are you doing this i have been authorized by my government to negotiate with you radih squatted on his haunches he held out rapps beretta why do you need this to negotiate rapp shrugged this is a dangerous town i dont know radih slapped him hard across the face i think you are a liar sorry shut up but the money radih slapped him again and rapp started to whimper im just a messenger and what do you have to offer money lots of it how much a million dollars radih roared with laughter i think it will cost you a lot more than that maybe i can get more money rapp said hopefully and maybe we will sell you to the russians with the others i can get you the money i dont care about the money and besides you do not seem like you would fetch a very good price the other men nodded and laughed radih was suddenly curious about this man he had to be very lowlevel why were you chosen to negotiate their release rapp shrugged and didnt answer radih slapped him and one of the other men kicked his legs and screamed answer him i volunteered please dont hit me and why would anyone volunteer for something like this rapp spoke softly into the floor speak up i said i am related to one of the men related to who stan hurley we dont have a hostage named stan hurley yes you do hurley is his real name you probably know him as bill sherman thats why i volunteered please dont hurt me rapp pleaded i mean you no harm i just want to get these men released i promise we will not bother you again how are you related to this stan hurley hes my dad radih could hardly believe his luck he might not be able to kill bill sherman but sayyed had said nothing about his son radih stood lets go he announced to his men tape his wrists and toss him in the trunk rapp was as passive as he could be while they wound the duct tape quickly around his wrists he counted ten times and noted that they didnt bother to tape his ankles i can make you guys rich rapp pleaded as they tossed him in the trunk of a different car the trunk was slammed shut and then they were off he had no idea where they were to begin with so the twentyoddminute drive that they went on through the city was unecessary just before they stopped however things became noticeably quieter almost as if they were in the country when the trunk popped again rapp was hit with a blast of sunlight he glimpsed a building that looked like it was slated for demolition two big men yanked him roughly from the trunk rapps bare feet hit the rough ground and he realized they were in an alley the buildings on each side were riddled with pockmarks and not one of them had a window two blocks away he caught a glimpse of blue before he could take in anything else he was rushed into the building and down a flight of stairs he was immediately hit by the smell of raw sewage he almost gagged and this time it wasnt for effect the hallway was ten feet wide with rooms on each side they were all missing doors except three rooms at the midpoint on the right he noted the two guards with bandannas tied around their faces they were the first men who had tried to conceal their faces and then rapp realized it was the smell the men who had him by the arms yelled ahead to the guards to open the first door they removed the padlock from the latch and swung the door open with a good enough head start rapp thought he might be able to bust the latch off please rapp pleaded with the men im only an analyst i cant do this please give me my clothes back and let me call washington ill get you your money they tossed rapp into the room like a rag doll he tumbled to the floor begging them to listen to him then the door was closed and he was again enveloped in darkness rapp began to whimper softly at first and then a little louder for some strange reason this room smelled better than the hallway almost as if it had been cleaned with bleach he recalled the landscape in the alley and remembered the thin strip of blue on the horizon only a few blocks away it was the sea for certain and with all of the bombedout buildings it fit the general description of martyrs square the merchant must have been right rapp rolled onto his side and started digging through his thick hair the fact that they hadnt covered his head with a hood worried him he found the small blade and placed one end in his teeth he set the blade against the top edge of the tape and began slowly moving his hands back and forth chapter the stairs at the tail of the russian plane were lowered and sayyed watched the soldiers in black fatigues file down the steps he counted thirty all heavily armed all russian special forces sayyed had no doubt they were intended as both a show of force and an insult sayyed raised the radio to his lips and said you were right mughniyahs voice came back how many men thirty spetsnaz heavily armed there was a long pause and then i will be there in five minutes sayyed attached the radio to his belt and watched as the elite russian soldiers spread out to cover the area finally shvets appeared and then ivanov both men were in suits and wearing sunglasses to protect their delicate moscow eyes as they approached ivanov yelled at sayyed from across the tarmac the big russian threw out his arms and walked the final ten paces as if it had been far too long since they had last seen each other sayyed was not going to be a rude host so he held out his arms as well and despite his misgivings he greeted ivanov with a smile as much as he distrusted the man there was something likable about him assef my friend how are you ivanov practically picked the syrian up in his arms i am well thank you for coming ivanov pushed the syrian intelligence officer away and held him at arms length what happened to your ear sayyed gently touched the bandage and said oh nothing just a little accident other than that you are well yes ivanov peered over the top of his sunglasses at the hangar and the surrounding landscapethe bombedout hangar an airliner with only one wing and another with no engines i see beirut hasnt changed much things are getting better sayyed pointed back toward the construction equipment at the main terminal we thought privacy would be best for this meeting he motioned toward the hangar saying i promise it will be worth your effort yes but what is this nonsense i have to compete for my information like some rancher bidding on heads of cattle they started walking toward the shade of the hangar sayyed followed the script that mughniyah had given him yes well if it was up to me it would only be you but i am not the only one with a voice in this mughniyah ivanov asked yes i have warned you he is in love with the religious zealots in iran and we both know they will never be the answer to a lasting peace in beirut i know i know sayyed said patting ivanovs arm as they entered the hangar but there is only so much i can do and you have been a staunch supporter do not think that has gone unnoticed ivanov took off his sunglasses now where are these americans that we are all so interested in sayyed pointed to their left in the shadowy recesses of the hangar next to a rusty brokendown truck a man wearing a black hood sat in a single chair but i thought there would be three there are sayyed said think of this one as a sample ivanov was not happy i have flown all this way and you play games with me i do not like this assef no games sayyed lied security is very important one of these americans is such a big fish that we must be extra careful what is his name i cannot say just yet why we must wait for the others ivanov looked around the empty space shvets and the spetsnaz commander had wisely stopped twenty feet away to give them some privacy where were the representatives from iran and iraq turning back to sayyed he asked that exact question they will be here any minute ivanov checked his watch and huffed his instincts told him something else was going on here i do not like this i do not like this one bit i am on time i have important business to attend to back in moscow i am sorry mikhail sorry will not work ivanov leaned in close so he was eye to eye with sayyed when you come to moscow i treat you like a prince i come here and we meet in this he waved his hand around the dilapidated space mikhail i am sorry we do not have your resources and that is something you would be wise to remember i do not deserve to be treated like this i am sorry sayyed could only say again if you are so sorry you will stop playing games with me and tell me who this big fish is and if you do not want to stop playing games then i will be forced to start playing them as well maybe i will get on my plane and fly back to moscow you can conduct your little auction without me mikhail i am dont say it again if you are truly sorry you will tell me who the mystery american is if not i am done playing games and i will leave mughniyah had specifically told him not to divulge that information until he was there but sayyed was growing weary of the mans paranoia he did not trust ivanov but he couldnt see what harm could be caused by telling him about bill sherman i will give you a sneak peak but you have to play dumb when mughniyah gets here turning sayyed said follow me as they walked over to a folding table he said this american is rumored to have been heavily involved in some of the cias most sensitive operations including operations directed at your country there were three files on the table sayyed picked up one and handed it to ivanov ivanov had been preparing himself for this for the past twentyfour hours he had expected to see the man in person but in a way it would be easier for him to downplay his reaction this way he opened the file looked at the polaroid photo of the american spy and nearly gasped ivanov hid his emotions and tilted his head as if he were trying to place the face even though he knew with absolute certainty who the man was he and stan hurley had tangled back in berlin a long time ago hurley had become such a problem that he had sent two of his best men to kill him one night neither came back their bodies were found floating in the spree river the next day the day after that hurley marched into ivanovs office in broad daylight and put a gun to his head hurley explained the rules to him that morning rules that ivanov already knew but had nonetheless ignored the americans and russians were not supposed to kill each other it was all part of the new détente of the cold war the easing of tensions in the early seventies brought about by nixon and brezhnev the american then gagged him blindfolded him tied him up and pilfered his files when hurley was done he loosened the ropes on ivanovs wrists a bit and whispered in his ear you should be able to wiggle your way out of these in a few minutes by then ill be gone and youll be faced with two options you can scream your head off and try to chase me if you do that your bosses and everyone else back in moscow will know that you let an american waltz into your office in the middle of the day tie you up and steal your files you will be an embarrassment to the kgb and we both know how much the kgb likes to be embarrassed your other option well lets just say i hope youre smart enough to figure it out ivanov was smart enough and he had never told a soul about that day he coughed into his hand and turned to sayyed i have heard of this man what else can you tell me about him sayyed thought it best to not be too forthright on this point telling him that the american was the toughest craziest man hed ever encountered would not be good for the negotiations fortunately he was saved by the sounds of approaching vehicles chapter hurley dangled in the air from a hook that was tied to his wrists his toes hovered only a few inches from the floor his shoulders ached like nothing he had ever experienced this had been his punishment for taking a bite out of sayyed they also decided to tape his mouth shut but he thought that had more to do with silencing his insults than with their fear of being bitten the only nice thing to come of it was that theyd left him alone not that hanging by your wrists a few inches off the ground was a nice thing but it was certainly preferable to having your fingernails ripped out and being electrocuted there was a noise at the door a second later it opened and the light turned on hurley blinked a few times before he could see it was radih the fatah leader crossed over and exhaled cigarette smoke into hurleys face hurley inhaled the smoke and thought he might apologize for all the nasty things hed said about radihs mother if only the man would offer him a heater radih reached up and tore the tape off the americans mouth i have a surprise for you we gonna try the rubber hose today no something much better great hurley said with feigned enthusiasm i cant wait hey about that stuff i said about your mom before hurley could get the rest of it out radih smashed his fist into hurleys stomach i have had enough of your lies i am going to make you feel more pain than you have ever imagined good hurley coughed i hope you kill me because mughniyah will kill you for it nothing could make me happier than making sure you went down with me dont worry im not going to kill you radih said smiling but i am going to kill your son hurley laughed what the fuck are you talking about radih turned to his men get him my son hurley asked you must be off your rocker unless you mean one of your bastard brothers i fathered with your mother yes keep talking we will see how tough you are in a moment the two men returned each with one arm looped under rapps armpits rapp was shuffling along trying to keep up and blabbing incessantly about the money he could get them rapp saw hurley and yelled dad dont worry were going to get out of this washington is going to pay for your release hurley looked at rapp and said what the fuck are you talking about have you lost your mind radih was finally having some fun this is beautiful you are right i cant kill you but i can kill your son a big american fuckyou radih snapped his fingers and pointed at the floor bring him here the men dumped rapp on the ground at radihs feet i will handle him he said as he drew the americans silenced beretta from his waistband hold the fathers head and make sure his eyes are open the two men left rapp and took up positions on the right and left side of hurley they grabbed his head and dug their thumbs into the skin just under his eyebrows and pulled up make him look radih commanded as he grabbed a fistful of rapps hair over here why are you doing this rapp wailed in a panicked voice our government will pay you radih bent over and said they will pay for him you idiot you are worthless he straightened and looked at hurley are there any other lies youd like to spew about my mother hurley didnt offer a reply how does a man of your considerable though twisted talents sire such a stupid child rapp looked up only half listening to the insults his focus was on a beautiful mm suppressed beretta radih kept waving the gun back and forth sticking it in hurleys face and then pointing it at rapps head rapp followed it like a tennis volley radihs finger was on the trigger and the red dot above his thumb told rapp that the safety was off and the gun was hot the man settled into a rhythm with his insults he was now saying something about rapps mother the woman he presumed to have slept with hurley the palestinian stuck the tip of the suppressor under hurleys nose and ordered him to beg for his sons life as hurley started to speak the gun began its slowmotion arc back to rapp rapp made his move hed sawed most of the way through the tape around his wrists while he was back in the holding cell now not sure the tape would break he went for a twohanded grab around the barrel of the gun his hands clamped down on the steel while the gun was still swinging rapps way rapp stood driving the gun straight up so a misfire wouldnt bury itself in hurleys chest at the top he pivoted to his left bringing the gun up and over the top of his head before pulling it back down on the other side effectively putting radih in an arm bar in this position the palestinian couldnt move unless he let go of the gun rapp delivered a quick knee strike to radihs face and a bullet spat harmlessly into the cinderblock wall having dazed him rapp ripped the gun free he swung the pistol back cracking radih across the forehead with the heavy metal grip the blow sent him to the floor rapp tried to wrench his wrists free of the remaining duct tape but it caught the other two men were finally starting to move hurley realizing that one of the men might yell for help started screaming at the top of his lungs as if he were being beaten rapp took a step back to get a better angle and yanked again but the last bit of tape held so he flipped the gun up in the air and caught the grip with both hands the man on his left was no more than four feet away when he fired the gun twice hitting him both times in the chest the man collapsed at rapps feet rapp swung the gun around on the other man who was caught between the door and hurley he was never going to make it so he stopped and put his hands up in the air shoot him hurley ordered in a raspy voice rapp squeezed the trigger and buried a bullet in the mans forehead get me down quick hurley hissed what about him rapp asked pointing the gun at radih who was showing signs of life get me down first rapp ripped through the last bit of tape while he ran over to the wall and untied the makeshift pulley hurley dropped the short distance to the floor landing on his feet he wavered for a second and then caught his balance give me that gun hurley ordered and check the right thigh pocket of that second one you shot he should have a knife rapp placed the gun in hurleys hands and went off to search for the knife hurley walked over to radih whose arms were starting to flop around as if he was waking up from a deep sleep hurley stomped on his stomach and the palestinians eyes popped open hurley bent over and pressed the suppressor against radihs chest looking into his eyes he said you should have killed me when you had the chance you piece of shit hurley pulled the trigger chapter two of the sedans pulled into the hangar and three more stopped just outside all of the doors opened at roughly the same time and a dozen wellarmed men fanned out creating a barrier at the door effectively sealing ivanov off from his spetsnaz escort ivanov looked at the commander with extreme disappointment mughniyah approached with a confident grin on his face four of his bodyguards trailed a few paces back mikhail welcome to beirut i would hardly call this a welcome you will have to excuse all of this but i am not in a good mood today and why is that because i just found out that you have been scheming behind my back yet again what are you talking about you will notice that our iraqi and iranian friends are not here why sayyed asked alarmed by the news because i found out that mikhail had made a deal with them didnt you mikhail ivanov tried to laugh the question away as if it was a harmless maneuver mughniyah turned his attention back to sayyed and said he set the ceiling at five million the others were going to bow out and let him win what did you do with them sayyed asked for the moment they are my guests i will decide if i am going to kill them later ivanov clasped his hands together and laughed mughniyah was proving to be much smarter than he had given him credit for you have outsmarted me imad that does not happen very often would you like me to leave or would you like to discuss business negotiate some terms perhaps i will negotiate nothing with you i am going to name a price and you are going to pay it really ivanov said and what if i decide i dont like your price then we will have a big problem ivanov nodded as if he found the game amusing before we get to that though i need you to return all of the money you took from our swiss bank accounts money that i took ivanovs eyes nearly bulged out of his head i did no such thing i think you did as a matter of fact i want my money back from you your money yes my money ivanovs face was blazing red the money that you took you dont think i suspected you at once you never liked sharif you did nothing but complain about his prices you called him a rat and a traitor to the cause for charging his inflated prices i did not kill sharif mughniyah denied flatly and why should i believe you because i am a man of honor someone who fights for what he believes in not a thief like you honor this is beautiful you of all people speak of honor imad mughniyah the hijacker of civilian airliners the kidnapper of professors the man who shells entire neighborhoods filled with women and children you speak of honor that is laughable ivanov literally spat the last word at his accuser mughniyah reached for his gun but the spetsnaz commander beat him to the draw and pointed the barrel of his markov pistol at the side of mughniyahs head all of a sudden it appeared as if everyone had a gun slides were being racked and hammers cocked enough sayyed shouted your disdain for each other has blinded your judgment and you are a fool mughniyah yelled sayyed approached him and in a voice loud enough for only mughniyah to hear said and you are broke how are you going to pay all of your men next week and the week after that get control of your hot temper and let me handle this speaking to the group he then said everyone lower your weapons he motioned with his hands and repeated himself two more times until finally all of the weapons were either holstered or pointed in a safe direction i know that imad did not steal the money and i do not think that mikhail did so either how can you know mughniyah angrily asked tell me why would he come here today if he had stolen our money while mughniyah pondered that question shvets stepped forward i can assure you that my boss had nothing to do with the stolen funds i visited herr dorfmans boss in hamburg last week more than fifty million dollars was stolen it appears we were not the only targets shvets wanted to get out here with his life so he quickly added we are following several leads including one that the money was stolen by an organized crime element out of prague and i can promise you ivanov added quickly that when we find these people we will get our money back and we will punish the people who took it thank you sayyed said right now we have something very important to negotiate we have three americans john cummins who served four years in moscow and the last four in damascus another relatively young man by the name of robert richards and the infamous bill sherman sayyed grabbed the file off the table and handed it to ivanov giving him a second to study the photo again now how much would your government be willing to pay for these three men ivanov unconsciously licked his lips a prize like stan hurley would virtually guarantee him the directorship primakov was getting old and lacked the ruthless animal instinct that it took to run the svr he could control the interrogation and filter what information he passed on the thought of keeping that asshole hurley in the basement of one of his secure sites like some exotic animal was almost too much to take he reminded himself that this was still a negotiation and his funds were not unlimited i am confident that my government would pay five million dollars for these three that is not enough mughniyah complained before anyone had had a chance to absorb the offer thus started the back and forth with ivanov coming up three million in his price they were stuck there for a few minutes while mughniyah kept saying that he would only accept an offer of sixteen million ivanov as well as sayyed tried to explain to him that the issues of the stolen money and the value of the american spies had nothing to do with each other ivanov raised his offer to ten and was prepared to walk away when mughniyah finally countered at fourteen thirty seconds later they had agreed on twelve and everyone breathed a sigh of relief no one more so than sayyed they were only halfway done though mughniyah wanted all the money in their possession before they would turn the men over and ivanov wasnt going to release a red cent until he laid eyes on stan hurley sayyed broke the stalemate by saying you need to call moscow correct yes why dont i retrieve the prisoners they are not far from here you can make the arrangements to have the money transfered and when we get back we can complete the transaction ivanov who wanted to get as far away from this horrible place and these horrible people as quickly as possible leaped at the chance to expedite his departure that is a wonderful idea turning to shvets he said nikolai go with assef and bring the prisoners back here the last thing shvets wanted to do was leave the relative security of this hangar and drive into downtown beirut he considered asking if he could bring a few of the spetsnaz with him but he knew the request would be denied as he followed sayyed and his men to their car he wondered how much longer he could continue to work for ivanov chapter rapp found the knife dug it out of the mans pants and crossed the room he took his gun back from hurley and stuck it under his armpit while he cut the tape from hurleys wrists the tape peeled free and hurley said give me the gun rapp held out the knife get your own hurley grumbled and took the knife there are two guys in the hallway rapp started dragging one of the bodies across the room and placed it by the wall with the door ill open the door you try to sound like radih yell for them to get in here and ill pop em when the bodies were piled out of sight rapp placed his hand on the door handle hurley stood behind him rapp nodded and yanked the door open hurley muttered something about a mess and ordered the two guards to get in there unfortunately only one appeared rapp shot him in the back of the head while pulling the door open farther and swinging his left arm around searching for the second man the tip of the suppressor ended up less than a foot from the mans face rapp squeezed the trigger and shot him in the nose pink mist exploding out into the hallway stepping over the body he looked left and right the hallway was empty rapp dragged the guard into the room hurley was already stripping the first guard of his pants shirt and boots rapp did the same with the second guard and told hurley to grab the mans bandanna when rapp found the radio he asked hurley do you know where we are no i think i might what about bobby and cummins bobby should be here but i think they took cummins to the airport theyre trying to auction off our asses well get bobby in a second but i need to call ridley first rapp dialed in the right frequency and hit the transmit button all he got was static bad reception down here hurley told him well have to get out of the basement all right rapp looked around the room i assume bobby is naked too yeah lets grab him some clothes rapp scavenged up a set while hurley collected two ammo pouches with eight extra ak magazines when they had everything they tied the bandannas around their faces and rapp checked the hallway it was still empty so they ducked out closing the door behind them and locking it the next door over was padlocked so rapp shot the lock off with his beretta hurley opened the door and froze there dangling from the hook in the middle of the room with a rope wrapped around his neck was richards motherfuckers was all hurley could manage to say rapp considered checking for a pulse but richardss skin was chalk white hed been dead for hours should we bring him with us no hurley shook his head rapp closed the door to richardss cell and told himself he would process it later they ran down the back hallway but when they got near the stairs they heard some voices hurley started making hand gestures but rapp waved him off pulling him back away from the stairs whispering in his ear rapp said i have an idea rapp handed him the twoway radio try ridley again tell him i think were at martyrs square im gonna run down to the front of the building and see if i can start a little something rapp started to move but hurley grabbed him what are you talking about just wait here if im right youre gonna hear a shitload of gunfire in about a half minute then well make our break rapp pointed at the radio just try to raise ridley ill be right back rapp tore off down the hallway slowing when he was fifteen feet from the stairs at the front of the building he stopped and listened for a moment but heard nothing then there was the sound of a foot scraping along the floor and a faint voice rapp couldnt tell if was coming from the first floor or farther up he considered going back to hurley he could use his silenced beretta to take out whoever was at the back of the building and then try to make a run for it fundamentally though there was a problem they were on the wrong side of town and severely outgunned they needed a diversion to get out of here full speed ahead he muttered to himself as he started up the stairs his silenced pistol in his left hand and the ak in the right midway up the steps he got his first glimpse of a small lobby off to the left maybe fifteen by fifteen feet rapp counted two heads and then three the main entrance was sandbagged as were the windows on each side although theyd left two holes in the sandbags to fire fromexactly what rapp was looking for when he hit the landing he noticed two more men lying on the floor one was standing looking out one hole in the sandbags watching the street and two more were sitting in folding chairs playing a board game rapp walked straight for the man who was on his feet he kept his pace casual and started shaking his head as if he was going to tell them just how crappy things were downstairs one of the men started bitching in arabic the best rapp could figure was that the man was telling him he had another hour before he had to pull a watch in the toilet rapp laughed and then raised the suppressed beretta he had had eighteen shots to start with and was down to twelve the guy who was standing got it first a nice little shot from ten feet right in the left eye the two guys playing the board gameone got it in the back of the head and the other in his open mouth rapp never stopped moving it was another nice thing hurley had taught him when you have the advantage close with the enemy he was no more than eight feet away when he shot the two nappers the first one was clean but with the second guy he was off a bit on the first shot so he had to fire one more to put him out of his misery six shots left rapp glanced to his left the hallway had been barricaded with scraps of broken office furniture the stairs going up were empty he walked over to the little onebyonefoot hole in the sandbags and looked across the street sure enough about two hundred feet away was a similar building this had to be martyrs square rapp slung his ak over his right shoulder stuffed the beretta in his waistband and picked up the dead lookouts ak he gripped the rifle firmly flipped the selector switch to full automatic and sighted at the building across the street he didnt want to kill anyone over there but he did want to make sure he got their attention so he chose a position on the second floor and let it rip the bullets shredded the afternoon calm thudding into the sandbags across the street and then the building itself as it climbed rapp emptied the entire magazine and dropped the weapon without hesitating he moved to the peephole on the other side of the front door and took aim with the other ak this time he sprayed the entire building down firing in controlled bursts twenty or so rounds into the magazine the building across the street erupted in gunfire rapp hauled ass down the stairs as he heard bullets smacking into the building and gunfire being returned hurley was standing at the other end waiting for him what in hell did you just do i gave the big fu to washington and got us a little diversion rapp looked up the stairs the men were gone come on lets get the hell out of here they climbed up the stairs and when they reached the landing a heavyset guy in green fatigues came running down from the floor above and started ordering them to the upper floors to return fire hurley pointed out the back door with his rifle and when the man looked in that direction he deftly stuck a knife through his carotid artery blood came cascading out pulsating through his fingers hurley followed rapp out the back door just as a sedan skidded to a stop between two piles of rubble the two men in the front seat jumped out of the car yelling and asking what was going on rapp couldnt hear them over the gunfire and since they werent pointing a gun at him he wasnt in any rush to kill them all he wanted was their car two more men exited the rear of the car one caucasian and the other middle eastern both looked vaguely familiar which made rapp think hed seen them in some of the photos ridley had shown him hurley said merry fucking christmas and then shot the two men in front rapp raised the beretta and took aim at the fairskinned guy on the left hurley yelled dont kill the little commie crack him over the head and stuff him in the trunk ive got the other one rapp and hurley rushed the two men their weapons leveled hurley swung the butt end of his rifle and cracked sayyed across the temple as the syrian dropped to his knees hurley said sayyed old buddy i cant wait to play twenty questions with you epilogue zurich switzerland four days later thomas stansfield sat on the park bench and looked up at the rietberg museum he loved zurichthe lake the unique pace the beauty of the mountains but most important the safety it afforded a man of his profession this city and the small country it was part of had managed to stay out of world war ii even with war raging just beyond its borders in every direction and in the years after that it had continued to offer respite for cold warriors like himself and the man he was about to meet a place where they could lower their guard not completely but enough to enjoy life a little and occasionally meet facetoface to discuss mutually beneficial opportunities or in this instance conclude vital transactions stansfield saw the two black sedans enter the park and glanced at his watch the meeting would start on time which was a nice surprise the man he was meeting was notoriously late stansfield watched the sedans stop thirty feet behind the two vehicles in his entourage every detail had been agreed to in advance so as to not make either party unduly skittish two men in dark overcoats and sunglasses exited the first car they looked like eastern european versions of the two men who were standing a respectful thirty feet behind the cias deputy director of operations a man with unusually large ears and puffy eyes exited the second car and buttoned his blue doublebreasted suit coat one of the men approached with a wool overcoat but the older man waved him off which brought the hint of a smile to stansfields face he had spent six years in moscow to a russian forty degrees in zurich this time of year would feel like summer yevgeny primakov motioned for his men to stay by the car and walked over to the bench stansfield did not stand and primakov did not expect him to neither were handshakes offered these were two men whose entire jobs revolved around seeing through other peoples deceptions did you bring my man stansfield asked yes did you bring mine that was not part of the agreement it should have been primakov said gruffly there would have been a slight problem there yevgeny what stansfield turned so he could face him my man wants to come back to america your man stansfield shook his head he doesnt want to go back to russia what does that tell you how can i know that you have not allowed me to talk to him stansfield pulled a manila envelope from inside his jacket i gave you the highlights on the phone his boss one of your deputies has stolen more than twenty million dollars from mother russia and her fine citizens that money is currently sitting in various accounts around the world how do you think deputy shvets would be treated if i were to hand him over to you primakov did not answer the question yevgeny you do realize i could have given this to the white house they would have shared it with your president when the time was right and you would have been put under suspicion along with that thug ivanov primakov couldnt bring himself to say thank you so he asked why the courtesy because i dont like my people being kidnapped and treated like a science experiment you did bring mr cummins yes primakov stuck out his hand for the envelope not until i see my man primakov motioned to his men and they opened the back door of the first car the bodyguard had to help cummins out of the sedan he was incredibly thin but it was him stansfield looked over his shoulder and snapped his fingers one of his bodyguards took off at a trot to help with the transfer the package stansfield handed it to primakov who immediately tore it open he flipped through the twentyodd pages and asked and how do i know this isnt all made up check it yourself the access codes are all there the money is still in the accounts although trust me i thought about using it for a few of our more creative programs primakov considered that for a moment he finally managed to say thank you youre welcome stansfield said as he stood just do me a favor yevgeny lets stick to the old rules you stay away from my guys and ill stay away from yours stansfield walked away with his other bodyguard close behind he stopped at the first sedan to check on the schnoz and then got into the backseat of the second car the bodyguard closed the door and then went around the other side and climbed in the backseat as soon as they were out of the park the bodyguard took off his sunglasses and asked did he buy it sir stansfield looked at over at mitch rapp and said one hundred percent rapp looked out the window thinking that hurley had truly lived up to his reputation as the biggest sob on the block it had been pure evil genius to pay ivanovs money back into his accounts and have shvets inform on him so whats going to happen to ivanov stansfield looked down and straightened his tie i think mikhail ivanov is going to spend the next few months being thoroughly interrogated by the svrs goon squad and then what he wont be able to deny the money will he no stansfield nodded youre a smart kid fill in the blanks couldnt happen to a nicer guy rapp shrugged as if he didnt care what about sayyed some questions are better off not asked rapp frowned he didnt like not knowing listen stansfield said i cant release a guy like sayyed hell just go back and torture more of our people stansfield shook his head the man will get what he deserves sir i hope you know i dont give a crap what happens to him good what about shvets shvets will be fine as long as he continues to cooperate in a few years well cut him loose and let him start a life of his own they drove in silence for a while and then rapp finally asked sir why did you want me to come along for this being your bodyguard is not exactly my area of expertise stansfield had been wondering when the rookie was going to get around to asking the question he grinned to himself and asked rapp you think stan hurley is a son of a bitch the biggest one ive ever met sir stansfield laughed now you know hes not big on compliments rapp nodded well he had some pretty amazing things to say about you when you got back from beirut ridley as well irene has been telling me for close to two years that she thought you might have the goods and i guess you proved to all of us last week that you most certainly do thank you sir so i guess i wanted to have a closer look at you and show you that despite what you may have thought in beirut i will go to great lengths to get my people back rapp nodded he supposed ridley had passed on his blistering critique i know that now sir good now i think you should take a week off youve earned it i dont care where you go as long as its west of here seven days from now report to stan ive got something else i want you two to work on rapp was tempted to ask but decided he didnt want it weighing on him while he was trying to recharge any idea where youre going to go stansfield asked in case we need to get hold of you rapp looked at the snowcapped mountains and thought of greta with a smile on his face he said i think im going to stay right here in zurich
