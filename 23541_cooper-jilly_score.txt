be regarded at twentyeight as the most exciting conductor since the war had necessitated brutal trampling on the way up but at least rannaldini could count on the unqualified love of his tenyearold godson tristan de montigny to tristan the dashing maestro with his suave catlike smile his deep caressing voice and his recklessly fast cars was the most glamorous person in the world most importantly rannaldini had been a friend of tristans mother who had died when tristan was a baby and was the only person prepared to satisfy the boys craving for information about her she was so beautiful so sweet so proud of you tristan and she love you so much her death happen in moment of madness when she feel she cannot cope and was unworthy of your father tristans father étienne de montigny was frances most illustrious painter he was revered for his portraits and landscapes but most famous for his erotic paintings many of which salomes ecstasy the rape of lucrece and more recently david and jonathan hung in the great galleries of the world elevating nearpornography to an art form étienne outwardly a laughing giant of a man had spawned a pack of children from three wives and numerous mistresses twelve years ago when he was sixty he had met rannaldini newly arrived in paris to make his fortune as a conductor the two had struck up a rapport and étienne had taken the handsome impossibly precocious teenager under his wing in return rannaldini had not only milked étiennes contacts but also posed for him part of the fun for collectors of what became known as étiennes extremely blue period was to identify rannaldini in the paintings as everyone from apollo to the head of john the baptist rannaldini had also provided beautiful young models to titillate the old goats palate and palette the most beautiful had been tristans mother the sixteenyearold delphine even étiennes staunchest supporters had been horrified when he had made this exquisite child his fourth wife and within a few weeks impregnated her nemesis moved swiftly a proud delighted étienne was busy sketching his newborn baby tristan when he heard that his fourth and favourite son laurent a young army officer had been blown up in chad laurent had always been a rebel and rumours persisted that he had been taken out by his own side too crazed with grief even to call for an inquiry étienne promptly lost interest in baby tristan and hardly seemed to notice when a few days later tristans young mother committed suicide she had been suffering from postnatal depression it was left to étiennes sister hortense a rusty old battleaxe to organize tristans christening at which as one of delphines last wishes rannaldini was a godfather étiennes indifference persisted tristan was the only one of his children he pointedly ignored and never praised the boy had been brought up with the rest of étiennes gilded pack in paris or at the château in the tarn but he was always the wistful calf which grazes away from the herd longing for yet shying away from love which was why his godfather was so important to tristan and why on that wintry november evening in he could hardly contain his excitement as in his first dark suit his gold hair slicked down with water he peered out at the galloping black clouds and frenziedly thrashing trees of the bois de boulogne for a first glimpse of rannaldinis mercedes although rannaldini got a machiavellian kick from singling out tristan for attention knowing it irritated the hell out of étienne he was genuinely attached to the boy he had also been a wonderful godfather writing from all over the world never forgetting christmas or a birthday taking tristan to concerts whenever he swept through paris for his confirmation he had even given him a guarneri cello valued at thousands which tristan had been practising for days hoping rannaldini might ask him to play tristan had also painted him a watercolour not too much like degas of polo players in the bois there was rannaldinis mercedes tristan hurtled downstairs beating the housekeeper slithering on a rosepatterned rug across the floorboards shyly shaking his godfather by the hand before submitting to a warm scented embrace as usual rannaldini was in a hurry as a tenthbirthday present he was taking tristan to verdis greatest opera don carlos the curtain would rise in an hour so they were cutting it fine but first he wanted to hear tristan play and whisked him into the library here rannaldini paused only to admire himself on the cover of parismatch and clock any new artists on the dark red walls over the centuries the montignys had increased their fortune buying paintings ahead of fashion rannaldini had considerably bolstered his coffers by using étiennes eye to build up his own collection opening the piano score of don carlos at the great cello solo at the beginning of act iv he placed it on tristans music stand try this even though tristan was sightreading he played with total concentration and the sad sound blossomed as his long fingers vibrated on the strings excellent cried rannaldini in delight you work very hard and this is excellent too he added putting tristans watercolour inside the piano score i will hang it in my study we must go i hope you will not be bored said rannaldini manoeuvring the mercedes through the pretheatre and dinner traffic at a speed that astounded even the parisians it is long opera but very interesting i will briefly explain story france and spain are ending long bloody war to unite the two countries elisabetta the french kings beautiful daughter is to marry carlos the son of king philip ii of spain understand tristan nodded he loved the way rannaldini never talked down to him young carlos reach france in disguise wanting to see if he has been lumbered with ugly cow but when he see princess elisabetta out hunting in the woods rannaldini gesticulated at the bois de boulogne he find her utterly beautiful with dark hair to her waist when he reveal he is carlos her future husband she fall in love too they will live appy ever after jumping a red light rannaldini made a vsign at an outraged crone in a volvo then awful thing appen carloss father philip ii decide he want elisabetta for himself and marries her instead this is very selfish because king already has beautiful girlfriend called eboli poor carlos however cannot stop loving elisabetta even though she is now queen of spain married to his father and she still love him but everywhere in spanish court they are spied on i wont spoil the ending they were approaching the opera house rannaldini rannaldini shouted admirers surging forward a group protesting against nuclear tests was also lurking one a handsome but ferocious blonde banged on the mercedes window which rannaldini lowered a fraction how would you like your testicles shrivelled by radiation she yelled sounds interesting murmured rannaldini closing the window as her furious face disappeared in a tidal wave of fans im getting a bodyguard he complained as a couple of doormen finally dragged him and tristan through the stage door tristan was unfazed particularly when rannaldini while donning the splendour of white tie and tails offered him a birthday glass of krug all down the passage singers could be heard warming up a white gardenia in a glass box for rannaldini to slot into his buttonhole was delivered to the maestros dressing room most of the flowers arriving were for cecilia rannaldini his second wife who was singing eboli and who now could be heard screaming when will people learn i only like red roses as she hurled everything else on to the floor chic and svelte for a diva cecilia had done much to advance rannaldinis career not least by changing her famous name to his having barged into the conductors room and smothered tristan in kisses she started rowing with rannaldini in italian carlos was being sung by a plump goodlooking italian franco palmieri rannaldinis latest discovery an unknown south african called hermione was making her début as elisabetta the packed audience was too old to interest tristan but with his chin resting on the front of the red velvet box he gazed down in wonder at the glittering instruments in the pit opposite him were the cellos and behind them towered the double basses redgold as beeches in autumn but once the action started on stage and hunting horns heralded hermione as elisabetta riding in on a real grey horse tristan hardly noticed the orchestra hermiones thick brown hair did indeed curl to her waist and he couldnt take his eyes off her cleavage which seemed to part like curtains whenever she hit a high note and how gloriously she sang rannaldinis black hair was drenched with sweat as his dark eyes sent laser beams to singer or musician so they responded almost without realizing it now he was smiling at hermione magicking increasingly beautiful sounds with a twitch of his baton cecilia rannaldini had a pure clean voice but not realizing that shouting and crying all night can harm the vocal cords tristan thought she sounded very rough she was however a great actress and as she glared at hermione put him in mind of the wicked queen in snow white king philip on the other hand was so stern and cold with his son carlos he reminded tristan of his own father étienne alone in the big box he was also terrified by the grand inquisitor blind hooded bent over his sticks like a black widow spider and when the flames began to flicker round the poor bare feet of the heretics tristan leapt to his own feet screaming no no they mustnt burn which was luckily drowned by orchestra church bells and chorus loudly praising god and the inquisition every role in don carlos is demanding but it was the young hermione who drew the most rapturous applause tristan clapped his hands until they were as pink as the carnations that cascaded down on her after more champagne and hugging as people poured backstage to congratulate them rannaldini cecilia fat franco whod sung carlos and hermione swept tristan off to the ritz where he still couldnt speak for excitement everyone was sweet to him because rannaldini made sure they knew both of his birthday and of his famous father the management presented him with a frothy fruit cocktail filled with coloured straws rannaldini who never minded what the boy ate allowed him to have lobster thermidor with sizzling cheese topping followed by blackcurrant sorbet hermione whod changed into lowcut dark blue lace presented him with one of her pink carnations then a birthday cake arrived with ten candles and he opened rannaldinis presents a red leatherbound copy of schillers play don carlos on which verdi had based his opera and a video camera tristan couldnt stop saying thank you he already play cello very well boasted rannaldini are you going to be a musician asked hermione no tristan blushed and stroked the camera im going to make films he was too happy to absorb the tensions around him singers are often so fired up after a performance they want sex instantly francos machismo was clearly dented because hermione made it plain she was interested only in rannaldini which didnt improve cecilias temper either she and franco muttered that hermione had deliberately hung on to notes to make them run out of breath nor would she have got such applause in the middle of act v if rannaldini hadnt made an artificial pause fortunately hermione didnt understand italian she was like one of his sisters oldfashioned dolls tristan decided who opened their big eyes and said mama although in hermiones case it seemed to be me me was it really twenty callbacks she was now asking rannaldini pinch me so i know im awake she screamed as rannaldini pinched her hard enough to leave white marks on her arm then he dropped his sleek dark head and kissed them better cecilia stormed out pretending that their daughter natasha had flu my wife is more neurotic than the horse in act one grumbled rannaldini you should be specially interested in don carlos he added to tristan because one of your montigny ancestors visited spanish court during philip iis reign and the inquisition kill him thinking he is spy i wish i had smart relations like that he went on fretfully i cannot imagine you not being smart signor rannaldini said a soft dreamy voice and they were engulfed in the sweetest scent as though a bank of violets had bloomed behind them it was the only time tristan had ever seen his godfather blush pausing at the table in floating chiffon as violet as her eyes a gently mocking smile playing over her full pink lips was the most beautiful woman in france claudine lauzerte the actress wife of the opposition minister for cultural affairs madame lauzerte jumping to his feet rannaldini kissed her hand then clicking his fingers at the wine waiter he beseeched her to join them i am leaving i hear your don carlos is wonderful with a sensational new star bowing and scraping like a brothelkeeper at the arrival of a royal stag party rannaldini introduced hermione and this is franco palmieri who play carlos leaping up franco sent several glasses and a vase of flowers flying claudine lauzerte had such impact that for the first five minutes people talked gibberish in her presence so she turned to tristan this is my godson tristan de montigny étiennes boy explained rannaldini proudly ah the violet eyes widened in amusement your father often ask me to sit for him but we are both always so busy she glanced at the video camera you are obviously destined to become a director with those looks every leading lady will do exactly what you tell her noting tristans pallor his deepset eyes mere hollows she chided rannaldini this poor childs exhausted take him home i will send you tickets rannaldini called after her i cannot believe ive met claudine lauzerte babbled hermione she must have had several facelifts to look so lovely on the drive home having jettisoned a furious franco rannaldini pointed to a round white moon retreating behind a lacing of dark clouds she is upstaged by your beauty he told hermione from the back seat tristan noticed hermione continually holding her throat as if it were some precious jewel tomorrow he would take his new metaldetector a present from aunt hortense into the bois and find her and perhaps claudine lauzerte as well a diamond ring hermione was now complaining about lecherous conductors i was doing rinaldo last week and sir rodney macintosh who must be over sixty asked me to his room for a nightcap and greeted me wearing nothing but a pair of socks rannaldini wasnt remotely shocked eef you knee conductor in groin he wont give you more work you must invent fiancé preferably black belt at judo even such a fascinating subject couldnt stop tristan dropping off later he never knew if hed dreamt it or whether rannaldinis hand really had vanished into hermiones dark lace dress and a moonlike breast emerged he did wake screaming however as rannaldini pulled up outside the house and étienne still in his painters smock loomed huger and blacker than the grand inquisitor in the doorway although his father cheered up when he saw hermione he curtly dispatched tristan to bed and no ducking out of school tomorrow good night little one called rannaldini then to irritate étienne ill be up in a few minutes in fact it was an hour and tristan again woke screaming from lobsterinduced nightmare as another broadshouldered black figure loomed over him it all appen four hundred years ago said rannaldini as he tucked the boy in you mustnt ave bad dreams looking round the bleak attic room seeing the video camera the red leatherbound copy of schillers don carlos and hermiones carnation in a toothmug on the bedside table he picked up the silver frame containing the only photograph of tristans mother delphine in the house so beautiful a little like madame lauzerte dont you think will she sit for papa asked tristan hopefully i doubt it she is very pure lady her nickname is madame vierge did they really burn people alive in those days they do today with electric chairs and bombs thats how your brother laurent died said rannaldini but the terror in tristans eyes was in case his father walked in and heard the forbidden name such had been étiennes heartbreak no allusion to laurent was allowed in the house why didnt king philip like carlos tristan asked wistfully fathers and sons rannaldini brushed back the boys hair philip was jealous carlos had whole life ahead of him to pull the girls can i work for you when i grow up murmured tristan one day we will make great film of don carlos together promised rannaldini eighteen spectacularly successful years later on a wet windy lateoctober morning sir roberto rannaldini gazed down on the valley of paradise often described as the jewel of the cotswolds rannaldini owned many splendid houses but the brooding secretive paradise abbey which he had somewhat hubristically renamed valhalla after the home of the gods in teutonic mythology was the one he loved most from his study on the first floor he could admire albeit through mist and rain his tennis courts swimmingpool hangar for jet and helicopter lovinglytended gardens and racehorses grazing in fields sweeping down to his lake and the river fleet which ran along the bottom of the valley to his left coiled up like a sleeping snake was the famous valhalla maze to the right deep in the woods lurked the watchtower where he edited composed and seduced beyond disappearing into the mist was the ravishing mill house belonging to hermione harefield his mistress for the last eighteen years but even as rannaldini gloated over his valley the dying fires of autumn seemed to symbolize his own decline for the first time ever his massive royalty cheque was down last sunday when he was conducting at the appleton piano competition his favoured candidate and latest conquest the ravishing natalia philipovna had been beaten into second place despite intense lobbying by rannaldinis detested stepson marcus campbellblack the same evening rannaldini learnt he had failed in his bid to take over the rutminster symphony orchestra who had accompanied the finalists as an ultimate humiliation at the party afterwards the first horn had hit rannaldini across the room his fall had been broken only by the pudding trolley and the flaccid curves of a grisly crone from the arts council the newspapers had had a field day rannaldini shuddered like philip ii of spain who had exhausted himself and his nations coffers trying to hold his habsburg empire together rannaldini was also learning by bitter experience that his vast kingdom could be maintained only by the crippling expense of waging war on all fronts he was currently engaged in lawsuits with orchestras unions sacked musicians mistresses and exwives nineteen months ago merely to spite his great enemy the very rich and arrogant rupert campbellblack whom he believed had orchestrated the breakup of his third marriage rannaldini had made a catastrophic fourth marriage to ruperts neurotic exwife helen in return for his habitual infidelity helen was now busy squandering his millions and because rannaldini was only five foot six deliberately dwarfing him in public by wearing very high heels rannaldini was sad that his two eldest children from earlier marriages wolfgang and natasha had left home after frightful family rows but saddest of all he knew his music was suffering accusing rannaldini of blandness in the daily telegraph last monday norman lebrecht had suggested he stopped settling scores and started studying them again rannaldini might outwardly be the greatest conductor in the world with orchestras in new york berlin and tokyo but he was poor in spirit and horribly alone outside rain swept across the woods like ghost armies marching on valhalla although his office was tropically warm and the windows and doors were closed an icy wind suddenly rustled all the papers and the fire died in the grate with a hiss on the chimneypiece a gilt and ormolu clock of apollo driving the horses of the sun chimed twelve noon valhalla was full of ghosts they never frightened rannaldini they were his accomplices in terrorizing the living but hearing an almost orgasmic groan he lookedup quickly at the étienne de montigny oil to the right of the fireplace entitled don juan in transit it portrayed the great lover looking suspiciously like rannaldini humping a lady of the manor but distracted by the swelling bosom of her young maid hanging clothes outside in the orchard it was the attention to detail the yellow stamens of the apple blossom each hair under the maids armpit the pale green spring light that made the painting so perfect rannaldini smiled at his reflection in the big gilt mirror his hair might be pewter grey but his face was still as virile and handsome as don juans in the picture he also had two trump cards the first was a film of don carlos which he was poised to conduct and coproduce the nightmare of cutting a threeandahalfhour opera down to a manageable two hours for filming had not been helped by rannaldini insisting that an overture an aria and linking passages to make the story more accessible all composed by himself be included the plot of don carlos had been gingered up with several sex scenes and to appeal to the pink pound carloss best friend the gallant marquis of posa would be portrayed as a homosexual an allstar cast who would have screaming hysterics when they discovered any of their numbers had been cut had been assembled for some time because singers have to be booked several years ahead they included hermione harefield who at forty would need careful lighting to play the young elisabetta nor could she act but at least she did what rannaldini told her which was more than did franco palmieri who was playing don carlos and who had grown so fat he made pavarotti look anorexic however it had been written into his contract that he must lose seven stone before filming started next april in the past rannaldini had often given juicier parts in more ways than one to his exwife cecilia in lieu of alimony but she and hermione would have murdered each other on location as a result the part of the seductive scheming princess eboli had gone to a ravishing mezzo chloe catford the search though was still on to find an unknown star to play the marquis of posa having in his opinion agreed to overpay everyone else rannaldini was hunting for a bargain opera films were seldom big box office why therefore had these vastly highearning singers committed themselves when they knew what purgatory it was to work with rannaldini the answer was tristan de montigny who by driving himself into the ground to win some recognition from his father étienne was now one of the hottest directors in the world with his ravishing englishspeaking version of manzonis the betrothed tipped to win several oscars he had spent the summer filming balzacs the lily in the valley with claudine lauzerte the word on the street was that despite being over fifty madame vierge had never looked more beautiful or acted better success with actors of both sexes had been helped by tristans wonderfully romantic looks the model whom calvin klein loved best at six foot two he was too thin and his gold curls had darkened to burnt umber but the peatbrown heavily shadowed eyes the cheekbones higher than the eiffel tower and the big mouth usually smiling but of incredible sadness in repose made everyone long to make him happy but it was a mistake to be fooled by tristans gentleness he could be both manipulative and monomaniac in getting the film he wanted he and rannaldini were both so successful that they seldom managed to meet except for an hour snatched at an airport or a midnight dinner after a concert but they had retained their affection for one another and their dream of working together which at last was going to be realized but sadly too late to please étienne all the newspapers littering rannaldinis desk reported that frances greatest painter since monet was dying but refusing to go to hospital rannaldini was tempted to cancel tonights barbican concert and fly out to bid his old friend farewell but hed get more coverage if he waited until the funeral he couldnt spare the time for both he felt a surge of hatred as he noticed an intensely glamorous photograph in le monde of rupert campbellblack embracing his son marcus before putting him on a plane to moscow if rupert was relinquishing one child he might consider a reconciliation with another marcuss younger sister the ravishing nineteenyearold tabitha rupert loathed rannaldini so much that he had disinherited both marcus and tabitha for attending their mothers wedding to rannaldini tabitha however like tristan was one of the few people who liked rannaldini not least because when she became his stepdaughter he had given her a large allowance and bought her a wonderful horse called the engineer but within a few weeks of marrying rannaldini helen had caught him leering through a twoway mirror at tabitha undressing and packed her off to an eventing yard in america there tabitha was winning competitions and was already spoken of as an olympic possible she was also making friends ive been invited to fifteen thanksgiving parties and im going to all of them she had announced in her last letter home on the other hand she missed rupert dreadfully she had always been his favourite child the one who rode as fearlessly as he did and like rupert she had hitherto dismissed her brother marcus as a wimp knowing it would unhinge her rannaldini played his second trump card faxing out all the cuttings of marcus being outed before winning the appleton piano competition and being reunited with an overjoyed rupert rupert had totally accepted that marcus was gay and in love with the great russian dancer alexei nemerovsky he had even flippantly told a group of reporters at heathrow that he was looking forward to meeting nemerovsky and felt he was gaining a daughter rather than losing a son silly silly rupert thought rannaldini as he filled his jade pen with emeraldgreen ink to scribble a covering letter dearest tabitha i know you will want to share your mothers joy that your brother is both a national hero and reconciled with your father smirking rannaldini handed it to his new pa miss bussage who looked like being his third trump card after only a month she had transformed his life keeping track of children wives finances and his gruelling schedule nor did she have any compunction about feeding pleading love notes demands from charities and bad reviews after the authors name had been put on the hit list straight into the shredder rannaldini dreamed of miss bussage giving him a bed review you were very boring in the sack last night maestro please do better this evening in her forties miss bussage had the look of a wellregulated musk ox with small suspicious eyes and dark heavy hair that flicked up sixtiesstyle like two horns her thick body was redeemed by a splendid bosom and rather good legs like musk oxen she was also able to survive the arctic climate of rannaldinis rages and gave off a strong musky scent in the rutting season friendly one day downright rude the next which rannaldini used to sycophancy thought wonderful she had now picked up his private telephone which none of his other staff would touch at pain of thumbscrew marcel dupont for you dupont was étienne de montignys lawyer he had grown rich over the years but had had his work cut out extricating the great man from scrapes and marriages and preserving his vast fortune what news asked rannaldini seizing the receiver the worst duponts voice trembled étienne died an hour ago glancing up as apollos clock struck one rannaldini crossed himself death must have been at noon when the fire died in the grate and don juan in étiennes painting cried out in anguish i am so sorry rannaldinis voice dropped an octave i trust the end was peaceful did étienne ever do anything peacefully asked dupont like hercules he battled to the end he wanted to see another sunset i know how busy you are maestro but i will certainly be at the funeral then dupont confessed it had been étiennes dying wish that rannaldini should join tristans three older brothers carrying the coffin but surely tristan began rannaldini dupont sighed even in death i can trust your discretion of course lied rannaldini french law insists that threequarters of any estate is divided between the children of the blood with whole shares going to legitimate children and half shares to any born out of wedlock tristan therefore would automatically inherit several million but the law also stipulates that the fourth quarter of a mans estate can be divided as he chooses étienne itemized everything for children mistresses friends wives and servants said dupont bleakly but he left nothing personal to tristan not even a pencil drawing or a paintbrush why did he hate the poor boy so much poor boy indeed rannaldini was shocked i will ring him please do hes devastated and the end was dreadful i hope this story doesnt leak out anyway while youre on rannaldini étienne left you two of his greatest paintings abelard and héloïse and the nymphomaniac both are on exhibition in new york together they were worth several million not such a bad day after all thought rannaldini having witnessed étiennes extremely harrowing death tristan had immediately fled back to his own flat in la rue de varenne trying to blot out the horror and despair with work he had been on the brink of making the one film his father might have rated because it was with rannaldini now it was too late scrumpledup paper lay all over the floor his laptop was about to be swept off the extreme lefthand corner of his desk by a hurtling lava of videos scores a red leatherbound copy of schillers don carlos books on sixteenthcentury france and spain sketches of scenes gauloise packets and halfdrunk cups of black coffee photographs of the don carlos cast were pinned to a cork board on the rust walls over the fireplace hung one of étiennes drawings of two girls embracing which tristan had bought out of pride so that people wouldnt realize his father had never given him anything he was now toying with a chess set and the idea of portraying his cast philip the king posa the knight carlos the poor doomed pawn as chess pieces but he kept hearing the nurses cosy overfamiliar voice just going to put this nasty thing down your throat again étienne as she hoovered up the fountains of blood bubbling up from his fathers damaged heart and tristan had wanted to yell for christs sake call him monsieur de montigny he also kept hearing étienne muttering the words father and grandfather as he clutched tristans sleeve and the roars of resistance followed by tears of abdication trickling down the wrinkles at the end only the extremely short scarlet skirt worn by his granddaughter simone had rallied the old man tristan hadnt been able to look at his aunt hortense it was as if a gargoyle had started weeping he prayed that étienne hadnt seen the satisfaction on the faces of his three eldest sons that there was no hope of recovery there was no way tristan could concentrate on a chessboard switching on the television he felt outrage that instead of leading on étiennes death they were showing the young english winner of the appleton marcus campbellblack arriving pale and fragile as a wood anemone at moscow airport and being embraced in the snow by a wolfcoated wildly overexcited nemerovsky before being swept away in a limo rupert marcuss father had then been interviewed surrounded by a lot of dogs outside his house in gloucestershire campbellblacks dont come second he was saying jubilantly god what a goodlooking man thought tristan if he had rupert marcus and nemerovsky playing philip carlos and posa hed break every boxoffice record he jumped as handels death march from saul boomed out and the presenter switched to étiennes death france was in mourning for her favourite son great artist bon viveur patron saint of vast extended family montignys compassion for life showed in all his paintings said the reporter but not in his heart thought tristan bitterly étienne had never been to one of his premières or glanced at a video or congratulated him on his césar frances equivalent of the oscars of all étienne de montignys sons went on the reporter as they showed some of étiennes cleaner paintings followed by clips from the betrothed tristan his youngest son has been the most successful following in his fathers footsteps but painting instead with light that should piss off my brothers thought tristan savagely as he turned off the television dupont had rung him earlier and like a starved dog grateful for even a piece of bacon rind tristan had finally asked if étienne had left him anything other than his due share nothing im afraid then after a long pause maybe its a backhanded compliment because youve done so well dupont had meant it kindly but tristan had hung up and for the first time since étienne had fallen ill he broke down and wept half an hour later he splashed his face with cold water and wondered what to do with the rest of his life he was roused by the sunday times commiserating with him then more cautiously probing a rumour that he was the only member of the family who had been left nothing personal fuck off said tristan hanging up fortunately this pulled him together the bastard he thought all my life papa noticed me less than the cobwebs festooning his studio looking at his mothers photograph he wished as always that she were alive then jumped as the telephone rang papa he gasped in desperate hope but it was alexandre his eldest brother the judge were all worried you might be feeling out of it tristan youre so good at lighting and theatrical effects and knowing appropriate poetry and music we felt you should organize the funeral we want you to be involved his brothers reflected tristan chose to involve him when they wanted their christenings and weddings videoed he wished he had the bottle to tell alexandre to fuck off too instead he said ill ring you in the morning without bothering to put on a jacket he was out of his flat driving like a maniac to the louvre to catch the last halfhour so that he could once more marvel over the goyas velazquezes and el grecos every frame in his film would be more beautiful when he got home there was a message on the machine rannaldinis voice was caressing deep as the ocean gentle recognizable anywhere my poor boy what a terrible day you must have had im so sorry but heres something to cheer you up lord ohara from venturer television rang and hes happy to meet us in london the day after tomorrow i hope very much you can make it and i think i have found a posa hollywood in the midnineties was governed by marketing men who earned enough in a year to finance five mediumbudget films who believed they knew exactly what they could sell and only gave the green light to films tailormade to these specifications to perform this function for don carlos and handle the money side rannaldini had employed sexton kemp as his coproducer sexton who had started life selling sheepskin coats in petticoat lane was now a medallion man in his early forties with cropped hair redrimmed tinted spectacles and a sardonic streetwise face sextons film company liberty productions so called because he took such frightful liberties with original material always had several projects on the go as he was driven in the back of a magenta roller to the meeting with declan ohara sexton was busily improving flaubert musically illiterate he found the sanctity of opera plots incredibly frustrating why couldnt the french princess elisabetta become an american to appeal to the us market at least he could constantly play up the sex and violence in don carlos all that assassination and burning of eretics and rumpypumpy because were using lots of the singing as voiceover while we film all the characters fantasies about rogerin each other for a year now sexton had worked indefatigably to raise the necessary twenty million to make the film he had also organized distributors in twentyfive countries don carlos is not exactly a comedy he would tell potential backers but very dramatical and wiv rannaldini and tristan de montigny we can offer both gravitas and a firstclass seat on the gravy train as a result rannaldinis record company american bravo and french television had both come in as major players conversely cbs had been unenthusiastic because don carlos is very anticatholic and they were nervous about alienating americas vast hispanic population for the same reason it had been a nightmare wheedling money out of the french and spanish governments sexton had promised filming in the forest of fontainebleau to bring tourists to france and the restoration of numerous crumbling historic buildings in spain for use as locations but each time he neared a deal the government would change and there would be a new minister of culture to win over even the last spanish minister a señora mendoza who had a black moustache hadnt fazed sexton one bottle of bubbly and a tube of immac and we was away unfortunately shortly after this señora mendoza had fallen from office and for sexton and was never off the telephone angling for another seeingto contrary to señora mendozas forward behaviour there was also a real problem of filming nudes and sex scenes in catholic countries a substantial sum had been promised by a group of saudi gunrunners who wanted to raise their profile by having their names on the credits unknown to the saudis sexton was busy dealing with the iranians his greatest coup however was to enlist the support of the recently ennobled declan ohara who was managing director of venturer television and a complete don carlos freak unknown to his tonedeaf partner and soninlaw rupert campbellblack declan had pledged ten million towards the films costs london had an untidy look on that chill midoctober morning grey and brown plane leaves littered the pavements and clogged the gutters brakelights were reflected like flamingos legs in the wet road ahead as the traffic slowed in park lane excited at the prospect of meeting a real lord sexton was glad he tristan and rannaldini were going to work out a plan of action before declan arrived rannaldini could rub people up the wrong way sitting in rannaldinis exquisite flat overlooking hyde park tristan felt warmth creep back into his veins he had just lunched on the fluffiest parma ham omelette sorrel salad quince sorbet black grapes gently dissolving camembert excellent claret and very black coffee it was the first food he had eaten in three days after the meeting rannaldini sexton and he were off to prague to see the possible posa a russian with lungs of steel called mikhail pezcherov tristan was already mad about sexton who was now hoovering up black grapes with a big hand gut spilling over his waistband his face absolutely still only his eyes swivelling in thought as he tried to persuade rannaldini of the benefits of accepting laundered russian money from the iranians dont worry your pretty swollen head over that one ranners the saudis need never know in preparation for meeting declan tristan had whiled away last nights insomnia speedreading declans massive biography of yeats which had just received ecstatic reviews declan had also once interviewed étienne on one of his vastly watched prestigious programmes the two had clashed declan had accused tristans father of meretriciousness and pornography that youre a genius makes the whole thing more reprehensible étienne had stalked off the set tristan was ashamed how drawn he was to people who had seen through his father as sexton and rannaldini were still arguing about money tristan was glad there was so much to look at in rannaldinis sitting room on the vermilion walls hung numerous portraits of rannaldini on every surface were silverframed photographs of rannaldini and the famous dominated by one of him getting his knighthood and another of him smiling at a very blonde girl what a beauty tristan made a mental note to ask rannaldini to introduce him what wonderful things the camera could do with her face on a low table in the middle of the room beside a huge brass bowl of dark crimson orchids lay the score of don carlos with cuts and possible scenes pencilled in for discussion with declan as the sun appeared casting its mellow autumnal light on the park tristan felt a surge of optimism oh look theres rupert campbellblack in a morning suit said sexton in excitement i wonder where es going an outraged rupert was in fact coming to rannaldinis flat as a fellow director having learnt about the ten million he had spent half the night raging at declan for such suicidal pledging of venturers hardearned cash rupert had never before questioned one of declans artistic decisions but as the last film hed seen in the cinema had been a remake of the incredible journey where hed been outraged because the bull terrier had been changed to a more politically correct breed and the last opera an amateur production of the merry widow with declans wife poncing around in the title role he couldnt see the point of don carlos at all i mean the guys in love with his stepmother rupert who had loathed all his four stepmothers had stormed at declan despite his indignation and the insensitivity that so often goes with social fearlessness rupert noticed tristans black tie the moment he entered the room and said how sorry he was about étiennes death bought a couple of oils of his twenty years ago bloody good painter and bloody well rocketed in value he added even more approvingly as rupert was wearing a morning coat rannaldini smoothly suggested a glass of champagne feeling he could use it rupert was about to accept then noticed the photograph of his daughter tabitha on the piano and curtly refused the thought of rannaldini having access to her drove him to madness havent you grown since i last saw you he drawled then tilting his head sideways to glance at rannaldinis lifts or maybe your shoes have trouble ahead thought tristan as rannaldinis face contorted with fury étienne had always painted in a northfacing studio claiming that the harsh light picked out every wrinkle and red vein showing the face as it was rupert must be fortysix or fortyseven but as he sat down on the windowseat looking north over the park his beauty made tristan gasp the sleek thick gold hair untouched by grey and brushed back from the wide suntanned forehead emphasized the lovely shape of the head the long heavylidded rather hard lapislazuli blue eyes the high cheekbones the greek nose the short upper lip pulling up the curling mouth the smooth olive complexion could all have belonged to a latin or a statue the face was so still then rupert caught a glimpse of a portly mongrel in a tartan coat waddling along behind an old lady which reminded him of his wifes dog gertrude his eyes softened and his mouth lifted and tristan wondered how any woman ever resisted him sorry declan cant make it rupert was now saying in his light flat clipped drawl he forgot he was taking my children his grandchildren to toad of toad hall he always swore hed never accept a peerage and now he has its clearly unhinged him particularly if hes intending to waste ten million on some crappy opera rupert then proceeded to tear the project to shreds the only person he praised was sexton for raising such an incredible amount to subsidize such tosh rannaldini immediately rose to his feet and opened the door if you wont come in with us he said icily wed better look elsewhere we cant ranners said sexton aghast its goin to be a mad scramble as it is we gotta start filming by the end of march because the first scenes take place in a forest wiv no leaves its goin to be grite he added to rupert his eyes shining brighter than his gold necklace two mighty armies meeting on the skyline and then the unt streaming down the ill wheres that being filmed asked rupert fontainebleau said tristan quickly the french government have put in a lot of money as venturer were putting in even more money countered rupert the film should be made on venturer territory namely in his woods at penscombe most beautiful beechwoods in the country he added haughtily that is debatable snapped rannaldini lets debate it then snapped back rupert we can also get the cotchester hunt for virtually peanuts and hounds wont have to go into quarantine youll never find decent hounds in france tristan had visions of drawing his sword for his countrys canine population the reason rupert wanted his woods filmed was to categorize them even more firmly as an area of outstanding natural beauty to scupper any evil plans to slap a motorway through his estate rannaldini who was determined the first act should be shot in his beechwoods at valhalla also to stop any motorway through his estate said the french would never agree to it being filmed at penscombe anyway your house at penscombe was only built in the late eighteenth century too modern for carlos rannaldini added dismissively whereas valhalla is medieval and steeped in religious tradition seeing ruperts eyes narrow sexton said hastily we do need to film in a monasterytype situation rupe so rupert switched to the fatuousness of the plot i mean the guys in love with his stepmother cant agree more rupe interrupted sexton excitedly i was just saying to ranners why dont we make elisabetta carloss real muvver incest is really hot at the moment dont be ridiculous said rupert who disliked his mother even more than his stepmothers tristan who often fell asleep in meetings was really enjoying this one and having great difficulty not laughing the plots far too complicated went on rupert needs a narrator to tell you whats going on wed better use declan then at least venturers lawyers could claw back a massive fee for declans services rannaldini who intended to introduce the opera himself for an even more massive fee said this was totally unacceptable so rupert attacked the cast theyre all geriatrics how can that old bat hermione harefield who must be well into her forties play a girl in her teens then before rannaldini could reach for his sword or fat franco whos fortysix and at least fortysix stone play a twentyyearold infante don kilos thats a joke and there arent many of those in the opera fat franco goes down very well wiv punters said sexton reasonably hes one of the biggest names of opera biggest being the operative word heres the guy you want rupert chucked a photograph down on the table wow whos he tristan grabbed the photo in excitement an aussie called baby spinosissimo not sure thats his real name speenoseeseemo said rannaldini coldly hes totally inexperienced and breathtakingly goodlooking said rupert taken them by storm in oz done well enough to buy himself several racehorses and eef he landed the part of carlos would no doubt be able to afford more horses for you to train said rannaldini bitchily leave the casting to us you dont know what youre talking about how about elisabetta becoming an american suggested sexton who never gave up they adore dame hermione in the us shows how stupid they are snarled rupert america was hardly built like my house he glared at rannaldini in the middle of the sixteenth century and hermione would have even more difficulty in passing herself off as a red indian than as an eighteenyearold virgin the meeting ended in uproar whos getting married asked tristan lovely girl conductor actually called abigail rosen marrying a lucky sod called viking oneill said rupert breaking off one of rannaldinis crimson orchids and putting it in his buttonhole rannaldini knows viking he added nastily hes the horn player who hit him across a hotel dining room a few nights ago easy as a shotputter or shitputter in rannaldinis case but the gods were on rannaldinis side as the front door banged behind rupert helen rannaldini rushed into the sitting room what a beautiful woman thought tristan admiring the tragic ravaged face as he leapt to his feet but helen was too distraught to notice him oh rannaldini tabithas on the phone shes been fired i hoped id catch rupert hes gone let me talk to her rannaldini whisked out of the room perhaps you could organize some drinks my dear he was sweating with excitement as he picked up the telephone as he had predicted his stepdaughter had flipped when his faxes had arrived tabitha had always been ruperts favourite child and suddenly marcus her brother had stolen his affection she was shocked rigid to discover marcus was gay and crazy with jealousy that rupert seemed to approve of marcuss new love daddy was always so foul about my boyfriends and now hes crawling all over some poofter and theres even a photograph of marcus and nemerovsky hugging on the front of the washington post yuk having read the faxes tabitha had ridden in a crosscountry competition hurtling over the fences as though death were the favourable alternative before sliding off her horse the engineer fifty yards past the post the course doctor had diagnosed her as dead drunk yesterday morning she had been suspended for nine months mostly because of her appalling language and lack of contrition afterwards she had gone out and got even drunker she had only just woken and screwed up courage to ring england how fortunate that rupert and she had missed each other rannaldini was smiling broadly my naughty child come home so i can spank your bottom he quivered in delighted expectation you have been away far too long ill send the gulf ill make my own way i want to travel with the engineer could you possibly lend me a couple of grand euphoric at the thought of tabitha returning rannaldini swept into the drawing room and promptly invited her mother to join the trip to prague after all prague had been where he had first bedded helen on the stage of an operahouse where earlier in the evening he had conducted don giovanni and he didnt want her to give him a lousy press as a husband if tabitha was coming home i cant go wailed helen ive got to host a dinner for save the children bussage will cancel it and tomorrow i will send save the children a large enough donation to quell any disquiet said rannaldini expansively i would love to go helen told tristan wistfully prague was the place where you and i spent our first wonderful romantic weekend exactly one year eleven months and three days ago said rannaldini kissing her you remembered the exact date helens eyes filled with tears of course said rannaldini smugly it had not been difficult it had also been his fortyfourth birthday but i havent packed rannaldini looked at his watch you have half an hour serena wont be here until five serena westwood was a young ambitious record producer who had just been poached by rannaldinis record company american bravo her first assignment was to produce the recording of don carlos helen nearly refused to go to prague when she saw serena who looked like a brunette grace kelly her heavy hair drawn back into a french pleat from a snowwhite forehead was shinier than her patent leather ankle boots and she was wearing nothing under her austerely cut pinstripe suit rannaldini had clearly been saving serenas child as well as sending a vast cheque to save the children because serena immediately kissed him thanking him in a cool clear voice for flying up two of helens young maids betty and sally for the night to look after her fouryearold daughter jessie bussage masterminded the whole thing said rannaldini smoothly and it is good for sally and betty to have an outing jessie fell so in love with them she hardly noticed me leaving said serena turning to an outraged helen oh lady rannaldini i know its a liberty hijacking your maids but ive been stuck in rome with dame hermione and rushed home to find my nanny had walked out so sir roberto very kindly came to my aid but its you ive got to thank we cannot cast posa without serena said rannaldini now we have time for a glass of champagne how was hermione snapped helen who detested her husbands mistress serena waited until rannaldini had left the room to get a bottle then said absolutely bloody shes recording arsena in rome next week so i spent all yesterday checking out hotels with her they were either too hot too cold too dark too light too big and not cosy enough too poky i kept frantically apologizing to the hotel managers you know how sweet and obliging the italians are she deserves a kick up the arsena she does agreed helen ecstatically i finally flipped and shouted at her confessed serena so as a peace offering i sent her some ravishing lilies and the bitch rang up shouting that they made her sneeze i want yellow rosebuds in future and ill tell you exactly which florist to go to what a lovely young woman thought helen putting her arm round serenas shoulders in an utterly uncharacteristic gesture of intimacy come and meet our director tristan de montigny hes next door phoning his auntie hortense volunteered sexton poor old hortense was being extremely cantankerous and giving tristan a longdistance earful for the first time in eightyfive years she was no longer étiennes little sister as head of the family she was feeling old arthritic and frighteningly exposed tristan so wished he could comfort her oh my goodness thought serena as he wandered back into the room he was wearing a battered leather jacket a buttoneddown peacock blue shirt and levis clinging to his lean hips serena immediately wanted to plunge her fingers into his shock of dark hair and run her tongue along his rubbery jut of lower lip before burying her mouth in his instead she smiled coolly accepted a glass of dom pérignon and said tell us about this posa rannaldini hes called mikhail pezcherov solti call me after hearing him do the role in russian hes now singing macbeth in some crappy production and making ends meet belting out songs in a nightclub and which do we have to endure if we leave soon well make the second act of macbeth landing in prague they were driven over the cobbles of illlit back streets to a crumbling operahouse rannaldini well known to scream at latecomers had no compunction in sweeping his party into their seats in the middle of the banquet scene a rumble of excitement went through the theatre and lady macbeth stopped singing altogether to gaze at the great maestro another wildgoose chase sighed serena whod made sure she was sitting next to tristan the sets and costumes might have come from an amateur operatic societys production of brigadoon neither conductor soloists nor chorus could agree on tempi attempting to glide through a castle wall banquos ghost sent it flying but out of this shambles came a voice of such beauty so deep rich soft yet intensely masculine that rannaldinis party turned to each other in rapture tristan was so excited he hardly felt serenas pinstriped leg rubbing against his mikhail pezcherov was also an excellent actor with a square expressive face and strong features enhanced by a black moustache and beard and a curly bulls poll tumbling over soulful dark eyes more important if he were going to play the gallant marquis of posa he was of heroic stature with long strong legs that would look marvellous in tights afterwards he welcomed rannaldini and his party backstage my knees knock my tongue thicken in mouth i can only croak hello i am so excited he announced thrusting mugs of very rough red wine into their hands he wished he could afford something more expensive but all his money was going home to support his darling wife lara and his children showing the visitors their photographs he wiped away copious tears but all would be worthwhile if they could live together one day in comfort how did you meet your wife asked helen i was best man at wedding lara was bridesmaid i sing nessun dorma at reception zat was zat sighed mikhail lady rannaldini and i had our first romantic weekend in prague purred rannaldini zat is good said mikhail i trust guys who love their wives i too rannaldini caressed helens cheek really thought helen when hes as charming as this i can remember why i married him back at rannaldinis suite mikhail got stuck into a better class of red wolfed down his own incredibly tough steak and polished off everyone elses leftovers rannaldini who for once hadnt made a single bitchy remark produced the score of don carlos and thumped away on the piano when mikhail came to the end of posas wonderfully beautiful dying aria it seemed impossible that only five listeners could have made such a noise cheering and shouting until people in the next rooms banged on the thin walls so thrilling to find him together a tearful helen squeezed serenas hand youre going to give the part exactly the right kerpow quotient mick sexton told mikhail tomorrow our people will call your people you better call my vife she handle money said mikhail if i really have zee part you have it said rannaldini who had been particularly captivated when mikhail congratulated him on his pianoplaying not since hermione had he discovered such a thrilling talent now where had he put his treasured jade fountain pen in his excitement he must have handed it absentmindedly to the waiter after hed signed for room service may i call my lara asked mikhail as his glass was refilled yet again go into our bedroom said rannaldini can i possibly borrow your mobile to check on jessie serena asked sexton ive got a horrible feeling ive left mine in the taxi helen had buttonholed tristan when shed first moved to england from america she told him she had worked as an editor in publishing which had involved a lot of research perhaps she could help out on don carlos tristan listened politely close up helens huge staring eyes ribby body spindly legs and flesh worn down to her admittedly perfect bone structure reminded him unnervingly of paintings of chargers dying of starvation in the crimean war across the room trying to make tristan jealous serena was chatting up rannaldini who was terribly sexy but definitely not husband potential we must have dinner one evening he was murmuring bussage can always find a window for special people at least promise to sit next to me at the gramophone awards on tuesday helens face had lit up while tristan talked to her but it went dead as she noticed the wolfish expression on rannaldinis meticulous by nature helen became obsessive under stress now she launched into a frenzy of tidying lining up scores and magazines plumping cushions whipping glasses from people still drinking anything to maintain her sense of controlling the environment leave it we are not at home exploded rannaldini and then remembering his role as cherishing husband go to bed my darling you must be tired having told mikhail he would fix him up with a shithot agent shepherd denstons who would handle everything and arrange for him to have coaching in prague to prepare him for rehearsals starting in december rannaldini said he was off to bed helen and i have happy memories to relive he found helen faffing round in her nightie she always laid out her clothes for the morrow and she was certain shed packed her saxeblue cashmere and the lapislazuli brooch that went so well with it you packed in a hurry soothed rannaldini i guess one of the maids has nicked it said helen shrilly i hate prague the beds are so hard the foods disgusting you cant turn down the heating so ill have hot flushes all night and finally theres no bath plug i will plug your hole my darling said rannaldini softly dyou remember last time we play game of naughty doctor taking liberties with young girl patient and how excited you became helen gasped as he pushed her back on the bed she has been very naughty rannaldini locked the door she deserves good spanking for not eating enough the othersll hear us you cant rannaldini parting helens legs rannaldini laid his tongue on her clitoris not for nothing was he known as the james galway of cunnilingus helen achieved orgasm fantasizing about tristan de montigny rannaldini pushed himself over the edge thinking about tabitha my darling child he murmured as he came why cant our marriage always be like this from now on it will be promised rannaldini next door tristan and mikhail who was drinking from the bottle were dissecting the character of posa he changes in the opera tristan lit another gauloise he starts out an idealist then realizes hes got to act politically to get things done he has to put on a different face to hide the brutal facts like youll have to thought sexton with a sudden surge of pity if youre going to work with rannaldini posa was like ira freedomfighter announced mikhail anxious to make a note about parallels with the ira who were very hot in hollywood at the moment sexton found his pocket computer had suddenly disappeared he was distracted by serena who had unleashed her dark hair like a cavalry charge and undone two buttons of her pinstripe jacket can i have a word she murmured wildly excited sexton padded after her into the second bedroom is tristan ok she whispered no shittin himself about the funeral on monday poor little sod its going to be like a state funeral inastate more likely wiv all his dads exwives and mistresses fighting to sit in the front row and all the paparazzi hangin abart god serena was pretty im going to score thought sexton joyfully he was about to unfasten the last button of her jacket and push the door behind them when she hissed get rid of mikhail wwwhat at once tristan wants to take me to bed sexton took it on the double chin dont hurt him he urged hes on the blink mikhail was desperate to go on partying and sexton had frightful difficulty shepherding him into a taxi such a lovely straightforward guy said tristan as he and serena walked down the dimly lit landing outside her room she put a caressing hand on his chest sorry about your father she whispered but a good fucks truly the quickest way to cure the pain taking her key dodging her puckeredup lips tristan dropped a kiss on her cheek having unlocked her door for her however he showed absolutely no desire to follow her inside the trouble with new men thought serena furiously was that they were so desperate not to harass women you never knew if they were gay or not the gramophone awards took place five days later over a splendid lunch at the savoy record producers and agents in sharp suits gossiped guardedly as they awaited their illustrious artists in the foyer women press officers their shiny highlighted hair and long golden legs belying the severity of their neat black suits hooked musical big fish out from their pools of admirers and ferried them like children to the right table the progress was maddeningly slow because it involved so much hugging and hailing on the way more hot and famous than anyone but hidden behind dark glasses tristan reached the table of shepherd denston international artists agents virtually unnoticed he was delighted however when his host howie denston a fawning little creep who ran the london office informed him that liberty productions cast for don carlos had cleaned up in the awards alpheus p shaw who was playing philip ii howie consulted his pocket computer was artist of the year glamorous chloe catford the mezzo who had posed naked on her winning record sleeve was the peoples favourite solo vocal had gone to rozzy pringle who was playing elisabettas page the opera award to hermione while early opera had been awarded to granville hastings whod been cast as the grand inquisitor fat francos italian love songs had been voted bestselling record most prestigious of all rannaldini had won record of the year odd that you all know in advance said tristan accepting a glass of sancerre not at all howie denston lowered his voice singers have such monstrous egos youd never get them to an award ceremony unless they knew theyd won nor was it a coincidence that all the cast of don carlos except fat franco were shepherd denston artists this was because rannaldini had recently wangled himself the chairmanship of the agency he had therefore ensured that per cent of the vast fees earned by the singers in the film would go back into shepherd denstons pockets howie denston known as mr margarine because he spread his oily charm so widely over his artists had now abandoned tristan and bolted back to the foyer to await hermione and his new chairman who were probably having a bonk upstairs and bound to be late tristan didnt mind being left he was always happy watching people also at the shepherd denston table besides the award winners was the retiring chairman who had an ulcer next to him sat serena westwood out of pinstripe into clinging scarlet acting cool towards tristan determined to show him what he had missed by not seducing her in prague rannaldini whod done the seating plan had also sat serena next to giuseppe cavalli a hunky young bass whod be winning awards in a year or two giuseppe had been cast as the ghost of the emperor charles v who appears at the end of the opera and draws his grandson carlos into the safety of the tomb noone was likely to be safe with giuseppe who was an unghostly thug with shoulderlength black curls given to check shirts tucked into bulging jeans he had a huge fan mail from women but was in fact the lover of granville hastings known as granny who could have uncheerfully murdered rannaldini for continually fixing giuseppe up with rich single women lone parents were even more predatory than loan sharks reckoned granny elegant tall silverhaired always exquisitely dressed granny appeared a cosy old pussycat inwardly his heart was breaking for years he had sung philip ii the finest bass role in the repertoire but now at nearly sixtyfour he had been demoted to the just as difficult but more pantomime villain role of the grand inquisitor as the bigger part philip also got the bigger pay cheque and keeping giuseppe was very expensive alpheus p shaw iii a very successful selfregarding american bass sitting at the head of the table was pointedly ignoring granny because they had just sung philip and the inquisitor in the same production in paris granny supposed to be blind in the part had totally upstaged alpheus by bumping into furniture and at one moment when alpheus was hitting a ravishing top note putting his finger into a candle flame and saying ouch alpheus who had no sense of humour had been outraged a magnificentlooking man with redgold hair brushed back from a noble forehead alpheus looked as though hed been carved out of mount rushmore married twenty years and the father of three fine sons he was also a stern upholder of family values as he forked up a smokedsalmon parcel with his right hand however alpheuss left hand foraged between the plump white thighs of chloe the mezzo he and chloe had fallen in love two years ago when they both appeared in aida engagements had separated them so they had accepted parts in don carlos to be together in the long weeks of recording and filming alas alpheuss wife cheryl harboured suspicions and was threatening to join him on location the great din of chatter suddenly stopped as rannaldini stalked in with all the prowling chutzpah of a leopard who has no intention of changing a single spot no star in decline wins record of the year its god murmured two record executives as he swept past them he was followed by hermione harefield looking slightly flushed the lunchers giggled as they noticed the jacket of her purple chanel suit had been wrongly buttoned up gangway gangway for dame hermione yelled howie denston pummelling aside other latecomers and sycophants as hermione glided across the room as stately as the qe i so wanted to creep in here anonymously she was saying loudly embracing tristan with whom she intended having an affaire on location kissing sexton with whom she did not hermione totally ignored that upstart chloe the mezzo whom she disliked intensely and serena whom shed not forgiven for sending the wrong flowers and granny who had never treated her with due reverence instead she turned to alpheus who was going to sing her husband your majesty hermione curtsied skittishly madama replied a bowing alpheus equally skittishly as he held her chair for her everyone was very sad rozzy pringle who was playing elisabettas page hadnt made the lunch she was singing octavian in budapest but sent tons of love later a delightedly squirming howie would accept the solo vocal award on her behalf rozzys so lovely sighed chloe as alpheus removed his burrowing hand to cut up his chicken cenerentola shes got no ego problem unlike some she glared at hermione i hope hermione glared back that rozzy is not overstretching her voice i never do more than forty concerts a year why have you never done a three sopranos dame hermione asked the retiring chairman with all the enthusiasm of one who knows he will never have to handle it there is only one soprano said alpheus hermione bowed her head your majesty is gracious conversation kept being interrupted by waiters grinding black pepper and pouring wine and water still or fizzy dame hermione still please one would have known that you would choose only something that ran deep like yourself observed alpheus playfully great big plonker muttered granny amen to that said chloe alpheus was hung like a donkey oh look she nudged tristan heres your leading man causing howls of mirth by wearing a vast tshirt saying ive beaten anorexia franco palmieri who was playing carlos had reached the megagram table next door appropriating four buckling chairs he waved jauntily at chloe then scowled at alpheus whom he detested even more than granny did fat franco longs to be the fourth tenor chloe whispered to tristan but very sensibly the others wont let that conniving shit near them dont worry she added as she picked the fruit out of her glazed apricot tart hatred always produces incredible sexual chemistry i prefer happy team protested tristan with rannaldini as team leader asked chloe incredulously they say his dagger follows close upon his smiles he is very great friend said tristan coldly good perhaps youll have a benign influence on him tristan was heartbreaking chloe decided those bruised eyes seemed to read her soul im sorry about your father she added the funeral must have been harrowing claudine lauzerte looked stunning she did but even claudines divine presence had not distracted a paparazzi frantic to find out among other things why rannaldini in even more builtup shoes so as not to be dwarfed by tristans three tall brothers had carried the coffin noticing tristans hands clamped to his thighs to stop them shaking chloe said gently when i got my first amneris at the eno i splurged on one of your fathers drawings he would have loved painting you tristan found he could say it without too much pain chloe couldnt have been prettier he decided very french in fact her strawcoloured bob had a thick fringe which emphasized permanently smiling slightly dissipated eyes tristan had also noticed long slim legs and a black cashmere bosom arching like a purring furry cat inside her dovegrey suit glancing up her eyes widened and held his for longer than necessary she would be perfect to screw on location he thought but since étiennes death his libido seemed to have gone into hibernation he knew he had snubbed serena the other night and would have to put in a lot of spadework if she wasnt going to act up during the recording idly he noticed chloe putting sweetex into alpheuss cup of coffee and wondered if they were having an affaire carlos loved his granddad charles v like prince charles loves the queen mum sexton was telling grannys boyfriend giuseppe who had sunk nearly two bottles of red and was still flirting with serena in the hope of a fat record contract at last rannaldini had reached the table wafting maestro his famous scent created specially for him by givenchy longing to goad all the male members of his cast that in mikhail pezcherov he had discovered the greatest bass baritone of the age he immediately insisted that everyone swap places it is crazy grumbled tristan who was now next to granny giuseppe who is twentyeight like me is playing not only alpheuss father but fat francos grandfather and he must be half francos age thats opera for you said granny in his beautiful voice although no stretch of the imagination would go round francos waist these days have you met rupert campbellblack asked tristan i would walk naked across the arctic circle for a touch of his nether lip sighed granny he thinks don carlos cant work with hermione and franco then youd better stamp your pretty foot and replace them my dear hermione had finished her third helping of apricot tart when everyone was asked to toast the queen most people oughta be drinking to themselves muttered sexton never seen such a bunch of fairies a roll of drums and the awards started having accepted his gold statuette of a harpist alpheus proceeded to thank everyone from the sound engineer to his wife cheryl his fine sons and mr bones his german shepherd ending with mozart who had after all composed the music how very caring hermione clapped vigorously im much looking forward to working with alpheus she was irritated that it was too dark except on the platform for everyone to see how lovely she was looking tristan de montigny was lovelylooking too and even seemed to be getting on with that acidtongued granny as well as an affaire hermione was looking forward to having many indepth conversations about herself with tristan rannaldini was tablehopping again posing for the daily express with david mellor he smirkingly fingered the carpet burns on his knees and elbows acquired while seducing serena westwood in her new office last night it had made him feel like a schoolboy ill have her but ill not keep her long he murmured blowing serena a kiss across the tables just long enough to control her during the recording so that she used exactly the takes he wanted there was a great cheer as the newly married viking oneill golden boy and first horn of the rutminster symphony orchestra who had hit rannaldini across the room after the appleton piano competition sauntered up to collect his award for his recording of the strauss concertos what a beauty murmured granny putting on his spectacles if polygramll release him i want him to play first horn in don carlos whispered serena ladies and gentlemen a grinning viking seized the microphone once upon a time three dogs took part in an intelligence test at crufts they had to arrange a pile of bones in the best shape the first dog who came in was an architect he looked at the bones built a pretty little house and everyone clapped and clapped the next dog was a town planner went on viking in his soft irish accent who scoffed at the dog architects little house knocked it down and rebuilt the bones as a beautiful town everyone clapped even more finally the third dog came in he was a tenor and he ate all the bones shagged the other two dogs and asked for the afternoon off such screams of laughter greeted this joke that viking could hardly be heard thanking his record producer the orchestra and his divine new wife the conductor abigail rosen which brought even more resounding cheers returning to the polygram table viking disappeared into the vast congratulatory embrace of fat franco on his way back from a grope or a toot or some other mischief for a second franco pretended to box vikings ears for making snide jokes about tenors then the two men put their heads together until franco gave a bellow of laughter seeing his chosen don carlos collapse on to his four gold chairs again scooping up petit fours as though they were smarties rannaldini shouted rudely unless you give up sweet things franco youll never get into charles vs tomb you no give them up shouted back franco viking tell me how you sail through air like dashing elderly gent on flying trapeze and flatten sweet trolley and member of arts council you wait vowed rannaldini as the roars of laughter subsided ill cook your goose before youve had time to stuff your gross belly with it at the announcement that chloe had won the peoples award the entire room rose cheering to its feet except hermione i am clapped so often that i am not used to clapping she told alpheus as he returned brandishing his award as chloe in her discreet dovegrey suit reached the platform a huge blowup of her naked on the sleeve of her prizewinning record appeared to even louder roars of applause on the monitor as serena put her hand on giuseppes crotch he fell into the petit fours best place for him young people need their sleep said granny who was feeling much happier after a long chat with tristan the boy was too sweet for words and had wonderfully revolutionary views on playing the grand inquisitor are you ready dame hermione asked one of the identikit press officers as vast illuminated olivegreen letters announced the opera award of the year this is the big one said hermione whipping out her powder compact meanwhile losing no time for revenge after all franco wasnt a shepherd denston artist so they wouldnt lose per cent of his massive fee rannaldini was talking in an undertone to howie denston do you know anything about a tenor called baby spinosissimo making waves in australia heartbreaking looks ill check out his availability and by the way howie lowered his voice weve got to watch alpheus he tried to get liberty productions american bravo and shepherd denston each to pick up the tab you will ensure cash settlements for dame hermione interrupted rannaldini as his mistress mounted the rostrum good people began hermione but alas rannaldinis mobile had rung tabitha is home maestro said clive his leatherclad bodyguard silkily rannaldini leapt to his feet i ave to go he told the astounded table but what about your award cried an aghast howie you accept eet said rannaldini blithely a family problem come up i call you he shouted to tristan most of all i would like to thank maestro rannaldini hermione wiped away a tear but she had lost her audience as every eye followed rannaldini out of the room rannaldini could hardly fly his helicopter home for excitement would days of riding out in all weather have coarsened tabithas amazing beauty would being fired so ignominiously have tempered her extraordinary arrogance her capacity for rage evidently not rannaldini entered the west courtyard through ancient gates optimistically crowned with rusty iron letters spelling the words omnia vincit amor sprinting up a mossy paved path flanked by lavender bushes and pushing open the heavy oak door he found helen spitting with fury tabitha was showing no contrition at all halting her mother in midlecture she had snapped that she hadnt flown five thousand miles for an earful and sloped off to the yard to settle the engineer for the night now shes attacking the vodka spluttered helen weve clearly got a lush on our hands rupert always drank too much and after over a year away she didnt even peck me on the cheek where is she demanded rannaldini in the blue living room the blue living room an upstairs drawing room which everyone else at valhalla still called the red morning room had just been redecorated by helen at vast expense in soft blues and rusts to complement her own hazeleyed redheaded beauty the orange flames dancing merrily in the grate and the last tawny leaves on the beech outside enhanced the effect rannaldinis étienne de montignys and russell flints had been banished in favour of an autumnal watermill by samuel palmer and a canaletto of seablue venice an embracing cupid and psyche by canova provided the only erotic note tabitha sat slumped in a carved brown chair which was rannaldinis only contribution to the room watching wallace and gromit on television she was wearing frayed jeans and a stop puppy farming tshirt a green toggle clung to her wrist like mistletoe she was very thin probably from taking those mad moodinducing slimming pills to keep her weight down her face was deathly pale the long turquoise eyes bloodshot and heavily shadowed the long nose reddened the mouth clamped round clenched teeth in an attempt not to cry whiteblonde hair used to being washed every day hung lank and greasy to her collarbone she was clutching a yellow labrador puppy as though it were a hotwater bottle where dyou get that animal asked rannaldini sternly sharon she was a stray wandering round the docks rannaldini clicked his tongue have you alerted the quarantine authorities tabs eyes darkened in terror please dont betray me i couldnt leave her in kentucky rannaldini who was never too hot put a log on the fire how dyou fiddle it i came through france theres a boat smuggling in thirty dogs a day the engineer and i had to wait as it only sails when theres no moon how long have you been travelling four or five days rannaldini filled up her glass naughty little girl he said softly taking sharon and examining her certainly she doesnt look rabid he dropped the puppy gently on the floor how can we punish you he purred the american horse show associations done that already for christs sake so they should have done risking the life of that beautiful horse i gave you engies fine i promise you tabs light clipped drawl was so like her fathers every time he heard it rannaldini was excited by how much he could hurt rupert by controlling and manipulating her moving round the room only pausing to run an admiring hand over psyches marble bottom he pressed a button on the back of tabs chair she gasped then screamed as its wings suddenly clamped round her waist trapping her what the fuck lemme go fighting tears she clawed fruitlessly at the imprisoning wooden arms until she nearly pulled the chair over its a debtors chair mocked rannaldini as he closed in on her eighteenth century used to trap debtors like you ive been looking for one for ages you owe me two grand for your journey home remember ill pay you back tabitha flinched away when she could retreat no further she allowed his fingers to caress her cheek for a second then dropped her head like a snowdrop my fathers such a bastard rannaldini shrugged maybe hes pleased marcus is gay probably never wanted a son competing with him having left pawmarks all over helens pale blue regency sofa sharon was now attacking a cushion helen had embroidered of a virgin and a unicorn neither tab nor rannaldini took any notice ruperts remark about gaining a daughter when marcus had shacked up with nemerovsky had been the one that had hurt her most confessed tab hes got a daughter for christs sake and what a daughter said rannaldini lovingly i want to make him madder than hes ever been before lets find something really to worry him rannaldini moved fast with his polaroid memory he had not forgotten four and a half years ago his leading jockey isaac lovell and tabitha exchanging an impassioned eyemeet in the paddock before the rutminster cup isaac had been riding rannaldinis vicious but generally victorious horse the prince of darkness whod fallen at the last fence tabitha had been the groom looking after arthur a big grey gelding trained by her father rupert tragically arthur had died of a massive heartattack way ahead of the field but just the wrong side of the winningpost slumped sobbing over arthurs body tabitha had been too distraught to feel the hand of sympathy isaac lovell had dropped on her shoulder as he led home the unhurt but shaken prince of darkness the campbellblacks and the lovells had been feuding for nearly forty years since rupert had bullied jake at prep school for being the cooks son and a gypsy with a wasted leg gyppo jake and rupert had slogged it out on the international showjumping circuit throughout the seventies with jake finally getting his revenge during the los angeles olympics by running off with ruperts then wife helen later jake had returned to his wife tory helen had eventually married rannaldini jake and rupert had both switched to training but their feud had not abated one reason apart from loathing rannaldini why rupert had disinherited tabitha and marcus was because photographs had appeared of both of them smiling at jake lovell who as the maestros trainer had been a witness at rannaldinis wedding to helen if helen and jake had once fallen so passionately in love reflected rannaldini might not history repeat itself by a delicious coincidence isa lovell was coming to lunch tomorrow which would give tab a decent nights sleep unhampered by scruples rannaldini didnt give a stuff that isa was already living just outside melbourne with a tough little tomboy called martie they had invested in a yard that had done brilliantly its first season but which still needed capital for this reason isa had come home to make serious money in the national hunt season and also to help his father jake now increasingly debilitated by the polio hed had as a child rannaldini had several horses in training with jake and had invited isa over to try out two mares he had bought in france and to plan for the future as usual rannaldini had another motive during the winter in melbourne isa had won three of australias biggest races including their grand national for baby spinosissimo the young tenor whom rupert had suggested should play don carlos isa would know if baby was sufficiently broke to accept the part for a quarter of fat francos fee there was nothing youthful about isa lovell money had always been tight when he was a child at six he was helping in the yard and jumping at shows at eight coping with very public trouble in his parents marriage and his mothers attempted suicide despite having been champion jockey three times he was aware at twentysix that he would soon have to support his parents and was therefore considering moving into training isa had trendily tousled black hair lowering black brows and slanting suspicious dark eyes dominating a pale expressionless face he looked like the second murderer in macbeth and had a birmingham accent you could cut with a flickknife but at five foot eight he was tall for a jockey with an undeniable brooding gypsy glamour not above dirty tricks on the course where he was nicknamed the black cobra he was as arrogant as tabitha and as champion jockey had had his pick of the girls after fourteen hours sleep a long scented bath and a raid on her mothers bedroom tab unaware isa was coming to lunch wandered into the blue living room she reeked of helens favourite scent jolie madame she was wearing helens new dark green cashmere poloneck which turned her turquoise eyes almost emerald her newly washed hair flopped arctic blonde over her white forehead as she sidled over to the drinks tray to get stuck into the vodka that is not a suitable breakfast and thats my rollneck began helen furiously shut up murmured rannaldini but with such venom that any further reproach froze on helens lips we have a guest tabitha my dear i dont think youve met isaac lovell tab halted tossing her head so haughtily isa could see up the nostrils of her long greek nose and the curling blonde underside of her lashes but as he breathed in her scent he was so unaccountably overwhelmed by foreboding that he found himself trembling tab in turn saw a young man as dark and narrow as the gallows and as still as the embracing cupid and psyche on the plinth beside him his eyes were filled with hostility and in his hand was a glass of tomato juice as blood red as the feud between the two families what the hells he doing here she demanded in outrage discussing my horses said rannaldini everyone jumped as the door crashed open and a furiously growling sharon the labrador backed into the room frantically worrying a sheepskin slipper hanging on to the other end growling equally loudly but looking more sheepish than the slipper because he knew the drawing rooms were out of bounds was tabloid rannaldinis senior rottweiler get them out of here screamed helen as a rosegarlanded chelsea bowl circa smashed into a hundred pieces you know those uncontrollable brutes arent allowed in the house how did he get in then spat tab scowling at isa dont be so goddam rude shouted helen ignoring such brawling isa picked up rannaldinis times and turned to the racing pages lunch was predictably unrelaxed isa who had the conversational skills of a trappist monk who had never visited sydney opera house or seen the nolans and the boyds in any of the art galleries and who had never forgiven helen for nearly destroying his parents marriage turned his back on her and talked horses with rannaldini watching his weight he drank only perrier picked the bits of lobster out of the delectable mango and shellfish salad and had no tartare sauce or vegetables with his dover sole tab just drank vodka and horrified she was so violently attracted to isa disagreed with everything he said rannaldini watched them in delight an evil smile flickering over his lips like a snakes tongue after lunch rannaldini isa and tabitha rode the new french horses and the dappledgrey engineer round paradise tab who had put on a blue baseball cap and an indigo bomber jacket with cant catch me printed on the back proceeded to show off executing dressage steps as gracefully as a ballerina jumping huge fences and fivebar gates beating isa easily as they thundered down the long ride past valhalla lake passing the gates leading to hermiones beautiful mill river house tabitha noticed her fiendish son little cosmo harefield touting for a fiver for the guy who looked surprisingly like rannaldinis fearsome pa miss bussage whats that obnoxious brat doing at home she asked knowing perfectly well that little cosmo was rannaldinis son i thought hed gone to prep school cosmo has been suspended for bullying tab was shocked by the pride in rannaldinis voice like son like father she said disapprovingly rannaldini laughed on the village green parents and children were happily building a huge bonfire as the horses clattered down paradise high street lights were coming on in the cottages seeing people companionably having tea and watching television tab was overcome with longing for penscombe what date is it she asked october the thirtieth said isa its daddys birthday tomorrow she said bleakly mist was rising from the river as they turned right towards valhalla the house itself was hidden by its great conspirators cloak of woods but ahead in a dense copse known as hangmans wood they caught a glimpse of rannaldinis watchtower the roar of a tractor taking hay to rannaldinis horses was accompanied by deep complaining from the rooks an early owl hooted in the dusk tab kept losing sight of sharon the labrador as the dog plunged into a stream choked by leaves as yellow as herself entering rannaldinis estate down a littleused back lane the engineer stopped and trembled violently sweat blackening his dappled coat his big brave eyes rolling even when isa and rannaldini rode on ahead he refused to follow them between two gnarled oaks into a tree tunnel in which blackthorn hazel and hawthorn intertwined overhead like a guard of honour in sympathy with the engineer sharon raised her hackles and yapped and when shouted at by tab rammed her tail between her legs and howled even when tab uncharacteristically laid into the engineer with her whip because she was so humiliated he was napping in front of isa the horse wouldnt go forward finally he backed terrified into a rusty barbedwire fence entangling his hind legs only isas lightning reactions leaping from his mare chucking his reins to rannaldini gently talking to the engineer as he calmly set him free avoided a hideous accident could have severed a fetlock you stupid bitch he swore at tab as he bound up the horses leg with a redspotted handkerchief tab whod also jumped down couldnt stop shaking and had to lean against an equally shaking engineer for support after hed given her a leg back up isa handed her sharon to hold the little ones gone far enough better carry her home lets go back through the main gates said rannaldini swinging his horse round the setting sun had emerged from beneath a curtain of dark grey cloud firing the puddles warming the swirling silver spectres of old mans beard as they swished home through the wet leaves isa lit a cigarette and drew deeply on it then as tabs hands were full of reins and sharon he held it to her lips for a couple of puffs letting his fingers rest for a second against her cold face few horses like that lane observed rannaldini idly sir charles beddoes a previous owner got so bored with the local blacksmith visiting his young wife caroline he rearranged the old mans beard cables between the two oaks then he surprised the lovers in bed escaping on his horse down the back lane the blacksmith rode straight into the cables and snap they broke his neck over the years many villagers have heard the clattering of his horses hoofs or seen him hanging above the road at twilight rannaldinis smile was satanic in the half light sometimes on winter evenings at valhalla you can hear poor caroline sobbing for her lost love or see her wandering the passages in a bloodstained grey dress a fashionable colour for ghosts said isa sardonically but he crossed himself quickly and spat on the tarmac as they turned into the paradise cheltenham road maybe said rannaldini but the trail of her little footprints comes through locked doors leaving marks on the flagstones why the hell did you take us that way then yelled tab then slipping all over the wet leaves endangering both her horses and her puppys lives she galloped back to the stables once the vet had given the engineer the ok tab retreated along endlessly twisting dark passages to her bedroom refusing any supper tempted to drown herself as she soaked in a hot bath sobbing helplessly like caroline beddoes as she waited in dread for the sound of isas departing car valhalla was full of priestholes and secret passages known only to rannaldini and clive his leatherclad bodyguard rooms on all levels enabled people to peer out of the small mullioned windows through the creepers into other peoples bedrooms not trusting rannaldini tab drew her tattered crimson damask bedroom curtains that covered the window overlooking the courtyard but left open the others so that she could gaze south over the quiet starlit valley valhalla had been a royalist stronghold during the civil war on one of the mullions was carved the head of a cavalier probably prince rupert of the rhine running her fingers over his long hair and proud patrician face tabitha wished hed gallop down the centuries on his charger and whisk her away from all this confusion from the summer drawing room directly below her bedroom she could hear the distant rumble of rannaldinis voice and longed to gaze at isa through a crack in the floorboards used to owners banging on isa was only pretending to listen to rannaldinis postmortem about why the prince of darkness had only won by four lengths at chepstow to take his mind off tabitha he was deliberately pondering on a small lazy chestnut twoyearold called peppy koala which hed seen last week in australia or rather not seen because frightened by a snake on the gallops the colt had flashed past him faster than light peppy koalas owner a tycoon called mr brown had no idea of the colts potential isa didnt ride horses for the flat but he reckoned hed found a guineas possibly a triple crown winner if tipped off rannaldini would certainly pay for the colt and its fare to england but would then want total glory and control he was a difficult demanding owner unfortunately baby spinosissimo the australian tenor who let isa do what he liked had run out of money it couldnt be long before someone else sussed the colts potential rupert was also serenading baby the racing world was a bloody jungle isa was brought back to earth at the sound of tabithas name rannaldini was saying idly that he was thinking of settling a very large sum of money on her it wouldnt be worth it isa told himself too much blood had flowed under the bridge and being superstitious he couldnt defy that feeling of foreboding when tabitha had entered the room that morning as rannaldini fetched the brandy decanter isa glanced at a letter on a nearby desk dear dame hermione i am sorry to suspend your son cosmo but we cannot allow bullying particularly of a much younger boy xavier campbellblack is only six and a half a plucky little lad who has settled in as a dayboy extremely well the fact that he is black makes the whole business even more reprehensible i hope ten days at home will give cosmo the chance to reflect upon his actions that was poetic justice thought isa sourly rupert had bullied isas father at school now ruperts adopted son was getting a taste of his fathers medicine tell me all about baby spinosissimo said rannaldini filling up isas glass later they went out on to the terrace to admire the winter stars which isa knew well as he had to rise most mornings several hours before it was light a small silver moon was sailing up from the east as isa breathed in the smell of moulding leaves and woodsmoke orion and his dog stars blazed down as beautiful solitary and icily imperious as tabitha and like the little silver moon how much light she cast around her the chapel clock tolled midnight tab turned her sodden pillow oh why had she left the latest dick francis downstairs the front door banged isa was gone she gave a wail of despair but hearing distant steps on the flagstones she hastily turned off her light in case rannaldini was on the prowl the footsteps slow and deliberate were coming up the stairs getting closer and closer in a moment of panic she felt sure she heard the door of the empty spare room next door stealthily opening and closing as the boards creaked outside her heart stopped it must be rannaldini she wanted to scream but who would hear with her mother locked in mogadoninduced stupor at the other end of the wing sharon asleep on the bed was no protection the floorboards creaked again as if someone were deliberating then there was a knock who is it gasped tab shutting the door behind him isa leant against it in the moonlight his eyes were a skulls black hollows ive been brought up to hate the name of campbellblack he said wearily but i cant help myself you are the most desirable but he didnt have time to finish tab had belted across the room tripping over a still unpacked suitcase into his arms youre as verboten as a cream bun in a health farm she gabbled but i cant help myself either for a second he put his hands round her white throat so slender that he could have snapped it in an instant telling himself he could still escape but her breath which came in little gasps smelt so sweet and her mouth shyly testing his was so soft that he found himself gently sliding his tongue between her perfect white teeth but it was the last gentle thing he did sharon must have thought one of the blacksmiths oaks had landed on her as they collapsed onto the bed ripping off tabs striped pyjamas scattering the buttons of his shirt jamming the zip of his jeans leaving on just his gypsy earrings to ward off evil isa appreciated her true beauty only when he held her naked and quivering in his arms kissing often biting his way downwards he found a little seahorse tattooed just below her left breast youre in for a bumpy ride fellow he whispered mockingly as his exploring fingers crept between tabs legs oh bliss you mustnt oh please go on gasped tab then worried that he might be bored by such a wonderful but extended foreplay oh please come inside me as isa brought her to extremes of pleasure with the same pelvic thrusts that drove winners past the post she knew exactly why he had been nicknamed the black cobra it was as though constant lightning were being unleashed from his body and she never seemed to dry up as if a cotswold spring was constantly bubbling between her legs as their breathing grew quicker and the fourposter creaked like an old tree in a high wind she thought she had never known lovemaking like it as he watched them through the twoway mirror which kept misting up rannaldini realized he had never seen anything like it either silvered by moonlight they were so transported by their passion it was as though canovas cupid and psyche had sprung to whitehot life constantly changing positions they coupled with snakelike frenzy now isa was kissing one of tabs small amazingly high breasts biting the nipple until she cried out now he was lying sideways his dark head and stabbing tongue buried in her blonde pubic hair as simultaneously her lips and tongue teased and caressed his cock which rannaldini was furious to confess looked bigger than his own at least the little blighter couldnt hold out much longer but exulting in his control isa drew himself out as proudly as excalibur then swivelling round he plunged inside her once more his pale murderers face triumphant his hips a juddering blur only when tab arched went rigid then cried out did he finally let himself come kissing in ecstasy her long white throat her damp forehead her loving mouth as for a fleeting moment his defences were down frantically wiping a peephole in the steamedup mirror rannaldini thought he would explode and did he must install a video camera so he could gloat for hours over the playback reluctantly he had to admit that isa was as good at riding women as he was horses i love you mumbled tabitha when isa finally removed his mouth from hers thank god youve washed off that bloody awful perfume its mummys jolie madame she never wore anything else until this summer when she switched to organza so i thought id help her use up the old stuff in horror isa realized he must have smelt the same scent on his father when jake had come upstairs to tuck him in after stolen meetings with helen never wear it again he snapped and rolled off her on to his back buy me something else then god youre a revelation ive always been soixantenervous before but with you it was unbelievable isa couldnt believe it had happened how could he have betrayed his parents like that id better go he said hearing the rusty creak of drawbridges being pulled up fighting desolation tab scooped a drowsy sharon into the warm place left by his body then she caught sight of the bedside clock its october the thirtyfirst now she said insolently happy birthday daddy sleeping with the enemy is the worst present i could give him isa glowered down at her his arms trapping her like the debtors chair is that why you went to bed with me he hissed not entirely said tab for the next week they devoured each other making love in the hayloft on the wet autumn leaves knowing they were playing with fire but unable to stop themselves aware of the difference in their backgrounds and temperaments isa was the more detached of the two but within three weeks tab was pregnant isa who had a strong sense of dynasty and a smouldering eye for the main chance hoped that rannaldini would settle money on her as hinted and insisted they got married there was no way a possible lovell heir was going to be terminated anyway he couldnt get enough of tab but he was worried sick about martie his australian girlfriend to whom in explanation of his absence he had considerably exaggerated jakes illness in junking her and consorting with the devilled campbellblacks had he lost all his principles terrified of trapping him tab would willingly have had an abortion ive never looked after a man she gibbered ill probably give you hay for dinner but she loved him so passionately she was only too happy to get married events were much bowled along by rannaldini who not only agreed to pay for the wedding which because of his overflowing diary could take place only on a late afternoon in the middle of december but also offered them his latest purchase magpie cottage just across the valley rentfree helen had mixed feelings tab could have done infinitely better and it would mean the press raking up her affaire with isas father jake but shed enjoy showing everyone at the wedding how much better she looked than tory the wife jake had gone back to she must book in for a few days at champneys finally there was undeniable pleasure in how much the whole thing would enrage rupert and at least it meant that tab who had draped a banana skin on psyches head only that morning would move out and rannaldini wouldnt run after her any more if she married isa who looked capable of knifing any competition or so helen thought meanwhile rehearsals for don carlos were supposed to have started in a defunct wi hall in north london tristan however grew increasingly frustrated when all his stars headed by fat franco who was singing otello at la scala failed to turn up this meant that poor mikhail whose hotel bill was being picked up by liberty productions had noone to rehearse with except his voice coach who found it a great strain having to squawk hermiones and chloes parts let alone growling like an old bear pretending to be alpheus the reason for this mass absenteeism was that top singers hate rehearsing because they dont get paid for it why should we roll up because mikhail pezcherov hasnt sung the part in english before they chorused were only going to be reading our parts at the recording anyway and could be whizzing round the world avoiding tax and making fortunes elsewhere franco and i never met when we did tristan and isolde protested hermione on a very crackly call from a florida beach i just put on cans and recorded the entire opera from the orchestral track thats why it was so lifeless and boring yelled a furious tristan but hermione had hung up tristan also spent a lot of time on the telephone shouting at rannaldini how the fuck can i direct individual rehearsals when there arent any individuals to direct i am shocked at them all lied rannaldini and to placate tristan he invited him down to valhalla the following saturday then we iron out every problem i also invite that australian tenor baby spinosissimo rannaldini added airily hes coming down to see his jockey isa lovell who by an extraordinary coincidence happens to be my jockey why dont you drive down together rannaldini rubbed his hands in glee what frisson it would add if tristan and particularly baby were present at the wedding thank goodness clive his bodyguard had discovered that on the big day rupert would be out of the country with his son xavier poor xav had not only had to endure cosmos horrible bullying rupert had also found his little son sobbing his heart out because hed been scrubbing his face for hours trying to get it as white as ruperts rupert had struggled not to weep too instead he decided to give xavier some sense of identity by taking him back to colombia here xav could meet the nuns in the bogotá convent in which hed spent his first two years and see something of the ravishing surrounding countryside taggie ruperts wife and bianca xavs younger sister would have gone as well if bianca hadnt caught measles at midnight on the eve of the wedding therefore an unsuspecting taggie was at penscombe filling up the deep freeze for christmas bianca whose temperature was down was fast asleep upstairs the six dogs except for gertrude the mongrel who always kept an eye open for scraps slept in their baskets two huge moussakas for the staff party were complete except for the cheese topping which was bubbling on the aga having laid the big scrubbed table for the grooms and jockeys breakfast tomorrow taggie had left space at the end to wrestle with her christmas cards very dyslexic she found proper names a nightmare she was dickering over whether to send a card to ruperts exwife helen to heal the breach and make it easier for rupert to see tabitha again but she wasnt sure how to spell rannaldini hearing the strange strangulated croak of a foxs bark she glanced out of the window a car was lighting up the trees as it sped along the opposite side of ruperts valley when the telephone rang oh bliss it must be rupert he hated her working late she must remember to sound sleepy is that taggie asked a slurred voice so like ruperts look im getting married to isa lovell at five oclock tomorrow no today will you come id like some family there apart from mummy oh no tab you cant taggie collapsed in horror on the windowseat tab burst into tears it was several moments before taggie could elicit the fact that her stepdaughter was having isas baby and rannaldini being angelic had masterminded the wedding and that tab was madly in love with isa but hes so busy raceriding five days a week and helping jake at the dreaded name taggie jumped as though shed been stung with his yard that i dont see much of him he doesnt need me as much as i need him as tabitha was obviously getting cold feet taggie beseeched her to postpone the wedding you dont have to marry him darling have the baby here well all help you look after it daddy wouldnt allow that sobbed tab of course he would itll kill him tab anyone else but isa you know how he feels about the lovells and not having the wedding at penscombe will break his heart he was just about to ring you and make it up put him on then demanded tab hes in bogotá with xav immediately taggie knew shed said the wrong thing as tab who was as jealous of xavier and bianca as she was of marcus slammed down the telephone a disgusting smell of burnt cheese sauce brought taggie back to earth as gertrude the mongrel wandered over stiffly and laid her head on her mistresss knee oh gertrude what am i going to do sobbed taggie is your name really spinosissimo asked tristan as he edged his navy blue aston on to the m course not said baby i got it out of a rose catalogue my real names brian smith but you cant have smith alongside the pavarottis and domingos on a record sleeve outrageous incredibly glamorous baby spinosissimo had burntsienna curls thickly lashed debauched grey eyes a beaky little nose and a pouting but wickedly determined mouth slightly plump already he finished a whole box of quality street on the way down chucking his sweet papers out of the window he also spent a lot of time on tristans telephone talking to his bookmaker responding to tristans ability to listen baby was soon telling him about his sex life women ran after him in droves but the only person he was remotely interested in was his trainer and jockey isa lovell hes got such a capacity for menace i cant sleep at night for imagining him gripping me as he grips those horses baby also confessed that buying horses for isa to train had screwed him up with the taxman jan one and the debtors prison looms in return tristan told baby about his problems with don carlos fat franco wont rehearse hes got half colombia up his nose for a start said baby dismissively and he hates the part of carlos thinks its very difficult and not important or sympathetic enough domingo feels the same he dismisses carlos as a wimp with one solo what dyou think asked tristan if the part was decently acted by someone hugely attractive baby smoothed his curls what else are you up to the lily in the valley was nearing its final cut said tristan tomorrow he was nipping over to paris to redo some dialogue with claudine lauzerte are you pleased with it yes admitted tristan but one has no idea what will happen when it faces an audience claudine lauzerte baby rolled his eyes is a terrific gay icon in oz they were in deep country now the sun hadnt appeared for days probably singing otello in milan but despite bare trees and lowering skies the winter wheat spilling like a jade sea over the rich red ploughed fields gave a feeling of spring driving through the russet cathedral town of rutminster approaching some traffic lights they drew level with a black mercedes driven by a young girl she was wearing a stop puppy farming tshirt but her pale blonde hair was fantastically garlanded with pink and white flowers like a botticelli angel a labrador puppy as yellow as her hair lay across her thighs her seatbelt was undone and she was unashamedly taking slugs out of a vodka bottle tristan who knew hed seen her before nearly ran into the car in front kerist on a harleydavidson gasped baby oh don fatale muttered tristan because the girl had one of those faces that makes everyone elses look commonplace where are you going to mademoiselle shouted baby lowering his window itll be madame in an hour or two shouted back tabitha lifting the vodka bottle to her lips and driving on at the edge of town she gave them the slip thats one for the divorce courts said baby then to tristans surprise he admitted he had been married briefly when he was twentyone my brother had such a beaut stag party i wanted one too so i had to get spliced my stag party was so great i only just made the wedding passed out as soon as i got to the reception and didnt wake up till next day my motherinlaw never forgave me and nor did my wife it only lasted a few weeks baby told the story so wickedly that tristan couldnt help laughing but neither could he stop thinking about the girl at the traffic lights then he remembered hed seen her in a silver frame on rannaldinis piano across the world in bogotá rupert had returned from a marvellous day out xavier had totally captivated the nuns who had not seen him since rupert and taggie had adopted him four and a half years ago he was so tall straightbacked and confident now and proudly showed them photographs of taggie bianca whod come from the same convent bogotá his black labrador gringo his pony already covered in rosettes and finally of his big brother marcus winning the appleton we read about marcus in the papers said mother immaculata you must be so proud and what about your sister tabitha we dont see her any more thank god said xav flatly shes in america eventing explained rupert hastily vowing to telephone her the moment he got back to england returning to the hilton he found a message to ring taggie urgently when he heard the news he went berserk what time is it in england about three thirty weve got to stop it rannaldinis set the whole thing up in revenge for marcus winning the appleton and the rows over don carlos gimme his number then for once forgetting his wifes reading problems for christs sake move it as tabitha breezed in from the hairdresser a purring rannaldini told her that her father was on the line for a second her face lit up then picking up the telephone she was scalded even thousands of miles away by the lava of ruperts rage if she really went ahead and married isa he would never speak to her again never allow her back to penscombe never give her a penny so what else is new screamed tabitha you said exactly the same thing when mummy married rannaldini i love isa its not just because im having your grandchild wont be any bloody grandchild of mine its spawn of the devil bollocks youre the devil i know what you got up to terrorizing jake at school and tory when she was a deb making jakes life a misery on the showjumping circuit pinching revenge from him id no idea that revenge started off as jakes horse or the reason macaulay wouldnt go for you in the world championship was because youd beaten him to a pulp in the past just as you beat up mummy i bloody fucking didnt yes you did youre the biggest bastard that ever walked you aint seen nothing yet howled rupert ill destroy your marriage and bring down rannaldini and the entire lovell family oh go screw yourself a shattered tab slammed down the receiver rupert was straight on to taggie i cant get back in time to stop the marriage but ill get it annulled tomorrow and ill strangle you if you go to the wedding the moment rupert hung up tabitha called taggie and begged her to go christ look at hammerklavier house of horror shivered baby as after extended drinks at the pearly gates he and tristan drove towards valhalla rooks rose out of a shroud of mist thickened by bonfires of wet leaves sinister conspiratorial as its owner the great grey house lurked behind its mighty army of trees its tiny deepset windows thought tristan were like the eyes of medieval scholars grown small from poring over learned texts lit only by a flickering candle as rannaldini had wanted maximum publicity without alerting rupert he had waited until midday to invite the leading gossip columnists who had dropped everything to be there the rest of the paparazzi in black leather jackets and dark glasses tried to storm the electric gates as they opened to admit baby and tristan remembering étiennes funeral tristan ducked in horror baby on the other hand waved happily at the end of a long drive through dark woods and deerhaunted parkland tristan and baby were directed through the omnia vincit amor gates rannaldinis alldevouring smile welcomed them at the front door inside they found tabitha except for the puppyfarming tshirt and the flowers in her hair she was unrecognizable her swollen eyes redder than carbuncles her face grey except where it was covered in blotches despite having thrown up after her terrible row with rupert she was still attacking the vodka delighted by the turn of events rannaldini was about to introduce her when tab gave a cry of relief and shoving baby and tristan aside ran towards a dark girl who had followed them into the house oh lucy thank god youve come one glance at tabs blubbered woebegone little face told it all has your dad been horrible to you again horrible horrible sobbed tab as she led lucy upstairs lucy latimer was tabithas greatest friend they had met when they became involved in animal rights a vegetarian and a makeup artist lucy was very careful not to use cosmetics that had been tested on animals extremely successful because she combined a painters eye with a sympathetic soothing nature she fortunately had a spare day between filming to make up tab and provide moral support come on latimer tab gazed at the wreckage in her bedroom mirror this is the greatest challenge youll ever face dont you worry lucy unpacked a roll of brushes sponges and assorted bottles ill have you stunning as ever in a trice and talking of stunning did you see that man in the hall couldnt miss him really sighed lucy but youll have to put all that behind you now only a streak of saffron on the horizon gave a clue the sun was setting but apple logs burned merrily in the summer drawing room rannaldini looking very good in a morning coat because the grey waistcoat matched his pewter hair handed tristan and baby glasses of champagne and apologized that they had run into a wedding whos getting married asked baby my stepdaughter tabitha she doesnt seem very keen on the idea said tristan wincing at his fathers painting over the piano of a leering man undressing a very young girl just lastminute nerves rannaldini seemed to be killing himself over some private joke whos the lucky guy asked baby my dear boy i thought youd have known its your jockey isa lovell the colour drained from babys suntanned face he seemed to shrink like a larky march hare suddenly looking down a gun barrel christ he cant be he stammered what about martie he was talking of marrying her after crimbo rannaldini always got a charge out of inflicting pain hell be in in a minute to tell you himself he was irritated not to be riding at cheltenham today tristan felt desperately sorry for baby and put a hand on his rigid shoulders this happen very quick you told me she only came home the day of the gramophone awards ah sighed rannaldini when one is young love work like lightning like carlos and elisabetta carlos and elisabetta happen so quick because they were giddy with relief an arranged marriage had turned out so well protested tristan i believe in arranged marriages said rannaldini warmly after all he had arranged this one i hope youll stay for the wedding he begged you might even sing something during the signing of the register he smiled at baby who having drained his glass of champagne had got a grip on himself dame hermione is singing panis angelicus went on rannaldini ah here comes the bridegroom and in strolled isa still in old cords and a tweed jacket hi he smiled almost mockingly at baby who found it impossible to act normally as he blushed and couldnt speak isa always had this effect on him hadnt you better get changed snapped tristan plenty of time said isa coolly i thought baby might like to see round your yard rannaldini it wasnt long before baby found his tongue again why the hell didnt you marry tabithas brother marcus he hissed at least hes the right sex i suppose you knocked her up this is a very nice mare isa opened a halfdoor shell lose it if she goes on hitting the vodka i suppose its also for the money rupert wont give her a penny sighed isa and rannaldini will only help out if it suits him well youre not getting another cent out of me in the safety of the loosebox isa ran a finger down babys gritted jaw it doesnt change anything he said softly if youre a good boy ill tell you more about this amazing horse ive found did you know he added idly gypsies consider it unlucky if a marriage takes place after sunset meanwhile tristan was exploring valhalla grey and spooky in the december twilight it would be the perfect setting for don carlos he could imagine the hunt streaming down those rides or eboli chasing carlos through the maze there were dungeons for posas death and a splendid mausoleum for charles vs tomb even the auto da fe in which the heretics were burnt could be staged in the courtyard outside the chapel as he wandered through rooms formed by yew hedges statues of naked nymphs lurked in every corner tristan wished he could offer them all his jacket to his right the wood kept readjusting the mist like a shawl around its shoulders and as he reached the big lawn to the north four vast lawson cypresses reared up like monks in black habits with their pointed hoods over their faces gazing up from beneath them tristan suddenly felt the terror of the sixteenthcentury maninthestreet overwhelmed by the dark towering forces of the inquisition quickening his step as night fell he nearly ran into a pack of paparazzi as they levelled their long lenses like a firing squad at a new arrival he decided they were part of some presentday auto da fe destroying reputations for public delectation in a blinding flash he realized that don carlos must be made in modern dress the present english royal family were so similar to verdis french and spanish royalty elisabetta was so like both the sad princess diana and the wistful queen elizabeth married to the shortfused rovingeyed prince philip who was not unlike philip ii of spain and they too had a son called charles who was romantic idealistic longed for a proper job had a loving nature and was terrified of his stern critical father as carlos had been whilst in eboli the feisty mistress in love with carlos could be seen an echo of camilla parker bowles and in the noble marquis of posa a touch of andrew her diplomatic soldier husband they could start the film with these characters in the royal box then cut to the two armies on the skyline but who was the modern equivalent of the grand inquisitor wondered tristan as he retraced his steps to the omnia vincit amor gates who terrorized people to madness why not gordon dillon the ruthless editor of the scorpion who would shop his own children to boost circulation and who went around in tinted glasses and softsoled shoes scaring his staff as shitless as the public the inquisition bullyboys who cast such terrifying shadows over don carlos could be represented as lurking paparazzi or as the chinless ruthless courtiers who spent their time spying and manipulating at buckingham palace tristan couldnt wait to tell rannaldini monsieur de montigny a soft lisping voice made him jump out of his skin in his path lurked what appeared to be yet another leatherclad member of the paparazzi with hair as pale as his bloodless face and the leer of a chemist when asked for something embarrassing before tristan could tell him to piss off the sinister creature introduced himself as clive rannaldinis henchman sir roberto was worried you were outside without an overcoat he thought you might like a cup of tea or something stronger before the service starts in half an hour fifty miles away at penscombe taggie campbellblack was still tearing out her dark hair ruperts reprobate old father eddie had invited himself for the weekend having ensconced him happily in the study with a bottle of bells and racing on television taggie took the opportunity as she hastily made up her face for tabs wedding in the kitchen mirror to discuss the crisis with ruperts assistant lysander hawkley lysander who was married to rannaldinis young third wife kitty and who had also ridden his horse arthur in the rutminster cup the same year isa had ridden rannaldinis delinquent prince of darkness was absolutely horrified tab cant marry isa taggie hes an evil bugger he spat at me before the race and made some seriously insulting remarks about arthur who being a horse couldnt answer back and he gets up to wicked tricks on the course nearly rode me into the rails and called me campbellblacks bumboy lysander flushed bloody insult not that he added quickly if i was that way inclined i could think of anyone nicer than rupert you probably could in his present mood sighed taggie as she fluffed blusher on her blanched cheeks oh lysander what am i going to do tab couldnt have done a worse thing poor darling said lysander who having been worshipped unconditionally by tab for four years had a rosier view of her than most people shes so impulsive shell be so isolated in that camp said taggie jake and tory wont like it any more than rupert wholl kill me when he discovers ive gone to the wedding but i cant not tab sounded so pitiful id come with you said lysander but id murder rannaldini take eddie hed liven up any party rannaldinis woods soared up like black cliffs trees sheathed in ivy danced like witches at some wild sabbath what a creepy house shuddered taggie as ruperts helicopter landed and she helped her fatherinlaw climb out whys the fella flying both the german and italian flags snorted eddie glaring up at the roof hes half german half italian strordinary to be on both losing sides in the last war as they hurried towards the omnia vincit amor gates a lot of people were getting out of a minibus must be the tenants said eddie no i think theyre isas relations said taggie it was nearly six oclock the little chapel attached to the north wing at valhalla was packed to overflowing having drifted in to a rumble of approval twenty minutes ago helen on her own in the lefthand front pew grew increasingly furious in order to upstage tory lovell and hermione she had spent a fortune at lindka cierachs on a ravishing smokyblue suit nipped in to show off her tiny waist she had spent almost more on a foxfur hat about which tab had been vilely rude one should not call ones mother no better than a bloody murderer on ones wedding day and because tabitha had never written thankyou letters or looked up helens family when she was in america none of them had bothered to fly over for the wedding claiming it was too near to christmas even marcus had deserted her because nemerovsky had a first night in st petersburg as a horrible result rannaldini had spitefully filled the relationless row behind her with valhalla staff sally and betty the pretty maids whod gone to london to look after serena westwoods jessie mr brimscombe the gardener who was hopping mad because helen had stripped his conservatories of flowers mrs brimscombe the housekeeper whod been allowed out of the kitchens for half an hour and to top it the fearful bussage in a trilby and a severe grey dress no doubt theyd be joined soon by clive rannaldinis henchman and tabloid the rottweiler having ignored helen the bridegroom across the aisle was reading the racing post and murmuring to baby whom hed somehow seconded into being his best man as there was a limited time one could admire the white fountains of jasmine and freesias and the murillo madonna which rannaldini had insisted on hanging on the wall to the right of the altar helen walked down the aisle to disabuse lady chisledon a local worthy of any idea that bussage might be a relation bloody hell helen prided herself on not swearing even in private but taggie campbellblack had just tiptoed in looking wildly embarrassed but undeniably gorgeous in a crimson suit with a black velvet collar and a little crimson pillbox on her dark cloudy hair rannaldini who was hovering in the doorway was all over or under her because taggie was so tall like a bull terrier courting a wolfhound even worse taggie had brought helens dreadful exfatherinlaw eddie campbellblack who was getting drunker by the minute with the aid of a hip flask and wearing ruperts far too large morning coat with a badge pinned to the lapel saying old men make better lovers ouch squawked helen as eddie pinched her bottom the lovells looked as though theyd come to a funeral the men in dark suits the women with too much hair sticking out under the front of their hats except for tory who looked maddeningly much prettier in a royal blue suit than helen remembered and who never let go of jakes hand and now late as ever hermione swept in having abandoned her usual chanel suits in favour of a white angels mididress and a gold halo hat psyching herself into the saintly role of elisabetta thought tristan sourly it would hold more credence if she made the odd rehearsal in one hand hermione was clutching the music of panis angelicus in the other her fiendish son little cosmo who proceeded to kick the pews crunch crisps and stick out a green tongue at the rest of the congregation thats rannaldinis illegit whispered meredith whalen whod taken one overexcited look at tristan and swept him and lucy latimer into a back pew cant you tell from the nasty rolling black eyes and hes twice as evil as rannaldini meredith who was known as the ideal homo because he was so much in demand as a spare man at paradise dinner parties was a hugely successful interior designer whom rannaldini had booked to do the sets for don carlos meredith looked so innocent and sweet all his gay friends wanted to put him in short pants and smack him and did you ever see anyone so tense as jake and tory lovell he was now whispering to tristan like blasted oaks i suppose its sad when ones little acorn goes astray and look at bussage shes a worse control freak than rannaldini and shes wearing her control frock we could film philips coronation in here you know dont you just love that murillo must be worth five million thats why rannaldini spends so much time in chapel gloating over it eddie campbellblack whod been ogling lady chisledon suddenly spied hermione one of his former amours hello henrietta he bellowed tabitha who was even drunker than eddie swayed on rannaldinis arm in the chapel doorway you look sensational he murmured she was wearing two triangles of white silk high at the neck and falling nine inches above her knees she held a small bunch of freesias to match the flowers in her hair my dress is new my knickers are borrowed from mummy she informed rannaldini my toenails are painted blue and youre the something old for a second she frowned at him i ought to be at penscombe with daddy giving me away the last thing im ever going to do is give you away purred rannaldini his right knuckles gently kneading her left breast then he winced at the first strains of here comes the bride who chose this junk i did said tab then glancing round the chapel she gave a sob oh thank god taggie and granddaddy are here striding up the aisle like a young amazon she paused to squeeze her stepmothers hand what a vulgar dress said hermione in a very audible whisper whens her baby due asked little cosmo loudly lucy whod hardly had a second to change into a dark brown suit and black bowler or to apply any of her makeup skills on herself prayed that tabitha wouldnt be sick thats percy the parson hissed meredith as a redfaced cleric with straggly grey hair moved forward to welcome the bride hes got such a plain wife theyre known as one man and his dog lucy fought the giggles and the bridegroom is to die for sighed meredith as isa moved beside tabitha such a moody vindictive little shit pure heathcliff in fact but bags i be catherine earnshaw should have had a haircut fellows hairs longer than tabithas said eddie loudly there was an awkward moment when percy the parson asked if anyone knew of any impediment or just cause why the couple shouldnt be joined in matrimony and little cosmo called out i do with a maniacal cackle and had his ears boxed by his mother to have and to hold from this day forward intoned isa chap sounds like something out of brookside muttered a disapproving eddie taking a swig from his hip flask i tabitha maud lavinia take thee isaac jake said tab in the flat clipped drawl that reminded almost everyone present of rupert love cherish and obey she went on looking mockingly at isa from under her mascaraed lashes oh dear taggie blew her nose on a piece of loo paper she certainly hadnt obeyed rupert today with my body i thee worship as she lurched over to kiss isa on the jawbone tab nearly fell over and with all my rather depleted worldly goods i thee endow although i am going to keep the engineer she added as an afterthought tabitha hissed an appalled helen what would the lovells think fortunately everyone was distracted by the ringing of little cosmos mobile tab got the giggles even more fortunately percy dispensed with a sermon hed been kept waiting quite long enough and when hed asked helen and rannaldini for touching memories of the bride helen couldnt think of any and rannaldinis had been quite unrepeatable as everyone knelt to pray it could be seen that the bridegroom was wearing sapphire cufflinks as big and blue as his wifes eyes followed by a smirking rannaldini a tightlipped helen an ashen jake and tory tab and isa went off to sign the register tristan turned to lucy that is best makeup repair job i ever see you wouldnt know shed shedded a tear no frenchwoman would be seen dead in that black bowler decided tristan but lucy had a nice face not pretty but kind and generous with her dark curls freckles bright eyes and athletic body she reminded him of a heroine in one of those mallory towers books his girl cousins were always devouring in the holidays lucy whod spent her life studying faces thought tristans was marvellous she longed to paint out the dark shadows bring forward the deepset eyes and add a bit of tawny blusher to the sallow cheeks there was also deceptive strength in the jaw and when he smiled he had wonderful even white teeth she jumped as meredith who was now standing on the pew to have a better view whispered that the lovells looked as though they were signing a death warrant probably will be if rupert rolls up whos that beautiful woman in the crimson suit asked tristan taggie campbellblack lucy was appalled to feel a stab of jealousy married to that whitehot fury thought tristan in dismay he hoped rupert didnt beat her up hermione had now mounted the pulpit her gold halo hat glinting in the candlelight and opened her music and her big brown eyes panis angelicus rang out on the arctic air tristan gave a shudder of pleasure could you make her look eighteen he muttered to lucy she doesnt look much older shes so lovely a maestro a day helps you work rest and play giggled meredith hermione would have eked out panis angelicus for ever if a mobile hadnt rung again hi joel who won the four thirty at doncaster demanded little cosmo and hermione had to scuttle down from the pulpit to cuff him again hermione was followed by baby who strolled up to the chancel steps turned with his hands in his pockets and looked straight at isa and tabitha who were waiting to return for the blessing whereer you walk sang baby and the chapel went still because he had one of those extraordinary voices whose music goes straight to the listeners heart and as he sang his face lost all its mockery and decadence leaving only sweetness and beauty isa lovells face was totally expressionless but his eyes were as dark as an open grave at midnight god in heaven thought tristan hes got to replace fat franco and play carlos glancing round he found rannaldini smiling straight across at him making a thumbsup sign as the congregation launched into jerusalem isa his saturnine face lit up a cigarette concealed in his left hand was whispering to tabitha as they came down the aisle oh please let it be ok prayed lucy helen followed in great embarrassment on jake lovells arm his limp was so bad that their progress was painfully slow eddie tugged taggies sleeve wasnt that the fellow helen ran off with at the los angeles olympics he demanded loudly dyer mean to say the bounders done it again after that the marx brothers seemed to take over the guests were firmly shepherded upstairs for champagne cocktails in helens blue living room and the bride and groom disappeared for their first legal bonk seeing lucy gazing in wonder at a sickert of a pretty dancer tristan joined her and in no time had learned she was twentyeight had worked like him on a number of big films and owned a lurcher called james nice scent he said scooping up several asparagus rolls its called bluebell it reminds me of home wheres that the lake district ought to be called daffodils then i wandered lonely as a cloud how did you meet tabitha at a compassion in world farming rally we were trying to stop a lorry taking baby calves abroad when the driver and his mate got out of their lorry because we were blocking the road tabitha jumped in backed up the lorry and drove it away they arrested her just before the motorway what was she going to do with them tristan noticed lucy refusing chicken volauvents let them loose in her fathers fields we both spent the night in gaol it sort of bonds you weve been friends ever since shes got absolutely no side she added humbly and shes so beautiful i make up so many faces but hers is easily the best you do excellent job today look lucy when he spoke her name in that husky gérard depardieu voice lucy was lost we start filming don carlos next april for three month maybe more he went on i would like to offer you the makeup job would you be free yes please gasped lucy shed have cancelled anything singers are very highly strung sighed tristan they cant pack their voices away in a case like other musicians but if you can calm tabitha you would have no problem i think having discovered they both shared a pathological loathing of ramblers and deliberately neglected their woods in the hope a rotten tree might fall on one eddie had taken an unaccountable shine to rannaldini how far dyou go he said peering out of the window the whole hog every time giggled meredith oh do look at the bride helen had removed her foxfur hat because it flattened her hair but to her horror tabitha had just returned in jeans and a navy blue poloneck which had pulled most of the freesias out of her hair i was cold mummy she protested feeding volauvents to sharon the labrador who had a pink bow round her neck champagne mrs lovell said a lisping mocking voice as tory lovell swung round her sudden desolation that rannaldinis evil henchman clive was addressing her new daughterinlaw rather than herself was almost palpable the makeup artist is most important person on the set tristan was now telling lucy as they admired an olivegreen wood by j s cotman she is first person an actor see in the morning if she say i havent been paid for weeks the directors a bastard it poison atmosphere you couldnt be a bastard blurted out lucy then went scarlet as he glanced at her bare weddingring finger its hard to be in a longterm relationship if youre a makeup artist on location you tend to slip into affaires i had a boyfriend at home but weve just broken up she confessed in her soft cumbrian accent he was fed up with me being always away said he wanted marks and spencers dinners and someone who listened in the evenings weddings always make you feel a bit bleak she must be drunk already she could tell this man anything and he hadnt volunteered a word about himself are you married she asked tristan shook his head perhaps thats why i too make films you become part of big family and kid yourself youre not alone who gave you those gorgeous cufflinks meredith admired isas sapphires are they a present from the bride no the best man said isa and let the best man win murmured baby tab who had been lighting a cigarette looked round sharply but as she opened her mouth to retort helen tapped her on the shoulder can you please rescue poor tristan hes been stuck for ages with your friend lucy noone gets stuck with lucy snapped tab you chuck him a lifebelt if youre worried dinner is served announced the fearsome bussage waiters holding candles guided the guests past tapestries and suits of armour down dark wandering passages to the great hall which looked stupendous a string quartet was playing in the minstrels gallery the red and gold mural of trumpeters harpists and fiddlers gleamed in the flickering light of hundreds of candles a bottlegreen cloth stretched the length of the huge table mrs brimscombe and the maids had risen at dawn to search the woods and intersperse the gold plate and the glittering armada of cut glass with beautiful red and gold fungi and the last coloured leaves of autumn in front of a huge organ rising to the ceiling a side table groaned with silver dishes of oysters giant prawns vermilion lobster slices of sole in cream sauce and stuffed sea bass carrying on the main tables colour scheme were great bowls of tomato mayonnaise sauce verte and gleaming gold hollandaise and this was only the first course at dinner lucy lost tristan she was stuck between a dull lovell cousin and little cosmo who she felt sure was about to slice a redspotted toadstool into her food tristan was next to helen who bombarded him with questions about don carlos then interrupted with her own views i mean the poor old grand inquisitor was visually challenged when tristan tried to answer them she was far more tense than she had been in prague her hazel eyes constantly policing the room for women who might be getting off with rannaldini particularly the adorable taggie whom rannaldini in a fit of megamalice had seated between himself and jake lovell taggie didnt know which man unnerved her more rannaldini was being unbelievably charming knowing what a great cook she was he found her the tenderest piece from the saddle of lamb then sought her opinion on the russet apples glazed with cumberland sauce would bramleys have added more piquancy taggie mumbled truthfully that it was all delicious but she couldnt forget the hideous way rannaldini had treated her friend kitty while she was married to him jake on the other hand was like a small thundercloud im desperately sorry about this stammered taggie no more sorry than we are said jake bleakly down the table the bride sat between baby and isa a cigarette in one hand a fork in the other her eyes crossing hardly taking in the horse talk that flowed across her poor redeyed tory lovell tried to hide her despair she and jake had managed to patch up their marriage miraculously but now shed have to see helen with whom jake had once been so hopelessly in love at the babys christening and at birthday parties for years to come she wished she liked tab more she shouldnt be smoking and drinking like that it was so bad for the baby tory had so longed for her first grandchild when tab cut her cake she most audibly wished for an olympic gold for the engineer people were beginning to tablehop jake joined isa and baby ignoring tab who got to her feet musht go to the loo arent you going to throw us your bouquet called meredith so we can see whos going to get hitched next instead tab threw her flowers high into the rafters but as the single women and meredith surged forward she reached out and caught them herself im the one whos going to need it she said glancing enigmatically at isa with distress tristan noticed the delight on rannaldinis face then turned and caught the satisfaction on babys rannaldini was clearly as crazy about poor little tab as baby was about the cool sinister isa a family drama in a princely house he thought wryly which was how verdi had described don carlos eddie campbellblack was nose to nose with lady chisledon i do wish they did soap operas about people of our class she was saying lucy had never met anyone quite like little cosmo what are you going to do for a living she asked im going to lead paedophiles on and then blackmail them said little cosmo who was lighting a joint his mother who wished to speak to her director plonked herself between tristan and helen tory lovell is such a charmer she said pointedly helen flounced off everyone was wandering back to their seats for the speeches not wanting to be landed with hermione tristan introduced her to baby no we havent met said baby but we share the same colourist in mount street hermione whod always sworn her rich brown hair was natural was absolutely furious making a hasty getaway tristan sidled up to taggie god she was adorable i hear you adopt children from colombia he said i once recced a film there the people are ravishing taggie melted instantly and was soon telling him about biancas adventures in the nativity play i love acting mummy she said yesterday but i hate being watched im not boring you she asked anxiously never never murmured tristan my singers alas love being watched but hate acting taggie was shyly producing photos of xav and bianca when she felt a laser of jealousy from tab and hurriedly shoved them away stop doing a number on isas divine stepmotherinlaw tristan i want to make a speech shouted baby who had clearly recovered his high spirits in a minute like leporello he bashed the table with a spoon im going to list all the men women and kangaroos isas been to bed with but first i want to read out the telegrams heres an excellent one for tabitha are you sure youre doing the right thing darling love granny after a long pause this was greeted by screams of laughter wonderful woman said eddie who was trying to light a gristik propose to her every christmas know well end up together sit down and shut up baby called out rannaldini with a big pussycat smile im the one whos making the speech helens not with us called out lady chisledon next moment the mother of the bride came rushing in i cannot believe it someone has set fire to my fur hat tabitha she rounded furiously on her daughter must have been lucy said tab collapsing on to her husbands knee shes so anti people wearing fur i never stammered lucy sort it out later said rannaldini sit down he added chillingly helen sat red blotches of rage staining her neck brilliant cake mrs brimscombe shouted tab taking a bite of babys untouched piece both jake and tory had looked at her in horror spit it out tory wanted to shout but it was too late ladies and gentlemen began rannaldini silkily it is with great pleasure but for once he was talking to air as rupert stalked in he was wearing a crumpled lightweight suit and must have hitched a lift from bogotá on someone elses jet enter the pinup from penscombe whispered meredith in ecstasy aware that rupert was the father of xavier whom he had bullied so dreadfully little cosmo slid under the table hello daddy called out tabitha for a second rupert glared round taking in first the bride his daughter on isas knee then his father with his hand down lady chisledons shirt and finally the brides stepmother who was also his wife cringing between jake lovell and a smirking rannaldini his fury was as blasting as nerve gas only hermione was unaffected rupert campbellblack just in time for the dancing she cried charging him like an excited buffalo stepping out of her way rupert chucked an envelope on the dark green tablecloth clive who shadowed rannaldinis every move was gliding in from the right venturer are pulling out of don carlos said rupert softly you can fucking well survive on your own but youre the chief backer hissed rannaldini and the contracts have not been signed interrupted rupert you should stop your rottweiler lawyers being so greedy and thats only the opening shot you poisoned dwarf then totally ignoring a frantically mouthing taggie rupert turned on his heel and stalked out rupert campbellblack gets away with being rude because hes very posh announced the muffled voice of little cosmo penis angelicus sang tabitha and slid under the table to join him the following day rannaldini tristan and sexton whod been heartbroken not to be asked to the wedding held an emergency meeting without venturers millions the film was seriously in jeopardy they couldnt postpone because it was written into alpheuss contract that they would finish at the latest by the end of june sexton was particularly gutted he had not only regarded rupert as a terrific gent who was shithot with money but also as comfortingly much of a musical philistine as he was himself rannaldini was just sighing that he would love to help out financially but what with the wedding and tax bills looming when tristan took a deep breath after all he had no dependants and said as soon as the french lawyers stopped wrangling liberty productions could have the bulk of the money étienne had grudgingly left him then he suggested they economize by filming in modern dress drawing parallels between the spanish and the english royal families grite grite cried sexton in excitement princess di as elisabetta the americans will go apeshit and we can change charles vs ghost into the queen muvver dont be fatuous sexton snapped rannaldini to rannaldinis delight however tristan then proposed they film at valhalla which would be much cheaper you have mausoleum dungeons cloisters and huge state rooms and we can save on location fees travel expenses and hotels by putting the cast up at valhalla said rannaldini gleefully envisaging unlimited extensions and redecorating on the budget once recordings over well recce buckingham palace to get the thing authentic if the leaves are back on the trees by the time we start shooting added tristan we can always send a second unit to film the opening scenes in romania where itll still be winter sounds expensive said rannaldini not altogether playfully well build in serious penalties if you dont finish the movie on time meanwhile the cast were still not turning up at rehearsals but each night tristan and serena westwood spent hours on the floor of tristans flat shuffling papers trying to schedule the recording it was like wrestling with some massive seating plan fitting in with singers availability and keeping the difficult ones apart tricky when theyre all difficult sighed serena i suppose rannaldini will have to turn up for the recording said tristan wearily serena smirked because the maestro was still finding time to take her to bed but to her irritation and despite heavy hints tristan still hadnt made a move on her the recording itself was held in a huge assembly room attached to wallsend town hall in northeast london as the orchestra straggled in on the first day in early january the temperature plummeted below zero snow lay thickly over the regimented beds of wallflowers and pansies lengthening icicles glittered from the gutters in the morning sun inside the hall it was even colder the central heating had been switched off in case gurgles and clicks were picked up on the tape its going to be breathein time for everyone said a fat female member of the chorus looking round the tiny gallery with disapproval down below technicians were trying to find room for all the orchestral chairs and music stands and putting green bottles of water by every singers microphone the offstage band had illadvisedly been sent to play in the bar where an impromptu rehearsal for soloists who had deigned to turn up was also under way hearing screeching sexton who was heroically trying to get into the jargon remarked that dame hermione was in fine voice chance would be a fine thing thats the chorus master said serena sourly do you have a pass sir asked a man on the door as rannaldini stalked in chocolate brown from skiing its maestro rannaldini hissed the other doorman where have you been outer space within seconds rannaldini was rowing with both serena and tristan and changing everything half an hour later hermione swept in and started yelling that her dressing room was too small and too far from the stage and she had nowhere to warm up how dare you send me yellow roses that are fully out when you know i only like buds she then shouted at christy foxe serenas pa a little scrubbedfaced schoolleaver who had just staggered in with hermiones four suitcases and dont forget i always have a glass of chilled champagne at eleven no need to fucking chill it in this hall muttered christy making his escape rannaldini was now altering the schedule no matter that the chorus who had been booked for the day at vast expense would be cooling their heels he wished to kick off the recording with hermiones last duet with franco when fat franco didnt show up rannaldini dragged him out of another recording studio in rome and sacked him thats a million saved for a start he told tristan gleefully as he put down the telephone when francos agent came on the line in apoplexy rannaldini countered suavely that the final contract had not been signed again due to lawyers wrangling and if it had franco was in default for not having attended a single rehearsal or having lost a kilo of weight he hasnt got a fat leg to stand on how can you fire the finest tenor in the world pour encourager les autres as shockhorror at the sacking ricocheted round the world liberty productions called a press conference to announce their new leading man the dazzling dropdead gorgeous honeytoned australian tenor baby spinosissimo the most exciting thing to come out of oz since joan sutherland and the same sex muttered the daily mail scribbling furiously aware that he was getting liberty productions out of a hole baby had played terribly hard to get when howie denston now his agent had rung to offer him the job he had said hed think about it he then went screaming ecstatically round the house before calling isa lovell he was going to earn more money in a few months than in his entire life so he could now pay his tax bill and buy that horse peppy something isa kept banging on about baby rolled up at the subsequent press conference on the arm of a ravishing ponytailed youth in a pinstripe suit gwynneth the flabby crone from the arts council on whom rannaldini had landed when viking hit him across the room was covering the event for the sentinel wildly excited she whisked the pinstriped youth from group to group introducing him reverently as mr spinosissimos partner how long have you and baby been together asked the telegraph oh he picked me up in the car park half an hour ago grinned the youth dyou prefer guys to women baby asked the mirror i prefer sheep said baby if sheep could cook id marry one over the roars of laughter a blonde from the scorpion called out whos this guy schiller whos done the tiein shriller if its dame hermione drawled baby the only obstacles ahead seemed to be that baby must lose a stone before filming if he were to look suitably lovelorn and that the don carlos press officer bruce cassidy predictably nicknamed hypealong would have to try to hide the fact that baby swung every which way including koala bears in another corner of the room as the loudspeakers played posa and carloss friendship duet rannaldini and tristan told a battery of cameras and tapemachines how delighted they were baby was taking over and how equally excited they were about their new russian discovery mikhail pezcherov rannaldini did most of the talking as tristan lit one gauloise from another and looked languidly beautiful bankable and bonkable wrote the mail youve been called the italian stallion and the kraut lout sir roberto piped up the scorpion how come the frog prince is making a film with you rannaldini said tristan in that husky smoky accent with a slight break in it that sent shivers down every womans spine as my godfather and friend has inspired and encouraged me it has been my lifelong ambition to work with him on don carlos i have every confidence in our collaboration alas the recording was continually embattled for a start rannaldini was only interested in the music sounding as he wanted he would scrap even hermiones most glorious take if he didnt like the intonation of the clarinets nor would he adjust his tempo to suit a singer and had no intention of adjusting it for tristan for whom the timing of every bar was crucial normally in films music is added later to enhance the action but in filming an opera the action has to fit already recorded music thus tristan kept having to halt rannaldini if he played something too fast or too slowly because when it came to filming the relevant singer wouldnt have the right amount of time to run to the centre of the maze or indulge in a passionate clinch rannaldini detested this he had arranged for a camera to be on him constantly while he was conducting so that the video could be shown on a huge monitor to guide the singers on location such was his monstrous vanity that he required endless lighting rehearsals and would hold up a hundred musicians not to mention singers chorus and technicians all on overtime for twenty minutes while his hair was brushed and the shine taken off his nose once started though he was reluctant to be halted except at his own whim nor were his singers behaving any better hermione was staying at the lanesborough chloe at the capital the hotels were only a stones throw apart but both divas insisted on travelling in different limos when she discovered that chloes dressing room was bigger than hers hermione was enraged and duly took her revenge the next day singers are reputed to sing less well when they have their periods their vocal cords thicken and the diaphragm supporting the voice becomes sore and easily tired next day chloe recorded her great aria o don fatale and denounced her fatal gift of beauty so gloriously but with such controlled venom it was impossible not to think it was part of her character as she came to the end however and before the strings could tap their bows on the backs of their chairs in congratulation hermione had produced a tampax from her bag and thrusting it towards her asked solicitously are you needing this dear chloe was outraged i cant believe youre still young enough to use those things she snarled back and retaliated later in the day by dropping her handbag in the middle of an exquisite take of hermiones aria in act ii this triggered a fiveminute screaming match with hermione threatening to walk out only tristan managed to calm her there are women hermione deliberately he made his voice even huskier who verdi claimed are born for others who are quite unaware of their own egos and who rise above the petty squabbles of lesser mortals hermione was so moved she behaved herself for the rest of the afternoon on the other hand she was not the only member of the cast to be worried that fat franco had been ousted by an unknown australian at least franco would have ensured that don carlos was a commercial success confidence was restored however the moment baby opened his mouth the entire orchestra turned round to gawp and at the end of his first duet with chloe mikhail put down the score he was studying ran across the hall and flung his arms round baby you have most beautiful voice i ever hear it will be privilege to vork with you mikhails own voice was just as impressive posas death scene had everyone in tears mikhail however was easily demoralized particularly by alpheus the bass who in the great duet between philip ii and posa kept sighing and wearily holding the bridge of his nose between finger and thumb as mikhail with his poor command of english fluffed line after line baby and mikhail on the other hand took to each other instantly almost as an extension of their comradely role in the opera in the evening they went on pub crawls rehearsing their songs for the next day to the noisy delight of the punters they tried to take tristan with them but to their disappointment he insisted on returning alone to a friends flat he had borrowed overlooking regents park after all the rows and hysterics he needed peace to study the next days score mysteriously with mikhails arrival things started to disappear serena mislaid some pearl earrings alpheus some gold cufflinks chloe had quite fancied mikhail until a large topaz ring the only decent present alpheus had ever given her went missing the cutlery in the canteen had to be replaced twice in a week only baby mikhails buddy remained unfleeced which convinced hermione whod made an unbelievable fuss about a missing umbrella that he must be the thief all australians are descended from convicts i have never stolen anything in my life except thunder snapped baby poor little christy foxe the pa had the thankless task of getting the cast to the right mikes on time a singer meant to sound far away has to stand back from the mike but if in the middle of a number he has a love scene with another singer he has to rush to the mike next to them in the ensemble numbers therefore it was like waterloo in the rushhour with little christy shunting dame hermione like a cattle truck in one direction and the chorus master propelling alpheus like the intercity express in the other collisions screamingmatches kicks on the shin and slapped faces were inevitable there were more rows in the control room which was where singers flocked after a stint of recording to listen to the playback and try to persuade serena and sylvestre tristans handsome blond french sound engineer to use the take in which they had sounded best baby who knew he sounded best in everything got so bored even of listening to his own voice not even handsome sylvestre could distract him so he frequently started dancing round the recordingmachines much to alpheuss disapproval alpheus already disapproved of grannys hunky boyfriend giuseppe because if giuseppes consumption of red wine didnt impair the beauty of his voice he might one day topple alpheus in leading bass roles as alpheus had toppled granny alpheus also disapproved of granny who sat calmly knitting colourful squares for a patchwork quilt for his and giuseppes bed shaking with laughter at his own even more colourful asides he hardly bothered to put down his needles when he sang but chilled the blood every time he opened his mouth to deliver the words of the grand inquisitor alpheus disapproved most of all of the orchestra i think the brass section have been drinking he complained during an evening session i should be extremely surprised if they hadnt said the orchestra manager calmly in turn the orchestra who worked flat out at every session thoroughly disapproved of the singers regarding them as lazy stupid hypochondriacal hysterical and grossly overpaid they did however forgive baby because he made them laugh and was monumentally generous whenever hampers or crates of wine rolled in from his increasing army of fans they were handed over to the orchestra alpheus who begrudged giving away anything was horrified no wonder baby had difficulty with tax bills meanwhile chloe and alpheus had worked out their schedule so that whenever neither of them was singing they could slope off to bed the ladies of the chorus also thought alpheus was yummy and whiled away long cold hours gazing at him predominantly middleaged given to baggy jerseys and straining leggings they were of little interest to alpheus one member of the chorus however gloria prescott rose like venus from the permanent waves and was nicknamed pushy galore because she always pushed her way to the front nodding gesticulating shaking her blonde ringleted head and overacting to catch the directors or conductors eye she also sucked up to dame hermione ay am such a fan so hermione befriended pushy to infuriate chloe alpheus rannaldini sexton sylvestre and mikhail had all clocked pushy in return pushy whispered constantly in all their ears including tristans that her greatest role at music college had been elisabetta and wouldnt she be younger and prettier in the role than dame hermione one morning she was practising one of hermiones arias and hitting all the high notes perfectly when rannaldinis vulpine smile came round the door would you like me to accompany you my child then as he was tinkling away you see i am not such an ogre when i say thees or that ees bad it is because i have ears to ear the wrong things the chorus were not booked for the following day but rannaldini confided to pushy that he would specially like to send a limo for her tomorrow afternoon so she could hear the orchestra recording the overture that he himself had composed and then perhaps they could have tea at the ritz pushy was in heaven but if rannaldini was histrionic when he conducted verdi he was ten times more difficult when it came to his own music having reduced the orchestra to nervous wrecks in the rehearsal beforehand he started rowing with an increasingly demented tristan if you take it that fast yelled tristan the hunt will never have time to stream down the valley then they must stream queeker then you will lose magical flowing effect i must be faithful to my music first time bastards been faithful to anything muttered viking oneill the first horn i must be faithful to story shouted tristan ok we rehearse two ways queek then flowing rannaldini proceeded to take his overture at a breakneck speed his stick a blur and then at such a funereal pace that the strings ran out of bow the woodwind and the brass out of puff and all got screamed at again tristan nearly killed rannaldini so did serena when she saw the ringleted beribboned pushy galore at the back of the hall rannaldini said no outsiders she stormed sir roberto kaindly sent a limo for me simpered pushy tristan sat shaking in the control room his head in his hands quiet please we now record said rannaldini imperiously filling the musicians with such terror they could hardly pick up their instruments remember gentlemen this is for ever he then took his overture at a totally different lilting cantering tempo to which the orchestra had a mad struggle to readjust at the end there was utter silence gazing at their shoes waiting for the inevitable explosion his musicians didnt see the tears in rannaldinis eyes thank you gentlemen that was absolutely beautiful he said quietly you can have the rest of the afternoon off so he can take me to tea at the ritz thought pushy joyfully but ignoring pushy abandoning the gaping orchestra rannaldini bounded upstairs to the control room where for once serena had lost her cool you cannot waste an entire session she yelled as she met him in the doorway what about the introductions to the other acts but her tirade faltered as rannaldinis hand crept inside her purple jersey we shall go ome to your flat but jessie is there with nanny bratislava tell little jessie she must learn to call me uncle roberto the next drama to rock the recording was when rozzy pringle finally turned up to sing tebaldo elisabettas page a seventies beauty the doeeyed longlegged rozzy was so like celia johnson that everyone had wanted to have unbrief encounters with her she was much too old for the part but at least shed make hermione look young and she had a host of fans granny and rannaldini whod often worked with her admired her inordinately serena and alpheus had long collected her records on the other hand hermione disliked all other sopranos on principle and mikhail baby and chloe being from a younger generation scoffed that rozzy was past it tristan was livid with them enchanted at the prospect of working with one of his heroines he filled rozzys dressing room with spring flowers but when rozzy finally came through the door on a dank grey viciously cold morning he was appalled she looked old enough to be hermiones grandmother and was purple with cold to match the darned violet blazer she was wearing over her long flowered dress to combat the ageing hippie look she had curled up her hair but it had dropped in the fog and fell in lank straight tresses over her jutting collarbones everyone greeted her effusively to conceal their shock hi rozzy im such a fan said chloe clanking cheeks then ten seconds later to baby she must have lied about her age in whos who shell never see fifty again having thrust a beautifully wrapped present into tristans hand a little something because youre so kind to book me rozzy fled to the loo such a drag having rozzy pringle here stinking out the lav again grumbled hermione half an hour later as little christy foxe propelled her towards the microphone you have to move to mike four next to baby in bar fortyfive dame hermione he reminded her for the tenth time then consulting his score he said smiling at rozzy as she crept grey and shaking out of her dressing room you start off standing twelve feet from mike two then move up close to mike three mrs pringle dont worry tristan put his bomber jacket round rozzys trembling shoulders tebaldos just as petrified as you in this scene just make sure those opening hey theres really ring out rozzy baby and hermione were all in place their breath rising in white plumes as rannaldini swept in morning rozzy lovely to have you with us shall we catch up over a spot of lunch he called out eliciting scowls from serena pushy and hermione it was too early for the offstage band waiting in the bar to have got drunk seeing rannaldini raise his stick on the monitor viking oneill came in with the mournful fading sob of the departing hunting horn all is silent night approaches and the first star glitters on the horizon sang baby who worked the mike like a rock star now theyll eat their bitchy words thought tristan as rannaldini nodded smiling at rozzy but despite her anguished face and frenzied mouthings no hey theres came out rannaldini halted the orchestra rozzy sorry maestro from the top he raised his baton vikings horn then baby both hauntingly exquisite were followed by silence and a dreadful strangulated croak relax rozzy one two three called rannaldini rozzys heart was crashing the blood pumping through her veins but her throat was drier than the desert even after ten minutes of struggling all she could produce were scraping gasps tristan in the control room felt as if he was watching a dog whose vocal cords had been cut in the vivisection clinic trying to cry out as the surgeons knife went in by the time he had run down into the hall rannaldini had lost his temper how dare you call yourself a professional singer he was screaming youve let us all down reproached hermione as rozzy fled to her dressing room her body racked as much with coughing as with sobs rannaldini picked up the telephone to the control room who booked her for christs sake you and tristan did snapped serena were going to have to reschedule tebaldo was my favourite part at college piped up pushy rozzys present to tristan was a cushion green velvet on one side the other exquisitely embroidered with the words the lily in the valley tristan couldnt bear unhappiness leaving everyone fighting and baby and hermione to finish their duet he drove rozzy to harley street with his car heater turned up she had had a terrible christmas she revealed between sobs yelling at insolent stepchildren placating glyn her idle husband coping with his frightful mother who kept commiserating with him for being neglected by a wife who was always selfishly pursuing a career matters had not been helped when rozzy had nipped off on december to sing mimì in a cheap hungarian production to pay a tax bill before singing brünnhilde with laryngitis in athens three days later brünnhildes immolation scene had done for her why the fuck did you risk it tristan wanted to shout the throat specialist said rozzy had thoroughly overstrained her voice he couldnt promise that it would come back and she certainly couldnt sing in the recording seated in tristans car once more rozzy cried so hard that passersby swept down harley street by the north wind gazed in horror people will think i am womanbeater grumbled tristan and drove her to his flat overlooking regents park which glittered with hoar frost in the midday sun all round the walls of the sitting room were propped photographs of the cast i like to live with my characters explained tristan past and present said rozzy picking up a large photograph of claudine lauzerte in its own silver frame i wish i looked as good as that now wincing as she glanced in the mirror she wiped mascara from under her eyes people used to say claudine and i were a little alike a little tristan smiled as he handed her a vast bloody mary she looked half starved he couldnt have her blubbing all over a restaurant hed been too uptight himself to eat the chinese takeaway hed brought home last night perhaps he could heat it up for rozzy im sorry to be such a drip she said following him into the kitchen yesterday i discovered glyn had appropriated thirty thousand pounds id saved for my tax bill to subsidize some dodgy property deal hes also employed an incredibly pretty temporary housekeeper called sylvia at vast expense for the few days i was going to be away recording carlos this morning i took my motherinlaw gocat in her breakfast bowl instead of muesli rozzy started to cry again youre just overtired said tristan putting an arm round her shoulders i found my washing in the dishwasher this morning and my car keys in the fridge he let her run on as he got out the takeaway the waxy topping of orange fat looked disgusting i cant go home tonight rozzy was whispering to herself glynll think im spying on him and sylvia oh tristan what are we going to live on if i cant sing any more for once when his mobile rang tristan was relieved it was baby in ecstasy and having a large vodka because christy foxe whod been such a trooper had finally walked out he was fed up shunting hermione around explained baby rannaldini being so vile to rozzy was the final straw the brave little lad got up and sang the prisoners chorus from fidelio after hed gone he sent rannaldini a message on his bleeper saying stuff job up your ass rude letter to follow tristan started to laugh after christy walked out went on baby gleefully alpheus too vain to put on his glasses and too busy ogling pushy galore failed to read christys last pencil note on the score saying please move back here herd of elephant coming through so dame hermione ran slap into him hermione is now suing for a broken toe alpheus for a broken rib i think youd better find another pa tristan grinning and shaking his head tristan switched off his mobile were in luck you can stay on at the capital and take over christys job you know don carlos backwards and because youre wonderful at sewing that is most beautiful cushion i ever have when we go on location you can stop griselda the wardrobe mistress having nervous breakdown and to keep you on the cast list tristan chucked the takeaway cartons in the bin you can have the nonsinging role of the countess of aremberg all youll have to do is cry when the king sacks you and youre very good at that come on ill buy you lunch rozzy got to her feet unsteadily as he caught her before she fell tristan felt her desperate boniness you are the kindest person ive ever met she said in a choked voice sexton and serena however shook their heads at such unilateral brokering of a deal and rannaldini went ballistic at such prodigality a singers salary for a neurotic geriatric pa that night in revenge for alpheus ogling pushy chloe invited sylvestre tristans handsome blond sound engineer back to the capital and discovered he was as good at twiddling knobs in bed as out afterwards as they shared a bottle of dom pérignon on liberty productions sylvestre sighed that tristan was too kind for his own good we had location manager on lily in the valley so useless he couldnt find his own cock tristan called him into his caravan to sack him but he spent so much time listing his good points so as not to demoralize him that the guy came out three hours later convinced hed been promoted more seriously they were now without a page who in tristans new presentday version had become a bodyguard tebaldo is not a huge part but a vital one a larky little fellow usually played by a charming gamin pushy galore came forward immediately ringlets and ribbons flying she knew the part could she audition rannaldini sexton and alpheus were all keen give the young woman a chance urged hermione because she knew it would irritate chloe who longed secretly to be admired and promoted by hermione serena however wanted to kick in pushys buck teeth because she was always making eyes at rannaldini and tristan thought her ghastly and far too refined to play a bodyguard the argument was at full throttle in the control room when viking wandered in despite their earlier differences he had played like an angel throughout the sessions and he and rannaldini had achieved a grudging if transient respect heres one soprano who isnt working at the moment he chucked a photograph on the table the girl wore an ivory silk shift she had a shiny dark red bob pale gold skin sprinkled with freckles like a tiger lily and cool watchful green eyes viking put a tape in the machine her voice was of such piercing distinctive sweetness that tristan had to hear only a few bars bravo viking who is she flora seymour shes georgie maguires daughter so its in the genes she played the viola in my old orchestra but trained as a singer as well shes got the most angelic voice in the world give me her telephone number said tristan he met a lot of opposition serena hermione and chloe all thought flora was a tramp probably because shed had affaires with both rannaldini and viking and because theyd all three had designs in the past on the filthy rich if slightly shady george hungerford with whom flora was now living rannaldini didnt want any advice from viking and hed fallen out badly with flora but he doted on her voice which had never been properly exploited he was enough of a mischiefmaker as well to see the potential for avenging himself on floras lover george hungerford who as managing director of the rutminster symphony orchestra had foiled rannaldinis takeover bid and who as a developer was also threatening to slap a motorway through valhalla sexton who was watching the mounting costs in horror was in favour because flora sounded cheap how dyou know her so well asked tristan i was once hopelessly in love with her said viking answering his mobile he wandered out of earshot to speak to his new wife abby darling i love you too ive also been matchmaking he lowered his voice ive posted tristan de montigny down to rutminster hall to see flora flora sat naked on the white shagpile drying her hair in the long gilt bedroom mirror she could see three moles on her inside thigh and soft red pubic hair still damp from the bath her small freckled breast rose every time she lifted her arm but her two spare tyres didnt shift schillers don carlos was now open between legs grown far too chunky to play a pageboy poncing about in white tights she mustnt get too engrossed in the story or shed forget her hair and the sleek bob would shoot upwards like an explosion in a mattress factory a hundred eyes are hired she read surrounded by georges guards who watched her every move flora identified with carlos then she looked up at georges photograph on her dressingtable croppedhaired squarejawed dark brown turneddown eyes mouth set like a steel trap in the harvey smithjohn prescott rough tough north country mould himself against the world only flora knew how sensitive and kind george was behind the façade but he was terribly possessive having screwed up his first marriage because he was a workaholic george had taken the autumn off to cement his relationship with flora but had returned to work because mega property companies and orchestras dont run themselves most of his time was spent in germany flora wanted to travel with him but she couldnt bear to be parted from trevor her little black and tan terrier who was now asleep with a red ball in his mouth on the vast oval bed whose headboard hummed with every dial when she was away trevor wouldnt eat and neither he nor she would survive quarantine so she stayed behind and missed george dreadfully flora was also lonely because her great friend marcus campbellblack having won the appleton was now blissful in moscow with alexei nemerovsky and her other friend abigail rosen was having a baby and blissfully happy married to viking abby a maternity dress hiding a nonexistent bulge had recently driven down for the day and chided flora for putting on weight youve never been an achiever flora you never really concentrated on your singing career and youve never stuck to a diet too right flora agreed gloomily im the one who should be wearing the maternity dress george is an incredibly attractive man went on abby if youre going to keep him you mustnt let yourself go floras hair was dry now thick as the shagpile inside snow was growing on the windowledge tomorrow she and trevor would build a snowdog as she reached for her glass of champagne trevor flew off the bed rushing downstairs in a frenzy of excited barking outside flora could see the lights of rannaldinis helicopter bringing tristan from london trevor had mistaken it for georges the heat of the hairdryer had removed any need for blusher ringing her eyes with brown liner flora wriggled into a pair of black jeans covered the flesh that spilled over the waistband with one of georges evening shirts squirted on coco chanel and belted downstairs the frenchman who came through the front door with snowflakes in his hair was so handsome and so near flora in age that she promptly had another glass of champagne on an empty stomach out of shyness tristan however noticed a schubert quintet in which he had often played the cello part on the music stand in the drawing room and they were off chattering dixneuf to the dozen tristan was only too happy to tell flora all about tabs wedding because it gave him an excuse to talk about tab shes the most beautiful thing i ever saw confessed flora but crazy like a fox and so volatile it must be like being married to mount vesuvius i gather rupert pulled out of don carlos as a result tabs wedding took them down one bottle then they moved on to the recording as floras parents lived in paradise valley next to rannaldini and hermione and she knew chloe serena and meredith too the gossip on that took them most of the way down another tristan whod noticed all the burglar alarms and the grilles on the windows thought rutminster hall was ghastly but improved by georges rottweilers stretched out in front of the fire by the time theyd finished the second bottle hed ceased to worry about all the guards where are you filming she asked as they tottered in to dinner valhalla then i cant do it george would never allow it squeaked flora in horror then shut up because two of georges guards were serving steak and kidney pie and pouring a matchless margaux after theyd shut the door flora told tristan how strapped george was for cash he owes the germans about forty million in bridging loans if it were me id never sleep again if id taken the part i could have helped out with a few bills but truly im too fat ive got a treble chin although most trebles dont have chins like mine tristan laughed he thought flora utterly ravishing and said there would be masses of time for her to lose any weight before filming started at the end of march but i havent got pages legs as its in modern dress tebaldos become one of those handsome detectives princess diana and princess anne seemed to get so close to so your perfectly ok legs will be hidden by trousers but the main drawback went on flora god i hope this room isnt bugged is working with rannaldini george is insanely jealous and has never forgiven rannaldini for beating me up and trying to rape me last august i promise you its true she added seeing tristans look of horror rannaldini wanted me to stay the night with him after singing in the creation but i bolted back to george then after a large glass of armagnac she said ill do it if george says its ok and if i can bring trevor perhaps he could wear lifts and audition for one of philip iis wolfhounds trevor wagged his stumpy tail approvingly as soon as tristan left flora rang germany george was dreadfully torn he felt sick at the thought of flora working with rannaldini again and neither did he want her anywhere near that impossibly glamorous tristan de montigny exuding crosschannel pheromones but he couldnt stand in her way youd never forgive me or yourself if you turned down the break of a lifetime youre the break of my lifetime sobbed flora who half wanted george to forbid her nothing will ever be as wonderful as falling in love with you the moment she rang off george regretted it flora would have other chances and he didnt trust rannaldini but when he rang back the number was engaged even though it was two oclock in the morning she was obviously speaking to tristan accepting the part george only just stopped himself ringing all the other numbers in the house three hours later flora was slumped at the kitchen table finishing don carlos and a large tub of banana and yoghurt ice cream when she saw more fireflies dancing in the window having made a detour to the other side of rutminster to drop some roman coins into the excavations of a rival to prevent him getting planning permission from english heritage george had landed his helicopter outside the kitchen as flora followed by a sleepy trevor ran across the snowy lawn into his arms george said ive got a meeting at nine in düsseldorf i can only stay an hour lets spend every second of it in bed said flora dragging him upstairs in fact george was angelic a fine bass himself he returned the following evening to help her learn the part flora also received a call from sexton were writing into your contract a clause to say you mustnt fall pregnant before the end of filming cant ave a private dick in the club before her first recording flora spent the night with abby and viking who had practically to drug and drag her screaming into his car to get her to wallsend town hall which had grown even colder the icicles outside even longer the rednosed chorus in their overcoats looked like carol singers flora was supposed to take over where rozzy had not started in the forest of fontainebleau with hermione and baby but as a dreadful anticlimax hermione had just rung in for the second day running saying that the broken toe shed sustained in her collision with alpheus was much worse tristan was so angry for flora that he drove much too fast over icy roads back into london to the lanesborough thundering on the door of hermiones suite he was admitted by her excited pa hearing shrieks of agony he thought he had misjudged his leading lady but barging into her bedroom found her having her legs waxed to hermiones fury he immediately insisted she and one hairy leg return with him to wallsend flora meanwhile had been immensely comforted to find a goodluck card in her dressing room from serenas new pa rozzy pringle she was attempting to get her trembling lips round a few arpeggios when rozzy herself rushed in with a mug of hot ribena hello my poor lamb you mustnt be frightened youve got such a lovely voice ive studied the role so if you need any help i have to confess rozzy went on as she hung floras blue scarf on a hanger i was prepared to hate you because my husband glyn is so in love with your mother hes got all her records ill get him an advance copy of her next album promised flora were all huge fans of yours come and meet granville hastings said rozzy hes such a darling why are there so many people here muttered an aghast flora youve turned up on the worst possible day whispered back rozzy indignantly by constantly ignoring poor tristans schedule and pulling out people to sing as and when he felt like it rannaldinis created the most appalling backlog all the rest of the cast are here in case they have to do retakes poor tristan they found granny regaling an audience with chitchat my dear child welcome he put down his knitting to give flora a kiss where the hells rannaldini even the normally ebullient baby was uptight over all the hanging around having a poke i expect sighed granny he always poked the prettiest chorus girls at the garden bending them over the red velvet balcony of the royal box between rehearsals if anyone came by he used to pretend he was showing them round the operahouse granny rose still knitting and went into a sequence of languid pelvic thrusts down there ees the peet where my orchestra play thrust and zat is rostrum where i perform miracle thrust and zat is proscenium arch thrust when you ave feenish granville said a chilling voice the laughter died granny dropped several stitches dame ermione soldier in at least ave the courtesy not to keep her waiting rannaldini glared round anyone got a fishermans friend came hermiones pathetic bleat limping ostentatiously she joined baby and flora on the platform just like the teddy bears picnic hissed flora glaring at hermiones fulllength mink i assure you this will be no picnic hissed back baby rannaldini just had to stand there his cruel cold pale malevolent face was enough to give a performance its special edge he raised his stick vikings dying horn call floated out of the bar flora was so terrified she began loud and sharp it didnt take rannaldini long to put the boot in after the fifth take when shed finally got the notes right he said that was better flora but you are expected to act flora flushed but i thought dont said rannaldini crushingly you do not have the necessary equipment he added bitchily to be a singer you have to have a voice to be a musician you have to have a brain dont confuse the two there is a limited number of times you can ask a singer to repeat herself and get the words notes and acting right rannaldini exceeded it flora was also slimming and the rare perfect take was invariably wrecked by her rumbling tummy this is hopeless yelled rannaldini calling a lunch break we will finish scene tomorrow the last day was even more tempestuous particularly when george hungerford rolled up with trevor floras terrier and sat at the back of the hall scowling at rannaldini flora got even more flustered particularly when trevor started howling at hermiones rather dubious top notes which reduced both chorus and cast to fits of laughter so master and dog were banished from the hall that nasty little dog is alas a critic said serena as she picked up the telephone in the control room to ring rannaldini on the rostrum dame hermione has lost her top where where said sexton looking round the control room in excitement her top notes you bloody idiot serena slammed down the receiver rannaldini decided to take a break and listen to the playback tristan bore george off for a cup of tea and a piece of shortbread for trevor smarmy frog even knows the name of my dog thought george ungratefully and then you can sit in the control room added tristan no he cant snapped serena whod nipped down to the canteen to grab a cup of tea and who hadnt forgiven george for choosing to live with flora rather than her our singers weaknesses and how we conceal them are entirely our secret weaknesses squawked hermione who having clocked rannaldinis preference for serena had been spoiling for a fight what weaknesses how dare you you patronizing hussy grabbing cups and saucers she started smashing them on the floor pull yourself together hermione said serena bossily my little jessie wouldnt behave like that appearing in the doorway rannaldini ducked to avoid a milk jug and frogmarched a screaming hermione off to her dressing room three minutes later he came out zipping up his flies shell be ok now but were going to have to drop in someone elses top notes whispered serena tristan decided to placate george with a large whisky instead and bore him off to find one flora is wonderful he said enthusiastically she is determined not to betray her panic to elisabetta but listen to the tension in her voice shes not having to act snarled george and whos that damn sight too goodlooking boy playing carlos baby spinosissimo hes sublime but extremely gay the ladies of the chorus who were not needed in the finale were drifting away pushys hard little heart was breaking as she knocked on rannaldinis door ayve just come to say goodbay maystro my dear can you keep a secret on pain of death of course lied pushy wriggling inside how would you like to sing dame hermiones top notes at last the recording was over tristan heaved a sigh of relief that rannaldini would now whizz off round the world out of their hair allowing himself serena and sylvestre to get on with the editing but to his horror rannaldini went nowhere hogging the edit suite putting his stamp on everything causing endless rows over which take was used twiddling knobs so some singers sounded less good and others better than they had at the recording granny getting to the end of his career needed careful editing hermione as rannaldinis mistress and more importantly because of their mutual record sales couldnt sound less than perfect sylvestre dropped in pushys top notes so noone could detect the join still disappointed that tristan hadnt made a move serena put it down to the fact that she had supported rannaldini on every artistic decision she had also reluctantly become very smitten with her italian stallion it was so sweet of rannaldini on the last day of editing because her involvement in the film was ended to invite her sylvestre and tristan back to his flat overlooking hyde park for a farewell dinner as serena was leaving to relieve the babysitter because it was nanny bratislavas night off she handed rannaldini a picture her daughter jessie had painted specially for her uncle roberto how charming of jessie rannaldini wiped away a tear and as he ushered serena into her minicab promised he would call her later bounding back into the house however he rolled up jessies picture plunged it into the drawingroom fire and lit his cigar with it what are you doing demanded tristan in horror now the recording is sewn up rannaldini inhaled happily i have no more need to ingratiate myself with little jessies mother there were more fireworks in march when members of the cast were issued with cassettes of themselves singing so they could learn the words to which they had to mime on location and time their movements to them then they discovered how much rannaldini had doctored the recording chloe was incensed by the cuts in the veil song and in don fatale rannaldini blithely blamed serena anyway those numbers dont add much to the plot my darling baby was outraged hed been so often drowned by hermione alpheus felt rannaldini had consistently favoured the orchestra and every other singer it was sacrilege to cut his great solo in act iv and his character didnt garner sufficient sympathy mikhail was so cross he rang up rannaldini in the middle of the night why did you not use my third and best take in death of posa because it was too slow said rannaldini coolly serena wanted to get acts four and five on to one cd for when the record comes out at this rate my billing will be so small and low down only snails and mice will be able to read it sighed granny whod also been savagely cut think of poor verdi snarled rannaldini he had to drop the entire first act of don carlos because the parisians couldnt get their last trains home and directors have been putting it back ever since said granny drily sylvestre the handsome french sound engineer felt hermiones performance had been so enhanced by subtle additions that he sent her her cassette with utter confidence in a frenzy hermione returned the tape by taxi shrieking down the telephone and threatening legal action you have rejected every single take i wanted and my top notes sound terrible sylvestre waited four days wrote to hermione saying hed laboured all round the clock on a new tape and sent her back the old one by return of post he received from hermione a letter which he framed saying you have worked miracles also included was an invitation to luncheon which lasted twentyfour hours there was great consternation when a hatchet job on the horrors of recording with rannaldini appeared in the sunday times written by little christy foxe as christy subsequently turned out to be rupert campbellblacks godson and the son of janey lloydfoxe a very dangerous columnist rannaldini and tristan wondered uneasily if this were the first round in ruperts war of attrition one of the secrets of rannaldinis success was that he knew when he had pushed those he needed too far immediately the editing was finished he suggested he tristan and meredith the set designer should recce the state rooms at buckingham palace rannaldini and meredith went back a long way they had done up numerous houses together without falling out aware that meredith had been the lover of hermiones charming husband bob harefield for fifteen years rannaldini had never outed them because he was fond of meredith and bob as orchestral manager of rannaldinis old orchestra the london met had made life incredibly easy for him neither rannaldini nor hermione on the other hand had made life easy for bob whod pretended he was far too stretched in australia setting up a new opera company to come home and organize don carlos for them meredith a hugely successful interior designer had turned down a mass of work to create the sets for don carlos but he intended to screw a vast fee out of liberty productions and although missing bob a great deal he was very excited about working with such an enchanting frenchman on the day of the proposed trip to the palace so many builders lorries and cars belonging to outraged planning officers were already whizzing in and out of valhalla that the fancy fish frozen foods van slipped through the gates unnoticed famed for his cheeky cheery manner which could sell shellfish à la king to a barmitzvah party terry the fancy fish rep had long had designs on valhalla particularly now rumours were spreading of a film crew rolling up at the end of march harriet bussage rannaldinis pa had tipped terry off that sir roberto was in rare residence on his way to make his pitch terry decided to pop into bussages cottage which nestled in a copse halfway up valhallas drive to deliver a cardboard box of sole véronique as a thankyou present loading up other boxes in case bussage was tempted to place an order terry never missed a sales opportunity he was just admiring the snowdrops and aconites in her little garden when he heard a male voice sepulchral and terrifying how dare you spell spinosissimo wrong followed by a great thwack and a shriek im sorry maestro it was a womans voice now quavering pleading please dont hurt me how dare you put a comma in that letter to lord gowrie when i dictated a semicolon intoned the mans voice more thwacks were followed by even more piercing shrieks punish me maestro im so sorry rushing to the rescue through the back door terry froze with shock a naked miss bussage was spreadeagled face down on the kitchen table with wrists and ankles strapped to each wooden leg beside her an equally naked rannaldini with an erection rivalling the tower of pisa was laying into her reddening but surprisingly trim bottom with a hunting whip watching them with indifference was a large fluffy white cat next moment sole véronique garlic king prawns not to mention jumbo crispy cod fingers destined for little cosmo went flying all over the kitchen and terry had fled it was the bleedin excitement on their faces fixed me he told his wife that evening five minutes later meredith and tristan having enjoyed a merry champagne brunch at the heavenly host bounced into bussages parlour to find rannaldini immaculate in a pinstripe suit and shocking pink tie autographing a pile of photographs helen said you were here giggled meredith the helicopters waiting what the hell did you do to that sweet fancy fish man hes just taken the side off tristans flash car booked in for a twohour trip round the state rooms which was all the time rannaldini could spare they lunched beforehand at greens in bury street over oysters lobster and sancerre they decided they needed ideas for the great hall which was going to be turned into philip iis bedroom they also required a set probably the summer drawing room into which philip summoned carlos from the polo field for a pep talk this was a duet composed by rannaldini so he didnt want a toospectacular décor to distract people from his music but they could go to town on the state room in which philip had his great political debate with posa which had only been written by verdi for this rannaldini had evil designs on helens blue living room arriving at the palace meredith commandeered the red guidebook thats the arch through which diplomats and heads of state enter he announced as they peered down into the pinkgravelled quadrangle her majesty lives on the opposite side said rannaldini pointing to a dark blue door why dont you give her a bell suggested meredith ask if we can pop in for a brandy you must have met her when she gave you your k and on many other occasions said rannaldini icily anyway he added looking up at the empty flagpole she is not in residence in george iv chose john nash to design a new palace read out meredith but he was hampered by a chronic lack of funds nash et moi i expect he gnashed his teeth rather like a child swinging between two parents meredith linked arms with tristan and rannaldini you will give me a decent budget wont you boys we cant stint on royalty oh look theyve got sky television lovely to think of that butch prince andrew watching all that golf tristan was gazing up at the lioncoloured columns of the ambassadors entrance the english stole the idea for that double portico from the louvre he grumbled they steal all our decent ideas well we won both of those meredith waved the guidebook at two panels celebrating the battles of trafalgar and waterloo so boo sucks weeth a little help from the germans said rannaldini crushingly now concentrate not now he snarled as a group of middleaged tourists tiptoed up reverently in the hope of an autograph meredith was disappointed the tour didnt include the ballroom youre only admitted announced rannaldini pompously if youre getting a decoration get you said meredith who was now busily sketching a grand staircase which unfurled like the frill round a golden wedding cake tristan lost in thought was admiring a lovely marble of a lurcher having a thorn removed from its paw by diana the huntress he must find a postcard to send to lucy latimer thank god hed booked her to do the makeup and to calm hermione and chloe when filming started there were dogs in every painting too which meant hed have to include lots in the film dogs he reflected wearily were almost more of a nuisance than children this is the green room rannaldini paused on the threshold where one mingles before proceeding to the throne room to meet ones hosts how lucky we are to have you to initiate us said meredith gravely stop taking the pees you little popinjay said rannaldini how about this décor for one of the drawing rooms no good for your colouring said meredith firmly greens awful with grey hair and a sallow complexion someone would spear you with a cocktail stick although we could drag the dungeons this colour to cast a sickly glow on poor doomed posa tristan kept having to hide his laughter by examining paintings this is how i want room where posa defies philip said rannaldini as he hustled them into the throne room which was the length of a cricket pitch the crimson silk walls were lined with gold sofas huge cutglass chandeliers glittered from the ceiling like a fleet of jack frosts air balloons the ceilings at valhalla are too low for chandeliers protested meredith then raise them said rannaldini imperiously through an arch flanked by whitewinged genii holding gold paper chains burgundy red steps led up to two crimson thrones embroidered with the initials eiir and p we must reproduce those for elisabetta and philip ii said tristan in excitement and keep them permanently at valhalla after filmings over giggled meredith we can unpick the e and p and change it to r for rannaldini and h for hermione or helen or harriet bussage he added slyly depending on whos in favour rannaldini allowed himself a chill smile but he could only think of a throne initialled t with naked tabitha sprawled on its faded damask waiting for him to mount the burgundy red steps and her in every room there were beautiful clocks depicting heroic scenes how slowly the minutes must have ticked by for the young princess diana thought tristan and for carlos and elisabetta how dyou cure a broken heart in a gilded cage particularly when every ravishing piece of sèvres showed idyllic scenes of young shepherds and shepherdesses in love i want a scrolled codpiece for christmas said meredith bringing everyone back to earth her majesty enters the throne room through that emergency exit murmured an official whod recognized rannaldini so she doesnt have to walk through a lot of rooms thats nice piped up meredith so she can always retreat down the backstairs for a squirt of diorissimo half the biglooking glasses confided the official despite being covered with gilt patterns of leaves and flowers are actually hidden secret doors rannaldinis eyes gleamed how perfect for the toing and froing of lovers and inquisition spies often the same thing in don carlos and for himself who liked to vanish like the cheshire cat they had reached the great spine of the state rooms the picture gallery mostly dutch and flemish masters tristan was enraptured and went into a flurry of ohmondieus particularly over rembrandts old shipbuilder and his wife whose faces were luminous with affection and inner light if only lucy could make the faces of his cast glow like that too much enthusiasm for anything other than himself unnerved rannaldini who whisked them past each masterpiece only pausing to admire guidos terrifying painting of cleopatra being bitten by the asp étienne had been the same thought tristan with a pang as a child he had never been given time to linger over a painting christ healing the paralytic consulting the guidebook meredith paused before a large oil he ought to have a go at tabitha lovell is she still drinking tristan tried not to sound interested buckets sighed meredith shell give birth to a little pickled walnut at this rate this is the best picture in the room a goodlooking official drew their attention to charles i astride a fine grey horse his eyes really follow one round the room so would mine given the chance said meredith admiringly this is the blue room purred rannaldini where one gathers for drinks before grand diplomatic occasions this is it glorious squeaked meredith whipping out his notebook and scribbling frantically corinthian pillars the colour of harrogate toffee seablue flocked wallpaper masses of gold framing the mirrors and ceiling pale turquoise sofas perfect for the summer drawing room and philips pep talk to carlos diluting the gilded splendour through floorlength windows green lawns could be seen sweeping down to a lake surrounded by willows im going to scrap my fences and flowerbeds and sweep down to my lake rannaldini was thinking aloud take a lot of mowing chided meredith teddy brimscombe would give notice and noone else would put up with you i like this vermilion he mused as they moved into the music room like a winter sunset and incredibly flattering to your colouring rannaldini smoothed his hair complacently but the smile was wiped off his face when tristan was suddenly mobbed by a party of french tourists demanding his autograph taking pictures and asking after claudine lauzerte outraged to lose the limelight for a second rannaldini dived under the red rope and played god save the queen on the music room piano guides blanched security men with walkietalkies rushed in the french tourists melting away from tristan cheered and clapped as they recognized rannaldini i couldnt reseest it thats ok sir roberto their last port of call was the white drawing room which took all their breath away this is answer for the great hall exclaimed rannaldini then for philips debate with posa we can restore our blue living room to its former glory with reds and crimsons isnt that the room helen just redecorated said an aghast tristan yes poor darling agreed meredith we tried a hundred coats before we got the right blue but this gilt and white is to die for and theres darling queen alexandra over the chimneypiece she was as good about fat edwards philandering as helen is about yours rannaldini so we might placate her with a new portrait over the fireplace meredith does get away with murder thought tristan as they trooped down the staircase out in the sunshine rannaldini stalked off to the palace shop we must take sexton a present said tristan as he and meredith panted after him he was so heartbroken he wasnt allowed to join us hed have wanted chandeliers in the larder said meredith sensibly get him a box of royal fudge mocked rannaldini who had bought a mug for tabitha and crested teabags for helen and bussage ill get him postcards of all the interiors so he can pretend hes been said meredith out in the street rannaldini announced he must leave them it is isas birthday i got tickets for riverdance sadly isa cry off rannaldini looked delighted i hope tabitha wont be too bored with just her old stepfather dear boy he turned to tristan who for one miraculous moment thought rannaldini was going to ask him to take isas place but with an evil smile as if he could read tristans mind rannaldini merely thanked him for sparing the time my god giggled meredith as clive rannaldinis henchman glided up in the most flamboyant orange sports car a lamborghini diablo boasted rannaldini a beautiful girl deserve evening out in a beautiful new car as clive slid across into the passenger seat rannaldini took the wheel and roared off towards hyde park corner silly old ponce went on meredith talk about mutton dressed as lamborghini then seeing the desolation on tristans face dont tangle with that nest of vipers baby boy at first tab had tried so hard to make her marriage work giving up booze and fags for the sake of the baby keeping tidy the charming cottage rannaldini had lent her cooking admittedly pretty disgusting meals but isa was used to a clockwork mother and a clockwork mistress martie in australia whod both provided uncritical admiration clean shirts tea on the table and an impeccable answering service he was also as driven as tristan and didnt want to be distracted by jealous tantrums or grumbles about burst pipes he was away most days raceriding or at his fathers yard where it was made quite plain jake didnt want tab anywhere near his horses so gradually she drifted into drinking one sunday when isa had gone over to see jake she had downed half a bottle of vodka before starting on the ironing trying to watch champions on television at the same time she singed the colours of a very important owner isa could curse in romany for over five minutes and proceeded to do so on the way home hed stopped at the garage to buy christmas cards for all his owners you cant send those said tab in horror theyre all spangly and its horrendously naff to say seasons greetings dont be fucking stupid snapped isa and handed her a fiver heres the stamp money make sure you post them tomorrow whats for supper hell i forgot ill ring for a pizza or we could go to the heavenly host we cant afford it and the row escalated the following night isa arrived home late to find tab had gone out clubbing in rutminster and things went from bad to worse isa was so cool silent and withdrawn tab so upfront and tempestuous she felt like a tidal wave hurling itself against the sea wall physical passion had drawn them together but the doctor had insisted on no intercourse for the first three months its all right bleated tab who was terrified isa might find a replacement from all those groupies mobbing him on the racecourse ill go down on you but when she tried she retched all over him and the bedclothes she was suffering from morning noon and night sickness her hormones were all to pieces and she was paranoid about everything snapping isas head off one moment in floods of tears the next isa was sympathetic until he saw the overflowing ashtrays and plummeting vodka bottles hasnt the doctor told you to give up he said cut down because it would cause me and baby rupert too much stress if i stopped completely dont call it fucking rupert tidy by nature isa was driven crackers by tab pinching his jerseys socks razors and ck one his precious aftershave as she drank more she forgot more to put out milk bottles and dustbins but worse still for a jockeys wife she forgot telephone messages isa started putting all calls through his mobile and his bleeper which made tab even more paranoid about other women at christmas everyone made an effort as their daughter darklis was in south africa tory persuaded jake to let her invite isa and tab to stay the old mill which tory had been given by her rich grandmother was big rambling and totally horseorientated the only paintings on the walls were of jake or isas horses or of their various sporting achievements there were scant carpets on the wooden floors all the sofas and armchairs needed upholstering nor were the lovells into central heating outside were days of extraordinary beauty and bitter cold the chill factor because of the east wind from siberia was minus and produced wonderful sunsets and sunrises rose pink on the horizon above snowy fields traditionally in racing yards the grooms have christmas day off it was a matter of pride for jake to do the horses with isa just to show everyone that polio hadnt got the better of him outside he noticed the wind had scattered ivymantled branches all over the fields clearing out the dead wood like me he thought with a shiver the only way he could relieve his painracked leg and back was to soak in a boiling bath but he returned home to find tab had used all the hot water he found her in the kitchen hugging the aga clean pale hair flopping over her ashen face her long turquoise eyes angry and bloodshot exactly like her father thought jake savagely and as capable of causing havoc poor tory attempting to cook christmas dinner for the family and the grooms was also trying to get to know her daughterinlaw i have no idea how to change a nappy tab was saying disdainfully they use velcro now its as easy as putting a bandage on a horse said tory encouragingly picking up jakes hatred tab escaped to pack her presents stopping on the way upstairs to pinch torys sellotape and a pile of newspapers because shed forgotten to buy wrapping paper the whole thing took ages because she kept stopping to read there was a huge piece in the telegraph colour mag about eventing stars destined for the next olympics tab was not even mentioned which made her feel more of a failure than ever turning to the sunday times she found a lovely picture of rupert and a piece saying how well he was doing tearing it out she fought back the tears the blue sky outside reminded her not of marys robes but of ruperts eyes the bells pealed far more sweetly at penscombe remembering the mountains of presents the banks of holly the huge fires taggies goose her parsnip purée and the brandy round the christmas pudding which flamed longer than the great fire of london tab forgot the earthshattering rows with which she and rupert had disrupted the entire household the last one had been because rupert had only bought her a golf gti convertible for christmas instead of paying forty thousand for the engineer for which rannaldini had forked out later in the year when hed married her mother god she had taken her wonderful family for granted cant you ever forget about being a bloody campbellblack isa had walked in and caught sight of the piece in her hand sharon stretched out on the bed scattered receipts as she waved her tail have you been ransacking my mothers tights drawer hardly be tight on me snapped tab shed got so thin she could jump through the hoop of the sellotape hanging from the bedside table i was looking for a thick jersey she went on which one certainly needs in this house the only thing i could find was ponds vanishing cream your mother could start by using it on her hips she thought isa was going to hit her you been drinking of course not i promised isa wasnt sure like most drinkers tab went through three stages clinging and filled with anxiety when she woke up incredibly cheery after the first few slugs then punchy and belligerent when she was coming down it looked as though shed reached the third stage but he didnt want to upset his mother so he asked if tab would come downstairs to open the presents the gritters are out he added gazing at the lights flashing along the horizon were in for a hard night people use them on their teeth round here the lovells were frugal short of money and had allotted one present to each person tory had gone to a lot of trouble to track down an early history of eventing in a secondhandbook shop for tab isa had rather pointedly given tab some scent called quercus so she wouldnt nick his ck one any more and a rather ugly gold locket im going to put your picture in one side said tab hugging him and sharon and the engineer in the other used to penscombe prodigality where everyone received presents from every dog horse and human and in anticipation of a fat christmas cheque from rannaldini tab had rolled up with a crate of champagne and a side of smoked salmon for the lovells her individual presents were less successful and all wrongly labelled tory opened a red fishnet stocking of dog treats destined for sharon then some boxer shorts sorry theyre meant for isa although i suppose sharon could wear them if she was a boxer not a labrador isa thinking of their bank account grew increasingly tightlipped as he opened a silvertopped whip two beautiful dark blue cashmere jerseys because im always nicking yours and a camera when hed already got four tab herself was desperately disappointed to have nothing from rupert and even more worryingly no fat cheque from rannaldini instead he and helen had given her a royal blue vase edged with gold and decorated with a pastoral scene very pretty said tory except bussage picked it up at a car oldboot sale said tab furiously she was most excited about the present shed got for jake and tory she had taken a photograph of their ancient lurcher beetle from isas photograph album and commissioned daisy francelynch a friend of ruperts to paint from it an exquisite miniature to her horror jake merely grunted and put it face down on the table why are your parents so ungrateful sobbed tab as she watched isa changing for dinner thinking how ravishingly a dark suit became his wild black hair and pale gypsy face why dyou do things without asking me hissed isa beetle was the puppy my father bought for my mother as a peaceoffering because he loathed living with your mother and he wanted to come back to mum and hed heard her dog had been run over he found mum in hospital dying of a massive overdose because she couldnt live without him either they believe beetle was the talisman that saved mum and their marriage and you have to go and give them a flaming painting of her i didnt know i never thought sobbed tab you never do snarled isa reaching for his aftershave she must have been drinking to have wrongly wrapped up all those presents then he twigged as he realized he was slapping not ck one on his face but neat vodka dinner was bearable because there was plenty of wine tory had cooked a delicious turkey and as isa and tab were sitting at opposite ends of the table divided by the grooms noone realized they were not speaking to one another the telephone had rung constantly owners jockeys friends torys sister fenella from america darklis from south africa all called to wish the lovells happy christmas noone rang tab tory found the silver bachelors button in her christmas pudding which caused lots of laughter from silver charms in puddings the conversation moved on to superstitions one mustnt get married after sunset said a pretty redhead making eyes at isa and never eat your own wedding cake said her plump friend why not asked tab quickly anyone want any more christmas pudding cried tory desperately jake do shove round the white why not insisted tab even more of a chill than there was already fell over the room a marriage is supposed to be doomed if you marry after sunset said the pretty redhead with a shrug and the gypsies say if you taste your own wedding cake your child will die but i did both those things tab clutched her tummy in horror its only a silly old gypsys tale said tory in distress think of the times you see a single magpie and nothing awful happens a ringing telephone made everyone jump its your father tabitha said the head lad returning from answering the call tab streaked out of the room daddy oh daddy my darling leetle girl said rannaldini your mother sends love i just wanted to know how you are getting on as tab returned to the dining room hollow with desolation jake was making some dismissive crack about penscombe pride not winning the george vi tomorrow my fathers a far better horseman than either you or isa ever were screamed tab and fled upstairs where mistaking jake and torys room for the loo she regurgitated turkey and vodka all over their bed and passed out the next day isa and jake went off to kempton and tab who had no intention of getting to know her motherinlaw better made the excuse that she couldnt leave the engineer any longer and drove back to paradise it was lovely to come home to such a pretty place magpie cottage which was faded russet rather than black and white lay just across the valley from rannaldinis watchtower with a beech copse behind and a stream running down one side on the lawns back and front it was hard to tell where snow ended and snowdrops began tab loved magpie cottage but she grew nervous on her own sharon picked up the vibes and kept barking at the wind or imagined bangs which made tab more scared than ever taking a slug from the bottle of vodka shed bought in a pub on the way home she started brooding on the superstitions theyd discussed last night and then about one magpie for sorrow finding a paintbrush and some black paint in a kitchen cupboard she went out into the fading afternoon the sky was a pale silvery grey dotted with darker grey clouds and patches of gold on the horizon the snow was too powdery to make snowballs but had drifted beautifully sharp as a sharks fin against the garden wall sharon charged round the lawn raising spray like a skier as tab added an s to the board outside now it was magpies cottage two for joy im going to make my marriage work she told sharon and you can show everyone how good labradors are with babies the cold spell continued there was no racing which made isa very twitchy and cross because neither he nor jake were making any money the horses grew bored and restless pipes froze so tab whod forgotten to stop the milk bathed in it instead rupert beat the chill factor by taking taggie xav and bianca skiing tab ground her teeth over their photographs in the paper fighting hangovers and sickness she still staggered up to do the engineer every morning because she couldnt bear him to get closer to one of rannaldinis grooms than herself then she returned to the vodka which she found increasingly difficult to buy because she had no money several of her christmas cheques bounced before she discovered rannaldini had stopped her allowance as well isa doled her out pocket money for housekeeping but grudgingly it would be much more sensible he said for her to wheedle some serious dosh out of rannaldini which was why she had accepted the invitation to riverdance on isas birthday in january at the last moment isa had cried off in a rage tab had a maddening habit of always borrowing his jackets grabbing his puffa from the back of the bedroom door he had found all the christmas cards to his owners unstamped and unposted in the pocket which was why tab had a lone evening with an amused but utterly unyielding rannaldini isa is a successful jockey you have a charming free cottage and if you bothered to check you ungrateful child youd discover the sèvres vase i gave you for christmas was worth a few bob young people should make their own way he wouldnt even lend her a grand or two to appease isa and the bank manager the coupling of an alcoholic and a workaholic is not a happy one as isa worked endlessly to keep the show on the road and compensate for lack of support from tab he had less and less time to spend with her which lowered her confidence and made her drink more out of loneliness isa was so cool he fell asleep in the middle of a row and she could never tell behind that expressionless face what he was thinking in fact throughout that long hard cruel winter peppy koala the chestnut colt so charming so idle so uncompetitive had never been far from his thoughts he was just making plans in late february to fly out to australia when mr brown peppy koalas owner suddenly called him he was in england taking over some bristol electronics firm was isa free tomorrow evening mr brown also wanted to see jakes yard and having read about isas wedding in hello said hed sure like to shake hands with the new mrs lovell who looked a beaut so perhaps they could have dinner at isas place switching off his mobile isa looked round at magpie cottage god it was a tip the ravishing little chest of drawers taggie had given them for a wedding present was already covered in drink rings like a pond in a rainstorm knowing there was no way he could bring mr brown back here in its present state isa swallowed his pride and a large whisky and rang helen could he borrow mrs brimscombe betty and sally tomorrow morning to blitz the place then all tab had to do was collect some precooked food from waitrose and make herself look beautiful as luck would have it in lieu of payment one of isas owners had given him a brandnew jaguar xk which was being delivered to the cottage that afternoon if money ran out he could flog it for the meantime it would impress mr brown the threemonth ban on sex was now up but the cold war seemed to have set in too hard for isa to placate tab by making a move on her that night tab had stopped being sick but instead when she opened her mouth a stream of resentment came out on the morning of mr browns visit however she was full of good intentions no booze and wifely behaviour by midday a tightlipped mrs brimscombe and a giggling betty and sally had made the cottage look wonderful and set the table why dont you buy some daffies for that lovely blue vase suggested betty tab had been just off to waitrose when she went to isas chest of drawers to borrow a pair of socks rooting round under the lining paper she found a lovely laughing picture of martie his australian girlfriend hes still in love with her she thought in terror hes going to leave me when the telephone woke her it was dark isa wanted to know if everything was on course mr brown had been impressed with jakes yard theyd be back around six thirty what have you bought for supper its a surprise bleated tab shall i get red or white both i should think see you later whimpering with panic tab looked around her how could she have made such a mess an empty vodka bottle and fragments of the royal blue and gold vase rannaldini had given her for christmas littered the floor shed better go and buy the food for dinner then she could tidy the place and herself while it was heating up her car was out of petrol so she borrowed isas new jaguar god it was bliss to drive in no time she had reached waitrose and loaded up with a smokedsalmon mousse three packets of coronation chicken new potatoes readymade dressing and a pretty red and green bag of salad adding banana and yoghurt ice cream a brown loaf and runny brie she was off to the checkout counter piling on pedigree chum and whiskas on the way catering was so easy if you knew how she even ignored a great glacier of vodka bottles hurrah for tabitha the coper her undoing was a white tablecloth covered in glasses and a beaming salesman with a special offer of chilean chardonnay might as well have a slurp muttered tab as her trolley developed a mind of its own and veered boozewards a man in a flat cap and a green husky had had the same idea and was soon swilling away waggling his nose back and forth in the glass like a windscreen wiper remarkably good he said to tab it is she agreed smiling back at the salesman and a terrific bargain could i have another glass just to make sure what a lovely little hideyhole said mr brown as isa drew up outside magpie cottage look at those primroses im dying for a leak isas first thought was that his jaguar had been stolen the second that his mobile was ringing ignoring it he ran into the house chaos met his eyes charging into the downstairs loo he found no bog paper and no towel fuck tab the best he could do was a box of tissues from the kitchen which was also a tip with no sign of dinner and no flowers a fire was laid in the grate but unlit littering the floor were fragments of the sèvres vase and marties tornup photograph he had better answer his mobile are you the owner of car p hha isa had to think twice yes its been stolen were not sure sir its been abandoned across the gangway in waitroses car park obstructing the flow of traffic and the alarm is causing a disturbance noone can get inside the vehicle coming out of the lavatory flapping his hands mr brown was rather amused by the news my spouse is always locking herself out of her car and my teenage daughters never lift a finger in the house he was very happy to give isa a lift to waitrose hed seen photographs of tab in ok magazine on the flight over and was looking forward to meeting her even more they found tab and the man in the flat cap sitting in a little café halfway down a second bottle of chilean chardonnay not having driven isas car before she had no idea that it was his number being paged with increasing urgency this is hugh murrayscott she announced happily hes a friend of daddys where are my car keys snarled isa car keys as tab rootled through the pockets of her jeans mr brown and mr murrayscott admired her slender hips here they are now where did i put my trolley the final straw was when isa found his lovely new jaguar had been rammed by another car with a furious owner its only metal said mr brown soothingly dont blame the little lady he thought tabitha was wildly exciting im sorry you wont be able to enjoy any home cooking mumbled tab im not only off my trolley i seem to have lost it as well she ended up trying to write a cheque for the chardonnay with her toothbrush and mr brown swept them all off to the old bell for dinner despite isa hissing at tab to keep her fucking trap shut she and mr brown got on famously she was soon telling him about her olympic hopes for the engineer and he was telling her all about peppy koala prettiest little horse you ever saw if you brought him over to paradise he and the engineer could meet said tab whose eyes were sparkling at the sight of the bottle of moët arriving in an ice bucket arent you rather isolated in that little cottage asked mr brown im isalated giggled tab because my husband is always late home mr brown thought it a very funny joke isa wanted to throttle his wife but if he could stop her doing anything frightful mr browns obvious infatuation might just work to his advantage by the time they had all ordered lobster with moules marinières to start with mr brown was talking about when he brought peppy koala to england rather than if if you run him in the derby this year isa was saying hell get a sevenpound allowance because as a southern hemisphere horse hell be so much younger than the others tab sloped off to the ladies on the way wondering whether to pack in a quick vodka at the bar she caught sight of a tank of lobsters she hadnt realized they werent born red black already in mourning they waited helplessly their claws tied together with elastic bands to stop them killing each other so that they could be boiled alive and intact tab was so distraught she upended a nearby ice bucket on the floor scooped up as many lobsters as it would hold and fled into the street outside in her thin jersey and jeans the cold hit her like a left hook if she could reach the sea she could set them free isa and mr brown caught up with her on rutminster bridge crying hysterically trying to hitch a lift when isa tried to snatch back the bucket she emptied the lobsters into the river although the young lady was a handful mr brown admired her spirit and was horrified by the way isa tore into her dont you understand you stupid bitch they cant survive in fresh water like me sobbed tab i cant survive in the wrong marriage any more after a week of cold war isa flew to australia on the pretext of winding up the yard he had started with martie as march came in bringing days of torrential rain and flooding tab died of every kind of jealousy looking out listlessly one morning she noticed the sun had broken through the stream that flowed past the cottage had also broken away from its course into lots of smaller streams glittering like a crystal lustre as they danced down the valley to join the river fleet were free to make our own way in the sunshine they seemed to sing to tab your future godmother lucy wont like it little rupert tab told the baby inside her but you and i are going hunting tab had always hunted until lucy had persuaded her it was cruel but so many foxes escaped and a ropy old pack like the rutminster ramblers never caught anything anyway and the poor engineer was so bored of dressage it would pep him up to have a day out gold catkins lit up the valley like tiffany lamps as the engineer floated over the fences tab had never been more conscious of owning an olympic horse she was so enjoying herself she didnt notice a strand of wire next moment the engineer turned over on top of her it didnt hurt at first she was conscious only of her white breeches turning red with blood and screaming the baby please save the baby before she passed out by the time isa had flown home at vast expense mother and horse were doing well but little rupert had died tab was utterly devastated sobbing and sinking into despair isa who loved children was determined not to show he was equally devastated he never reproached tab because he knew in his heart that it had been his fault he had longed to take her in his arms but such was his loathing of the campbellblacks he couldnt convince himself he hadnt unleashed some gypsy curse instead he had gone to cheltenham won a big race on a horse of babys and not come home that night rannaldini delighted at the turn of events had been playing iago clive who had let himself into magpie cottage with rannaldinis master key had been responsible for putting marties photo in isas sock drawer he also tipped off rannaldini when isa was away enabling him to ring tab and drip poison into her ear isa is finding it so difficult to break with martie she was so capable and they were together seven years and he is seven years older than you which was vilely hypocritical of rannaldini who was intending to move in despite being nearly thirty years older than tab himself he would play the same game with isa telling him how wild tab was how young and unstable how late coming home how not always alone how fond of the bottle subtly slowly treacherously the same shoulder rannaldini was providing for them both to cry on was the wedge he was driving between them he encouraged tab to use his indoor school and have a crosscountry course built on the estate her suspension would be up in august in time for gatcombe but he still hadnt given her any allowance let her beg for it the national hunt season was nearly over isas winnings were shoring up jakes yard so money would grow even tighter playing his usual cool waiting game isa had not pestered mr brown about peppy koala finally mr brown rang him im dead choked your little tabitha lost the baby how is she pretty depressed not surprising the way you treat her if you cant be nice to a pretty lady like that how can i trust you with my little horsy thats crazy said isa sharply noone fusses over horses like my father where were you thinking of sending him well sir roberto rannaldinis offered me so much dosh i nearly sold to him but in case peppys that good im giving him to your other fatherinlaw rupert campbellblack if isa couldnt blame tab for losing the baby he could and certainly did for the loss of peppy koala the following day rannaldini and a suicidal tab rode round paradise a big red sun was disappearing into the mist like the brake light of apollos chariot putting a pink rinse on the bare trees and a rose flush along the horizon conscious that they were about to be invaded by far more famous singers robins and blackbirds were carolling their heads off ive had some lovely letters about the baby muttered tab from lucy in belgium meredith mr brown and even from that glamorous french director you invited to our wedding he sent me a lovely poem about little rupert really existing and being a plant of light for a second her stony little face softened that one would have to be knocked on the head very quickly thought rannaldini mrs brimscombe told isa how sorry she was about the baby he said idly isa said at least its given tab something new to grumble about the bastard gasped tab i suggested you get a parttime job and what did isa say as the sun sank all the birds that had been singing so madly went silent as the glow in the west became an orange fire rannaldini noticed a little adolescent moon turning her slim back on such ostentation she reminded him of tabitha he said you were unemployable god hes a shit you wait till the bloody bans lifted well show him thats how i wanted you to react said rannaldini silkily as he moved his horse close to the engineer his hypnotic black eyes were level with tabs perhaps he had such an impact on women she thought because he was small enough to dazzle them like a lowangled winter sun filming starts the week after next he announced id like to offer you a job on don carlos as mistress of the horse he added sententiously sounds perverse as well as hunting war scenes and polo during the overture horses will be needed for philips coronation and tristan might want to film carlos and posa galloping across country we need someone to organize it well pay you a very good fee wont people think it a bit odd you hiring a totally inexperienced member of your wifes family not in the least tristan has already signed up his delectable niece simone to handle continuity can the engineer have a part a starring role then ill do it she was flaming well going to show isa and rupert that she could do her bit for the marriage what rannaldini did not tell tab was that also joining the crew as second assistant director and as hellbent on proving himself was his eldest son wolfgang this had come about because rannaldini wildly jealous of ruperts rapprochement with marcus and closeness to xavier wanted his son back and had ordered sexton to employ him the twentyfouryearold wolfgang who had just gained an excellent law degree in germany had agreed to work on don carlos as a filler before taking up a plum job in berlin he had not been back to valhalla for six years ever since rannaldini had pinched from him his beloved flora seymour who was then a sixteenyearold schoolgirl highly if somewhat rigidly intelligent wolfgang had read schiller in the original and parallels between the cold tyrannical philip stealing elisabetta from his son carlos were not lost on him now a jackbooting eurocrat with a slimline briefcase and narrowed eyes wolfgang was determined not to let rannaldini bully him his job would be to run errands keep the chorus in order and yank singers out of their dressing rooms which in turn would give plenty of opportunity for bullying i am completely over flora wolfgang told himself firmly and repeatedly as he hurtled down the m the only car that overtook him was a red ferrari glancing right as it shot past wolfie nearly rammed the car in front for in the passenger seat yacking her head off to a beautiful boy instantly recognizable as the tenor playing carlos was flora in person wolfie had to pull into membury service station to recover i am not over her he told himself bleakly unaware of the havoc she had just caused flora was much too busy worrying about tomorrows filming you just have to hit the mark and mime to your own voice said baby soothingly itll be a doddle i promise you hey doddle doddle im sure its going to be more difficult than any of us think theres bound to be a voice coach around to bring us in god i could murder a burger lets stop at that little chef you mustnt you look fantastic adonis carlos after a week at champneys baby had lost his double chin and his gut i can wear all my jackets as wraparounds like the queen mother he crowed and i adored being whipped by all that seaweed flora gazed gloomily at the yellowing verges it hadnt rained for weeks the motorway was littered with furry corpses desperate to reach the river crows hung overhead like vultures george and i were so miserable at the prospect of being separated she sighed we had a stupid row last night and slept back to back loathing each other we were just making up when trevor barked hysterically at some nonexistent burglar by the time id defied george and let trev out and in the mood was broken and trev doesnt give a stuff she added as the little dog raced back and forth along the top of the back seat yapping furiously at dogs in other cars and thats the precious life blood of a master spirit youve just devoured she said reproachfully as she retrieved a chewedup copy of captain corellis mandolin from the back seat thats a nice ring said baby admiring the row of coloured stones on her left hand its called a regard ring victorian men gave it to their sweethearts if they were separated as a token of their regard george gave it to me before we started rowing last night she added dolefully you are entering the misnamed valley of paradise she intoned half an hour later from the south side they realized the immensity of the operation opposite lay the great abbey of valhalla as grey and brooding as the clouds hanging over it around it all over rannaldinis parkland like a huge circus sprawled lorries caravans tents a mobile canteen portaloos and vast generators god its a creepy place flora shivered rannaldini is rumoured to have a torture chamber under the house its safer to walk round brixton after dark my parents live there she pointed to a large georgian house on the right of valhalla and thats dame hermiones shack further down the valley golly the rivers low and up that little lane to the left is magpie cottage where isa and tab clearly arent going to fifteen rounds spoilt brat said baby dismissively takes one to know one chided flora dyou fancy tristan i certainly do dont you one cant not hes so holy grailish and separate and so sad behind all that charm dyou think hes gay hope so but at least weve got three months to find out shall we have a quickie in the pearly gates no said flora firmly weve got to behave valhalla swarmed with technicians everyone obsessed with his own agenda meredith determined to produce the most memorable sets whisked about trailing comely chippies who could transform a dog kennel into aladdins cave in twentyfour hours not only had they ripped apart the great hall and the two drawing rooms but also the dining room the entrance hall and rannaldinis study and bedroom too tristan was outraged and having a shouting match with meredith as baby and flora arrived those other rooms were not on the budget they might just get into shot said meredith blithely rannaldini didnt want to risk it i love it when you act masterful tristan stormed off as meredith turned to baby and flora my dears its all too exciting and wait till you see tristans boys theyre so glamorous he must be gay tristans boys the crew mostly french were indeed a glamorous bunch they all seemed to have skiing tans and lean jaws rapidly being hidden by beards so they wouldnt have to shave when they dragged themselves out of bed at the crack of dawn totally professional they had already checked and tested their equipment for the first shoot day making sure that lights and sound gear were in working order and camera and lenses properly calibrated poised to grumble at everything anglais and to blow gauloise smoke in the face of any singer who played up they were also acting bolshie because most of them hadnt been invited to rannaldinis smart dinner party that evening those who had included the wonderfully languid director of photography known as oscar because hed won so many oscars and because with his floating scarves dark hair flopping from a middle parting and endlessly assessing heavylidded eyes he was a dead ringer for oscar wilde oscar seldom went near a camera he appeared to sleep most of the day but was paid five thousand pounds a week to make sure that the sets and the singers were beautifully lit despite his effete appearance he was a doting family man who spent his time on location when he wasnt asleep talking to valentin his handsome soninlaw the camera operator who earned two thousand a week they had arrived with several crates of claret and intended to escape home to paris on every possible occasion sylvestre tristans sound recordist whod already sampled the don carlos wares during the recording said little because he was always so busy listening sylvestres aim on location was to pull the delectable simone de montigny who was in charge of continuity much of simones energy would go into proving she had not been booked to work on don carlos because she was tristans niece the daughter of tristans eldest brother alexandre the judge she was in fact just two years younger than tristan having caught a glimpse of wolfgang rannaldini she knew exactly who she wanted to pull on location and then there was lucy latimer whod been working in brussels on villette which had overrun by several days so she had had a mad scramble to get to valhalla on time she was cheered that sexton had provided her with a beautiful caravan in which to work she had already unpacked her makeup brushes and sponges for the first days filming her main problem would be in persuading the cast that the camera four feet away saw different things from an audience up in the gods in the fridge were three bottles of white plenty of veggie snacks and a garlicflavoured cooked chicken for her russet shaggycoated lurcher james who ate much more expensively than she did and now in a smart new green leather collar lay replete and snoring on one of the bench seats above him in the window lucy had already put stickers saying lurchers do it languidly a dog is for life not just for christmas and passports for pets round the big mirror semicircled with lightbulbs beside snapshots of her little nieces lucy had stuck photographs of the cast and the members of the royal family or gordon dillon the editor of the scorpion they were supposed to represent over the door was pinned her prize possession nicked from the bbc which said please ensure that all spirits are returned to the spirit tank in this room it was creepily appropriate in valhalla where every shadow appeared inhabited and the dark cliff of wood behind the row of caravans and tents known rather grandiosely as the facilities unit seemed determined to obscure the stars who knew what ghosts might creep out of the cloisters or on this bitterly cold night the identities of the mufflered and overcoated figures scuttling by also on lucys walls were thankyou cards from the cast shed just been looking after as usual there had been tears and promises to keep in touch but for once she wasnt mourning the end of yet another location affaire her thoughts had been too full of tristan she had been overjoyed to find a big bunch of bluebells in her caravan but slightly deflated that every woman in the cast and crew had also received flowers but at least hed remembered she liked bluebells and she kept his goodluck card which she would certainly need tomorrow she had to make up baby and flora who would each require at least an hour and a half and if things moved swiftly she might even have to do the ancient tenor playing the spanish ambassador thank god dame hermione had insisted on her own makeup artist at vast extra expense fifty yards from make up hermiones squawks could be heard issuing from the dairy which had been turned over to wardrobe lady griselda the wardrobe mistress big deepvoiced kind vulnerable and a bit dippy looked like julius caesar in drag and had a small mouth like the slit in the charity tins she so often jangled on street corners as a deb griselda had played the double bass in a pop group called the alice band and had briefly been in waiting to a lesser member of the royal family she now lived with a lot of cats in a thatched cottage in north dorset where she knew absolutely everybody the cottage was called wobbly bottom griselda tended to send herself up before anyone else could by dressing outlandishly today she was wearing a floorlength redembroidered tunic and a purple turban she was also having a nervous breakdown because rannaldini whod employed her because he felt shed know how the upper classes dressed was being absolutely beastly riding coats and breeches littered a large seablue damask sofa which had recently and peremptorily been ejected from helens blue living room as flora baby and hermione tried on their clothes for tomorrows shoot tristan was pacing about there were a million technical demands on him a potentially disruptive crew production pressures worry that the cast would gel even less in a strange environment rannaldinis beautifully manicured fingers were drumming on the table sexton was massaging his big face with his hand always a sign that all was not well hermione in white breeches black boots and a waisted red coat with black velvet facings cut long to hide her large bottom was preening in the mirror you look lovely hermsie boomed griselda whose social and sartorial instincts were rapidly being sabotaged by her thumping great crush on hermione women dont hunt in red coats in england snapped tristan it looks vulgar please try the dark blue one again hermione the dark blue wont show up against the trees argued rannaldini i want to add a cheery note to the winter gloom pouted hermione baby who was supposed to have hurtled across country to join the hunt incognito was wearing a brown herringbone tweed jacket and having lost so much weight at champneys was marvelling at himself in buff stretch breeches as elisabettas bodyguard flora was wearing a less fitted brown riding coat to accommodate the bulge of her gun all of them are same colour as countryside rannaldinis voice was rising theyll get lost meredith oblivious of the storm breaking over his airborne curls was trying on the diamond tiara hermione was supposed to wear for philip iis coronation put on your hats for the total look urged griselda the row escalated because neither hermione nor baby were prepared to wear hard hats with black chin straps to resemble camilla parker bowles and prince charles how could anyone fall in love with anyone at first sight wearing that protested baby dyou want hermione to smoke a fag as well those hats are authentic protested griselda getting up with a rattle of valium to tap hermiones brim further down over her eyes we must set a good example to the pony club fuck the pony club snapped baby rannaldini would quite like to murmured meredith you can take off your hats the moment you dismount pleaded griselda and hermiones blonde wig will then tumble beautifully down her back my hair wont tumble anywhere snarled baby he loathed his prince charles wig complete with incipient bald patch even more than his hat meredith who was now trying on a flowertrimmed straw bonnet suggested that babys and hermiones hard hats might look better if they were dressed up with long earrings only if i can wear my scarlet coat said hermione mulishly english women dont wear began tristan but im not english said hermione with a peal of merry laughter as though shed made a frightfully good joke im south african reimpose sanctions muttered baby valhalla like many ancient ecclesiastical buildings was hshaped with the north and south wings forming the verticals of the h rannaldini and his family lived in the south wing overlooking the valley meanwhile in the north wing other members of the cast and the upper echelons of the crew were bagging their bedrooms which in contrast to the lavishness of the south wing consisted rather creepily of exmonks cells reached by badly lit uncarpeted staircases and long narrow corridors bit scary quavered lucy pushing a reluctant james into a darkly panelled rabbit warren almost entirely occupied by a big mahogany double bed i dont mind sharing said ogborne tristans cocky and cockney chief grip who had a shaved head an earring and looked like a selfconfident pig employed to hump equipment around and shove heavy cameras along tracks ogborne had had no difficulty in carrying all of lucys cases upstairs plenty of room for you me and fido in here he said patting the bed i talk dreadfully in my sleep and james snores said lucy hastily down the corridor alpheus shaw psyching himself into the part of philip ii was getting more regal by the second referring to himself as one and striding around with his hands behind his back he had also demanded the biggest bedroom which had the biggest fourposter and small leaded windows looking north into the woods and east up the valley however he was deeply displeased that unlike tristan he had not been put in the lush south wing which he had admired loudly on a previous visit only half the principals were in situ neither mikhail granny his wayward boyfriend giuseppe alpheus nor chloe would be needed for a couple of weeks alpheus had come down ostensibly to show solidarity and to inspire the cast after all he was the principal male singer now fat franco had been fired in reality he wanted to screw chloe without having to fork out for a hotel particularly as his wife cheryl always went through the amex receipts looking down he could see tristan and rannaldini walking towards the house their arms waving as they yelled at one another their shadows long and black behind them inside the dairy meredith like a small child comforting his mother was patting the vast shoulders of a sobbing lady griselda its just firstnight nerves dont take it personally griselda gave a sniff try not to get lippy on that hunting tie hermsie she called out and id be grateful if youd all put your clothes back on the hangers what times dinner asked baby seven thirty for eight said flora as she wriggled back into her old grey jersey and scruffy black jeans i cant be bothered to go home and tart up dinner began scratchily helen a lousy hostess at the best of times because she never refilled glasses or introduced anyone was clearly livid at being invaded by so much mess and so many strangers as a final insult drinks were being served in the old red morning room which she had spent two years of her excruciatingly unhappy marriage transforming into an exquisite symphony of faded blues and rusts almost overnight it had been reduced to a gaudy riot of cherryred walls gilded ceilings floorlength mirrors framed with gold leaf and two crimson thrones initialled e and pii at the end of the room worst of all three huge glittering chandeliers hovering overhead like spielberg spaceships highlighted every bag and wrinkle an unkind contrast to the ludicrously flattering painting of herself over the fireplace in which she was portrayed as athene goddess of wisdom with an owl perched on her head having flown in from a wildly successful mahlers resurrection in berlin to ensure valhallas cuisine exceeded anything french rannaldini had unearthed the krug and was welcoming guests and accepting compliments on the room it ees of course based on throne room at buckingham palace he told anyone who would listen as the crew gathered in one corner puffing gauloise smoke and the cast retreated to another trying not to breathe it in gossip whizzed back and forth in all languages everyone was also assessing talent how can i tell tristans boys apart when theyve all got beards said baby fretfully jesus must have had the same trouble with his disciples said meredith except this lot have got gorgeous names like bestboy and focuspuller valentin the camera operators heaven but hes just back from his honeymoon best time to turn them before they start looking round for other women god hes divine also rannaldinis son wolfgang so hes out of bounds very straight and rather fierce im sure hes going to insist we all have uniform willies like common market carrots hes nice meredith nudged baby as sylvestre the sound man whod tied back his long blond hair in a ponytail wandered through the door even straighter and utterly monosyllabic said baby dismissively having grabbed a drink sylvestre was soon comparing notes with ogborne the chief grip flora looked sexy enough even if she did need a bath they decided but those sodding great rings on her hand suggested a rich boyfriend that blonde looks a goer said ogborne sylvestre whod much enjoyed chloes goings and comings during the recording agreed then both men choked on their drinks as tabitha stalked in turquoise eyes flashing hair slicked back from her forehead like rudolph valentino she was wearing a cashmere crop top to show off a seahorse tattooed below her left breast and very lowslung black hipsters having filled a glass with so much vodka that the ice she added made it overflow she made a beeline for lucy and dragged her over to the fireplace why do the most beautiful girls always pal up with dogs said ogborne still sour at not being asked to share lucys bed because their dogs like each other said sylvestre as sharon the labrador bounced up to james the lurcher who went up on his toes and nearly sent a bowl of grape hyacinths flying with his long wagging tail tab immediately launched into the state of her marriage isa was there when i got home from auditioning horses then he went straight out saying hed gotta go over to bloody jakes and couldnt make dinner tonight so i press the redial button and guess who answered fucking martie in australia im going mad luce she drained half her vodka hand trembling and what was even worse when i ran down the garden trying to catch isa i saw this man on a horse his hair whiteblond in the moonlight and for a second i thought by some miracle daddy had come to take me away from this nightmare then i realized it was bloody wolfgang having a snoop hes furious rannaldinis lent us magpie cottage and rannaldinis given him this ace job and hes got no experience cant you see the ladybird book of the cinema sticking out of his pocket lucy was about to say how sorry she was when rannaldini clapped his hands for silence i would like to welcome you all to the throne room at valhalla on this very special evening he said smoothly and introduce my wife helen our daughter tabitha by the fireplace and our son wolfgang he turned to smile at the extremely handsome but undeniably bootfaced young man standing by the window wolfgang wolfgang hermione charged forward i havent seen you since you were in short pants and hasnt he turned out yummily sighed meredith to giggles all round poor wolfgang blushed dark crimson tabitha you look just laike your sibling said pushy galore who although only in the chorus had somehow pushed her way into the party and to match the décor was busting out of red velvet braided with gold but not laike your dad or mum rannaldinis not my father spat tabitha any more than hes my brother she scowled at wolfgang who scowled back an awkward silence was defused by tristan wandering in his hair was still wet from the shower his eyes bloodshot from late nights poring over the storyboards of each scene which like an extended comic strip covered the walls of his suite upstairs tristan apologized profusely for being late and for lady griselda who knowing everyone in rutshire as well as dorset had gone out to dinner for his delectable niece simone who needed ten hours sleep on the eve of a shoot and for bernard his first assistant director who was handling some row with equity and couldnt make it either he was then so charming to everyone particularly helen that she soon forgot about dust breakages and chipped paintwork in fact tristan was incredibly uptight he always got blinding headaches before filming started particularly after that row with rannaldini he needed five more hours on the score his confidence had been jolted because his cult film the betrothed had just lost out in the oscars to a mainstream american comedy he was alsosad to see the large salacious étienne de montigny of abelard and héloïse which his father had left rannaldini hanging opposite the fireplace to helens obvious distaste oscar the director of photography and his soninlaw valentin however were both jolted out of their habitual languor by the painting thats the look we need for the shoveandgrunt scenes tristan said oscar waving his green cigaretteholder in the direction of héloïses left breast beautiful flesh tones your father certainly knew about light i love that painting too said hermione smiling warmly at oscar because she wanted him to light her beautifully and because she liked the piratical good looks of his soninlaw étienne de montigny was always begging me to sit for him tristan had had enough and belted off to the more reassuring comfort of lucy who had been deserted by tabitha in need of more vodka and who went scarlet when tristan kissed her on both her already flushed cheeks oh why had she worn a red wool twinset to stand by a blazing fire thank you ever so much for the bluebells she stammered i know you love them and i remember very good poem about lucy a violet by a mossy stone half hidden from the eye fair as a star when only one is shining in the sky tristan reeled off the verse in triumph but noone looks at her when all the other stars come out thought lucy shed never found the poem very flattering there was a pause and this must be james tristan put out a hand to stroke lucys lurcher who was now curled up on the crimson throne initialled e for excellent you remembered said lucy rapturously of course he is beautiful how old is he about twelve the vet says where did you get him i was on a shoot in the east end he was running round the streets terrified with his lead flapping so i coaxed him into my caravan with a bit of quiche he was starving the words were tumbling out of lucys big trembling mouth then he leapt on to a chair as if he wanted me to make him up so i took off his lead to make him feel at home and put it on the table would you believe it the next moment hed leapt down snatched back his lead put it on his chair jumped back and sat on it as lucy caressed jamess brown velvet ears her voice broke he was desperate not to lose the only possession he had in the world i had to keep him after that im sorry lucy wiped her eyes smearing her mascara im boring you i would run around east end with lead trailing said tristan gently if it found me an owner like you squawking like a pheasant disturbed in a wood was coming from the other end of the room oscar not recognizing hermione had put up the terrible black of assuming tabitha was the beautiful young girl who was going to play elisabetta and loudly assuring her he would have no problem lighting her at all hermione was hopping touching lucys blushing cheek with one finger tristan shot off to calm hermione which also gave him a chance to say hello to tab but tab had grabbed a bottle and saying quite untruthfully that lucys glass was empty as an excuse to fill her own shot past him going the other way whos that man who looks as though a marmalade cats died on his head she hissed thats colin milton grinned lucy lowering her voice poor old boys been in the wilderness for years kept forgetting his lines and then had a nervous breakdown hes playing the spanish ambassador hes really sweet meanwhile anxious to make alpheus jealous chloe was chatting up wolfgang and to prove she was not just a pretty face discussing schiller in the play she said philip offers his mistress eboli in marriage to a disgusting old courtier he also offers carlos up to the inquisition said wolfgang bleakly because both his mistress and his wife are in love with carlos his religion gave philip a marvellous excuse to murder a son he hated wow thought chloe youre a chilly boy ruthless as your dad the combination of blond chiselled luftwaffepilot looks with rannaldinis nightdark eyes was very disturbing oh goodee hermione clapped her hands heres alpheus alpheus who had deliberately arrived late to make an entrance looked splendid deeply tanned wearing a frilly cream shirt tucked into dark blue velvet trousers to show off his tbone figure helens eyes widened with excitement as he kissed her hand here comes the lothario from long island said baby sourly he is handsome reproached flora like a lobster snapped baby tasty body but a head full of shit dinner is served grumbled mr brimscombe the gardener who was violently opposed to rannaldinis plan to obliterate his flowerbeds in a great buckingham palace sweep of lawn down to the lake and who had only agreed to butle because so much crumpet was on view as the great hall was being transformed by merediths myrmidons into philip iis bedroom they dined in the old prussian blue dining room which now had walls the tawny red of beef consommé and a gold ceiling to match all the gold plate and the frames of the portraits on the walls a brass trough filled with white daffodils stretched down the middle of the table and then my heart with pleasure fills and dances with the daffodils said tristan who had been summoned to sit on helens right but hoped lucy and therefore tab might come and sit on his other side but tossing her ringlets pushy galore nipped in and stole the seat how the hell did she get in here chloe hissed to flora sexton brought her in that dress she looks as though he ordered her from the past times christmas catalogue the last shall be first shell probably end up marrying tristan having cased the joint shell more likely become the next lady rannaldini as helen clearly hasnt thought we were worth a seating plan shall we sit together flora nodded clutching a furiously growling trevor to stop him attacking james she was actually in a state of shock shed had no idea her old flame wolfie was working on the film or that hed grown so devastatingly attractive if only shed bothered to wash her hair and change in honour of the stag hunt with which don carlos opens they dined on the darkest meltingly tender venison steeped in a rich red wine sauce the secret of venison is that it should be well hung announced hermione scooping up most of the delicious celeriac purée like blokes agreed baby sublime rannaldini announced alpheus determined to raise the tone how dyou make it so goddam tender i eenjeck the marinade into the tissue with a hypodermic syringe purred rannaldini how gross snapped tabitha and fed her venison to sharon under the table colin milton wasnt eating his venison either great henry the glorious king of france he muttered to himself wishes to bestow the hand of his daughter oh hell what came next his hand was shaking so dreadfully that when he tried to raise his glass of château mouton rothschild to his lips he spilt it dont waste that stuff colin shouted rannaldini down the table eet cost a fortune bastard thought lucy who was already embarrassed because she had refused the venison sitting beside her wolfie noticed her empty plate i dont eat meat she stammered ill be fine with vegetables wolfie stood up ill have a word with he glanced up the table at helen er mrs rannaldini lady rannaldini howled rannaldini have you lost your manners wolfgang an ugly flush spread over wolfies face and his whiteknuckled hands clenched the table lucy felt terrible particularly when mrs brimscombe hobbled in apologizing with the most delectable vegetable lasagne i make it specially for you lucy called rannaldini determined to ingratiate himself with tabithas friend youre still a bastard thought lucy delighted that wolfie was now defiantly emptying tomato ketchup over his venison when everyone was eating the lightest primrose yellow syllabub with bitter chocolate sauce tristan stood up having thanked rannaldini and helen for allowing their house to be invaded he went on to talk about don carlos repeating verdis description of a family drama in a princely house which must have been very like valhalla it is also a story about sexual jealousy and loneliness in high places both schiller and verdi were obsessed with oppression tristan continued the tyranny of philip ii over his family and his subjects the tyranny of the church over everything today the church has loosed its stranglehold instead we and particularly the royal family and the government are controlled by the media that is why we have set our don carlos in modern dress with a corrupt press baron replacing the grand inquisitor as part of her job lucy never stopped watching faces seeing the rapt attention of flora chloe pushy hermione helen and even tab her heart sank how stupid to think she had a hope against such dazzling competition lost as a star when all the rest are shining in the sky she thought sadly as if to comfort her james laid his long nose on her knee at least she hadnt had to go abroad this time and leave him behind in the flickering candlelight tristans face had lost its hollows and yellowgreyish pallor his eyes glowed with conviction none of us is going to get him into bed murmured meredith to baby like spielberg he only fucks the movie in real life don carlos was horrible person tristan was now telling his audience he roast animals alive he gallop his horse to death he assault and flog palace maids he even bit the head off a pet lizard and ate it ooh squealed pushy i could have murdered a whole lizard at champneys last week called out baby you are very beautiful now so it pay off laughed tristan then serious again tomorrow we begin filming the first act which is perhaps the most tragic dusk is falling on a great forest the huntsmen are riding home elisabetta and carlos experience le coup de foudre first love striking like lightning they have few moments of ecstasy thinking they will live happy for ever then it is over noticing the desolation on tabithas face he was ashamed to feel a flicker of satisfaction her marriage might not be working out he had been haunted by dreams of her lean jeaned body and garlanded head ever since the wedding after hed wished everyone good luck for the morning there was applause coffee and liqueurs down the table hermione was telling alpheus that rannaldini often lent her his gulf iv for overseas engagements why shouldnt the maestro do the same for his principal bass misinterpreting the excitement on her lovers face chloe tried once more to galvanize wolfie do you like opera she asked i liked you in nabucco admitted wolfie when the eno brought it to munich its pronounced nabooko snarled an eavesdropping rannaldini i hate my father thought wolfie i should never have come back i hate helen she had always been a pain in the arse when her son marcus and wolfie had been at school together and now she had put him back in his old room which shed obviously been using as a spare room then expected him to rave over the chintz curtains and the flower paintings on the pretence shed redecorated it especially for him i loathe tabitha he thought shes a spoilt brat worse than little cosmo more arrogant than her father and now in possession of the nicest cottage on the estate and there laughing across the table with chloe was flora his old love bloody golddigger covered in his fathers fingerprints now shacked up with a guy as old as and probably richer than his father he had forgiven neither her nor rannaldini and flora seeing the antagonism battling with the longing in wolfies eyes found it very disturbing as solid as tebaldos gun she fingered the mobile in her jeans pocket willing george to ring rannaldini was now talking about valhalla part of the house is twelve century it has been owned since the beginning by aristocrats or monks certainly by neither today said tabitha sourly as she reached through the white daffodils for the kummel sometimes rannaldini ignored her on summer nights we ear the most beautiful plainsong from the chapel but noone is there a sad weeping lady in grey caroline beddoes is often seen gazing out of a blockedup window on the north side she has blood on her dress and a little dog in her arms sometime she glide through doors which exeest no longer you can hear the hiss of her silk skirts on the flagstones and of course as in many great houses there is a legend that when the lake dries up the head of the family will die it looked promisingly low on the way down murmured baby everyone laughed nervously glancing furtively into the shadowy corners except alpheus did you really manage to negotiate a cash settlement he was asking hermione do you believe in ghosts sir roberto quavered pushy the lights seemed to dim i believe my dear the excited throb in rannaldinis voice was growing more insistent in a great departure lounge crowded with spirits desperate to get to the next world or to return to this one to avenge themselves or to clear their name or find a lost love attractive isnt he whispered chloe satanically shivered flora been to bed with him yes so have i brilliant wasnt it yes we also have the legend of the paradise lad a beautiful novice rannaldinis eyes gleamed flogged to death by the monks for falling in love with a village girl sometime we hear him sobbing listen as rannaldini held up a white hand a moan came from the chimney and everyone jumped in terror but it is probably only the wind the port and brandy were orbiting like formulaone cars suddenly the door creaked slowly open people screamed and clutched each other as noone entered then rannaldinis white cat sarastro padded in its the night shift come to sit on colins head whispered tabitha next moment even she had jumped out of her skin as sarastro arched his back and hissed his tail thick as a snowcovered christmas tree but he had only seen james who would have given chase if lucy hadnt grabbed his new green collar helen was not happy tristan was perfectly charming but she wished he didnt always want his crew to enjoy the same privileges as himself when it meant her having on her left ogborne the piglike chief grip whose shaved head was gleaming in the candlelight and who had just poured himself a third glass of port got everything you need she asked acidly well cindy crawford would be nice said ogborne adding kindly but its been a great meal where does the name valhalla come from asked pushy helen opened her mouth at last a chance to show off but she was preempted by ogborne wagner he told pushy valhalla was the palace built for the gods by the giants fasolt and fafner you must remember that wonderful moment at the end of rhinegold when the gods pass over the rainbow bridge and enter the castle at sunset the entire table fell silent gazing at him in amazement and whos that very handsome gentleman over the fireplace simpered pushy galore shes so far up rannaldini hissed chloe one cant see her toenails any more that is my greatgreatgrandfather on my mothers side said rannaldini smiling warmly at pushy a tremendous rake that portrait has been known to wink at very pretty girls bollocks hiccuped meredith you bought greatgreatgrandpop and all your other ancestors in the kings road in the late eighties tristan tried not to laugh and because rannaldini had thrown meredith such a filthy look and he didnt want his entire crew and cast quitting valhalla in terror he got up to go bedtime everyone thank you rannaldini and helen for a wonderful evening it has put us in great mood for tomorrow not all of us thought flora sadly then squeaked in ecstasy as her mobile rang im in a sevenfoot by sevenfoot fourposter in doosledorf said a broad yorkshire accent and i need soomeone to fill it oh george sighed flora i love you so much and thank you for my lovely regard ring wolfie flinched ok for some said tab bitterly then pleadingly to lucy come back to the cottage for a quick one can i come too asked ogborne picking up the bottle of kummel no you cant said tab rudely lucy sighed inwardly itd better be quick ive got to be up at six having made a few telephone calls rannaldini locked his study door pressed a button and the bookshelf slid back to reveal a wall of monitors twoway mirror on the wall murmured rannaldini who is the fairest of them all sadly tab had gone home he must get clive to install that videocamera in magpie cottage flora had pushed off to her parents house hermione to river house but there was poor bald colin without his toupee pacing his little cell and tristan had fallen asleep on his chessboard clutching his mobile oscar was also asleep valentin calling his new wife ah that was more interesting pushy galore going down on sylvestre and ogborne snorting with delight over a porn mag wolfie lay on his back smoking rannaldini had so often seen the same bruised furious reproach in wolfies mothers eyes of all of his wives she had been the first and the worst treated she had been so young he must win wolfie over in the next cell baby was gazing at a photograph of someone suspiciously like isa lovell pouring himself a brandy rannaldini sat back to watch chloe and alpheus but despite chloes ravishing body and flickering expertise it was so mainline he soon nodded off even when she had tumbled into bed long after midnight lucy couldnt sleep the house like an ancient arthritic kept shifting its position creaking and groaning to get comfortable the wind howled the central heating gurgled james was restless and in the next room colin milton was so nervous they might get to the spanish ambassador tomorrow he spent all night practising his lines lucy tried not to think about tristan for once she was glad when her alarm clock went off at five thirty from six oclock onwards a mighty army of lorries caravans a canteen generators doubledecker diningbuses and a portaloo euphemistically nicknamed the honeywagon rumbled eastwards into rannaldinis woods their destination was a beechwood known as cathedral copse because its silver trunks soared to the sky like the pillars of a huge nave it was a bitterly cold day in a clearing oscar the director of photography his purple scarf and dark hair flapping was eating a bacon sandwich glancing from shivering standins to light meters and briefing the gaffer the chief electrician who in turn told his minions the sparks where to put the lights except in the place where the singers were going to act the carpet of faded beech leaves was crisscrossed with camera tracks and cables and teeming with focuspullers measuring distances boom operators and props men trying to look useful over in make up lucy had grabbed a cup of coffee and a hot dog for james before starting on the long haul of making up baby who needed alkaseltzer lots of blue eyedrops concealer for his dark shadows and blusher for his blanched cheeks youve got such a beautiful face chided lucy you should cut out the booze and get a few early nights carlos is supposed to look pale and wan not in this scene that comes after his dads nicked his girlfriend hows mrs lovells marriage fine lucy drew a white line inside babys lower lashes to reduce the redness yeah yeah rannaldinis won a peace prize is isa catting around you should know youre his friend hes not the greatest communicator except with horses arent you nervous asked lucy who was accustomed to calming terrified actors particularly on the first day not in the least dont change the subject you went back to magpie cottage she must have said something she was certainly on the pull last night flashing her seahorse tattoo she dressed up because she thought isa was coming with her i dont want to discuss it now what are we going to do about your green tongue heres a pink cough pastille if you can keep it down next she had to cope with a sobbing flora clutching a furiously yapping trevor with one hand and tugging her red hair down over her ears with the other whereas makeup artists usually adjust to their subjects wishes film hairdressers tend to impose their views on others flora had got stuck into the tattered remains of captain corellis mandolin only to discover shed been given a short back and sides george will sling me out oh for gods sake stop it trevor floras voice rose to a scream as the little terrier lunged at a surprised james you can get away with it youve got such a lovely face lucy tied a powderblue overall round floras neck and itll soon grow not for three months it wont mocked baby that gauleiter simone from continuity wont allow it and lucy said ive got a beautiful face too she says it to all the girls oh go away and annoy wardrobe said lucy throwing a sponge at him i shall go and inhabit my caravan look its on the call sheet mr spinosissimos caravan its eight inches longer than hermiones i measured it so yah boo lucy then had to turn a quaking flora into hermiones private detective thickening her eyebrows giving her sideboards and a small moustache and creating brown stubble with a dry sponge im bored in my caravan its lonely being a megastar said baby half an hour later he was so turned on by floras new butch look he couldnt stop pinching her bottom youre wanted in wardrobe mr spinosissimo standing in the doorway his shoulders broadened by a lumber jacket was a stonyfaced wolfie get your ass into gear the directors waiting treat em mean keep em keen heil hitler baby goosestepped after wolfgang christ its cold if march is meant to go out like a lamb this ones new zealand and deepfrozen over at wardrobe tristan and lady griselda in a floorlength furlined red coat and a fakefur hat like a tsar had decided that as carlos had just flown into france incognito it would be more appropriate for him to lurk at the meet in a covert coat wouldnt a flashers mac be more suitable said baby he was still violently opposed to his prince charles wig and enraged tristan by asking the grinning crew whether he looked a prat or not when they voted by a show of hands that he did he tore it off and threw it into a bramble bush tristan only gave in because he and rannaldini whod just rolled up in his huge wolf coat had been sucked into an even worse screaming match with meredith who didnt appear quite so young and boyish out of doors the point of contention was a hunting lodge which looked as though it had been exclusively decorated by colefax fowler we are not making fourthrate production of hansel and gretel snarled rannaldini whose idea it had actually been because he wanted a free summerhouse but who hadnt forgiven meredith for last nights bought ancestors carlos and lizzie have a love tryst in it meredith stamped his little snow boot so it must look nice we should have seen a model first said tristan reasonably it look like cuckoo clock hissed rannaldini meredith flounced off muttering that his artistic input had been compromised the cuckoo clock was banished and stood sulking near the car park for the rest of the shoot because hermione was still squawking in make up it was decided quickly to relight and shoot the first four lines of babys aria when he expresses rapture after catching his first glimpse of elisabetta there was already a crimson blur of new bud on the beeches bluebell leaves and green flames of wild garlic were pushing through the leaf mould but such signs of spring were speedily blotted out by the snow machine scattering white foam everywhere even between the cracks in the dry ground remember not to bang your chest it sound like beeg ben begged sylvestre as he miked up baby next moment everyone jumped out of their skins as music poured fortissimo out of speakers hidden behind two venerable sycamores doesnt it sound gorgeous cried flora rushing out of make up her eyes filled with tears rannaldinis overture is simply sensational youd never know it wasnt verdi you always admired him said wolfie coldly flora flushed next moment she had tripped over a sign concealed by the snow saying beware of snakes oh god she wailed trevor and i are going to invest in some thigh boots before summer meanwhile hypealong cassidy the harassed press officer who was expecting a reporter and photographer from the independent was sidling from one bewildered member of the french crew to another imploring them to charge forward and ask for dame hermiones autograph when she deigned eventually to come out of her caravan bruce williss press officer does the same thing he lied tristan was taking baby through a quick rehearsal valentin oscars handsome soninlaw perched on a little chair behind the camera was following them as ogborne a red knitted flowerpot covering his shaved head pushed the camera along the silver rail tracks as the head of props pressed a button and the smokemachine enveloped baby in swirling grey mist lucy shot forward with her brushes to take the shine off his nose and a hairdresser rearranged his curls more smoke shouted tristan that brown velvet collar needs straightening yelled griselda quiet please were going for a take brayed bernard the first assistant director an incredible tension gripped everyone even the birds were silent the breeze still sound rolling said sylvestre camera rolling called valentin mark it said tristan and the clapperloader jumped in front of the camera saying slate one take one and snapped his clapper action shouted tristan out strolled baby into the sunlight fontainebleau immense and solitary forest he sang exactly in time to his own exquisite voice what rosefilled gardens what eden of loveliness could equal in carloss eyes this wood through which his smiling elisabetta passed and cut shouted tristan that was great then loping over to baby could you make it a little more ecstatic you are expecting hideous future wife and suddenly you discover you are to marry most stunning girl in world you could even clutch yourself with joy anythings better than clutching dame hermione taistoi youre miked up ok we go again the mournful clarinet began once more the smokemachine fired another swirl of mist as tristan called action glamorous valentin riding his camera like a jockey reminded baby of isa fontainebleau he sang rapturously after three takes each more miraculous than the one before tristan said fantastic check the gate once the clapperloader had shone his torch into the camera to check there were no hairs or dust to ruin the picture tristan shouted cut and print everyone cheered because the first shot was in the can the rest of the aria was going to be used as voiceover as baby smuggled himself into france and the spanish ambassadors entourage it was now time for hermione having borrowed a tapemeasure from griselda and discovered baby had the longer caravan she was now screeching at bernard guérin the first assistant director i answer only to tristan de montigny or sir roberto and noone absolutely noone orders me to hurry up and in future ensure that my caravan is not parked next to the honeywagon bernard whod been unable to make last nights party acted as tristans sergeant major his job was to see everything ran smoothly on the floor any holdup cost thousands bernard also did the bellowing and bossing around which enabled tristan to drift about inspiring charming manipulating and still appearing as mr nice guy even when he pushed people to the limit bernard whod been in the army with tristans brother laurent and held him dying in his arms in africa heroworshipped the montigny family he also got wildly jealous and sulked if anyone got too close to tristan sadly one of the reasons hermione was being so gratuitously rude to him was because he had a brickred face the rolling eyes and big teeth of a rockinghorse an ebony moustache covering a huge upper lip and the bray of a choleric donkey when frogs are ugly theres no competition whispered baby as bernard emerged from hermiones mauling his red face darkened to maroon and enlivened by a delta of purple veins on his forehead with a sigh rannaldini vanished into hermiones caravan and came down the steps a minute or so later ostentatiously tucking his shirt into his trousers dame hermione is now on her way he called out smugly so the crew could hear you must learn tact bernard nemesis however was hovering almost on cue hermiones young hopelessly harassed but adorably pretty makeup artist wandered down the steps of the honeywagon next door in her clinging orange cardigan above knitted red and white trousers she looked every inch a star to the rapture of the independent photographer she was then stampeded by crew members crying ermione ermione and begging for her autograph hypealong cassidy the press officer whose brown velvet hat was knocked off in the rush only just managed to beat them off as hermione herself emerged in the red riding coat tristan had vetoed last night whatever happened to rannaldinis dominance ending at the recording thought flora in alarm hermione was further outraged when tristan cautiously suggested her makeup was too heavy for outdoors which roughly translated means it makes the old bat look a hundred whispered baby to the crew who hed got totally on his side hermiones quailing makeup artist was then ordered by tristan to take her makeup down which meant another hours delay later bernard stole off to have a pee behind a holly tree and only just missed hermione frantically applying eyeliner her next cd will be called hermione goes to hollybush babys joke was soon whizzing round the set baby proved a complete natural who only had to glance at his lines in make up before going from nothing to regulo ten in thirty seconds hermione on the other hand was used to having a raised eyebrow seen in the gods and was defeated by the stillness subtlety and control of cinema acting she was soon driving everyone crackers insisting but i always enter right for this aria and because she like everyone else had a monstrous crush on tristan wanting to know her motivation for every syllable tristans niece simone in charge of continuity was tiny and elfin with a glossy dark brown urchin cut and mournful montigny eyes her fragility however belied a forceful personality as most of the film was shot out of order simones main task apart from timing takes was to insist that each scene blended into earlier and later ones your cigarette was only a quarter smoked last time baby she was now shouting and we agreed you should carry a whip dame hermione oh sugar i left it at home wolfgang can go and get it said rannaldini thats what hes here for having played in the first rugger team of an english public school wolfie was used to being yelled at under pressure but with bernard shouting instructions into his earpiece all morning it was as though the battle of the somme had broken out now rannaldini was pitching in and you can pick up another thermal vest from the mill while youre there wolfgang hermione called after him i cannot afford to catch cold she added as tristans eyes rose to heaven at the thought of more delay by the time they broke for lunch only babys four lines had been filmed and everyone had such cold noses they looked like an advertisement for comic relief aware she had a french crew maria the caterer a pretty pregnant italian was on her mettle and had produced baked red snapper with aromatic chinese sauce steak and kidney pie sautéed garlic potatoes a vegetable stirfry for lucy followed by rhubarb crumble or treacle pudding everyone piled up their plates and charged the dining bus where tristan because of the cold and it being the first day had ordered bottles of wine for every table how the hell are you going to put up with hermione asked oscar as he tied his napkin round his neck to protect his purple scarf divas are not fully balanced human beings said tristan dropping three disprins into a glass of perrier if they were they wouldnt be great after lunch the rows escalated what is my motivation for this scene hermione asked tristan for the thousandth time you are cold exhausted and lost in a huge forest said tristan through gritted teeth suddenly carlos steps out from behind that tree and offers you his protection if ive just come off a plane surely id offer her a slug of dutyfree said baby helpfully will you stop taking the pees tristans voice rose as i was saying hermione youre lost in a wood just a little lamb whos lost in a wood sang hermione fortissimo then went into peals of laughter as everyone jumped out of their skins dont you wish that pistol was loaded murmured baby to flora i feel like agent scully at least weve got the samecoloured hair whispered back flora who was very excited by her gun which was a hecklerkoch toy as used by the sas she was feeling spooked however because rannaldini had nastily insisted she take off not just her regard ring but also her sapphire engagement ring it ees almost beeger than the evening star and much too camp for a detective he sneered why not lend it to baby look mean flora chérie shouted tristan and when you see carlos shield hermione and point your gun straight into camera stand by to shoot please bellowed bernard everyone moved out of shot here we go lets turn over and poor flora was into a rat race if she sang loud enough to have the right facial movements the sound was too loud for her to hear the playback and she got out of synch alas the promised voice coach had been sacked even before hed started instead to help her sing in time and come in at the right moment the video of rannaldini conducting the score was now being relayed on a huge monitor behind the crew this made her even more nervous she kept fluffing her lines let alone remembering to look mean and shoot into the camera nor was she helped by planes going over griselda charging up to smooth her riding coat over the bulge of her gun lucy racing in to tone down her red nose with green face powder simone telling her to do up her top button or rannaldini continually shouting i dont like hecklers even if they do have cocks she muttered dolefully then just as she got things right her mobile rang oh george flora burst into tears im a lousy actress but i cant talk now ill ring you back im sorry everyone rannaldini went berserk are you going to take this thing seriously he yelled grabbing her mobile because eef not gloria knows tebaldos words and is only too appy to take over leave her alone shouted baby whod been crunching clove after clove of garlic in anticipation of his clinch with dame hermione there was a red glow on the horizon the third lot of snow needed topping up the day was running away blown like a dry leaf by everyones arguments flora leant against a tree got lichen on her breeches and bollocked by griselda everyone hates me she muttered miserably i dont said sylvestre who could hear her through the mike i dont said rozzy pringle the former singer of floras part whose voice had broken down in the recording and whod just arrived to help in wardrobe putting a little stone hotwater bottle into one of floras blue frozen hands and a mug of hot ribena into the other she whispered you look chilled to the marrow poor little duck oh rozzy how lovely to see you and you dont cry darling your makeup will run ooh that looks nice called hermione id like some hot ribena too go and fetch me some wolfgang which made wolfie hate flora more than ever particularly when he met helen panting up the hill going the other way george hungerfords just called the house he cant get through can you tell flora to switch on her mobile he says its urgent im not having any of those thoogs bullying you were georges first words as flora rang him on bernards mobile flora snarled wolfie are you going to hold us up all night he wants to kill me thought flora even with a hundred people milling around he terrified her the next day went much better in the afternoon they even filmed carlos and elisabettas first kiss babys attempts only to kiss hermione between her jutting lower lip and her chin came to nothing she sucked in his tongue like a hoover cut shouted tristan then took her aside as this is the first kiss of an innocent young virgin chérie i think it should be more tentative that woman could suck tasmania back to the mainland baby regaled an hysterical crew god knows how rock hudson did it for years its called a fontaineblowjob giggled flora whod regained her high spirits when the weather improves youve got to bonk her thatll be a piece of piss drawled baby when i was a little kid in oz my parents were always sending me up chimneys hermiones fanny holds no fears for me the first weeks of filming were very traumatic for tristan and his good nature particularly when large crowds horses and hounds were introduced was severely tested extras as sexton was fond of saying are more expensive than lawyers tristan planned to use much of the choruss already recorded singing as voiceover and when he employed actual crowds to keep down the budget by packing as many of their scenes as possible into the same day one of his problems was that sexton had advertised for extras in the rutminster echo and the same lot rolled up for every crowd scene whether as povertystricken woodmen and their wives or glamorous french courtiers and ladiesinwaiting or suave darkeyed diplomats from the spanish delegation this was particularly apparent because pushy galore one of the few trained singers used as an extra pushed her way to the front in every crowd scene if any of the extras managed to have a word with tristan they could claim they had taken direction and charge for extra pay if they were filmed beside any of the stars this could be categorized as a cameo appearance and they received double pay one of wolfies most important jobs therefore was to keep the extras away from the cast which was particularly difficult the day hypealong invited down a reporter from the times and was bunging anyone he could see to ask for dame hermiones autograph this was after a most unfortunate piece had appeared in the independent headlined dame qui saying none of the french crew had a clue who hermione was poor hypealong had had to rise at dawn and buy up every independent on sale at the paradise village shop before hermione could send out for one it was even harder to keep the extras away from tristan who was so polite whose head was so much in the clouds and who was so horrified by the way rannaldini was shattering everyones confidence that hed speak to all and sundry just to reassure them they were doing brilliantly as well as bellowing through his loudhailer to the extras to keep back wolfie had to tell them what expression sad shocked deprived happy to use uninstructed extras always look like the village idiot every week sexton came down with money in a gladstone bag new readies for the extras used readies for hermione wolfie had to distribute these the extras made their first appearance at a stag hunt through snowy beechwoods a very mettlesome stag had been hired and baby and flora made jokes about fast bucks particularly when the stag took off into the forest scattering rustics and was last seen chasing ghastly percy the parson whod got a thumping crush on baby after hearing him sing at tabithas wedding griselda the wardrobe mistress massive in a mauve boilersuit was having even more of a nervous breakdown than usual she had spent days amassing clothes for woodmen and footfollowers that were suitably bucolic rozzy pringle her new pa had spent hours labelling them with each extras name and hanging them on clothes rails alas all the extras had lied about their neck size and ended up wearing collars so tight their eyes popped out like an old pekineses reunion then rannaldini started screaming that nobody looked dirty enough thees ees not catwalk at aquascutum fashion show you okd those clothes yesterday said griselda bursting into tears i hate extras she sobbed only ten per cent of the men wear underpants and only five per cent of the women can you tell me which five when youve got a second asked ogborne his shaven head hidden in a blue wool flowerpot today as he laid the tracks for the dolly on which the camera travelled down a different ride lucy had loads more people to make up the courtiers and huntsmen were fairly straightforward but she had great difficulty with the chorus of povertystricken woodland folk because none of them looked remotely undernourished she had even more of a problem keeping a straight face when colin milton instead of removing his marmalade toupée to play the balding spanish ambassador insisted on hiding it under a bald skullcap flora who as hermiones detective was meant to shadow her during the hunt found singing while controlling a horse extremely difficult tab had grudgingly lent her the engineer because she wanted her little grey horse to appear in the film unfortunately every time wolfie who was cantering around like a polo umpire bellowed through his loudhailer the engineer bolted yelling that she couldnt afford to lose an olympic horse tab finally insisted flora switch to wolfies old pony audrey this triggered off a further screaming match with simone because it screwed up continuity and with wolfie who didnt want poor audrey between floras thighs tab didnt care as mistress of the horse her word was law she had already tranked the delinquent prince of darkness because rannaldini wanted hermione to ride him in the film rather like a selling plate grumbled baby the prince of darkness was fine when he was galloping across country but he lashed out at crowds particularly at pushy galore who had shoved her way to the front of the footfollowers pushy was livid and promptly reported the prince and tab to the union this may have been due to jealousy every time tab appeared on the set all one could see was technicians tripping over cables and camera tracks and cannoning into each other as they cricked their necks for a third and fourth glance even oscar the director of photography woke up talk about the return of halebopp he sighed as tab and the engineer flew past blonde hair grey mane and tail flying after tab the most eyecatching sight on the set was hypealong cassidy the press officer who had ginger sideboards and even in winter whisked about in flowered kipper ties and flared pastel suits seventies is my trademark he was always saying if youre different youre remembered hypealong knew more people than griselda but in twentyfive highly successful years he had never met a bunch whose vanity and caprice exceeded the cast of don carlos not only did they want coverage in the posh papers but also doublepage spreads in the tabloids praising their artistry but not mentioning their sex lives on the extras second day hypealong wheeled in the sunday express whose photographer was having an adventurous time leaping out of the way of the prince of darkness and snapping the hunt as they streamed down a woodland ride so pleasant to have a break in paradise announced hermione slowing down to bow to the express photographer as she and colin milton cantered decorously past its so peaceful here colins chestnut mare had furry legs like a feminist it was lucky he was hanging on to her mane for grim death for next moment they were overtaken by a yelling peril move it you fuckers shouted tabitha youre hunting not pulling a coffin and for gods sake sit up grandma she added to hermione and shorten your reins hermione turned puce to think i sang at her wedding for nothing im not surprised isaacs fed up with her already i also think shes been at the hip flask wolfie thought the same thing and finding a halfempty bottle of vodka in the hollow of a large oak tree emptied it on to the grass tristan meanwhile knew exactly what space he wanted between horses and in the politest possible way made hermione flora colin and the hunt return to their startingpoint at the top of the ride again and again they were at last achieving a perfect take galloping out of the wood with the sun shining and ivy glittering like chainmail on the trees when tab came scorching across their bows screaming cut cut cut horses and riders slithered to a halt but before tab could weigh into them in front of a flabbergasted crew an outraged tristan and an apoplectic bernard wolfie had hurtled up caught the engineers reins and yanked him to a halt what the hell are you playing at with his furious flushed face his gleaming blond hair and his plunging horse he looked just like st george but his indigo eyes blazed like rannaldinis hermiones toes were pointing down like darcey bussell yelled back tab and spanish ambassadors dont cling on to their horses manes and who let hermione carry a hunting whip without a lash its so naff and if she wants to wear a red coat why doesnt she get a job at butlins youve just wrecked a perfectly good take my reputation is at stake countered tab who was getting thoroughly above herself if this goes on ill have to take my name off the credits after all your fortyeighthour experience said a scornful wolfie thinking how pale and unhealthy she looked in the spring sunshine then seeing the first assistant director puffing up the hill he added and youll bloody well apologize to bernard i will not you bloody alfred hitler alfred wolfie raised an incredulous blond eyebrow realizing shed goofed tab had to recover herself adolfs much more evil elder brother she said haughtily and dont you dare take the piss out of me can we get on said a chilling voice which promptly sent the sun in it was rannaldini youre out of order wolfgang tabitha was quite right to halt the film that whip he added bitchily is wrong hermione had a lash yesterday and the prince of darkness should be wearing my saddlecloth very black mark for continuity simone not if hes being ridden by a french princess said wolfie defiantly your saddlecloth incorporates the colours of the german and italian flags and swinging his horse round he cantered off to tell the hunt to go back up the hill again how truly kind of wolfie to defy his terrifying father for my sake thought tiny simone tearfully to avoid more chaos tristan filmed the hounds on a separate day the cotchester hunt pulled out by rupert had been replaced by a splendidly sixteenthcentury assortment of wolfhounds greyhounds salukis and lurchers but being gaze hounds who chased what they saw rather than what they smelled they ignored the extra drenched in aniseed whod replaced the stag and tore instead after the camera moving on its dolly soon ogborne clutching his flowerpot hat valentin in his new english brogues and oscar whod nodded off against a copper beech could be seen belting off into the wood in terror james the lurcher whod been signed up as a hound immediately rushed back to lucy where the other valhalla dogs sharon trevor and tabloid rannaldinis rottweiler whod all ploughed the audition proceeded to rubbish him out of jealousy cut down the tallest puppy said flora who was in such hysterics she fell off audrey despite the traumas wonderful work was being done hermiones long onenoted yes when she agreed to marry philip rather than carlos had everyone in tears and at the end of two and a half weeks the first and probably most taxing act was in the can the buds could feel free to burst open in cathedral close and the wild flowers to throw off their blanket of artificial snow action would now move inside to the dungeons and to alpheuss bedroom scene alpheus granny chloe hermione mikhail and baby would be needed but no horses or flora so she and tabitha could have a break but there was no respite for lucy her makeup had been inspired except when tristan popped into her caravan and her hands started shaking when he watched the rushes he realized even more what a treasure he had found flora with her short back and sides looked disturbingly androgynous with miraculous shading baby had lost all his puppy fat he was also acting everyone off the screen you couldnt take your eyes off him the only person not ravished by the rushes was hermione she was in the habit of pestering her agent howie denston twenty times a day even ordering him to ring up and tell her chauffeur to turn down the car radio when she was being driven the halfmile from river house to valhalla now she told howie to tell tristan she could only film in the afternoons when her big brown eyes were fully open she also sacked her makeup artist and insisted on having lucy lucy was then summoned to hermiones caravan for a glass of very cheap south african sherry as the great diva lay stretched out on a bed a pad steeped in witchhazel over her eyes as im playing a beautiful young princess in this film announced hermione i thought it fitting at first to employ a beautiful young makeup artist who would be au fait with the latest trends while youre here lucy dear could you peel those grapes and pop them into my mouth now i realize i was wrong hermione sounded as though she was going over to rome far better to go for a mature older woman like yourself who knows the ropes you mustnt be fazed lucy i have every faith in you i wanted to ram her bloody grapes down her throat lucy told tristan afterwards although he was cross tristan was ecstatic lucy could now feed his ideas into hermiones thick skull but realizing lucy never finished clearing up and doing her paperwork before midnight he promised her more help perhaps rozzy from wardrobe and you need more light in here lucy was so touched hed noticed shed have made up the entire crew griselda however was livid rozzy was the best assistant shed ever had she was determined to hang on to her wolfie was also proving a great asset checking oscars cigars were lit and that tristan didnt lose his camera script and if he found bernard ugly and uncharming he didnt mob him up like the others having been brought up with artists wolfie was quite used to them losing their head and their nerve several times a day and somehow managed to get everyone except hermione out of their dressing rooms on time outwardly however he appeared terribly arrogant the crew resenting this pinned a notice saying stalag studios on wolfies door and whistled the dambusters every time he walked past ogborne and three of the sparks had too much to drink one lunchtime and proceeded to circle the production office where wolfie was wrestling with the next days call sheet sticking their arms out they pretended to be lancasters and lobbed scotch eggs through the window wolfie ignored them but later that evening tristan found him gazing miserably into space he knew wolfies arrogance was a defence mechanism and that beneath his reserve he was warmhearted and thoughtful it had been wolfie who had told tristan lucy needed more light tristan had also noticed the anguish wolfie couldnt hide when an ecstatic flora baseball cap tugged over her short back and sides had flown off to join george that morning tristan was a workaholic but for once he abandoned his storyboards and bore wolfie off to dinner at the old bell in rutminster wolfie had always been jealous of tristan because rannaldini had such a high regard for him but now over several bottles they discussed schiller horrendously competitive fathers and inevitably the cast as they walked back unsteadily from the valhalla car park across the valley a light like a low bright star was shining in magpie cottage you could loosen up with tabitha said tristan idly shes appalling said wolfie bleakly the most awful human being ive ever met the wicked stepsister tristan smiled in the darkness and you could stop bitching up flora i made love to flora in every inch of this park said wolfie his face was in shadow but his voice was raw with pain the night i took her to the school dance my father landed his helicopter on the cricket pitch and flora disappeared into it like close encounters i left home the next morning or id have murdered him and how can she live with that thug george hungerford hes knocked down more buildings in dresden than winston churchill as they wandered past the north wing tristan noticed with a sinking heart the curtains moving in bernards stilllit window if bernard felt he was being usurped as tristans confidant he would give wolfie a hard time next day rannaldini pushed off to new york for a week and heaving a sigh of relief tristan decided to kick off indoor filming with posas moving death scene in the dungeons this was scuppered by mikhail missing the plane from moscow so tristan switched to a later scene in which carlos and philip are joined by eboli and the grand inquisitor with the spanish rabble outside the dungeons all clamouring for carlos to be set free this meant an awful lot of people for lucy to make up her biggest challenge was to turn the silverhaired noblebrowed patrician granville hastings into gordon dillon the neanderthal thug who edited the scorpion and whose hairline rested on his straightacross brows lucy was terrified of letting tristan down but granny promptly cheered her up by bitching about hermione my dear the only reason madam is so addicted to playing the pink oboe is that shes read that seminal fluid rejuvenates the vocal cords lucy giggled then added charitably that it seemed to work she showed me the marvellous reviews she had for rinaldo her mother must have written them said granny waspishly oh you do cheer me up lucy was sticking on a long line of beetling black eyebrow dont take any truck from her lucy lockett said granny or from alpheus whos such a wooden actor he makes that table look like anthony hopkins and youre going to have dreadful trouble with his hooter granny smirked admiringly at his own beautifully aquiline nose alpheus has a bigger conk than rudolph the reindeer lucy had just grabbed a pair of scissors to trim the ends of grannys brows when meredith bustled in in great excitement you can down tools lucy darling hi granville dear repairing a dungeon wall one of the setbuilders has unearthed a skeleton with a rosary round its neck oh my god lucy nearly dropped her scissors anyone we know asked granny retrieving a dropped stitch probably the planning officer said meredith gleefully hes been so dire the dungeons at valhalla had always been damp and chill now none of the crew would go in there even after percy the parson was summoned and sprinkled holy water from a smirnoff bottle ever conscious of a spiralling budget tristan gritted his teeth hed have to reschedule mikhail had now rung in from moscow claiming to be laid low with bronchitis so baby could shove off for a few days and stop making a nuisance of himself and they could switch to the great hall which had been transformed by meredith with the help of a massive white and gold silk fourposter into king philips bedroom merediths minions were already busy dusting the arctic white marble chimneypiece and touching up gilt cherubs who were getting up to no good in the frieze running round the white walls the prop table groaned with priceless ornaments which rannaldini intended to keep after filming and which meredith kept rearranging driving tiny simone crackers griselda had agonized long and loudly over what a king should wear in bed and settled for a magnificent turnbull asser dressinggown in pink and purple stripes which alpheus was equally determined to hang on to after filming having spent a duty fortnight in the caribbean with his wife cheryl he was also frantic to screw chloe filming began with the insomniac philips great soliloquy even though he had played the part twenty times alpheus was avid to know his motivation the candles are guttering said tristan it is the heure de loup just before dawn when mans resistance is at its lowest you feel old and threatened because your ravishing young wife and your sexy demanding mistress are both madly in love with your son you are also deeply hurt and raging with jealousy too right agreed sylvestre dropping a cold microphone down alpheuss hairy chest which had just been greyed up by lucy i would be peesed off with scenario like that noone asked your opinion snapped bernard all right quiet please were going for a take how dyou get a pompous ass like alpheus to act devastated muttered meredith show him a sevenfigure tax bill muttered back granny quiet thundered bernard in the heartbreakingly beautiful cello solo which sets the mood of the aria alpheus wandered dazedly round the room then plundered elisabettas desk which was rumoured once to have belonged to louis xiv as he riffled through her diary scrutinized her itemized telephone and amex bills and finally rooted under the mattress of the big double bed for love letters rozzy pringle gave a groan how often had she done that at home praying she wouldnt stumble on more evidence of her feckless husband glyns infidelities alpheus then sang the first part of the aria so beautifully and with such an air of nobility and resignation that the crew gave him a rare round of applause alpheus can act and his nose looks fine naughty granny thought lucy indignantly if only it were me singing that aria thought granny tristan was going to use the rest of the aria as voiceover when he filmed philip forcing himself on a young unresponsive bride suddenly at the prospect of watching alpheus and hermione in the sack the number of people on the set seemed to have quadrupled mr brimscombe rannaldinis gardener who was always leering into the female extras changing room was pretending to trim back the famous paradise pearl wisteria so that he could peer in through a high stainedglass window depicting st cecilia at her organ the weather was still bitterly cold and the cost of heating the hall alone was putting liberty productions over budget there was no way however that hermione was going to risk turning blue in a shoveandgrunt scene howie denston hadnt quite screwed up enough courage to tell sexton and tristan that she wouldnt be filming in the mornings any more but she made him ring in now to say that she had a cold everyone was less than amused when she promptly whizzed off to sing in an arena concert in new york except rannaldini who was already there and was taking a fat percentage of her hundredthousandpound fee far from chiding her he sent the gulf to collect her a demented tristan was forced once more to reschedule granny whod been planning to go to sense and sensibility with chloe was livid to be dragged into filming the blind inquisitors great dialogue with philip and insisted on upstaging alpheus by feeding bonios to his guide dog who was being played quite excellently by sharon the labrador grannys makeup beetlebrowed above black glasses made him look so menacingly like gordon dillon that after crossing themselves the crew also gave lucy a round of applause sexton whod rushed down from london to have a butchers at a naked hermione felt grannys makeover was so realistic that theyd better watch out for an injunction from the scorpion the power struggle between granny and alpheus was so crucial to the plot that it took four days to film by which time sharon egged on by granny had chewed up both of alpheuss blue velvet crested slippers alpheus had not endeared himself to the crew regally bidding them all to drinks in the pearly gates leading the stampede he would grind to a halt just outside the pub to admire the mullioned windows and the variegated skyline of turrets you brits are so lucky your history is so old by which time the first round would have been bought and alpheus who had read somewhere that the royal family never carry money would get away with not buying a drink all evening the least often heard words in the english language grumbled ogborne are thank you alpheus the next least heard words are alpheus saying its my round said sylvestre next day dame hermione flew back from new york but wanting to rest and refusing to film in the morning she made howie ring in to say her throat was still playing up rather than waste a tropically heated hall tristan therefore shot a little shoveandgrunt scene between alpheus and chloe which having had plenty of practice they did quite beautifully once again in seconds as oscar ordered his team to rearrange their lights to cast a more diffused romantic glow the great hall was absolutely packed out sexton materialized from nowhere meredith was whisking around rearranging pieces of sèvres on a table beside the bed on which chloe was now lying on her back the picture of abandonment the fact that she had to wear an eyepatch to play the traditionally oneeyed princess eboli somehow made her look even more sexy dont feedle with those ornaments please meredith begged simone consulting her polaroids there were only two vases last time not that anyones going to notice she sighed the trouble with such a hot room was flat nipples lucy had to keep darting forward with icecubes sometimes we use blutack she told chloe do you think my penis is too large asked alpheus seriously not when howies taken off his twenty per cent replied tristan wolfie got the giggles chloes chewed off all her lippy bellowed an excited griselda noones going to notice that either said oscar who for once had stayed awake god look at the light on those pubes shes like a little bonnard sighed simone ive certainly got a bonnardon confessed sexton whose redrimmed spectacles had quite steamed up hush or ill put ice down your trousers chided a returning lucy my mum wouldnt let me do nudes pouted pushy galore who was dying to take her clothes off quiet please everyone brayed bernard whose face had gone an even darker shade of magenta god this is sensational oscar dramatize the neck un peu chérie murmured tristan as philips aria poured out of the speakers as chloe raised her head thrusting out her breasts so that the light caught her rouged now upright nipples an approaching alpheus whipped off his pink and purple dressinggown action shouted tristan claiming that his bronchitis had turned into pneumonia mikhail finally arrived and was overwhelmed by the beauty of valhalla a touch of rain had sent the green flames of the wild garlic sweeping over the woodland floor like a forest fire even rannaldinis lowering maze of dark yew had a blond rinse of lemonyellow flowers you pay me for vorking in such vonderful place mikhail asked in amazement noone however could quite work out whether he really had been ill or just moonlighting he had turned up wearing a black pavarotti smock with large pockets for amassing loot maria in the canteen soon found her cutlery disappearing then mikhail started complaining that he missed baby alpheus was no fun and far too expensive to drink with and he missed his wife lara even more and kept hinting that liberty productions might pay for a plane ticket so she too could admire the vonders of valhalla from new york rannaldini put his foot down there was no way he was having lara and mikhail stripping valhalla of his lovely new pickings less welcome an arrival was grannys hunky blackhaired boyfriend giuseppe who wasnt needed to play the ghost of charles v for several weeks but whod rocked up to ogle tristans boys and enjoy free booze on the budget his mausoleums going to smell worse than the pearly gates grumbled ogborne meanwhile the digging up of the skeletons seemed to have disrupted the household ghosts the night after mikhail and giuseppe arrived the occupants of the north wing were woken by bloodcurdling shrieks when a terrified lucy a for once quite paleintheface bernard and an unfazed ogborne who was eating a banana emerged from their celllike rooms they found hunky giuseppe in hysterics having slipped granny a mogadon he was just returning from an unspecified location when hed seen his own part the ghost of charles v stealing out of a bedroom and creeping away down the corridor he was all in white weeth a hood over ees face gibbered giuseppe as giuseppes breath rivalled bacchuss after an allnight bash everyone assumed he was plastered having calmed him down lucy tucked him up in bed beside a snoring granny but the following night as she was wearily drawing her curtains the windows suddenly rattled the wind shrieked in the chimney and a ghostly hooded white figure came flitting along the parapets she had never known such fear not even a strangled croak would come out of her throat james the lurcher was no help at all and only growled if you tried to shove him off the bed more sightings followed everyone grew increasingly terrified except alpheus who poohpoohed any suggestion of spooks im sure these apparitions would disappear if you guys went to bed sober for a change he added pompously the weather although nearly may was still freezing after supper the following night alpheus mindful of colds locked his bedroom windows and drew his curtains against draughts he had just mounted his exercise bike with the don carlos score on a nearby music stand so he could study tomorrows scene when a chill breeze ruffled the pages spinning round alpheus found the windows still firmly locked suddenly the room felt clammily damp and cold as if he were in an underground cave next moment a window behind him had blown open and the heavy dark green velvet curtains were billowing into the room outside alpheus could see the cliff of wood disintegrating thrashing and writhing as if caught up in the frenzy of a mighty gale but jumping off his bike and rushing to the other window he found the moonlit valley all stillness and serenity the wispy white clouds were only crawling past the shining stars not a silver leaf was moving far below the lake lay as still as the blackedout window of a limousine white and trembling alpheus rushed out into the corridor stumbling along endless dark passages until he reached rannaldinis study rannaldini just back from new york was all suavity but my dear alpheus these things happen poor monk was rumoured to have hanged himself from the beam een your room but then legend weaves on legend like mees havishams cobwebs in these great houses i never tell you because you insist on biggest bedroom rannaldini gave alpheus a brandy but despite heavy hints did not invite him to move into the south wing but my wife cheryl flies in tomorrow she has a heart murmur i cannot subject her to this why dont you rent jasmine cottage suggested rannaldini just beyond paradise village on the opposite side of the valley hermione recently ave it redecorated im sure she would be appy to ave you there if liberty productions picked up the tab alpheus felt he could go with this a pretty cottage would be a more discreet venue to entice young women and he had clocked the fact that tabitha lovell lived just up the road after bidding him goodnight however rannaldini added silkily eef you must creep down my corridors every night to pleasure chloe alpheus dont wear that white hooded dressinggown you stole from the hilton milan how can my crew and cast get their beauty sleep eef they theenk you are ghost of charles v and grinning evilly he slammed the door in alpheuss frantically mouthing face in the morning as he was leaving valhalla to inspect jasmine cottage alpheus was somewhat spooked to meet percy the parson coming the other way with his smirnoff bottle of holy water to exorcize a ghost who was in fact himself i wish hed exorcize cheryl grumbled chloe who was getting less and less discreet about her affaire with alpheus whats cheryl like asked lucy as she painted a dark brown semicircle in chloes eye socket shortlegged noisy and goes for the jugular like a tweed jack russell said chloe sourly shes the personification of the word feisty i hope you two dont come to feistycuffs giggled lucy cheryl when she arrived was enchanted by jasmine cottage which had a modern kitchen a power shower a charming garden with a waterfall and a swing hanging from an ancient apple tree on her first evening a mischiefmaking rannaldini invited her to supper and to see the rushes which of course included chloe and alpheuss spectacular naked bonk this put cheryl into orbit hermione incensed that chloe looked so good vowed to steal alpheus from her later alpheus turned on by the rushes and feeling it might be expedient to pleasure his wife on her first night after all she had intimate knowledge of all his tax fiddles and could turn nasty suggested they christen the big brass bed at jasmine cottage it was not a success stoking away alpheuss notion of himself as the great lover was shattered by cheryl yapping shrilly you dont need to go on all night alpheus im not chloe you know nor were tempers improved by the driest spring on record rannaldinis streams were all disappearing blossom whipped off by the bitter east wind fell down the everwidening cracks in the paths on the parched sunny slopes saplings shrivelled and died in their cardboard tower blocks and poor bluebells faded and curled over without ever reaching their sapphire splendour there was less and less grass lucy watched the lambs skipping after rannaldinis groom janice as she brought them hay each morning tristan was anxious to dismantle the set in the great hall and move outside but he still hadnt shot hermiones nude scene with alpheus on the morning it was scheduled hermione rang tristan herself because howie was in tunisia i cant hear you hermione the voice whispered hermione sententiously she hasnt woken yet my body tells me i havent had enough sleep ill do my love scene tomorrow afternoon spitting tristan ordered wolfie to ring up alpheus and get him in to do a couple of cover shots but when wolfie called jasmine cottage an irate cheryl told him that alpheus had left for the set two hours ago as a result cheryl was soon yapping up rannaldinis drive and seeing chloe coming out of the omnia vincit amor gates on her way to the post office blacked her eye with her new crocodile handbag this caused huge consternation chloe had a starring role in the garden scene the day after tomorrow the chorus flora and mikhail whod nipped off to prague for the weekend were all due back for it tabitha had already booked some polo ponies you could change chloes eyepatch to the uvver eye suggested sexton non cried simone from continuity in outrage could you hide it with makeup lucy asked tristan not for a few days the eyes much too bloodshot only when tristan suggested she come out later for a consoling dinner did chloe stop sobbing into his shoulder and rush off to make up beseeching poor lucy to streak her hair for this exciting date cheryl meanwhile was roaring round valhalla in search of alpheus she was soon joined by forty members of dame hermiones fan club whod won a daily express competition entitling them to a day on the set of don carlos and whod just arrived by bus because hypealong the press officer was frogmarching baby through a series of interviews in london wolfie was deputed to show them round as they passed the mobile canteen wafting forth an enticing smell of boeuf provençal one of the fans asked about the dear little house next door it was a hunting lodge for act one but in the end we never used it explained wolfie throwing open the door he thought for a moment two of his fathers prize pigs had pushed their way inside then to his horror he realized he had caught alpheus and hermione in flagrante cheryl was about to black hermiones eye with her crocodile handbag when hermione rose to her feet wrapping a white hilton dressinggown round her goddesslike form crying cheryl my dear calm down alpheus and i were only rehearsing for tomorrow afternoon noone should act a scene without rehearsing such was the steamrolling force of hermiones personality they were all silenced the fans went off murmuring reverently that dame hermione was such a professional particularly when she ordered bubbly on the budget for them all at lunch everyone except chloe and cheryl was in stitches over the whole affair the crew wanted to know if alpheus had a crown on his cock what however a blushing wolfie reported back to tristan and sexton was that hermione had pubes bigger than brahmss beard i think she ought to trim it before she does a nude scene papa could have told her wolfie blushed even deeper but hes away how about mr brimscombe grinned sexton hed love to do it wiv a strimmer alpheus can tell her said tristan im busy you brief him sexton sexton however pussyfooted so much around the subject that alpheus went the whole hog and hermione rolled up on the set the following afternoon with a totally shaved bush this caused more rage and hysterics perhaps it was fashionable in the sixteenth century said sexton hopefully were filming in modern times snapped tristan get her some false pubes he ordered lucy its called a merkin volunteered granny hardly a word that occurs in crosswords giggled meredith during the film of carmen said griselda eagerly when lilian watson shaved her armpits by mistake make up had to hold up shooting for two hours while they stuck on individual hairs oh i couldnt said lucy aghast ive just spent even longer covering dame hermione with body makeup rather like varnishing the whale at the natural history museum said meredith sympathetically well just have to shoot her from the back said tristan who was torn between tears of despair and helpless laughter particularly when hermione summoned him and wolfie to her caravan to ask if they thought her breasts were too large you could always get some smaller ones from props said wolfie gravely and both men had to flee clutching their sides the set was absolutely crowded out mr brimscombe binoculars hanging from his scrawny neck was selling tickets at the door ross benson whod been smuggled in by a returned hypealong to do an indepth piece fell off a rafter fortunately landing on the great fourposter as he was very handsome dame hermione looked very excited tristan however flipped clear the set clear the fucking set please dont bother said hermione graciously where am i going to hide my microphone grumbled sylvestre who usually had to drop it down hermiones cleavage up her ass volunteered ogborne quiet please roared bernard lucy howled tristan then lowering his voice can you do anything about the blue veins on her boobs lucy darted forward with concealer murmuring dont you get nervous about taking your clothes off in front of all these people indeed not hermione looked amazed a woman should be proud of her body then in indignation why is that man reading dogs today very discourteous of him oh its you meredith i suppose you dont really count bernard grabbed tristans camera script to conceal a huge hardon were turning over he said hoarsely action shouted tristan christ alpheus isnt having to act in this scene at all hissed sylvestre to wolfie a few moments later hes bigger than a fucking thermos hermione ees supposed to be gritting her teeth uncle treestan whispered simone but she look as though she enjoy every minute cut said tristan then to hermione your husband is virtually raping you in this scene chérie could you possibly act a bit more upset there are beings tristan roguishly hermione quoted him back at himself who are born for others who are quite unaware of their own egos elisabetta had far too perfect manners to upset her elderly partner by showing him she wasnt having a good time tristan was defeated okkay okkay he sighed theyd just have to film her even more from behind id take a wide shot on this one he told valentin one could hardly do anything else oscar slumped over the camera ostensibly checking the lights through his eyepiece was actually asleep talk dirty to me alpheus murmured hermione who was used to being turned on by rannaldinis crooning obscenities unless sexton pays me cash like you murmured back alpheus i may have difficulty meeting next years tax bill chloe was utterly mortified alpheus had been pompous and selfregarding but i thought he loved me and would shelter me through life like a great tree she told tristan as she toyed with her scallops mornay in the heavenly host that evening plants growing in shade miss out on sun and rain said tristan chloes breasts leaping out of that crimson dress had the same springy texture as the scallops he decided you and baby are stealing the show he went on filling up her glass youll get your revenge on hermione when the reviews come out youre so beautiful chloe chloe glanced complacently at her reflection in a nearby mirror lucys streaking was so subtle the dark glasses over her blackened eye showed off the tilt of her nose and the luscious curves of her smiling crimson mouth she must buy lucy a box of chocolates tomorrow back at valhalla a weary lucy finished writing the days notes and stuck in polaroids of a naked hermione and alpheus at least she hadnt had to powder alpheuss cock and chloes lower lip was rather thin so shed had to extend the natural line along the bottom with a lipbrush and fill in quite a large gap but the end result had been heavenly particularly in that incredibly skimpy dress tristan had reeked of eau sauvage and even put on a suit out in the park as the orange glow of sunset died away the occasional bleat of a lamb and the deepthroated reassuring rumble of its mother reminded her of cumbria and made her long for tumbling grey streams geometric walls and mountains rising out of the mist why did one feel most homesick when one was miserable as tristan walked chloe back to the north wing she cursed herself for wasting so much of dinner bitching and talking about herself she wasnt used to dining with a good listener the lamp over the doorway shining through the clematis cast a leaf pattern on tristans face from the sides of his nose past his beautiful big mouth two lines dug trenches that had not been there in january don carlos was taking its toll your suite or mine she whispered there was a long pause an owl hooted darling chloe are you gay the leaf pattern quivered as he shook his head is there someone else something else rannaldinis back tomorrow i have two three hours work to do then when chloe looked sullen my father die last year your scene with alpheus was so like his paintings give me time chloe he kissed her cheek as he wandered off into the garden rain dripped through the wood like some chinese water torture the constellation of the virgin was chasing leo the lion across the sky when push came to shove and grunt he didnt want to sleep with chloe who as she undressed felt it would have been quite easy to get over alpheus if tristan had made a pass at her away from home for so long people started to lose their moorings groups formed and reformed cabals sprang up feuds and jealousies flourished as husbands lovers children were sometimes gladly forgotten poor rozzy pringle working flat out in both wardrobe and make up and sending most of her wages home couldnt forget glyn her horrible husband however because he was always ringing up to bombard her with complaints and demands when hes ratty sighed rozzy i can never tell if hes been dumped by one of his girlfriends or his business is in trouble again no work and all play makes glyn a kept boy observed meredith disapprovingly everyone loved rozzy who seemed to love everyone even the lascivious mr brimscombe who spent hours discussing plants with her and even gave her access to his toolshed lucy had filled a windowbox outside her caravan with loveinamist rozzy remembered to water it and took james for walks when lucy was too busy rozzy loved everyone but most of all she adored tristan for his kindness when her voice gave out she was always shoving buttered croissants and big cups of café au lait into his hands lucy had to curb tinges of irritation after all rozzy fussed over her too wardrobe had its own bendix to wash costumes rozzy put in lucys clothes and occasionally dragged tristans favourite peacockblue shirt off him when he became too obsessed with work to change it as cheryl had become extremely bolshie alpheus crinkled his eyes in the hope of getting his washing done too but drew a blank mobbing up bernard was a favourite location pastime but rozzy stuck up for him too bernard had insisted on his own little office facing south between wardrobe and the smokefilled ant hill of the production office here he could work out tomorrows movement order in peace and complete the figaro crossword which was faxed over to him every morning on the door was a notice saying first assistant director please knock so baby knocked when he went past come in what can i do for you asked bernard nothing at all it says please knock so i did bernard was apoplectic particularly when baby did it each time he went past and the habit caught on with everyone else they were all giggling about it in the canteen one lunchtime when rozzy lost her temper bernards a darling she shouted at them you only dislike him because hes good at shutting up chatterboxes she glared at baby and granny and he refuses to reschedule because someone she glanced reproachfully across at chloe wants to buzz off and sing carmen in paris who wrecked their voice in january singing all over europe snapped chloe i suppose you and bernard have the screaming hots for tristan de montigny in common parlez pour votre self drawled baby then chloe went as crimson as her lipstick because bernard was standing in the doorway the dreadful silence was only interrupted by the clatter and chatter of the canteen staff washing up but bernard was oblivious of chloe crossing the room he kissed rozzys hand thank you madame pringle may i buy you a drink with fractionally warmer weather filming moved outside to rannaldinis garden which had reached a pitch of late spring perfection tristan decided to kick off with a returning mikhail singing a beautiful aria to hermione alas mikhails english had been so incomprehensible the taxi driver picking him up at heathrow took him to rugby rather than rutminster mikhail rang in in tears saying he couldnt reach valhalla before early evening reluctant to waste hermione whod already spent three hours in make up bullying lucy tristan decided to shoot a later scene in which philip finds elisabetta unattended and sacks her favourite ladyinwaiting the countess of aremburg this was the nonsinging part in which he had cast rozzy which would at least get her name on the credits rozzy was only required to burst into tears but she was dreadfully nervous even of this piece of mime particularly as rannaldini had just returned from tokyo and was scowling from a new chair with executive producer printed on the back being called at such short notice rozzy had had no time to wash her hair which lucy was able to hide under a very pretty short curly wig or to remove a few hairs from her chin and upper lip some immac will take them off in a trice said lucy soothingly we havent got time quavered rozzy course we have lucy screamed hermione dont leave your old bags unattended quipped meredith as lucy belted off to hermiones caravan ive nicked a toenail moaned hermione and its sticking into my big toe have you got a plaster only to put over your mouth muttered lucy are you nearly ready luce wolfie appeared at the door my fathers about to boil over as a result lucy only had time to put a bit of slap on rozzy and pray that the dark base would hide any hairs before sylvestre arrived to mike her up alas poor rozzy struck down by nerves fled to the honeywagon from which because naughty sylvestre had not switched off the mike the whole crew could hear the sound of mount etna erupting mrs pringles got the runs giggled pushy galore pity shes not playing for england sighed ogborne theyre fiftytwo for four even bernard was smiling everyone however managed to compose their faces as rozzy arrived on the set except hermione who with merry laughter proceeded to explain the joke thats enough hermione snapped bernard seeing rozzy going crimson rozzy looks beautiful and the hair is very nice that style makes you look years younger conceded hermione but youre a little too red in the face probably a hot flush sighed rozzy oh no dear youre well past that lets go for a quick rehearsal tristan came off his mobile to aunt hortense rozzy you look wonderful he could make a warthog feel like helen of troy grumbled pushy im elisabettas ladyinwaiting i ought to be playing the countess she thought furiously as with the rest of the ladies of the chorus she bobbed around in front of a hedge of white roses trying to get into shot countess sang alpheus sternly at daybreak you will return to france burst into tears rozzy shouted tristan rozzys only problem would have been holding them back any longer particularly when hermione repeatedly stroked her face as she mimed her consoling aria and between takes loudly advised rozzy to invest in some decent electrolysis its well worth it at your age tears of such humiliation had gushed out of rozzys eyes that tristan was genuinely able to congratulate her on a wonderfully convincing performance which didnt cheer rozzy up one bit happily hermiones comeuppance was in train oscar who was not the most famous director of photography in the world for nothing had decided to avenge both chloe and rozzy that evening as everyone poured into the viewing room to watch the rushes all that could be heard was hermiones agitated squawking having lit her from beneath in her nude scene with alpheus oscar had made her bottom look enormous the great globe itself said granny in a sepulchral whisper you should have reduced it with a darker base lucy giggled meredith any moment david attenborough will pop up and lecture us sotto voce on the mating habits of the hippopotamus cried baby in ecstasy shouts of my bottom is not that big my bottom is not that big were drowned by cheers particularly from chloe who gave oscar a big kiss what are you doing after this she murmured i owe you tristan laughed but was cross with oscar because they ought to reshoot he was overruled by sexton and rannaldini who both liked big bums and small budgets do you know the meaning of the word callipygean asked sexton cosily as he tried to bear hermione away for a consoling drink hermione shrugged him off she wasnt going to let such a common little man take advantage alpheus had laughed as heartily as anyone over dame hermiones humiliation until rannaldini sidled up to him may i be honest alpheus you look in great shape in those nude shots alpheus preened but in future i think you should leave off the false nose it looks a leetle grotesque later on the terrace oblivious of an exquisite coral sunset hermione and alpheus could be seen berating a sleeping tristan sexton was not cast down by hermiones rejection he had just come back from cannes where showing a tenminute trailer of chloe and alpheus in the sack in order to sell more distribution rights hed had to massage even bigger egos than theirs now he retreated to the production office and continued four different deals on four different mobiles i may look calm he was fond of telling people but im not poor hypealong cassidy was not feeling calm either controlling the publicity was a nightmare hermione incensed that nothing about herself had appeared recently was unaware that her sacked makeup girl had just dumped in news of the world how i concealed dame hermiones turkey neck and how she ate technicians for breakfast hypealongs rise at dawn on sunday mornings to empty the village shop of papers was becoming a common occurrence hed also had terrible trouble with baby who when hed taken him up for interviews in london had fallen asleep over drinks with the guardian and on the way to lunch with lynn barber had jumped taxi to buy clothes in jermyn street and not been traced till the following day saddest of all tristan the person to whom everyone wanted to speak was so violently antipress he wouldnt give interviews at all hypealong however was working towards a quiet lunch at the old bell with valerie grove of the times i think oscar and chloe are an item griselda told everyone as chloe looked more and more magical in the rushes and oscar slept even more during the day but chloe was not out of the woods baby was watching porn on the internet one afternoon when up popped a teenage chloe cavorting with a black girl and a goat goodness gasped lucy when baby rushed in to tell her was the goat female i saw its udder shudder in mitigation it did appear to be having a good time i do hope rannaldini doesnt know about it shivered lucy im sure hed use it against her someone was pinching clothes from wardrobe especially ties griselda and simone whose continuity was being screwed up went out to the heavenly host to drown their sorrows and asked lucy to join them which at least gave lucy a chance to quiz simone about tristan whats his auntie hortense like a battleaxe who demand the whole time sighed simone and not at all motherly to uncle tristan when she drop him as a baby in drawing room she ring for maid to pick him up then simone added slyly valentin sylvestre and ogborne wanted to crash dinner tonight lucy they all fancy you but they know you only ave eyes for uncle tristan thats ridiculous spluttered lucy sending her glass of red flying of course i dont then as she frantically mopped up with her pink scarf i wouldnt dream dream is perhaps the only thing you should do said simone gently i love my uncle tristan but he is very damaged terrified by the ghostly sightings inside valhalla lucy had taken to sleeping outside in her makeup caravan which seemed less claustrophobic than those little cells and long dark spooky corridors but returning from the heavenly host as she scuttled past silent generators and empty darkwindowed hair and wardrobe departments she wasnt sure it would be so easy for a ghost to leap out from behind an empty lorry even the moon and the stars had deserted her as she approached her caravan still upset by what simone had said about tristan she froze at the sound of pitiful anguished sobbing oh god was it the ghost of caroline beddoes mourning her lost love the blacksmith you might at least try and look fierce she hissed at james whod stopped in his tracks with his head on one side the sobbing grew more pitiful lucys dutch courage evaporated whos there she quavered as she unlocked the caravan door screaming as a grey shadowy figure loomed over her then as she fumbled for the light switch she heard jamess bony tail whacking against the open door and rozzys choked voice saying dont turn it on i look so terrible and i dont want any of the others to know whatevers the matter let me get you a drink i dont want one lucy did as she fumbled her way to the fridge rozzy was racked by a fit of coughing then it all came tumbling out shed been to the doctor that evening to hear the result of some tests and been told shed got throat cancer oh rozzy lucy collapsed on the bench seat opposite there are lots of things one can do wept rozzy voice boxes treatment operations and things but my careers finished ill never sing again even worse were so broke lucy and im all weve got to live on i feel the prison doors clanging shut on a solvent future lucy was devastated youll be able to earn money as a pa everyone thinks youre brilliant you must get a second opinion the campbellblacks and rannaldini have a brilliant private doctor james benson i couldnt possibly afford him i can said lucy stoutly as she took a bottle out of the fridge youve been so good to me as soon as shed poured rozzy a drink lucy wrote her out a cheque for six hundred pounds after all she got paid at the end of the month later refusing all lucys entreaties to sleep in the caravan rozzy insisted on dragging herself back to the cells i dont want people suspecting anything you must tell glyn i cant rozzy started to cry again hell be so cross with me thank you lucy for being such a friend lucy didnt sleep all night thinking of a ravishing voice that would sing no more like a nightingale being strangled she had been sworn to secrecy but tristan seeing her red eyes next morning wheedled the truth out of her and was equally horrified pretending hed no idea that rozzy was ill he casually asked her out to dinner inevitably rozzy asked lucy to do her makeup i cant let tristan dine with an awful old hag at the old bell away from gossips tristan told rozzy hed been asked to direct der rosenkavalier at glyndebourne eef your voice is rested enough i would like you to sing the marschallin it wont be for two years it was lucky they were sitting in a dark alcove so noone could see rozzy weeping again tristan knew she would never be able to take up the offer she might be dead in two years if as lucy suspected she had secondaries elsewhere but at least it would give her hope next day rozzy was beside herself i never dreamed tristan thought that much of me she kept saying to lucy who was bitterly ashamed to find herself feeling irritated at the end of may the weather finally gave way to heatwave rozzy coughed more in the dry dusty heat and grew thinner her adoring eyes growing bigger in her shrunken face as she gazed at tristan bernard gazed longingly at rozzy but even on the hottest day he wouldnt take off his shirt in case it dented his authority he encouraged wolfie to do the same for the first year ever rannaldini didnt sprinkle his lawns so they would look more parched and spanish he allowed mr brimscombe to water only selected plants the rest could die of thirst thus realizing his plan of a buckingham palace sweep down to the lake which was getting perilously low again despite delays rows and nightmarish rescheduling beautiful scenes were being shot particularly of the great duet in which gallant posa defies philip ii on the subject of religious persecution here he so captivates the king he is nicknamed the kings favourite by the entire court it became a running gag on the set that anyone singled out by tristan became le favori du roi playing posa movingly however was not enough to mikhail who was getting bored paradise was a lovely little village but he wished there were more of it he was also frightfully jealous that baby was about to have a shoveandgrunt scene with chloe the occasion shot in the cowparsley in the shade of a huge lime to blot out the burning sun was not without incident they were just about to turn over when lucy hissed cover up chloe nous avons company it was percy the parson pretending to be birdwatching obviously looking for great tits said ogborne as with great presence of mind wolfie whipped off his dark blue polo shirt and pulled it over chloes head the beauty of his young broadshouldered body was lost on noone simone immediately took a polaroid oh hunky hunky dory sighed baby ive never been topless before joked wolfie to hide his embarrassment its baby the vicars mad about hissed chloe as percy raised his binoculars to peer through an elder bush better slip a dunces hat over his cock my cock is not a dunce may i have this dunce asked meredith who shouldnt have been there either as there were no sets to dress and everyone collapsed with laughter precious shadows drained away until at last percy moved on get wolfies shirt off chloe yelled tristan christ i feel like icarus about to melt he added taking off his directors cap to mop his brow with his arm at least you dont have to sustain a hardon grumbled baby dong carlos said chloe they had all corpsed once more when tabitha thundered round the corner on the engineer who shied violently and nearly unseated her the sight of tristan a halfnaked wolfie and all the crew leering joyfully at a naked chloe and baby additionally put her into orbit you disgusting perve she screamed at tristan turning yourselves on making revolting porn movies swinging the engineer round she galloped off in a cloud of dust pissed as usual drawled baby i dropped off a cheque for her husband last night even sharon was drunk dont be a bitch baby said lucy furiously shut up all of you shouted bernard seeing how upset tristan was but the fun had gone out of the day as chloe walked into the canteen wolfie handed her a big glass of iced lime juice oh you angel said chloe taking a great gulp will you marry me when you grow up im afraid theres rather a long queue piped up meredith id like a very small prawn salad maria darling maria the cook loved watching the french crew she loved the sensual way they tore apart their bread and undressed their prawns with beautifully manicured fingers knotting their napkins round their necks to protect their perfectly ironed shirts propping their knives and forks up on their plates savouring what they were eating drinking each glass of wine slowly and reflectively chattering all the time tristan although he often forgot to eat would make love in the same leisurely fashion imagined maria happily married with a baby on the way she could still allow herself to daydream she had been to the hospital for a scan the day before and proudly produced a photograph of the baby oh how lovely cried lucy ecstatically look at its nose and its head and little legs rather like et meredith took the photograph gingerly as if it were a newborn baby what a little angel said oscar who was the proud father of five hello tab shouted griselda as tabitha half sheepishly half defiantly sidled into the canteen and dropped her bag on an empty table come and look at this sweet little babba oh no lucy muttered but it was too late as tab gazed at the photograph tears trickled down her cheeks its adorable she whispered next moment she had fled what is the matter with that girl today grumbled ogborne someones left a bag said simone who noticed everything inside were only a tattered dick francis a bottle of evian a coutts switch card and photos of isa sharon and the engineer its tabs said wolfie not the sort to bother with a compact lipstick or even a comb said chloe dismissively she doesnt need to wolfie was amazed to hear himself saying behind his smooth broad fastbrowning back meredith and baby exchanged glances do you think he and tab are going to be the next item griselda whispered excitedly to simone who was suddenly looking very sad tab refused to answer her telephone but seeing her dirty green golf outside magpie cottage wolfie decided to return her bag in the teabreak through the car windows he breathed in great wafts of wild garlic pestled by rain and the soapy smell of the hawthorns in the lane up to magpie cottage light brown puddles reflected hedgerows and overhanging trees like an album of sepia photographs tabs lawn was blue with speedwell a few white irises were fighting a losing battle with the nettles round the eggyolkyellow front door the reek of more wild garlic from the woods behind didnt altogether disguise the stench of unemptied dustbins noone answered the bell so wolfie let himself in tabitha cuddling sharon on the sofa was wearing a pale green vest a bikini bottom dirty gym shoes and was watching racing on television with the sound turned down her face was deathly white except for her reddened eyes but nothing could take away the beauty of her long pale legs what are you doing here she asked sharon who had better manners jumped down and brought wolfie a small rug revealing a pile of dust wolfie handed tab her bag i brought this back thanks staggering to her feet kicking an empty halfbottle of vodka under the sofa antagonism fighting with loneliness in her eyes tab asked him if hed like a cup of tea wolfie followed her into the kitchen and nearly fainted im sorry tab smashed a cup as she tried to get the kettle under the tap in a hopelessly overcrowded sink i only tidy up before isa comes back she had cut herself on the cup tugging off a piece of kitchen roll wolfie wrapped it round her finger then started to load the contents of the sink mostly glasses into the dishwasher which was empty except for a shoal of silver on the bottom hows your marriage he asked a bed of roses wolfie looked sceptical with the thorns sticking upwards said tab you could stop drinking i dont drink at all ive given up whats this then wolfie produced the evian bottle out of her bag tab brightened id forgotten that i think were out of teabags fretfully she opened a cupboard and a lot of pasta packets descended on her head oh christ wed better have a slug of that instead but before she could grab the evian bottle wolfie had emptied it into the sink whydya want to waste perfectly good alcohol screamed tab now what am i going to do go to aa one is supposed to meet rather nice men there i might find a new husband ill take you along there must be a rutminster branch ill check out the time of the next meeting just stop it tab flared up again hearing a patter on the trees outside wolfie glanced across the valley at tassels of rain hanging from the clouds they wouldnt be shooting for a bit why had she been so upset at lunchtime he asked knowing the answer but feeling she needed to talk it reminded me of my own baby muttered tab isa wont discuss it wont really discuss anything then i got a letter from mummy this morning raving about my brother marcuss recital in moscow and how charming alexei marcuss lover was being i bet she drives him crackers and the mean old cows locked her bedroom door so i cant help myself to her stuff wolfie laughed but noticing tab shivering unearthed a bottle of orange squash poured an inch into a mug and switched on the kettle as she talked even if everyone else thought i was a nightmare tab was saying i was always convinced i could whistle daddy back marrying isa was the easiest way to hurt him christ i need a drink wolfie poured the boiling water on to the orange squash have this instead and another thing tab was pacing round the kitchen everyone cooing over the photograph of that baby reminded me how jealous and awful i was when my stepsister perdita arrived and even worse when daddy and taggie adopted xav and bianca i tried to be good but i wasnt as she hung her blonde head she reminded wolfie of the cowslips fading in the valley so did i he said roughly i was papas first child and now i have seven stepbrothers and sisters not to mention little cosmo and a pack of illegits and i wanted to kill each one when it arrived i remember thinking when will papa ever have the tiniest bit of love or time left for me you do make me feel better sighed tab if mummy suddenly gets pregnant we can drown our sorrows as she took a sip of orange squash listlessly wolfie noticed how thin her arms were when did you last eat dunno the telephone rang you answer it tab led him back into the sitting room if it were isa it might make him sit up but it was bernard breathing fire gotta go said wolfie putting down the receiver then blushing would you like to have dinner tonight men dont ask me out for a second wolfie thought tab was going to cry youre like a very rare and beautiful orchid he stammered people feel they ought not to pick you thats nice for a second tab examined wolfies dark blue eyes matching his polo shirt his squarejawed slightly oldfashioned action man features his reddish complexion turning brown he would make a good dependable friend id like to she said ill take you to shakos wed never get in wanna bet there are advantages in having a famous surname we can take your dustbins to the tip on the way oh look theres daddy tab lurched towards the television turning up the sound and fingering her fathers face wolfie and he were both tall and blond but it was like comparing a cob with a thoroughbred rupert had just paid seventyfive thousand to make a late entry in the derby thats a lot of money john oaksey was saying you must be sure peppy koalall do well very said rupert oh my god tabitha had turned as pale green as her vest if peppy koala wins isa will murder me she rang at nine oclock just as wolfie was leaving valhalla her voice slurred im sorry i cant make it course you can ive already left the heatwave chugged on between filming people played croquet and tennis swam in rannaldinis beautiful pool got lost in the maze and helped granny knit squares of his patchwork quilt the hawkeyed simone went round routing out sunbathers because a tan screwed up continuity rozzy watered dying plants sewed thousands of seed pearls on an ivory satin dress for hermione to wear at philip iis coronation and kept wonderfully cheerful dr james benson had been so kind to her she told lucy with passionate gratitude he was such an attractive sympathetic man whenever rozzy had to disappear for treatment lucy covered up for her explaining shed had to rush home to deal with some domestic problems lucy spent much of her spare time surreptitiously making rozzy a wig as befitting an international maestro rannaldini jetted in and out criticizing everything and everyone slowing down filming when it was already disastrously behind schedule and sending costs spiralling rumours of the runaway budget were sweeping europe and hollywood tristan had already ploughed in five million and seen it vanish mostly in merediths decorating costs it was as though rannaldini had thrown petrol over the notes and set fire to them but tristan couldnt stop to worry about money finishing the film was all that mattered alpheus too was making no attempt to keep down the budget having finally screwed a jaguar out of sexton he now wanted a runaround for cheryl hes already giving her the runaround observed baby as every day wearing face masks alpheus and pushy jogged bouncily off into the yellowing park poor cheryl spent a lot of time spying up trees and was mistaken for a member of the press by mr brimscombe who removed her ladder to much squawking hermione insisted on her limo to and from river house being on permanent standby she also demanded unlimited champagne and fresh flowers each day both in her caravan and on her sunhat she still thought sexton was a nasty common little man for curbing her expenses everyone knew caviare like seminal fluid was good for the vocal cords nor was sexton setting a very good example his worries about the budget had not deterred him from employing a ravishing new production secretary called jessica on the flimsy grounds that her telephone manner kept the backers sweet clearly she had not been hired for her typing copies of her first memo from sexton please will all the cast assemble for a publicity shit in the great hall at twelve moon were already circulating the unit after a nice break with george flora was back to accompany chloe in the veil song for this tristan had introduced a chorus of ladiesinwaiting picked from the prettiest extras who would be seen poring over tatler and playing bridge and tennis eboli or rather chloe would dazzle in tennis whites flora as the queens detective would flirt and strum chloes racquet like a mandolin flora terrified of acting was further demoralized to discover her old enemy serena westwood the record producer had rolled up to see how filming was going even with temperatures in the nineties serena in an applegreen suit looked as though shed just come out of the fridge she had also brought fouryearold jessie who little cosmo promptly pushed into the lily pond uncle roberto had regrettably displayed a similar lack of chivalry towards jessies mother he had dropped her after the recording and refused to answer any of her telephone calls lunching in the canteen serena and helen who had no idea that serena had had an affaire with rannaldini which she was frantic to reignite were joined by hermione in her big straw hat decorated with yellow roses the three women were all old flames of floras george and not realizing flora had wandered in were loudly agreeing how attractively macho george was and how anyone so rich and powerful could free himself in five minutes to marry flora if he really wanted to how old is george mused serena about a year younger than me said helen we used to laugh about his being my toyboy hermione as rannaldinis longterm mistress detested any suggestion that helen might be attractive to other men when were you fifty dear she enquired beadily was it in or helen choked on her spinach and bacon salad i am not fortyfour yet hermione she said furiously arent you dear said hermione blithely then peering into helens face those chandeliers meredith installed are quite lovely but not very flattering if youre heavily lined after the movie id encourage rannaldini to return to more subdued lighting a hush had fallen on the canteen glancing round serena saw chloe killing herself and flora looking extremely unhappy and hastily asked after george hes working in germany mumbled flora serena raised eyebrows plucked thin as the new moon is that wise my bobbys in australia chipped in hermione but we have a relationship of trust grabbing a mars bar and a packet of crisps for trevor flora retreated chuntering to make up to find lucy also going spare on the premise that she adored children little jessie had been dumped on her to stop her prattling during takes jessie having upended lucys makeup box was now trying to rouse james from his siesta by tickling his long nose with a powder brush hes going to take her hand off in a minute let trevor do the honours said flora sourly he loathes children oh hell rannaldinis just rolled up in that flash orange car hell be wearing white polonecks soon and combing his hair in little tendrils over his forehead sleek suntanned satanic rannaldini promptly decided the veil song needed gingering up with a spot of sapphic necking between flora and one of the ladiesinwaiting who shall we choose murmured rannaldini chloe perhaps although maybe even randy little tebaldo wouldnt risk jumping on the kings mistress running his eye lasciviously over the chorus he noticed pushy bobbing around in rosered gingham like an apple under a waterfall and beckoned her over even lucy couldnt calm an hysterical flora as she applied designer stubble to her ashen cheeks flora took foxie her puppet fox and adored mascot everywhere with her but this time she wailed foxie must stay in the caravan with james and trevor in case he became corrupted foxies face must be turned to the wall the light was ravishing a rare downpour had brightened the late spring greenery unearthly white lilacs wafted forth heavenly scent a froth of cowparsley merged into the rosetipped barley then as chloe and flora sang about the randy king trying to seduce a veiled beauty flora had to act out the scene with pushy just a quick snog tristan patted her padded grey linen shoulder i cannot go on thought flora after they had notched up twenty nightmarish takes because she was groping pushy with all the enthusiasm of one defleaing a rabid dog even the cuckoo mocked her from a nearby ash grove ah weave your veils fair maidens sang the chorus as they swayed about desperate to get into shot taking a sadistic pleasure in how much this must be hurting serena helen and hermione rannaldini kept strolling over to show flora exactly how the pass should be made which pushy clearly adored judging from the way she giggled and wriggled beneath his wandering hands he would then seize floras hands and slap them like a weathermans suns on various embarrassing parts of pushys anatomy maestro rannaldini gives off enough electricity to make the generators superfluous said a disapproving voice more cheerfully australia are two hundred and fifty for no wicket it was baby eating a large strawberry ice remember the times ive had to snog dame hermione he whispered to flora just shut your eyes and think of income then when she didnt laugh he grabbed foxie from lucys caravan and clasping his furry puppet paws together kept raising them above his head like a cheerleader its no good crying hissed rannaldini as a tear trickled down floras cheek the reek of decaying wild garlic indistinguishable from the breath and armpits of the crew was making her feel sick how dare those three witches serena helen and hermione sit there despising her how dare wolfie fill in his lottery tickets oh darling george prayed flora come to my rescue and suddenly floras prayer was answered as george unable to resist checking how shooting was going ruined the first perfect take by noisily landing his helicopter in the next field well go again shouted tristan storming through the buttercups terrible as an army with banners george saw that devil incarnate rannaldini and that smooth bastard montigny his peacockblue shirt flapping against his lean taut dark gold body and wolfgang blond as a nordic god and baby a laughing cupid and hundreds of smarmy frogs leering over his darling flora as she groped some ringleted tart but he misread the excitement on their faces as desire when it was in fact delighted anticipation that someone might at last be going to take out rannaldini either way george flipped bellowing at tristan sending cameras and crew flying ordering flora off the set george grabbed rannaldini by his white sharkskin lapels threatening to bury him until clive and his pack of heavies dragged him off analysing it afterwards flora wondered guiltily if it had been because george was looking so uncharacteristically redfaced and sweaty and because his wool suit it had been cold in düsseldorf first thing suddenly looked too tight for him but irrationally she also flipped i cant walk off in the middle of a take its totally unprofessional she screamed its only a grope you bloody victorian prude pack your stooff were going yelled back george we are not flanked by bodyguards rannaldini went on the offensive didnt you ear the lady as george swung around the hatred so distorted his face that flora thought he was going to kill rannaldini ill get you you wop bastard he bellowed then without a backward glance he stumbled off in the direction of his helicopter and youre not having custody of trevor flora screamed after him why dont you go into the diplomatic service rannaldini sighed baby who do i have to sleep with to get off this movie wailed a shaking flora tristan laughed then told her how sorry he was im going to london tonight ill take you somewhere fantastic tomorrow evening after that flora completed the scene in one take baby not unpleased by the turn of events also comforted flora he would buy her dinner tonight and then if she still needed to drown her sorrows they would go on to ogbornes birthday party rolling up at magpie cottage to take tabitha to ogbornes party wolfie was horrified to go slap into isa unexpectedly returned from australia the odds on peppy koala for the derby had been shortening alarmingly rannaldini was furious at losing the colt and not wanting to lose him as an owner or tab as a wife in no particular order isa had decided to stay awake and attend the party to protect his property he had missed tabs birthday at the beginning of june but had brought her back more quercus the sweet lemony scent he loved it smelled wonderful on her just bathed body but it didnt match up to wolfies present a short sleeveless pale blue suede dress from hermès held up on one slender shoulder by a silver chain it was also a reward tab hadnt had a drink for three weeks she looked so beautiful wolfie could hardly breathe particularly when she flung her scented arms round his neck whispering it was the loveliest dress shed ever had isa was looking extremely wintry over at ogbornes party which was taking place around rannaldinis swimmingpool a relay race crew against cast was in deafening progress the crew was tipped to win because rannaldini a powerful swimmer who wanted to show off his rippling muscles and flashy crawl had graciously joined their side bernard looks more like a walrus than ever chloe whispered to simone as the crew were held back by the first assistant directors ponderous breaststroke lucy due to take over from bernard quivered on the edge of the pool dying to hide her white body under the water having spent so much time on location in hot countries however she swam very well spurred on by the sight of rannaldini the crews last swimmer poised to plunge into ferocious action she streaked up the pool to roars of applause bravo lucy as she lurched forward to touch the brass rail rannaldinis mahogany body flew over her head alas alpheus the casts last swimmer had had an olympic trial and emerged like an otter at the other end beating an enraged rannaldini by yards vowing to take both pushy and cheryl off alpheus rannaldini stormed off to change there was a chorus of wolf whistles as lucy climbed panting out of the pool pity youre always hiding that gorgeous body under a shirt and jeans miss latimer yelled ogborne who was now wearing hermiones rosetrimmed sunhat on his shaved head already drunk he was doing very well for presents tab gave him a purple and white striped shirt from harvie hudson confessing that in her drinking days she had bought it four sizes too big for isa thank you said ogborne kissing her pity youre off the booze i was hoping to get a job carrying you home after parties tab giggled all the men had gasped when shed rolled up in wolfies blue suede dress then sighed in disappointment to see a lowering isa in her wake chloe however spotting fresh talent sidled up to isa alpheus the hero of the evening after his winning swim was having a wonderful time pushy who hed pleasured earlier in the long grass was looking very lovely and so was serena but noone outshone tabitha he was just edging towards her when he choked on a shrimp volauvent his wife cheryl had swept in a vision in cream lace showing even more boob than pushy you never told me you were coming he hissed you never asked hissed back cheryl meesus shaw you ave never look more enticing rannaldini equally radiant in pale beige linen clicked his fingers for clive to bring cheryl a glass of krug let me show you my garden then seeing serena moving in on him desperate for a showdown he grabbed a swaying hunk with fretted black charles ii hair serena my dear you must remember grannys partner giuseppe and shoving them together he whisked cheryl into the shrubbery wheres tristan asked tab who wanted him to see her in her beautiful new french dress gone to london said simone in a way its easier when my uncle is not here the women dont compete for him the men with him tab didnt think so at all and was very disappointed that giuseppe she stormed turning to wolfie with all the disapproval of the reformed drinker has just thrown up in rannaldinis delphinium bed and blamed marias paella the party roared on ogborne sylvestre and even newly married valentin were trying to get off with jessica sextons ravishing new production secretary chloe was finding isa desperately heavygoing why are you known as the black cobra she asked because im lethal isa yawned and looked at his watch he still hadnt made his number with rannaldini neither had serena desperate to win back rannaldini she flirted more and more outrageously with giuseppe until granny knitting quietly away under a walnut tree wanted to plunge his needles into rannaldinis heart for setting the whole thing up the evenings main topic of conversation however was george hungerfords flying visit and whether flora should have entered into the spirit of her part most of the crew said they would have been only too happy to grope pushy soon hermione was loudly putting her oar in i cannot understand why flora seymour made such a fuss i have often made love to young women on stage can you get me some comps in the front row next time youre at it called out an excited sexton to guffaws all round hermione flounced off trust such a common little man to lower the tone emerging stars reflected milkily in the silken green water the party was growing more raucous those with good bodies had started skinnydipping those roses need watering said valentin emptying a bottle of red over hermiones sunhat which was still on ogbornes head wheres flora asked simone having dinner with baby at the pearly gates said lucy no she isnt theyve just arrived crowed griselda as followed by trevor the terrier flora and baby drifted hand in hand through the buttercups i always said those two were an item oh grizel when will you learn sighed meredith ogborne dripping red wine and more delighted to have a stale pearly gates scotch egg from trevor than a magnum of moët from baby and flora patted the bemused little dog over and over again its the fort wot counts trevor my lad a snake in the water caused shrieks of horror particularly when baby fished it out by its tail and killed it with one crack on the side of the pool it turned out to be an adder people eat snake in australia he informed his admiring audience it tastes just like fanny how would you know asked ogborne pointedly my brother told me said baby to howls of mirth baby is so attractive sighed simone crashing around like a fretful moth searching for rannaldini hermione perked up when the singing started and she won first round in the notsofriendly fight to hog the microphone someone to watch over me was soon blasting squirrels and pigeons out of the trees within a halfmile radius baby after several snorts of cocaine was in a wicked mood his eyes glittering his bronze curls tangled round his handsome face griselda was thumping him on the back for being exactly the right weight at the moment when hermione charged up to them please protect me from that common little man which one griselda stared around sexton hissed hermione oh right said baby thoughtfully not many people know sexton went to eton eton said hermione incredulously eton certainly did sexton thought hed get on better in the film business if he acquired an east end accent so he took elocution lessons hes so modest he doesnt like to talk about his very grand family murmured griselda five minutes later she and baby were crying with laughter as they watched sexton looking as delightedly bewildered by hermiones unexpected attentions as trevor had over ogbornes scotch egg youre not to tease hermione was telling him roguishly one can always tell an etonian from his air of quiet authority i expect you played cricket against my very good friend rupert campbellblack who must have been at harrow at around the same time baby was so entranced he could hardly be dragged away to sing a nightingale sang in berkeley square with granny and mikhail oh i love this tune sighed flora she was just wondering where george was when baby sang and when you stopped and smiled at me and looking straight across at her jolted her with a lightning bolt of desire the moment the song was over baby launched into waltzing matilda and watched in amazement by the entire party seized floras hand and danced her off into the park round and round under the stars through the foam of cowparsley they were both so drunk they nearly fell over one of the set designers pots of paint near the cloisters seizing his brushes they were busy writing death to rannaldini with cackles of laughter on the chapel walls when they saw evil leatherclad clive gliding up on the right and hastily changed it to death to racism before running away gee its great after staying up late walking my baby back home floras piercingly sweet voice echoed round the valley as she bore baby up the valley to her parents house angels reach because shed promised to feed charity the cat what was rannaldini like in bed asked baby a genius mesmerizing imaginative with immense concentration but utterly depraved hed have taken me down to hell to their right was a long lake even shorter of water than rannaldinis white daisies spilt over a low stone wall lilies poured forth scent out of a tangle of weeds what was his watchtower like the top floors all bed with a mural of wildly applauding crowds in evening dress well have applauding clouds murmured baby idly stroking the nape of floras long neck beneath her short back and sides oh help thought flora i want to sleep with baby so badly but its a culdefuckingnosack ahead stone angels stretched up from each corner of the roof plucking star daisies out of a grey suede sky in protest against their being so late charity the cat had left a small disc of sick on the hall floorboards baby most resourcefully scraped it up with his platinum amex card seriously good pictures he said drifting from one big underfurnished room to another as flora opened a tin for charity and a bottle of moët my father owns a gallery where is he in london and up to no good probably hes very attractive like his daughter said baby he led her out into the garden waltzed her round and round until the stars joined in the dance and they collapsed on the dewy grass their hearts hammering for a second baby laughed down at her his bland brown unrepentant face irresistibly young and beautiful caught in the lights from the house then he kissed her rigid with shock flora clamped her mouth shut but such was the darting insistence of his tongue that her lips soon opened and she was kissing him back with ecstatic enthusiasm i thought you only liked men she gasped when she finally drew breath no more mr nice gay crowed baby i take the best of both sexes and you are definitely the best i fancy you absolutely squinteyed youre drunk flora made a last attempt to keep control but as he rolled her towards him to unzip her dress the warmth of his body melted her resistance i love george she mumbled into his smooth scented shoulder george has gone off like a prawn in the sun deserves all he gets oh you little beaut baby was a master of the tease running his fingers round the side of one nipple until every nerve of her breast was crying out stroking her belly over and over again letting his hand creep up her inner thighs just stopping short of her clitoris until she was screaming to have his cock inside her and even then he was totally in control when charity came out mewing in outrage that plastered humans had mistaken pedigree chum for gocat baby just laughed and said cattus interruptus he was so relaxed there were daisies and little shimmering moths all over the lawn and stars all over the sky gradually they seemed to merge im having such a heavenly time mumbled flora but im far too drunk to come wanna bet sliding out of her turning her over baby kissed each bump of her backbone slowly slowly progressing downwards oh my god oh my god yes i thought youd enjoy that do i taste of snake mumbled flora no only of paradise how dyou know so much about women asked flora as they lay back stupefied with pleasure on the grass i used to be married what flora sat bolt upright to a singer why did it break up baby took a slug of moët she asked me what i thought of her in the verdi requiem i was foolish enough to tell her she never spoke to me again did you mind nope isnt it rather immoral pretending youre gay when youre not certainly not however would i get rid of all those ugly cows if they suspected i was heterosexual you are seriously degenerate said flora as they fell asleep in each others arms waking cold stiff and horribly hung over in the morning flora was demented how could she have done this to george hed never forgive her if he found out rannaldini had spies everywhere and was bound to tell him im being punished for shortchanging that cat she moaned as she crunched around on the gocat the furious charity had upended all over the kitchen floor i will take care of you said a totally unfazed baby but when flora returned crawling with embarrassment to her dressing room at valhalla she found her puppet fox had been cut to tiny pieces flora went berserk she had had foxie since she was a baby he had always brought her luck without his protection george would never come back and who could have cut him up rannaldini helen hermione and serena all hated her so did wolfie and probably pushy bernard and sexton after yesterdays débâcle or perhaps some admirer of babys outraged shed got off with him last night it was all dreadfully frightening everyone was very sympathetic particularly rozzy who gathered up fragments of orange fur and said shed soon sew foxie together again rozzys so lovely a tearful flora told baby if only she could get rid of that horrible husband and find some heavenly lover hard to kiss a woman whose mouths always full of pins flora was far too miserable to have dinner with tristan that night tab too was absolutely miserable isa was back in australia so wolfie came and watched the derby with her at magpie cottage then she had the exquisite but agonizing pleasure of seeing rupert and his entourage in their grey top hats streaming solemn as warlords into the paddock to watch peppy koala saddling up look theres lysander and declan daddys partner she told wolfie and billy lloydfoxe who was his great showjumping mate and ricky francelynch and bas baddingham his old polo friends whos that blonde asked wolfie thinking she was beautiful my halfsister perdita uptight bitch thats her husband luke alderton hes a saint heavens marcus has flown back from moscow that must be nemerovsky his boyfriend look at the stupid poof showing off tab added furiously as a smiling nemerovsky waved his top hat to acknowledge the cheers of the crowd wolfie whod been at boarding school with marcus thought how happy he looked here comes taggie hissed tabitha as her stepmother ravishing in a fuchsiapink silk suit and a big violet hat was towed into the paddock by a thoroughly overexcited xav and bianca bloody hell tab took a long slug of perrier splashing her face children shouldnt be allowed in the paddock particularly loose she added angrily as xav and bianca rushed forward to hug peppy koala and that geek with his hat on the back of his head is peppys owner mr brown mr brown apart thought wolfie wistfully they were the most glamorous selfassured bunch tabs world how presumptuous to hope he could ever be part of it god what a beautiful horse another slug of perrier spilt over tabs face as ruperts jockey wearing mr browns colours bright blue dotted with white stars like the australian flag mounted a dancing peppy the little colt gave all his supporters a heart attack by dawdling at the back until the last furlong then putting on a staggering burst of speed he bounded past the toiling field to win by three lengths having screamed her head off with excitement tab proceeded to sob so wildly wolfie couldnt help her i miss them all so much mr brown refused to give peppy to isa because he thought isa was cruel to me thats what isa will never forgive neither did the derby result please rannaldini how could isa have let peppy koala slip through his fingers to goad tab rannaldini summoned her to his study a week later to watch a big australian race on cable isa was riding a dark brown mare who won as effortlessly as peppy koala as usual he was mobbed by groupies tab on the other hand was more upset to see his deadpan face break into a smile as martie his allegedly exgirlfriend looking scruffier and shinier than any of the grooms ran forward to hug him after the race very well ridden said rannaldini softly but he could spend a leetle more time in england training my horses then seeing tab gnawing her lower lip and i dont think he is paying you quite enough attention my angel to justify a free rent in that lovely cottage put him in the debtors chair where is it by the way somewhere much more exciting remind me to show you some time but tab had fled sobbing from the room tristan meanwhile was spending more and more evenings in lucys caravan he was obviously not sleeping and everyone was draining him with their insecurities and petty rivalries as he heroically battled to keep within budget and rannaldini at bay he was trying to smoke less which made him very uptight and unwillingly yielding to hypealongs pleas he had finally agreed to talk to valerie grove of the times in the hope that some good publicity might calm the backers in the past he had stuck up for rannaldini but as lucy cut his hair for the interview he repeatedly returned to the attack hes like evil octopus with tentacles everywhere thinking how thickly and beautifully tristans hair curled into his neck lucy struggled against the temptation to stroke it then he nearly lost an ear as he switched to the subject of tabitha rannaldini is so crazy about her he inveigle her into marrying that absolute shit isa lovell now he plays games with her like iago she came out of his study crying this afternoon lucy fought despair thank god rozzy had rolled up with a bottle to cheer tristan up rozzy was relieved that she only had a hundred or so more seed pearls to sew on hermiones coronation dress next morning lucy was terrified to discover slug pellets in jamess water bowl perhaps someone had just missed the windowbox or perhaps she thought wryly people were jealous because tristan spent so much time in make up but it was only because he was desperate to talk about tab she had further evidence that afternoon when hermione who she was making up for her great renunciation scene with carlos announced shed heard a horrid rumour that tristan was queer of course hes not exploded lucy well thats what theyre implying silly really hermione gave her horrible little laugh that with so many pretty women to choose from tristans spending his evenings with and also that makeup girls usually stick to their own kind and drink with the sparks and the chippies then seeing lucys face she added but i stuck up for you lucy i said you had quite a warm personality and anyway beauty is in the eye of the beholder oh belgian chocolates lucy was about to snap that they were a thankyou present from tristan for cutting his hair when hermione opened the box and found one white truffle left my favourite she cried although ive already got a handsome hubby and a thousand a year wouldnt go far these days she was just about to eat it when lucy snatched away the box james loves white truffles she insisted and opening the amazed dogs jaws shoved it into his mouth hermione was furious when you think of flora and that wretched terrier and tab drooling over that labrador she said beadily it is extraordinary how women who cannot get it together with a man become dependent on a companion animal james spat out the white truffle bloody chippies exploded lucy merediths carpenters building a cathedral for the auto da fe and banging away all morning had given her a blinding headache she was so cross she gave hermione a parsnip yellow complexion ageing grey shading hideous violet eye shadow and a wonky lipline hermione was so busy reading about her health in the daily mail that she didnt notice tristan did however and remonstrated sharply with lucy well if she was about to give carlos the push and she loved him to bits she would look grotty shouted back lucy ma petite tristan looked at her in amazement this is first time i see you angry you are so sweet and he ruffled her hair patronizing bastard muttered lucy she was so fed up that she knocked back nearly a bottle of white at lunchtime and stuck colin miltons bald wig on back to front colin was so taken by the sight of himself with a youthful fringe of grey curls nestling on his eyebrows that he would happily have let it stay tristan however went ballistic and yelled at lucy to stop taking the piss the auto da fe which means act of faith is one of the most terrifying scenes in all opera heretics in dunces caps are paraded through the streets by their executioners and followed by sinister blackcowled monks who with the courtiers and ladiesinwaiting take up their seats round the funeral pyre a newly crowned philip comes out of the cathedral and repeats his coronation oath to defend the faith the scene ends with his dreadful words and now on with the festivities the masses are then entertained not by fireworks but by the heretics being burnt at the stake lasting twenty minutes in the opera even tristans pareddown version took eight gruelling days to shoot the harrowing nature of the subject exacerbated rannaldinis sadism meredith and his chippies had only just completed their ravishing cathedral façade looking on to the east courtyard when rannaldini swept in on the first day of shooting and pronounced it utterly suburban just like a weybridge hacienda are we going to have chiming doorbells celebrating the burning of the heretics meredith promptly burst into tears it took all tristans tact to stop him resigning lucy had visions of being asked to streak merediths hair for yet another dinner at the heavenly host fortunately sexton rocked up and told meredith he thought the cathedral was just beautiful and he ought to know whispered hermione reverently sexton did go to eton hermione was also delighted that after weeks of work griselda and rozzy had finally sewn the last seed pearl on her ivory satin dress her first appearance wearing it that afternoon caused gasps of wonder and genuine applause from the crew a second later rannaldini had erupted on to the set and everyone glanced at the sky in excitement then to their horror they realized that what they had imagined as the patter of rain was the scattering of thousands of pearls as rannaldini ripped off the dress and stamped it into the dust with his suede boots hermione in her petticoat screamed and screamed oscar crossed himself it was like seeing a velazquez slashed in the prado tristan grabbed rannaldini in whitehot fury what the fuck are you doing that was the most beautiful dress i ever see elisabetta must wear scarlet yelled back rannaldini at her husbands coronation to symbolize in philips crazy mind she has been unfaithful all those pearls all those pearls whispered rozzy whod done nearly all the work a devastated hysterically sobbing griselda had to be carried off the set by a buckling lucy and simone everyone was outraged they loved griselda indefatigable gossipy old trout they knew she was good the crew would have walked out if rannaldini hadnt built massive penalty clauses into all their contracts instead they went slow with oscar waking up to relight every ten minutes all the crew were putting in impossibly long hours but noone more so than wolfie once again his greatest headache was stopping pushy galore appearing in everything having waved a flag as a member of the hoipolloi and simpered as a ladyinwaiting pushy was determined to star as a heretic and was utterly incensed when tristan chucked her out you wait till ay tell sir roberto fortunately rannaldini had flown off to vienna and was not expected back until the evening pushy was even crosser when tristan chose tab instead she would look so touching a dunces cap on her blonde head her deadpan face smudged tab was terribly excited wolfie less so supervising the filling of petrol cans with water he couldnt bear the thought of her beautiful body being torched the drought was so terrible it was as if meredith had carpeted the surrounding fields brown wild flowers that had survived were a quarter of their usual height wolfie disappeared in a cloud of dust as he drove his land rover round the park all the cast complained nonstop about not being able to breathe wolfie could have burnt the lot of them on the bonfire it was the last setup before lunch as surrounded by leatherclad paparazzi with tristans four black cypresses in the background overseeing things granny as gordon dillon took up his position on the battlements of the cathedral while the heretics were tied to the stakes below shredded piles of the scorpion were thrown under their bare feet as people in the sixteenth century flocked to see heretics burn today we devour the papers and gloat over reputations being destroyed explained tristan think of the poor duchess of york think of chloe in a week or two murmured flora to baby out in the park through the heat haze they could see chloe ravishing in palest pink having her photograph taken for the scorpion hotfoot from a very promising samson and delilah audition she had returned to valhalla for an indepth interview with beattie johnson the scorpions most dreaded columnist beattie had written to chloe direct claiming she was a longterm fan of chloe and the opera i can handle the press chloe had told hypealong haughtily when he expressed horror at the planned interview having read chloes cuttings and a pagelong synopsis of don carlos in the limo driving down beattie johnson was highly diverted to see the identical twin of her notorious boss gordon dillon on the battlements and was now shredding reputations off the record of course with chloe lucy whod already had to make up chloe as well as the cast was having a day from hell the gruesome concept of an auto da fe upset her dreadfully her passport had gone missing and shed spent two hours looking for it her back from so much bending was killing her shed have gone straight to james benson if she hadnt given more money to rozzy whod been in tears all morning this was because after a weekend at home rozzy had forgotten floras newly repaired puppet fox and done a uturn only to find her horrible husband glyn and his glamorous housekeeper sylvia opening a bottle to celebrate her departure i cant go on shoring everyone up thought lucy in despair having not had any breakfast she was feeling faint and decided to grab a salad from the canteen where she found chloe and beattie johnson two glamorous blondes sharing a bottle of muscadet bernard the first assistant has a thumping great crush on rozzy pringle chloe was whispering whos she oh beattie giggled chloe you must have heard of rozzy shes so refined she pees eaudecologne both women shrieked with laughter lucys blood started to boil here comes tristan hissed beattie you must introduce me shes got the hard set little face of a terrorist waiting to lob a bomb into all our lives thought lucy ive seen all your films beattie was now telling tristan lucy was on her way out when she heard tristan whod taken an empty seat at the table explaining the auto da fe to beattie the spaniards are experts at ritualistic torture he was saying look at the ballet of killing the bull in the same way auto da fe sets fire to humans in dunces caps to humiliate and express power of church i love spanish men said chloe who hadnt been listening me too sighed beattie well youre both stupid bitches said a furious voice looking round everyone was amazed to see a trembling redfaced lucy holding a tray off which a glass of orange juice and a salad were sliding i hate spaniards hate hate hate them she went on hysterically when greyhounds are past their sellby date in england theyre sold to spain where theyre raced into the ground oh purlease chloe raised her eyes to heaven but the fucking spaniards are too stingy to shoot them or put them down so they string them up in the woods with their toes just touching the ground and have bets on which is going to die first it takes hours the poor dogs scream in agony like the heretics and you like fucking spaniards the appalled silence was broken by lucys salad crashing to the ground and orange juice spilling all over chloes new pink dress flora baby and granny leapt to their feet but tristan reached lucy first its all right sweeteart of course its terrible whether its greyhounds or heretics but lucy had wriggled out of his arms and shouting why dont you have a word with king carlos i bet he shot partridge with your father she fled sobbing back to her caravan dear dear drawled chloe when makeup artists start having tantrums the rot has set in oh shut up yelled flora tristan was about to go after lucy when bernard seized his arm and dragged him off to an urgent meeting in sextons office this tristan did not enjoy the budget sexton told him bleakly had hit twentytwo million and was still climbing tristan must hurry up the crew after a snide piece in the stage picked up by the nationals the backers were getting antsy rannaldini must be persuaded to release more money when he returned tonight he wont unless we allow him to do his sodding introductions tristan unwrapped another piece of chewinggum god he needed a cigarette sexton was just saying he couldnt pay this weeks wages when tab barged into the room whats that bitch doing here get out bellowed bernard she was daddys mistress between marriages stormed tab she nearly ruined him she stopped him and taggie adopting babies in england she got abby rosen sacked and she outed my brother marcus shes the most evil woman in the world who are you talking about beattie johnson whos interviewing chloe said tab in that big black bag are a hammer and nails to crucify her victims thats blasphemous exploded bernard but a shrewd assessment agreed sexton if beattie stitches us up the backers really will pull out tristan wrinkled his brow i think shes a friend of rannaldini wed better throw her out before he gets back he found beattie buttering up pushy if you werent so lovely people would take you more seriously as a singer sir robertos always sayin that he says you stand out from all the other extras aym not an extra aym a featured extra said pushy haughtily off the record how well do you know alpheus shaw what a hunk tristan had heard enough beattie was incandescent with rage when he told her that a car with her suitcases all packed in the boot was waiting to take her back to london do not say liberty productions does not evict with style he added as he opened the door for her chloe was also insane with anger we hadnt even begun the interview yet everything was off the record every inch of that evil frame is taped said tristan spurred on by his meeting with sexton he returned to the set determined to dispatch the last gruesome seconds of the auto da fe in one stint it was even hotter hermione was flushing up in her new red dress from versace flora and granny sweltered in their dark suits but not nearly so much as alpheus in his gold regalia or baby mikhail and the courtiers in their erminetrimmed peers robes as lucy tearstained after her outburst at lunchtime rushed round trying to cool people down with a chamois leather soaked in cologne baby could be heard grumbling that hed be barbied without going near any stake if you confessed at the last moment you could be strangled before you were burnt to death volunteered a listless flora who hadnt heard from george since her night with baby to capture the intense drama tristan was using a crane to film from above with valentin and his camera on a tiny platform hanging twenty feet above the funeral pyre it would be a wonderful shot tracking over the excited crowd the bigwigs of church and state in their gilded regalia and the poor doomed victims the head of props waited with his finger on the button of the smokemachine the flames would be added later by special effects take that i survived don carlos badge off at once baby ordered bernard quiet please everyone ok lets go for a quick rehearsal shouted tristan from a firstfloor window shit muttered valentin who from his platform could see an orange lamborghini diablo sneaking up the drive rannaldinis back ignore him snapped tristan in moved the paparazzi like a firing squad their long lenses trained on the heretics swiftly the executioners chucked petrol cans of water on the shredded scorpions then flicking on their lighters pretended to set fire to the damp newsprint cue for smoke yelled tristan and a white cloud engulfed the heretics excellent let it clear he shouted and well go for a take adjusting his directors cap to a more military angle tristan felt a surge of power as he looked down at the huge crowd he was a general commanding a mighty army the landscape shimmered with heathaze a hot breeze ruffled the redtipped barley into flickering flames he was just shuddering at the thought of tabs body being burnt to death when he was roused by a dreadful screaming and fantasy became reality as the shredded newspaper beneath her stake burst into flames and flared up around her for a moment everyone was motionless with horror then as the screaming grew more terrified tristan leapt straight down into the smoke miraculously landing safely on the stony courtyard its all right chérie diving for the rope tying her to the stake aware of flame caressing his chest his long fingers somehow managed to untie the knot without fumbling a moment later he had dragged tab to safety beating out the flames snaking up her yellow heretics robe feeling no pain except that of frantic worry he dragged the peers robes off a horrified extra and rolled tab in them it was over in thirty seconds next moment wolfie whod been watching from a secondfloor window hurtled into the courtyard yelling is she ok get the paramedics for christs sake the front of tabs hair her long blonde eyelashes and her eyebrows were singed there was a terrible stench of burning but she didnt appear hurt only dazed and terrified as she collapsed sobbing wildly into tristans arms as tristan clutched her to his sweatdrenched shirt examining her face for burns kissing her frizzled hair crooning in rapid french that she mustnt be frightened the extras thinking it was part of the plot led a round of applause as he ran into the courtyard and sized up the situation rannaldinis face was shrivelled into a mask of evil who left petrol in that can he screamed someone has tried to murder my daughter they were all filled with water stammered an aghast wolfie i checked them well heads will roll everyone retreated as rannaldini glared round tristan promptly called a wrap for the day im taking tabitha home you cant muttered an appalled bernard all these extras a full cast weve got hours of light left i dont geeve a fuck oscar can take over tabitha will stay at valhalla her mother will look after her snarled rannaldini and you can carry on no tab was hysterical i want to go home with tristan even griselda was roused from her despondency over hermiones wrecked dress i always said those two would end up together she hissed to a bootfaced alpheus at least theyre the same class here you are darling she slipped tabs short red shift over her head sliding it down her body as she removed the heretics robe go home and have a heavenly tryst with triste tristan and boo sucks to sodding rannaldini that little madam gets everyone nice said baby sulkily a stricken lucy fled to her caravan a stunned wolfie kept repeating that there had been no petrol in the cans rozzy had mindlessly collapsed into rannaldinis executive producers chair tears streaking down her face tristan could have been killed youre so wet my dear rozzy sneered rannaldini you could have put the fire out yourself clive he clicked his fingers for his shadow then dropping his voice follow the two of them see what they get up to at magpie cottage sharon the labrador singing in delight welcomed tristan by bringing him a pair of tabs knickers you sing better than hermione tristan stooped to pat her tab laughed then gave a sob and fled upstairs to examine her naked lashless face in the bathroom mirror five minutes later tristan found her shaking uncontrollably rubbing toothpaste into her blanched cheeks he was amazed then touched when she refused a glass of brandy i promised god i wouldnt and he admittedly helped by you has just saved my life on the bed snoopy gazed up from one of her pillowcases dinosaurs from the other tristan had just persuaded her to lie down on the peter rabbit duvet when the doorbell rang tell it to go away pleaded tab dont bang your head on the beam going down it was james benson the smooth family doctor who had been summoned to so many campbellblack and rannaldini crises in the past agreeing with the paramedics that tab was unhurt but deeply shocked he gave her a shot youll be fine sweetie youre a lucky girl it would have been a tragedy if that lovely face had been spoilt wheres your husband in australia tristan saved my life will you see hes ok downstairs james benson produced some very strong painkillers youve come off worse than she has he said as he accepted a large brandy thank god shes off the booze but shes not in good shape she was clinically depressed after she lost the baby in march and she burst into tears when i said id seen rupert last week id give the old bastard a ring im convinced hes missing her as much as shes missing him its all helens fault exploded tristan bloody woman doesnt give a stuff about tab thats not fair said james benson sharply i first treated helen when she wasnt much older than tab she was the loveliest thing i ever saw and sweet too if she hadnt been a patient id have made a serious play rupert was away when she nearly died having marcus he was even more humiliatingly unfaithful to her than rannaldini if thats possible between them theyve done for her tristan was amazed by the venom in jamess voice but tabitha was his only interest what about isa cold fish corroded with moral outrage against the campbellblacks hell never forgive tab sooner shes out of this marriage the better tristan was pacing the room clearly desperate to be left alone with tab leggy and effortlessly elegant despite his dusty espadrilles and dirty frayed white shorts he reminded james of a heartthrob admired by his own generation gérard philippe i know its none of my business he drained his brandy but shes very vulnerable having let the doctor out tristan noticed a framed photograph on the desk of isa smugly riding in the winner of last years gold cup parking his green chewinggum on his rivals face he belted back upstairs im going to make you a cup of tea hot sweet tea mocked tab id rather have hot sweet montigny please dont leave me i wont he was touched to see schillers don carlos beside dick francis on the bedside table im trying to educate myself she muttered are you sure youre not hungry tab shook her head sharon probably is i feed her i give her sheep chops i find in fridge tab giggled flora and baby call griselda lady caroline sheep im sorry im holding up your film but it was so cool you telling bernard and rannaldini to fuck off and leaving three hundred and fifty extras and dim hermione all cooling their heels because of me tristan lay on the bed beside her am i squashing you not enough mumbled tab tristan could feel the faint down of her leg against his he thought shed fallen asleep then her hand crept into his are your poor burnt hands agony not when you hold them the smell of wild mint and meadowsweet was drifting in through the window outside wild roses cascaded over dark green trees like a william morris wallpaper as tristan lay up on his side he thought he had been caught up in some time warp without her lashes and eyebrows and with her extreme pallor and her hairline temporarily singed back an inch tab had become a sixteenthcentury beauty elisabetta or even eboli her forehead was as white as the moon her lashless lids like magnolia petals james bensons painkillers had begun to kick in bending back his hand as though he were drying his nails because his palm was still very sore tristan ran the inside of his wrist up the red chiffon dress feeling the concave belly the soft swell of breast only to be halted by a rockhard nipple as he bent over and kissed her tab gave a gasp and kissed him back in ecstasy breathing in a faint tang of eau sauvage and the mint of his chewinggum burying her fingers in his thick silky hair feeling his big bumpy head so different from isas which was as narrow as a weasels i have longed for you murmured tristan laying his cheek against hers ever since i saw you at the trafficlights in rutminster drinking vodka sharon across your thighs instead of a safetybelt straight away i want to be safetybelt that protect you he smiled down at the malevolent little eyes and great gnashing teeth on the pillowcase beside her even from dinosaurs the first time i saw you i thought jesus although it was probably jeshush because i was so pissed i asked lucy as she made me up if shed seen that fantastically gorgeous man downstairs and she laughed and said yes but id have to give all that up now i was getting married did you marry isa because you were pregnant no confessed tab gently pulling fragments of singed hair from his chest i never do anything because i ought to so i put you on hold until i galloped round the corner and saw you all ogling that naked bitch chloe god i was cross but ever since then ive looked forward more and more to seeing you on the set its as though youve got a halo youre the only person i notice what about wolfie sweet but too straight and he doesnt have a halo even though tristans hand was stroking its way very slowly down her body setting her completely adrift she had to know everyone on the unit spends their time speculating about your sex life she said falteringly a celibate frenchman is a contradiction in terms there must be someone outside a blackbird was singing a dog barked in the valley sharon barked back not any more said tristan as his hand now crept up slender thighs honed by years in the saddle please wait begged tab there isnt someone like isas girlfriend in australia waiting to rear her hideous head in a month or two i couldnt handle it hush as he shut her mouth with his tristans fingers edged under her knicker elastic into the tightest stickiest hollow oh ma petite wriggling out of his arms tab leapt out of bed like a poppy shedding petals her red dress slithered to the floor tristan had lost enough weight for her to tug off his shorts without unzipping them next moment she was on top of him venez inside moi toute sweet tristan did just that as he thrust up inside her he was briefly conscious of a delicious slipperiness of muscles closing round him like a fist and tab moving fluid as a dancer then he trembled violently cried out and came oh fuck fuck fuck im so sorry he buried his face in her shoulder i should have held out i am weemp but you are so lovely i was lost i am so sorry dont be tab kissed him over and over her tears soaking his shoulder its so gorgeous to be wanted so much isa times it like a race conserve the energy push through the gap i love you totally said tristan as he slowly returned to earth assuming sex was over for the day sharon galumphed into the bedroom landing between the lovers and was disappointed to be firmly told by tristan that it had only just started hazily watching his dark head between her legs as his long lazily lapping tongue drove her through repeated hoops of ecstasy tab was inclined to agree with him and those lovely endearments he kept murmuring in french its like sharon being talked to by me she thought she doesnt understand what im saying but she knows by the tone of my voice its adoring that was the best sex ever she said flopping back on to the pillow then terrified it might only be a oneafternoon stand she glanced sideways trying to memorize his face for ever noting the dark brown curls straighter since the moisture had dried out of the earth the big slightly twisted mouth the sallow complexion now burnt dark gold the long slightly snub nose thick curly eyelashes that would never need mascara black rings beneath the hollow eyes when you ave finish staring said tristan acidly i have first grey hairs at twentyeight it is abomination youve been working too hard no i worry you will never love me oh my angel what a lovely life well have together tab froze dyou mean that absolument tristan took her hand tempted to slide off her wedding ring james benson wanted me to call your father fuck hed ruined everything dont interfere tab hissed its nothing to do with james christ why is everyone not everyone hush gradually he calmed her i cant cope if daddy hangs up on me i dont want to lose face noone would want to lose one as beautiful as yours tristan ran a finger down her cheek am i really beautiful oh my darling you are also genius he added lovingly i never had horses more better organized on a shoot will you tell isa tab sat up in excitement he thinks im a total failure isas over i know i go on about him confessed tab but hes tougher to kick than the booze i dont love him but him having this other woman hurt almost more than losing the baby my poor darling tristan kissed her forehead then her greek nose and then her luscious loving mouth we will have lots of kids but i will always adore you the most kissing his fingers tasting traces of herself tab examined his signet ring on it was engraved a snake coiled round a column i cant read the motto basically it say dont disturb the montigny snake or hell come and get you he can see off a black cobra any day having taken sharon for a run tristan left tab when she was nearly falling asleep he had missed a halfdays filming and had several hours work to do come back later begged tab if you promise not to wake up suddenly thunder rumbled round the valley like a roused guard dog poor james hell be terrified said tab poor lucy tristan thought of her anguished disintegrating face in the canteen outside the front door white rose petals snowed down on them as he kissed her goodbye he felt his soul like those of the heretics being drawn up to heaven bats flitted across a rising yellow moon as he floated back to valhalla trying to keep the silly grin off his face overhead proud and defiant strode the constellation of hercules as tabitha loved him he could dispatch thirteen hundred labours suddenly he was singing i am carlos and i love you yes i love you at the top of his voice he was so happy he walked straight under a ladder on his bed lay a fax of his interview with the times he had been very taken by and had got mildly tight over lunch with valerie grove whod written it she had described him as the complete prince charmant with naturally aristocratic good manners and a haircut that could only have come from paris tristan smiled he must show lucy that bit the piece mentioned his close friendship with claudine lauzerte and said that the word on the street about the lily in the valley was that it would be both smash hit and artistic triumph is this the greatest montigny of them all said the headline below was a big picture of himself flanking it were smaller pictures of étienne and tristans older brothers including an incredibly rare snapshot of laurent who had looked so like che guevara one reason i make don carlos tristan was quoted as saying was my brother laurent die twentyeight years ago blown up in chad fighting injustice like posa his death broke my fathers heart i wanted to give him my own memorial étienne would have gone ballistic at the mention of laurent tristan hoped the crescendoing of thunder wasnt his father smashing furniture in heaven but it seemed a lovely piece perhaps he was being too harsh on the press in don carlos they werent all bad apples like beattie johnson but his head was too full of tabitha he wished his mother who had been only two years younger than tab when she died was alive to celebrate with him idly he switched on his machine dearest boy it was rannaldini at his most silken however late you get in pop down to my watchtower we must talk bloody hell thought tristan as he pulled on a pair of jeans he hoped rannaldini wasnt going to be insanely jealous the moon pale and sinister as rannaldini kept vanishing behind fluffy sable cloud a witchs trail soared straight through hercules a chill breeze ruffled the leaves as tristan walked through hangmans wood the stench of decaying wild garlic was stronger than ever rannaldini waiting in the watchtower doorway was wearing a black crewnecked sweater that gave him a vaguely ecclesiastical air hows tab he asked as he led the way to the glowing red sitting room on the first floor very shaken as tristan collapsed on a palegrey sofa his tummy rumbled the last thing hed eaten had been one of rozzys croissants at breakfast and he didnt remember finishing it the vast armagnac rannaldini handed him would go straight to his head shes ok he went on but we must tell the police it cant have been an accident and about floras fox being cut up tab was so brave then unable to help himself and so adorable rannaldini had gone very quiet frowning as he paced up and down trampling on the red roses that patterned the faded aubusson carpet i have been sad recently that you and i have so often come to blows he said gently but we only fight because we so passionately want carlos to work of course but i never stop loving you tristan you are still my little godson rannaldinis voice was so hypnotic perhaps he should do those introductions after all thought tristan and i love you he stammered he felt very happy that everything was falling so wonderfully into place but rannaldini went on pacing there is he began no i cannot go on urged tristan there is secret i prayed i would never have to tell you but as very close friend of your father he paused tristan went cold have you never wondered why étienne neglected you and never loved you tristan winced all the time he said wearily laurent died i suppose i lived laurent was my fathers favourite son then maman committed suicide maybe it deranged him on his deathbed he was rambling on that my father was my grandfather i didnt know what he was talking about he shuddered remembering étienne in the huge bed with the determinedly cheerful nurse siphoning off the fountains of blood the moon like a beardsley rakehell was leering in through a high window covered in a black lacing of clematis whose quivering shadows in turn cast an illusion of mobility on rannaldinis cold impassive face your mother was most stunning woman i ever meet turn round i dont think you ever see painting your father did tristan leapt to his feet behind him on the scarlet wall was a small oil of a young girl her naked body as white as tabs but far more softly curved and passive she leant against a dark green sofa the young rannaldini blackhaired black eyes glittering with lust and power was stripped to the waist in tight breeches and boots he had a hunting whip in his hand and had coiled the long lash round the girls neck there was an expression of terror and wild excitement on her face maman stammered tristan finding himself blushing in horror and sick shaming excitement at what was clearly one of his fathers masterpieces it is called the snake charmer purred rannaldini the texture of her body is quite extraordinary i shall miss her dreadfully what dyou mean the tate and the louvre are planning a huge montigny retrospective your beautiful mother will tour the world and take her place in the pantheon of women who inspired great artists non cried tristan in outrage for gods sake rannaldini he wanted to throw his shirt round delphines naked body dragging his eyes away he collapsed trembling on the sofa fumbling for a cigarette she certainly inspired your father began rannaldinisoftly what étienne did not know was that her father maxim your grandfather was a thug brutish utterly unstable his sole passion his daughter he was obsessed with her delphine only went out with me idly rannaldini flicked a speck of dust from a bronze of wagner to escape him for the same reason she marry your father maxim her father was so crazed with jealousy he wait till she and étienne return from honeymoon which had not been a success the marriage hardly consummated étienne fly to australia for two months to fulfil commission rannaldini paused his face full of compassion my conscience torture me should i tell you this go on for fucks sake a week later maxim roll up at empty house and rape her breath swamped tristans chest his heart had no room to beat by horrible luck she became pregnant rannaldini admired his expression of genuine concern in a big gilt mirror but she was too terrified to tell étienne so she passed the baby off as his i dont believe you croaked tristan his legs shaking with a violent life of their own why didnt she have an abortion she was so young a strict catholic and terrified of it coming out that her father was clinically insane that people might commit her because she was insane too that étienne might kick her out back to maxim you could have helped her spat tristan my poor boy i was in berlin i knew nothing after you were born delphine sink into depression and reject you your father was too devastated by laurents death to give her any support then he do sums you are large healthy boy not premature he furiously crossquestion your mother she collapse from guilt and weakness and tell him everything then take her own life that was the dreadful irony rannaldinis eyes were velvety dark as pansies with sympathy that laurent the flower of the montignys was dead and you a little incestuously conceived bastard said tristan with a dry laugh horribly reminiscent of étiennes death rattle was alive i am so very sorry murmured rannaldini étienne was never able to speak of laurent again what happened to my tristan couldnt say father to maxim he go off his head with grief when delphine die he was committed and die shortly of eartbreak in the asylum its not possible tristan winced as he put his head in his sore hands but it was nothing to the pain in his heart my grandfather was my father oh christ rannaldini put a caressing hand on the boys rigid shuddering shoulders my poor child knowing all this i deliberately take interest in you hoping to give you back some of the love that deserted you the wind had risen frenziedly shaking the trees rose stems scraped at the windows lacerating each other with their thorns rannaldini was trampling over the aubusson roses again but when cheeps are down tabitha is my daughter he sighed i see the longing in your eyes but she is better off married to isa even if he is ruperts deadly enemy she needs babies marcus is homosexual there is little likelihood of you fathering healthy kids you are threequarters maxim remember rannaldini watched the boy shove his fists in his ears trying to shut out the horrors one day tabitha will be reunited with rupert he would not be appy with some unstable misshapen offspring like the vrai carlos whispered tristan bitterly picassos oneeyed girl over the fireplace had the same greek nose as tab tonight i find her tristans voice broke i love her rannaldini there is only a couple of weeks left of filming everyone fall in love on location chloe and oscar alpheus and chloe baby and flora sexton rannaldini gave a wry shrug and ermione sylvestre et tout le monde ave you also not notice the way your niece simone gaze at my wolfgang tristan was too shocked to take in any of these pearls gleaned from rannaldinis monitors you will soon forget her never tristans mind was reeling not only was he not a montigny but his identification with don carlos because the inquisition had murdered his montigny ancestor was a sham no wonder my father christ i mean étienne sneered at my obsession with the family no wonder his lip curl when kind people say i inherit his talent and paint with light not one drop of montigny blood oh christ then another devastating hammerblow struck him if i am not montigny i have no claim to any of papaétiennes money i have handed eet over to production i am a thief his voice rose his eyes rolled crazily as he jumped to his feet he caught sight of étiennes painting for a second rannaldini was alarmed he was going to tug it from the wall and smash it calm down noone has discovered secret in twentyeight years why should it come out now but i will be living a hideous lie tristan turned pleading back to rannaldini how can i be sure everyone says i am all montigny adopted children pick up parents mannerisms tristan slumped on the sofa why did étienne keep me guilt that hed pushed delphine over the edge and after all his boasting to his friends that he fathered beautiful son in his sixties he was too proud to admit you werent his but you should be proud of yourself continued rannaldini warmly knowing ow much youve achieved from such unpropitious beginning but i beg you never have cheeldren have a vasectomy at once perhaps one day like rupert you can adopt maybe a geneticist would say you could produce normal children but you must not risk it with my tabitha she was so devastated to lose that baby tristan gave a groan that was almost a howl the knell of all our hopes has sounded he mumbled the dream that has faded was so fair oh dreadful cruel fate continuing the quote rannaldini stroked tristans hair oh rannaldini are you quite sure my dear boy if only i werent from his desk he took a dark red bible and from between its gleaming gold pages drew out a yellowing letter everything was familiar the beautiful black script the thick paper with the serrated edges the montigny crest of the chained snake the little drawing of the entwined lovers in the top righthand corner that hed so often seen on letters sent to his brothers but never to himself étienne had written my dear rannaldini thank you for all your understanding and kindness without these i doubt if i would have survived i cannot imagine a crueller betrayal but i must accept that tristan is the product of this obscene incestuous union delphine took the easy way out so i am forced to bring up the boy although it will be a constant reminder of the foul nightmare of his conception i can never bring myself to love him unable to read more tristan thrust the letter at rannaldini and stumbled out into the woods cannoning off trees like a drunkard longing to uproot them and build his own funeral pyre like hercules he reached the park where he wandered sobbing oh dreadful cruel fate over and over again at dawn he chucked his signet ring into the lake would that it could have been himself but the water had almost dried up in the drought beautiful pale like a sadistic marquis totally untroubled and unmarked by his night of vice the moon on its side lay over rannaldinis woods the rising sun was already gilding the little wood that formed a halo round magpie cottage his halo had gone tristan longed to level with tab but the truth was too hideous and he couldnt bear to read the sickened distaste in her eyes or to listen to her lame excuses as she backed off she needed perfect children to carry on the beauty of her family she deserved only the best tab had waited up all night when he told her he wasnt coming back her howled oh no were the most agonizing words hed ever heard its not anything youve done my darling its my fault youre married try and make a go of it with isa im no good to you one day ill explain then when there was total silence tabitha ive just lost another father whispered tab and hung up lucy didnt want people to hear her crying so as soon as shooting had finished the night before she retreated to her caravan james who was upset by tears curled himself into the tiniest russet ball on one of the windowseats letting out occasional deep sighs to rival rannaldinis at first when tristan hammered on her door she thought he was drunk his shirt and jeans were ripped his face was covered in scratches his eyes rolled wildly he was shaking so violently that she wrapped him in her duvet as he sobbed his heart out gabbling in french often quoting don carlos and occasionally laughing inanely he was difficult to understand but gradually she pieced together what rannaldini had told him lucy was furious the bastard she handed tristan a cup of black coffee into which shed poured a miniature drambuie he knows youre bats about tab and tab is bats about you oh why was she cutting her own throat hes jealous you saved tabs life and she was so frantic for you to take her home youre a montigny sure as oeufs is oeufs i can tell by your bone structure and your mouth and the height of your eyes in your face why dont you nip back to france and ask auntie hortense non non non tristan shook his head back and forth its all in the letter i am very fashionable incest is hot as sexton keeps saying his wild laughter turned into sobs sitting down beside him on the bench seat lucy gathered him up stroking his hair trying to still his desperate shuddering i love tab so much lucy last night she was holy grail in my arms i know i know even a worried james leapt down and nudged him with his long nose dear james avoiding his sore palms tristan smoothed the shaggy head with the side of his hand i cant stop thinking of that monster raping my mother she had noone to turn to if only shed had an abortion no shouted lucy clutching him even tighter that would have deprived the world of a fantastic director she gave a sob people forget youre only twentyeight and youve kept this bloody great show on the road youre exactly the same person today as you were before rannaldini told you all that junk its what you are that matters but what can i do about the money i put into carlos nothing your fatcat brothers arent exactly skint carlos is going to be such a smash hit youll easily be able to pay them back afterwards you have the heart of an angel quoted tristan wearily but mine sleeps forever closed to happiness promise you wont tell anyone he refused to be comforted tab was equally distraught she had been offered a glimpse of paradise what was it about her that noone could love rannaldini moved in swiftly my poor child but you know tristans track record he cannot commit himself he ave you so he dump you wolfie was more handson woken by a pitiful telephone call from tab he hunted down tristan as he was leaving lucys caravan and sent him crashing to join the debris of cigarette butts skeins of hair and cotton buds on the grass outside make up how dare you lead her on you smarmy frog then as tristan staggered to his feet wolfie hit him again hearing the din lucy emptied jamess waterbowl over wolfie stop it you revolting bully slumped against the steps of lucys caravan tristan told wolfie he had never meant to hurt tab but he had learnt something last night that meant he was useless to her or to any other woman when he wouldnt explain what it was wolfie stormed off unconvinced by this time heads including merediths and rozzys both in rollers were emerging from windows so lucy patched tristan up dressed his hands and sent him back to the set where he heroically carried on directing but everyone noticed he wasnt all there and the spark had gone soon rumours were flying around that hed blown tabitha out that shed blown him out along with all the old chestnuts that he was gay impotent violent and incapable of commitment rozzy was angry and hurt lucy wouldnt confide in her i thought we were friends cant you trust me then she stormed off when lucy couldnt it really irritated lucy the reproachful way rozzy instantly topped up jamess waterbowl and tested the earth of her plants whenever she came into the caravan even more maddeningly there were tears in tristans eyes later that afternoon when he told lucy that knowing we are haemorrhaging money rozzy offer to work for nothing she is so sweet sweet agreed lucy bitterly remembering james bensons bills even darling rozzys getting on my nerves she thought in despair but that evening as she put a patch of a greyhounds head over one of the rips in tristans jeans there was a knock on the door it was wolfie looking desperately tired sorry i flipped this morning we had a whipround for the greyhounds in spain he handed her a jangling brown envelope inside was nearly three hundred pounds oh wolfie fighting back the tears lucy hugged him come in oh thank you ever so much as she poured him a glass of wine she said she couldnt tell him what tristan had found out but if it were true she understood why hed had to dump tab she is destroyed sos tristan he needs you she also didnt want to upset wolfie by letting on to him the part rannaldini had played from then on wolfie carried tristan which aroused the enmity of bernard oscar sexton even of rannaldini and most of all the women because he was so clearly now le favori du roi june melted into july the birds fell silent the heatwave intensified legend had it that when the ponds of valhalla dried up the head of the house would die hoovering up shrivelled petals on the burnt lawn mr brimscombe noticed the dangerously low level of the pond near the rose garden and moved the gasping carp to the mere beside the maze he was just making a note to fill up both from the house mains when he was called away to round up the cows who in search of grass had forced their way into the woods near rannaldinis watchtower well have to raise the voltage on the electric fences rannaldini told tabitha pity mummy cant do that to keep you in stony limits cannot keep in love my darling tristan missed tab desperately but they were still so frighteningly behind schedule and over budget that he plunged into work driving himself and the crew to a point of collapse he was incredibly forgetful not finishing sentences or remembering names before hed kept the whole script almost to the line in his head now wolfie had to remind him what scene hed shot an hour before his nights were racked by drenching sweats and hideous dreams of rape torched flesh and a black cobra curling evilly round the neck of tabitha who would suddenly become his lovely naked mother how could he blame maxim for brutal incestuous lust when he was tortured himself by the same shaming desires for delphine often he was seen wandering round paradise at dawn muttering rannaldini doesnt know what hes doing he was still stonewalling about the introductions the plot was now so cartoon simple he felt that constant reappearances by rannaldini explaining what was going on would hold up the action it would also mean agonizing cuts of other stuff paring people like colin milton granny and giuseppe down to nothing not up to a tussle however he agreed that the great hall should be turned into an operahouse with a royal box rannaldini would then sweep in in his tails to conduct his overture only two incidents marred the filming of this opening meredith was sacked because a falling piece of scenery missed rannaldini by inches and lucy after everyone had raved that her makeup of granny and the characters in the royal box would win her an oscar found an adder coiled in her makeup basket a terrified lucy told only baby whom she had to make up immediately after her discovery must have crawled in by itself baby tried to cheer her up adder in the baskets better than chicken tristan had already shot two endings schillers in which philip hands carlos over to the inquisition and verdis which has the ghost of charles v played by grannys boyfriend giuseppe emerging from his tomb which looked according to granny like a public lavatory in morocco and drawing a terrified carlos inside rannaldini now insisted on a third with the principals of act v on stage singing the last minute of verdis version then the film ending with himself on the rostrum acknowledging the ecstatic applause of the audience the lighting rehearsal on his snowwhite shirtcuffs alone went on all morning griselda was then sacked because after twentynine fittings he was unhappy with the cut of his tailcoat rannaldini was even angrier that giuseppe thinking he wouldnt be needed had buggered off without permission to sing on a cruise ship in the bosphorus get heem back by tonight screamed rannaldini quite right said granny approvingly show him whos bosphorus granny was in a much happier mood he had finished his patchwork quilt darling rozzy was sewing the pieces up for him and it would look beautiful on his and giuseppes bed tristan heeding a word from lucy that granny was worried about work had spoken to him about a future role as the wonderfully comic baron ochs in der rosenkavalier the day that tristan shot rannaldinis ending was also mikhails thirtyfifth birthday having been bumped off in act iv mikhail was not needed and had been happily getting himself and everyone else plastered all day except lucy who was still shocked by the adder and who had to stay sober because she had the loathsome task of making up rannaldini she had never met anyone so vain he wanted bronzer blusher white on the inside of his eyelids mascara eyeliner and shading and it took her hours to get his glossy pewter hair just right familiar with lucys body from the relay race and his monitors rannaldini kept making suggestive remarks and when she was trimming the hair in his nostrils and terrified of nicking him putting a warm caressing hand between her thighs meanwhile word was whizzing round the set that mikhail had been so stoical about missing his wife lara that as a birthday surprise and sod the budget sexton was flying her over from moscow to emerge from mikhails birthday cake later that evening as lucy was darkening rannaldinis eyebrows wolfie popped in with glasses of champagne from mikhail rannaldini refused he never drank before a concert so wolfie left a single glass on lucys table and told his father he was wanted on the set in two minutes rannaldini was intensely sexually excited at the thought of being on camera as lucy removed the pale blue overall and was nearly asphyxiated by maestro his aftershave he rose a magnificent figure in white tie black cummerbund embroidered with a silver skull and beautifully cut black trousers he had other sexual games planned for later in the evening but as lucy put back the tops on her bottles he couldnt resist putting a hand up her skirt i know you want tristan he purred and he loves only tabitha but dont be sad lucy you have interesting body and eef i give you few lesson you could be very passionate his probing fingers wandered upwards utterly revolted lucy leapt back jolting the table spilling the champagne the next moment she had slapped rannaldinis face i dont care if you fire me she said furiously and im not toning those down she added as her fingermarks reddened on rannaldinis cheeks rannaldini laughed smelling his fingers in ecstasy shrugging on his new coat the poetry of whose cut was undeniable he adjusted his gardenia picked up the glass of champagne and raised it to his lips as he strode towards the great hall but before he could take a sip hermiones top e as she warmed up in her dressing room had shattered it rannaldinis smile broadened he had been right not to drink maestro rannaldini tiny simone stepped bravely into his path you were not wearing cummerbund with deaths head in opening shots when did continuity take precedence over aesthetic consideration said rannaldini haughtily the skull forecasts death of carlos and elisabetta and shoving simone out of the way he strode on half an hour later baby was tempted to walk out hermione had obviously persuaded rannaldini to substitute a different take of the last duet to the one on the cassette which he had been sent on that one she had had a distinct wobble now over the speakers she sounded wonderful and he distinctly off fucking bitch baby wanted to kick her on the ankle as he gazed soulfully into her eyes farewell my son farewell for ever sang hermione one camera was trained on rannaldini a second up on a crane kept cutting from stage to royal box to enraptured crowd suddenly philip the grand inquisitor and a pack of paparazzi in leather their long lenses raised like machineguns charged in philip had just grabbed elisabetta when the ghostly presence of charles v slowly emerged from his tomb giuseppe has got back after all thought baby in surprise as his glorious rich voice poured out of the speakers like the expensive red wines of which he was so fond as the rest of the cast fell back in terror rannaldini whipped the orchestra through the last deafening chords but as the ghost put out his hand to seize babys baby crashed to the ground in a dead faint pissed again said ogborne it was a ghost a real ghost protested a terrified baby when he came round he cast no shadow on the wall and his hand went straight through mine i told you never to touch spirits chided granny noone on the other hand had seen giuseppe arrive or leave returning to her caravan still shuddering from rannaldinis grope lucy found that the spilt champagne had burnt a hole right through the red checked cloth to the table beneath someone was trying to kill either her or rannaldini she gave a shriek as a tall figure loomed out of the darkness but it was only a holloweyed wolfie was she coming to mikhails birthday party lucy was knackered but she loved mikhail hoping a few drinks might dull her sense of foreboding she decided to pop in for an hour and went slap into a fulldress row chloe and mikhail had both had tipoffs that theyd landed the parts they wanted in samson and delilah a plastered mikhail was just kissing chloe in congratulation covering himself in crimson lipstick when with fiendish timing rannaldini urged mikhails newly arrived wife lara to peep out of her bedroom window for a sneak preview of her beloved her reunion with mikhail was therefore most acrimonious and noone emerged from any birthday cakes lara kicked off by slapping mikhails face so hard he fell in a nearly empty fishpond she then turned on chloe you are scarlet voman i read about in evening scorpion on vay down oh beatties piece must have come out said chloe in excitement if youve got a copy id love to see it so lara slapped chloes face as well chloes squawks however were nothing to her hysterics when she tracked down the scorpion beattie had portrayed her as a ruthless careerist and husbandsnatcher and quoted all the bitchy remarks chloe had made off the record including the one about hermione farting every time she hit a top note delilah was an absolute cow said baby reassuringly so youll only have to play yourself chloe chloe fled sobbing to her room mikhail trailing muddy pond weed stormed round valhalla trying to find lara everyone as a result was very wary of a grungy crone in granny specs and flowing black robes who was reverently being hawked round the party by hypealong as eulalia harrison of the sentinel eulalia was doing an indepth piece on the whole production that would redress the harm done by beattie helen who loved the arts pages in the sentinel had even given eulalia a bedroom in the south wing eulalia had already cornered flora about her famous mother perhaps you could spare me a moment in the foreseeable future to discuss mothers new album and your début in carlos id like that said flora the albums great and thank goodness you reminded me i promised rozzy one for her horrible husbands fiftieth birthday hes a mad fan of mums we all are said eulalia reverently even buckets of wine couldnt make the party gel there was no birthday boy to blow out the thirtyfive blue candles on the big chocolate cake people loved mikhail and hated seeing him so hurt and humiliated on his birthday it was eerie in the shadowy garden owls hooted moths scorched themselves on flambeaux gasping unwatered plants failed to revive in the cooler night air babys protestations that charles v had been a real ghost began to stack up as granny summoned to take a call from giuseppe found him still on his troop ship in the bosphorus in bernards office tristan oscar and valentin were still wondering after babys fainting how much of tonights film they could salvage having raved over grannys patchwork quilt which was on display and lighting up the summer drawing room like a rainbow the rest of the guests had spilled out into the garden sexton who was heartbroken that his plan to bring lara over had misfired so tragically had arrived with hermione who having heard about but not yet read beatties piece was delighted at chloes discomfiture considering herself an expert on the subject of the press she decided to charm the grotesque eulalia harrison after all the sentinels circulation nudged the guardians have you heard my latest cd i have indeed said eulalia in her refined ultraintellectual islington twang i am a longterm fan dame hermione then you shall come to luncheon at river house determined not to fall into chloes trap of bitching up others hermione beckoned lucy over this is my personal makeup artist lucy latimer youll want to talk to lucy about me and probably to our woman friday rozzy pringle by the way rozzy my roselined green cloak has a tear rosalinds very nifty with a needle eulalia and a great singer said lucy defiantly come and meet sexton kemp hermione took eulalias arm sexton went to eton you know bitch bitch bitch said lucy to hermiones broad departing back omigod she screamed as a ghostly apparition appeared unexpectedly out of the ebony depths of the maze oh thank goodness its you alpheus either of you two seen cheryl an enraged alpheus glared towards the terrace where rannaldini still in his tails the skull leering from his cummerbund was now standing how dare he say artistic consideration come before continuity fumed simone as rannaldini clapped his hands and announced the cabaret earlier in the shoot after a particularly trying day meredith and rannaldini had joined tristan in his caravan and over a bottle of whisky they had discussed everyone rannaldini had taped the conversation and now relayed it on speakers around the house and garden clearly tristan had been enjoying the catharsis of a really good bitch the sound of his laughter which had not been heard since the auto da fe drew the outside revellers in round the terrace having mimicked most of the cast particularly pushy and alpheus meredith had savagely taken the piss out of sexton but his venom had been reserved for hermione as the wife of bob his longterm lover tristan had defended her manfully only when meredith started impersonating her in a screeching falsetto could he be heard crying with helpless laughter initial guffaws from the guests quickly faded into appalled embarrassed silence sexton looked as though he was going to cry i never knowed i was that common noone dared look at hermione who for once was lost for words as tristan wandered into the party rannaldini could be heard saying on the tape do you theenk we should replace hermione superfluous harefield giggled meredith well pushys already sung her top notes so why not get some pretty actress half her age to play her on film with an ass a quarter the size tristan had suggested to shouts of mirth turn that bloody thing off howled the real tristan and his hands were round rannaldinis neck i keel you you bastard if wolfie bernard and a racingup valentin hadnt pulled him off he would have strangled rannaldini dyou want to screw up everything we achieve you fucking madman let me get at heem he snarled struggling to break free of their clutches my dear boy sneered rannaldini straightening his collar how very excited youre getting over a bit of fun a second later everyone was distracted by hermione screaming it isnt true about my top notes sexton was about to protest that of course it wasnt but pushy was too quick for him aym afraid it is hermione she said smugly roberto couldnt bear you to sound less than perfect screeching that she would get both pushy and rannaldini and never work with tristan again hermione flapped off towards river house so like a great goose that everyone expected her to break into flight shame the rivers too low for her to drown herself sighed baby but her departing screech was interrupted by a far more pitiful sound in the summer drawing room granny was crouched weeping over his patchwork quilt which had been slashed into such tiny pieces that unlike foxie it couldnt be sewn together again like eaglets fluttering round a mother bird with an irrevocably broken wing lucy baby and flora surged forward frantic to comfort him but granny refused to let tristan call the police no no nothing can bring it and my darling boy back again ten minutes later utterly unmoved by such tragedy pushy returned from cleaning her teeth in helens bathroom after all it would be hers soon and sidling up to rannaldini asked if it were too early to slope off to the watchtower frankly it is smirked rannaldini because i ave subsequent engagement and singing life is just a bowl of cheryl he disappeared into the dark ten minutes later he let himself into the watchtower my darling he crooned to mikhails lara who clive had just smuggled down a newly strimmed ride dont spoil your lovely eyes with tears suffering will make your wayward husband sing even more beautifully and you will have a night to tell your greatgrandchildren about then as a feisty blonde in a foxglovepink and purple dressinggown came down the spiral staircase i dont think you know cheryl shaw the next two and a half days thank god were rest days tristan had a big press screening of the lily in the valley in paris on saturday night and then a lunch party for aunt hortenses eightysixth birthday on sunday nightshooting would start on monday evening roused early on saturday morning from the same hideous nightmare tristan found his light on and rannaldini standing in his bedroom doorway with his bare muscular chest soaring out of tight black trousers he was hideously reminiscent of himself in the snake charmer if i have any more hassle from you tristan reached for a gauloise with a shaking hand im taking my name off this film what name taunted rannaldini youre not a montigny any more in fact your lack of roots is showing my dear tristan felt churning black loathing unless he jumped to rannaldinis tune the bastard would tell the world étienne wasnt his father hurry or youll miss that plane smirked rannaldini and do give my best to claudine lauzerte strolling down the landing rannaldini was greeted by his cat sarastro mewing with rage stooping to stroke him rannaldini found his white fur drenched how could this be when it hadnt rained for weeks out of the window through the predawn halflight he saw rozzy with a wateringcan like a nurse in the trenches trying to bring succour to his dying plants padding downstairs out into the garden he caught her so redhanded she dropped the wateringcan first you water my cat next my flagstones im terribly sorry rannaldini im so shortsighted i mistook poor sarastro for some white violas rozzy my dear said rannaldini silkily i had such an interesting session with james benson yesterday the colour stole from rozzys cheeks as though she was bleeding to death flora woke when the sun was high in the sky to find baby had already left it was too hot to wear anything but cotton so she wandered out to the facilities unit in her white nightie as trevor rushed reproachfully around lifting his leg on wheels and guy ropes she could hear merediths voice issuing petulantly from make up how can i expect darling sexton to reinstate me when rannaldini plays that loathsome tape baby sent his love flora and said hed be back some time on monday called rozzy as she emerged from wardrobe clutching a large harrods bag ive got the remains of grannys patchwork quilt in here she added conspiratorially shoving it into the boot of the car im going to try and save it poor old boy said flora sadly i bet giuseppes doing more cruising than singing in the bosphorus although i cant really believe baby saw a ghost she handed rozzy another carrierbag i got mum to sign two photos and her new album for glyn oh you darling child rozzy hugged her it was the least i could do after you mending foxie are you ok rozzy you look dreadfully pale im fine sighed rozzy ive got to be well dont work too hard i hope glyn jolly well appreciates his birthday party you look pretty pale too rozzy called after her why dont you ring your nice george an almighty bang made them both jump wolfie who hadnt put a foot wrong throughout the shoot had been bullied into filling up alpheuss jaguar from rannaldinis petrol pumps catching sight of tabitha leaving magpie cottage however he had driven slap into bernards peugeot this gave alpheus the excuse to storm upstairs to rannaldinis study where he found his executive producer signing fan mail alpheus flipped not only was his jaguar totalled but how dare rannaldini also lie to cheryl that hed been humping pushy chloe and hermione cheryl was threatening to divorce him and expose him to the taxman if he didnt accede to her outlandish demands and she wants custody of mr bones the family dog alpheus shouted finally i am not surprised admiring his beautiful hands rannaldini picked up a nail file eef mr bones can hold down job worth two hundred thousand dollars a year on your books and bite the postman hes quite a find i ave to confess i find that emerald stud in cheryls labia minora quite enchanting but i think she has the ots for mikhail so i suggest you get it insured before they get together ill get you rannaldini alpheuss bellows of rage could be heard all over valhalla flora had just screwed up enough courage to punch out georges number when rannaldini catfooted up suggesting a walk round the garden flora was so depressed she thought rannaldini would be better than noone to talk to she was wrong as they reached the pond near the rose garden rannaldini said i wonder when baby will tell his little friend isa that hes just tested hiv positive flora stopped in her tracks breathing in a sudden stench of fox how dyou know i recommended him to a doctor said rannaldini smoothly the poor boy only heard this morning hes demented and so must you be my darling are you sure well if you swing all ways and sleep around as much as baby does it was only a matter of time oh my god flora slumped on a stone bench trevor had disappeared after the fox in the almost nonexistent water of the pond a couple of carp gasped and writhed then from his inside pocket rannaldini produced an even worse horror what will george theenk of these pretty pictures flora gave a groan because the top one was of baby making love to her on the lawn at angels reach give them to me she screamed snatching the polythene folder have them rannaldini gave a sigh of delight i have the negs they should make george relinquish his plans for a paradise bypass and eef not gordon dillon will adore them and whistling this is my last my finest day rannaldini sauntered back to the house pausing only to switch on his mobile bussage my dear can you ring fleet water board and get them to fill up the lake and the ponds flora whimpered with terror baby whod been mysterious about his weekend plans always switched off his mobile there was no way she could call him and check the truth looking round she saw that trevor was tossing something in the air stop she screamed but by the time she had got there it was too late it was a little black mole probably in search of water lost above ground blinded by the sun the earth was baked too hard for him to tunnel to safety there was something so pathetic about his tiny pink hands sobbing helplessly followed by an insufficiently contrite trevor flora set out to find a spade to bury him she felt she had bypassed paradise for ever entering valhalla rannaldini had bumped into his leading mezzo dear chloe how blubbered is thy pretty face he quoted in amusement its all because of beatties horrible piece sobbed chloe howies just rung in his undertakers voice saying i havent got delilah even worse he says the moneys on gloria she is a newer face my dear your voice is not really strong enough to fill the garden the last thing we need is terrible reviews for delilah just as carlos is previewing chloe was the second person in twentyfour hours to slap rannaldinis face and now he was in his watchtower working on his memoirs the evil smile playing constantly over his lips pushy had left several furious messages on his machine having had access to helicopter orange lamborghini diablo and rannaldinis bank balance while theyd been having an affaire she was now feeling the draught rannaldini took her next call you promised ayd be the next lady rannaldini you were queen for a night my dear gloria poor eboli only had two minutes of bliss you had two weeks count yourself lucky now pees off rannaldini turned back to his memoirs what a lot he had on the rest of the cast that very morning poor silly granny had been so unhinged that clive had snapped him doing something very stupid in rutminster there was no way hypealong would be able to buy all the nationals once the story broke and what a lot too he knew about goodygoody rozzy then there was chloes frolic with the goat on the internet and isas parents certainly wouldnt want to know what hed been getting up to with baby or isa what baby had been getting up to with flora how gay was baby really and what a shame mikhail had lapsed last night that marriage would take a long time to repair sighing with pleasure rannaldini picked up his photograph album what a lot of beautiful women hed slept with there was flora a plump ravishing schoolgirl and chloe whose skin was whitehot in texture but who had been almost too easy to bed and wolfies mother gina hangdog because shed loathed being photographed in the nude not a beauty but incredibly rich she had given him his start in life sharing a page were serena the nympho and pushy whose pillow talk had been very limited over the page was beattie johnson who was helping him with his memoirs and who knew rather too much about him beattie had been a marvellous fuck his second wife cecilia an even better one and there was his third wife plump kitty so anxious to please who had escaped to marry ruperts friend lysander one day he would get even with those two across the centre spread was an emaciated helen what a contrast to hermione rosy rubenesque probably the most beautiful of them all and certainly the best in bed yesterday he had punctured her selfesteem but she was turned on by punishment and would soon bounce back before the end of filming he would screw lucy she deserved a treat and what a wonderful evening he had had last night watching cheryl and lara exploring each others bodies hed hardly been able to get a cock in edgeways but flipping through the pages there were two everests still to conquer ruperts women there was only a head shot of the divine taggie taken at tabs wedding but by secreting hidden cameras in both her bedrooms at valhalla and at magpie cottage he had some stunning shots of tabitha naked slender and most disdainful of them all rannaldini felt chained to a lunatic by his lust his cock about to detonate he had fantasized recently of marrying tab and giving her blond beautiful babies but things hadnt gone to plan rannaldini found himself increasingly identifying with philip ii he had sought in the vast desert of men for a friend he had found tristan but tristan had flouted his authority and won tabs affection it was the same with wolfie rannaldini had wanted his son back so much but how could it happen that flora once and now it seemed tabitha had grown increasingly fond of such a hamfisted formal slightly ridiculous hopelessly romantic young man tab was infatuated with tristan but wolfie was busy gaining ground in his sons top drawer under the lining paper rannaldini had found polaroids of tab in her dunces cap hed kill rather than relinquish her to wolfie suddenly he had a brainwave and picked up the telephone clive i want you to make a trip to penscombe tab was amazed and touched when chloe rang her the following day which was a sunday asking her to come to harvey nichols sale in rutminster but who was there to buy dresses for isa was as cool as ever and tristan hadnt telephoned since hed blown her out but knowing that he wanted polo in don carlos and that rannaldini was baulking over the expense tab explained to chloe that she was going over to rutminster polo club that afternoon to try and persuade some of the england players all mates of rupert to appear in the film for a crate of moët apiece not much of a hardship negotiating with those guys said chloe at least drop in on the tennis tournament later i cant chloe evenings are the only time its cool enough to work the engineer well look after yourself little one tab wiped away the tears how kind of chloe to be so solicitous inspired by a fortnights wimbledon and the fact that it was july the day the real carlos had been born the tennis tournament had been scheduled for early evening in the forlorn hope that the heat might have subsided alas it was hotter than ever with black stormclouds massing like the grand inquisitors army in the west the tennis courts at valhalla flanked hangmans wood already the poplars were yellowing and every chestnut leaf was edged with brown it was so still the smouldering trees seemed turned to stage scenery rannaldini had retired to his watchtower to drool over the newly arrived rushes of himself on the rostrum over and over again the opening bars of the overture like hunting horns deep in the wood advertised his evil presence to add to the tension people who had fondly arranged to partner one another weeks ago were no longer on speaking terms pushy was playing with alpheus which would put cheryl into orbit chloe a reputed demon on the court with mikhail which would equally enrage lara after fridays débâcle mikhail had also decided he loathed chloe and rolled up at the tennis tournament swigging vodka out of a twolitre smirnoff bottle appy birthday don carlos appy birthday to you sang mikhail and i hop he had better bloody birthday than i ave on friday today boomed griselda resplendent in a vast white tent dress is also the birthday of rozzys husband glyn probably an even greater shit than the original carlos so horoscopes do work and it is my aunt hortenses birthday piped up simone she is terrible tart too i think you mean tartar sweetie said griselda fondly uncle tristan is probably still at her birthday party now said simone glancing at her watch shell be very angry i rattled at the last moment you couldnt miss a chance of having wolfie as your partner mocked chloe swiping at a passing wasp with her racquet seeing poor simone who was unaware that her crush on wolfie was common knowledge going absolutely crimson griselda said quickly rozzys been cooking chicken breasts to be wrapped in smoked salmon sea trout and raspberry pavlova for that bastard glyn all weekend paid for by me thought lucy bitterly oh look said meredith as a black helicopter approached from the southeast and landed on the lawn of river house hermione has returned from milan shes clearly not too mortified to make use of maestros chopper meredith was partnering flora neither serious players particularly meredith whose christopher robin sunhat fell off if he ran too fast to everyones amazement they took out mikhail and chloe because mikhail smote every ball into the dark midgy canopy of hangmans wood i hop i break every window of his bloody vatchtower he growled why dont you take up golf snarled chloe as they walked off the court afterwards they could be heard yelling at each other in the maze in which they would be filming next week no doubt rehearsing the bit when posa pulls a knife on eboli said flora collapsing on the burnt scratchy grass to watch bernard and jessica sextons beautiful secretary pounding balls at lucy and ogborne who was still keeping the midges at bay with hermiones winestained sunhat flora was coming apart at the seams in floods one minute screaming with laughter the next now she was crying because she could hear tabloid the rottweiler howling and stuck in baking solitary confinement beneath rannaldinis watchtower why doesnt bloody clive take him for a walk then as the hunting horns from the rushes echoed through hangmans wood again if i hear that overture once more ill scream the horror of the photos rannaldini had shown her had now kicked in she hadnt come on yet what happened if she was pregnant and produced a little hiv baby if george saw those pictures hed never take her back every time a mobile rang she leapt three feet in the air granny who was partnering griselda was equally suicidal how could he have let himself go in rutminster yesterday every time a car came up the drive he expected blue lights and sirens even more cruelly an indignant howie had just confirmed that serena westwood was on the cruise ship with giuseppe rannaldinis evil matchmaking had worked a treat grannys dreams were now as shredded as his patchwork quilt but being granny he refused to spoil everyone elses fun and plucked his tennis racquet like a banjo he said that he loved her but oh how he lied sang granny oh how he lied oh how he lied and then they were married and somehow she died somehow she dihihied joined in flora on three glasses of white and no food since friday granny was also in a fuckit mood his sneaky underarm service was soon whistling over the net griselda galumphing around in her white tent turned out to have a murderous backhand to everyones noisily cheering surprise they routed the numberone seeds alpheus and pushy pushys gone white with rage to match her tennis kit muttered ogborne to lucy i reckon alpheus threw that game as pushy came off the court meredith was reading out a sunday times piece claiming that the coveted part of delilah had not gone to chloe or even pushy but to rannaldinis ex cecilia with a frantic jangling of bracelets and earrings pushy burst into tears sir roberto promised me that part and he promised ay could be the next lady rannaldini she sobbed weve all been promised that said a mocking voice it comes after being told weve got the most beautiful voice in the world abandoning mikhail whod passed out under a weeping ash chloe had returned to the court oh god her smile disappeared here comes helen and that ugly cow eulalia harrison i gather she had luncheon at river house pushys sobs subsided she longed for an indepth interview with the sentinel but eulalia pallid beyond belief with the evening sun showing up a moustache and a gap of hairy leg between flowing skirts and leather boots had her sights set higher chloe catford she cried i was appalled by that drivel beatrice johnson wrote about you in the scorpion the bitch completely misquoted me said chloe unfreezing slightly that was apparent i resented the way she trivialized you eulalias blinking unmadeup eyes behind her granny specs were full of compassion could you spare me a moment tomorrow why dont we do lunch chloe turned to lady rannaldini who had drifted on ahead of eulalia clearly reluctant to get sucked into the tennis hi helen that is a gorgeous dress helen paused for a second holding out the mauve silk patterned with purple lilac and pale yellow honeysuckle lovely isnt it then looking coldly at pushy my husband brought me back the silk from tokyo wolfie and simone easily dispatched lucy and ogborne to reach the final against granny and griselda were going to have trouble beating those two sighed griselda wolfie plays like boris becker boris better wolfies much nicer looking and such a good boy said granny approvingly as wolfie topped up everyones glass and handed round strawberries giving simone time to get her breath back before the final he had lost so much weight his signet ring kept falling off so he gave it to lucy to look after as the chapel clock struck half past nine the finalists took up their positions lucy and simone are so sweet thought wolfie as he jumped from foot to foot on the baseline why was he too hopelessly in love with tab to consider anyone else glancing across the valley he felt sick to see a car looking suspiciously like his fathers merc creeping stealthily up the little lane to magpie cottage an ace from griselda whizzed past his ear he mustnt give in to weakness if he was incapable of returning simones love he could at least ensure her victory oh well played wolfie said simone five minutes later as he aced granny for a second time alpheus sitting away from the rabble on the other side of the court much envied the way simone ran around picking up balls for wolfie it was high time he had an adoring young woman in his life again he picked up his mobile moths were bashing against the floodlights even rannaldinis sapphire delphinium bed the only thing watered in the garden was losing colour in the dusk a mobile rang everyone dived hopefully but it was for chloe ok she purred terrific ill be with you as soon as i can not having had any exercise she announced she was going for a jog and giving mikhail a kick in the ribs as she passed the weeping ash disappeared into the darkness shortly afterwards alpheus muttered about swimming his twenty lengths drained his glass of perrier and also left he and chloe must have started up again hissed flora i hate rannaldini said pushy so do i agreed bernard stunning everyone because he never bitched noone hates him as much as i do said griselda as she remembered rannaldini wrecking hermiones dress mikhail must have been roused by chloes kick for suddenly he reared up and sang thunder rumbles deep in the heavens a man must die then slumped back to sleep everyone exchanged nervous glances particularly when real thunder started to grumble round the hills in sympathy a slight breeze rattling the summerhardened poplar leaves sounded like rain lucy put her arms round a quivering james shed have to trank him if the claps grew louder guess what i had to do earlier today she asked the remaining spectators as the players changed ends streak clives hair whatever for asked meredith he had an important date he said his bloodless face went quite pink actually he was really sweet and told me about his mum and he tried to pay me afterwards must be the first time shuddered flora clive scares me more than rannaldini that black crows been sitting on top of the cypress for the last two hours dyou think its stuck its name is death said ogborne with a sepulchral laugh christ that girls got amazing legs everyone turned as jessica sextons beautiful secretary loped back from the house youll never guess what she gasped youve been streaking clives hair said ogborne i just saw tristan dont be ridiculous said bernard roughly hes in paris youve had too much to drink keep your hair on bernie said meredith baby saw a ghost yesterday what was tristan doing asked flora nearly running me over belting down the drive must have been someone else insisted bernard angrily i find it a relief tristans away confessed flora hes so uptight and he was bitchy on that tape i always thought he adored us all oh well played simone lucy hugged an increasingly trembling james if only she could explain to the others why tristan was being so difficult i miss the birds singing at twilight she said looking up into the trees theyre all exhausted feeding their young said jessica mr brimscombe told me nightingales disappear in july one morning theyre here the next theyve gone departing silently in the dusk like us next week said ogborne burying her face in jamess coat lucy burst into tears then leaping to her feet fled into the wood it was nearly nine and even hotter when tab got home from working the engineer she went straight into the shower then put on the coolest clean thing in her wardrobe a virginal calflength grey cotton shirtwaister which she had never worn but which her american bosses had given her last summer for her birthday probably as a hint she might curb her dissolute lifestyle god it was stifling she was already breaking out in sweat again in the past she would have got stuck into the vodka but staying off it seemed to be the only achievement she had to cling on to she missed tristan so dreadfully but as she breathed in a familiar smell of nightscented stock and philadelphus she was flattened with longing for penscombe tristan however had urged her to work at her marriage isa was back in england and as she expected him home later she opened and applied the chic french makeup simone had given her for her birthday then she drenched herself in quercus the disturbing sweet yet lemony scent which isa so loved going downstairs she found sharon panting on the kitchen floor she was on heat and most of the local dogs including james trevor and tabloid when he escaped from his dungeon had been hanging round magpie cottage at least one of us has got admirers sighed tab listlessly she switched on the wireless they had all been so caught up in don carlos they had forgotten the outside world existed then she jumped to hear a soft gruff utterly familiar voice one of the children had taken her collar off for fun her stepmother was saying oh no tabitha clutched herself in horror we were playing grandmothers footsteps in the woods went on taggie and suddenly gertrude had vanished shes deaf and blind she must be so frightened taggies voice broke what does gertrude look like asked the interviewer shes only a little black and white mongrel but her black patches are mostly white because shes eighteen a good age said the interviewer and your husband rupert has offered an amazing tenthousandpound reward a lot for such an old dog shes special to us sobbed taggie she eats bonios in her paws like icecreams she was eating one yesterday and this magpie one for sorrow snatched it away shell be so bewildered we just want to know shes safe well im sure with a tenthousandpound reward well have the whole of england looking for her thats gertrude and the number to ring is tears were flooding tabs face she had known gertrude taggies dog since she was eight even before taggie married her father rupert had had to work hard to win over gertrude gertrude had also starred at taggie and ruperts wedding escaping up the aisle and standing panting between her mistress and rupert while the bishop ranted about sexual mores when anyone had a row at home gertrude the peacemaker would rush in rattling a box of bonios she had so much character oh poor taggie thought tab she must ring home at once it took her three goes to dial because she was shaking so much then the number was engaged feeling the need of wolfies solid comfort she dialled valhalla seeing magpie cottages number coming up rannaldini picked up the telephone my little one may i speak to wolfie he is out the calls are being diverted to the tower ive been listening to your poor stepmother on the radio oh god its terrible maybe not so much clive was driving back from cotchester just now and pick up small white terrier smoothhaired and with curly tail maybe its gertrude has she got a greyish patch over one eye and on her tail she has ill be over in a sec telling a reproachful sharon she wouldnt be long tab put on gym shoes so she could run faster outside in the dusk it was even hotter the once deep and dangerous river was so low she could paddle across it the lights were on in hermiones house she could see mr brimscombe still deadheading roses in anticipation of night filming and waved as she raced past from the shrieks issuing from the tennis court the final was reaching a climax someone called out but she ran on by the time she reached hangmans wood she was drenched in sweat she had never visited the watchtower a combination of rottweilers and rannaldinis rapacity had deterred her no guard dogs patrolled tonight but racing down a woodland ride she heard an imperious yap blind and deaf yapping was the only way in the big house at penscombe that gertrude could broadcast her whereabouts to the family crashing open the door tabitha stumbled upstairs here she is said rannaldini the little white dog sat in the middle of the room looking around anxiously with clouded unseeing eyes she gave another yap tabitha dropped to the floor beside her oh my angel and suddenly gertrude who had often wriggled under tabs duvet in the mornings smelled someone familiar who reminded her of home she whimpered incredulously frantically wagging her tail as she jumped off her front legs to lick tabs sweating tearful face gathering up gertrude burying her face in her neck tabitha also breathed in the smell of home oh gertrude she sobbed oh thank god rannaldini taggiell be so relieved i must ring her at once her breath was coming in great gasps from running have a drink said rannaldini cosily pouring her a vodka and tonic go on this is a celebration he reeked of maestro and wore only alpheuss coveted purple and pink striped dressinggown but tab was too happy to notice or that not wanting to be interrupted he had just diverted the calls back to the house i shouldnt she took a gulp of vodka and nearly choked ive got to drive her back to penscombe its all right darling she dropped a kiss on gertrudes forehead can i ring magpie cottage and ask isa to look after sharon isa still wasnt home so she left a message as she rang off she briefly noticed a disgusting painting of a blackhaired rannaldini whipping some naked tart wasnt i andsome in those days he demanded youre betterlooking now said tab but without interest oh rannaldini finding gertrude she smoothed the lipstick left on the little dogs forehead gives me the excuse to go home and maybe daddyll be so pleased hell forgive me ive missed him so much she had never looked more touching two blonde strands escaping from her black velvet toggle framed her face her eyes shone her cheeks were hectic red the innocent grey dress clung to her still heaving breasts and wet body i honestly dont want it leaving the vodka she jumped to her feet i dont know how to thank you putting her infinitely precious burden on the floor for a second she reached up to kiss him on the cheek rannaldini breathed in her scent next moment he had grabbed her with the grip of a madman then the solid wedge of his body hit her winding her throwing her on the floor and he was on top of her sending buttons flying he ripped open her dress suffocating her with his other hand she could see the black hairs feel the clash of the wedding ring he had been given by her mother against her teeth struggling like a wild cat tabitha scratched his face and pummelled his ribs but lust doubled rannaldinis considerable strength as he tore at her knickers she jerked away her head and screamed youre so beautiful hissed rannaldini but you need to be taught a lesson ducking her head to avoid him kissing her she found her lips crushed against his dressinggown then he had rammed his cock into her not minding if his aim was off centre at first it buckled against her tightness then tearing her because of her dryness forced itself inside but tabs screams like bats shrieks had roused gertrude who could also see faint but frenziedly moving shadows edging towards the noise she encountered rannaldinis leg and plunged her few teeth deeply into it rannaldini gave a bellow and groped for the bronze of wagner on a nearby marble table no screamed tab please not gertrude too late rannaldini had hurled it catching the side of the little dogs head with a crack but still gertrude the lionheart clung on reaching down rannaldini grabbed her by the scruff of her neck and flung her against a big carved cabinet with a sickening crunch and a faint yelp gertrude slid to the ground rage gave tabitha strength catching rannaldini off balance she wriggled away from him at the same time shoving his head very hard against the sharp corner of a marble table youve killed her you murdering bastard jumping to her feet she scooped up gertrude who was gushing blood from a cutopen head and stumbled down the spiral staircase out into the dark wood she could still hear cheers and yells of excitement if only she could reach the tennis court but terror fury and grief made her lose her bearings turning left away from valhalla tripping over roots and bramble cables she reached a little clearing and paused gasping for breath oh please dont be dead she sobbed but gertrude lay motionless in her arms frantically tab tried to distinguish the dogs heartbeat above the pounding of her own but there was nothing gertrudes merry curly tail had wagged its last crying hysterically tabitha reached the paradise cheltenham road and a telephone box her grey dress was soaked in blood she had no money and dialled emergency which service love no i want you to get this number for me wolfies machine was on oh wolfie help me rannaldinis just raped me and hes killed gertrude oh please get sharon from the cottage she heard a deafening crash and swung round in terror but it was only thunder she clutched gertrude to comfort her because the little dog had always been terrified of bangs but now gertrude was beyond thunder shouting loud music christmas crackers even fireworks sobbing and shaking convulsively tab jumped in panic as the telephone rang but it was only the worried operator can you reverse the charges to my father at penscombe gertrudes body was losing its warmth and growing heavy i have a reversedcharge call from tabitha campbellblack will you pay for the call asked the operator there was a pause then she could hear ruperts light clipped drawl yes of course hello oh daddy howled tab ive got gertrude and its a thunderstorm but she cant hear it any more because shes dead im so sorry daddy rannaldini kidnapped her and raped me gertrude bit him and saved my life so he threw her against the wall and killed her oh daddy it was so heartbreaking for a second rupert couldnt speak then he said its all right darling where are you im not sure in a telephone box on the edge of rannaldinis woods about a mile out of paradise oh daddy im sorry i didnt save her if gertrude saved you rupert tried to keep his voice steady that was the best possible way for her to go look stay where you are ill be with you in a trice but angel youre too conspicuous in a telephone box he didnt want to terrify her that rannaldini would soon be after her hide behind a tree until someone turns up ill kill him if he comes anywhere near me rannaldini fingered the bump on his head where tab had pushed him against the table and rubbed his leg which was still bleeding fucking dog tab would calm down hed buy her stepmother a new puppy hed better find her before she caused trouble picking up her glass of vodka he went outside the wood was very dark not a star pierced the leafy ceiling there was no sign of tab as he wandered northwards blackberry fronds clawed at his dressinggown like women always wanting things helen had spent most of the day packing everything was such an effort these days she was off to london first thing and to her heartfelt relief rannaldini appeared to be cooling off the appalling pushy and had even offered her his helicopter for years helen had boycotted rannaldinis watchtower as a ghastly phallic example of pandoras box but overcome by restlessness and curiosity as to whether rannaldini had really dumped pushy she decided to take a latenight walk through the woods drawn irrevocably towards the tower she was amazed to find the door open and lights blazing on the first floor she found a glass knocked over a bronze of wagner on the floor a chair on its side and tidied automatically seeing nothing of interest except one of étienne de montignys revolting paintings she retreated to rannaldinis edit suite on the ground floor where he had been watching the rushes here with pounding heart she discovered rannaldinis memoirs diaries bound in red leather with crimson endpapers and in a huge scrapbook on the table beautiful obscene photographs of her husbands women there was that slut flora and serena westwood helen gasped with horror she had trusted and made a friend of serena and look at pushy straddling a sofa in a london flat no wonder the little tart had treated valhalla as though she owned it as if she were watching some horror film helen flicked over the pages faster and faster oh heavens there was bussage roped to a bed like an elephant being airlifted to another safari park shed been right all along about her and oh god blood seemed to explode in her head there was tabitha naked and in her lean beauty and her arrogance hideously reminiscent of rupert but there was worse to come a photograph of helen herself across the gatefold pitifully thin her hips hardly holding up a suspender belt her silicone breasts jutting obscenely from a skeletal ribcage im going mad sobbed helen as if in slowmotion nightmare she turned to the diaries fumbling for the entries where rannaldini had first met her prudish pretentious silly she read numbly then on the night he had first made love to her in prague used wicked doctorshy young patient routine helen a pushover reading on she realized that throughout their courtship rannaldini had not only despised her but had been making love to other women recording conquests even on their honeymoon and interspersed with all this was his craving for tabitha she smiled at me today she was wearing a sawnoff shirt and when she raised her arm i saw the underside of her breast like a gulls egg with a howl of anguish helen went on the rampage tugging a drawer until it fell out she found a draft will dated july bussage must have typed it that afternoon rannaldini was leaving everything to cecilia his second wife to all his children by her and to that monster little cosmo not a cent to helen or wolfie a flash of lightning lit up the wood as though it were day a deafening clap of thunder ripped open the valley running outside helen threw up and up and up rannaldini must be stopped from publishing his memoirs particularly if that fiendish beattie johnson had any say in it suddenly she heard singing these tears are from my soul hermione must be on her way to the watchtower jumping behind a huge sycamore helen didnt notice at first the dancing fireflies of a helicopter landing in a nearby field and men jumping out like an sas raid and running across the grass rannaldini had found no sign of tabitha but the voltage of the vodka hed drunk and the bump on his head which was still seeping blood into his hair were making him dizzy wandering back in the direction of the watchtower surprised to hear sheep bleating he was suddenly distracted by someone singing elisabettas part in the final duet these tears are from my soul soared the voice you can see how pure are the tears women weep for heroes but we shall meet again in a better world he was still a hero in hermiones eyes she was showing him that noone could sing the part better and that she had forgiven him her top notes sounded as pure and lovely as they had in paris eighteen years ago hermione who had given him more pleasure than any other woman why was he squandering his energy on silly young girls smiling he walked down the ride and held out his arms my little darling he called out despite noisy encouragement from the spectators granny and griselda lost to wolfie and simone leaving the others down at the court with plenty of drink wolfie loped back to the house to organize supper in the larder he found a big plate of chicken à lestragon a ham an asparagus and avocado salad a chocolate roulade a large blue bowl of raspberries and was just thanking god for mrs brimscombe when she hobbled whitefaced and gibbering into the kitchen she refused a stiff drink and it was several minutes before she made any sense she had seen a pale mauve light she said it came bobbing out of hangmans wood across the big lawn past the chapel and disappeared into the graveyard must have been someone with a torch there was no footsteps it went straight through the big yew hedge and a wall bobbing and pale mauve it was wolfie mrs brimscombe put gnarled hands shaking like windswept twigs to her face lights like that have been seen in paradise before come to guide the dead soul to his grave she whispered despite the stifling heat wolfie felt icy fingers on his heart it means theres been a death wolfie refusing a lift home she stumbled into the dark wolfie was terrified his father never allowed servants to sleep in the house although to helens distress clive and bussage drifted in at all hours for once he was relieved to hear old bag bussage tapping away on the keyboard in her office and singing probably on the radio coming from helens little study down the passage he must pull himself together and open some bottles grabbing a corkscrew from a kitchen drawer he idly flipped on the answeringmachine and received the full horror of tabs message that shed been raped and gertrude murdered this time i am going to kill my father he yelled oh god where was tab he must find her before rannaldini caught up with her the bastard wolfie dialled to discover where shed rung from then found out from directory inquiries that it was the callbox on the edge of hangmans wood noone answered when he rang it was so dark now between flashes of lightning he decided it would be quicker to drive and found himself trying to open the bmws door with the corkscrew but when he screeched to a halt beside the callbox tab had gone there was blood all over the floor and the telephone a terrible fear gripped him had that pale mauve light been guiding tab thunderclouds had blotted out the russet glare of rutminster the tiny sliver of new moon had gone gratefully to bed behind the wood down at the court the conscientious frugal bernard suggested everyone look for balls whereupon most people sloped off claiming the need to make urgent telephone calls lucy who had returned after her storm of tears in time to watch the last game and give back wolfies signet ring set off with james clinging to her heels for a last run round the south side of hangmans wood she soon regretted it the wood exuded such evil at any moment she expected dark branches to grab her or the hanging blacksmith to thunder by she was glad when the path curved and she could see the comfortingly twinkling lights of paradise village she was just wondering wistfully how tristan had coped knowing he was no longer a montigny at such a tribal gathering as aunt hortenses party when james bounded forward wagging his long tail giving excited little squeaks peering through the darkness lucy could see nothing perhaps james had caught a white glimpse of sharon across the valley but settling back on his haunches still wagging he gazed in the direction of the west gate perhaps he had seen a ghost turning in terror lucy raced back to the tennis court to find ogborne guzzling the last of the strawberries all sorts of exciting crashing bellowed griselda emerging from the wood probably cows said bernard appearing from a more northerly direction and lots of shooting added griselda defiantly ok bernard it probably was teddy brimscombe after pigeon and a helicopter landing and taking off i always feel this woods watching me shivered lucy were still about twenty balls short sighed bernard here are two more coming out of the wood granny dropped a shocking pink and a lime green one on the pile as the chapel clock struck a quarter to eleven ogborne filled up everyones glass what are we going to do about rannaldinis balls he intoned chop em off said granny it wasnt very funny but even bernard was braying with laughter when lucys mobile rang it was rozzy terrified as the howls of mirth escalated that rozzy might think people were laughing at her lucy spanked the air with her hand to shut them up how did the party go rozzy really well judging by the din in the background rozzy however sounded suicidal after all her hard work to make glyns birthday special sylvia the housekeeper had given him a single of swonderful and hed been playing it and dancing with her all evening oh poor you how was the food they seemed to like it although glyn fed his smokedsalmon parcel to the cat and everyones plastered over drunken shouts of happy birthday dear glyn lucy could hear the strains of swonderful smarvellous hes a pig rozzy how was your dress glancing round lucy saw granny and griselda playing imaginary violins and ogborne holding his fat sides and wandered away from them rozzy admitted the dress had been a success youll see it at the wrap party are you having fun yes lied lucy i miss you all so much and we you rozzy where are you ringing from upstairs ive got a migraine not surprising if theyre making such a noise lucy could now hear roars of why was he born so beautiful when are you coming back first thing tomorrow bye lucy darling shes always been a masochist sighed griselda when lucy had recounted rozzys tale of woe in the old days they were known as glyn and bear it said granny mind you im one to talk lucys mobile rang and she blushed feeling disloyal when it turned out to be rozzy again i forgot to say why i rang in the first place can you remind griselda to get hermiones cloak out of wardrobe or leave me a key so i can mend that tear i doubt rozzy paused to listen to the laughter at lucys end you lotll surface before the afternoon griselda and granny reached the finals began lucy but rozzy had rung off she wants you to get out hermiones cloak what a little treasure she is whoops sorry dearie added griselda as she cannoned off one of rannaldinis bronze nudes id better fetch it before i get really whistled rozzy doesnt sound in carnival mood said granny shed never have gone home this weekend if tristan hadnt shoved off to paris observed griselda oh sorry bernie i forgot you had the chauds for her up at the house unable to find wolfie the others were having a riproaring party on the terrace wheres mikhail giggled simone still snoring under weeping ash shouldnt we wake him said lucy oh leave the bloody killjoy with any luck hell get struck by lightning said a newly arrived chloe who was looking lit from inside and wonderfully beautiful its the first time ive seen her without bright crimson lips thought the eagleeyed simone she looks so much softer five minutes later griselda tottered in cant find that cloak anywhere madam must have taken it to milan hope she hasnt got it dirty heres the key griselda dropped it into lucys shirt pocket rozzy can find it why should i bother if ive been fired alpheus arrived next he had changed into terracotta trousers and a blue checked shirt and kept glancing sourly at his watch everyone was deliberately staying up late in the hope of waking late to get into the rhythm of nightshooting but eleven thirty was a ridiculous hour to dine im starved where in hells wolfgang he said tetchily dont tell me the nazi machines broken down at last mocked chloe ignoring a scowl from simone im off to raid the larder going in through the french windows ogborne went sharply into reverse as he met helen in her honeysuckle and lilac silk dress coming the other way pretty woman mused alpheus that would really annoy rannaldini he was about to offer helen one of her own drinks when most uncharacteristically she poured herself a massive vodka and tonic with a frantically shaking hand such a fascinating play on puccini on radio three she told bernard i had no idea that he never finished turandot and that toscanini conducted the première we wont get any dinner out of her murmured ogborne to lucy my god shouted griselda our very own auto da fe swinging round they saw hangmans wood going up in flames and a shower of sparks like an orange inferno the crackling could be heard four hundred yards away as parched trees and dry undergrowth submitted helplessly to the fiery furnace they could feel the heat from where they were standing as the blaze lit up the entire valley rannaldinis watchtowers on fire screamed helen all his papers and compositions will be burnt hurrah said granny pouring himself a drink probably knew they were junk and set fire to them himself crowed griselda holding out her glass all rannaldinis evidence against tristan would be torched lucy felt giddy with relief what about the rushes asked alpheus horrified because he was in them theres a duplicate set at the lab said ogborne hadnt someone better call the fire brigade someone already had with a manic jangling a fleet of fire engines came pounding up the drive and were soon sending fountains of water into the wood five minutes later the firemen were joined by an hysterical flora having run through brambles thistles and nettles all the way from angels reach she was panting so hard she could only croak what about tabloid keep back miss shouted a fireman in a yellow tin hat aiming a huge hose at a blazing oak tree rannaldinis rottweiler flora tugged frantically at his sleeve his kennels under the watchtower weve got to get him out too late miss places been torched he might be alive panted flora in desperation please please shielding her eyes with her arm she inched forward but jumped back as the oak tree crashed to the ground narrowly missing her and spraying sparks everywhere someone grabbed her arm brushing her down and yanking her to safety it was several dazed seconds before she recognized clive behind the blackened face and hair tabloid she sobbed its ok i took him back to the yard earlier are you sure flora yelled over the crashing and crackling she didnt trust clive get back for gods sake bellowed another fireman for a few seconds the blaze had been pegged by the jets of water but as the flames merrily leapt back to life again flora hastily retreating out of the corner of her eye suddenly saw a body on the ground for a crazed second she thought it was some leering silenus caught catnapping in the wood after a surfeit of dryads then slowly horrifically she realized that the lolling tongue the hideously engorged lascivious features belonged to rannaldini alpheuss pink and purple dressinggown had fallen open to reveal a mini watchtower of an erection flora began to scream thats rannaldini hes been murdered we have found a body admitted the chief fire officer cautiously and the police are on their way if i were you he added to clive id take this young lady back to the house people were always screaming at valhalla often to the accompaniment of classical music cars frequently hurtled up the drive helicopters landed like swarms of fireflies shots were heard in the wood as television was so dire on sunday nights many of the inhabitants of paradise had got into the habit of switching off their lights turning round their chairs and focusing their binoculars on the great abbey those watching the goingson on sunday july included old miss cricklade who took in ironing pretty sally and betty the maids who worked at valhalla pat and cath two village beauties with crushes on tristan and that paradise worthy lady chisledon having clocked dame hermiones return from milan and been disappointed by no sightings of tristan on the tennis court the spectators had assumed the flaming watchtower was part of filming but when five fire engines had been followed by detective sergeant gablecross the area cid man in his battered rover and the weay weay weay of a police car with a flashing blue light they realized something was up they were then delighted by the arrival of detective chief inspector gerald portland a local pinup who was equally delighted to have just returned from sailing in turkey with a mahogany tan to flaunt at forthcoming press conferences having seen that rannaldini had not only been strangled but also shot through the heart he ascertained murder had taken place and set in motion the wheels of inquiry no doubt chief constable swallow a dinner guest at valhalla would soon ring lady rannaldini to express his sympathy in no time two uniformed police had cordoned off not only hangmans wood with blue and white ribbon but also the paradise cheltenham road which passed the main gates at valhalla for two hundred yards in either direction a uniform car halted and took the names and addresses of everyone entering and leaving watchers all down the valley were even more excited to see men in white hoods overalls and boots like astronauts landed on the moon moving around the smouldering remains under brilliant floodlights these were the sceneofcrime officers videoing fingerprinting taking soil samples waiting for the fire and ashes to cool cursing under their breath that the fire brigade who were more concerned with saving lives than trapping murderers had drenched the place hurrying as the storm drew nearer the pathologist due from cardiff in an hour or two would get soaked up at valhalla two uniformed policemen were collecting names and addresses within half an hour twenty more were swarming in through the east gate followed by three times as many press rutminster police were still recovering from the infamous valhalla orgy in when pc now dc lightfoot had rolled up to investigate complaints about noise and only been returned to the station with staring eyes thirtysix hours later rannaldini had been cordially detested in the area he had bribed too many local councillors in return for planning permission there were endless rumours of rapes and unnatural practices two of the comelier village girls had vanished without trace in the past three years dark tales had always come out of valhalla to the legends of the hanging blacksmith and the paradise lad was now added that of the strangled maestro but despite their expressionless faces as armed with torches they searched the sinister house and gardens nothing could suppress the excitement of the police that this was bonanza time the eyes of scotland yard interpol and the world would now be on little rutminster every stop would be pulled out as they worked from dawn to long after midnight to find the killer this would mean massive overtime to pay off mortgage and overdraft neither was the hunt tainted with sick revulsion over some fearful child abuse or loss of innocent life only incredulity that noone had murdered rannaldini before detective sergeant gablecross stayed with the body until the sceneofcrime men arrived then made his way up to the house he lived in nearby eldercombe and knew a local network of villains including clive as extensive as the secret passages under valhalla a racing fanatic appalled by rannaldinis cruelty to horses he had been trying to nail rannaldini for years but it seemed the grim reaper had got to the grim raper first gablecrosss primary emotion was passionate relief that overtime from the murder would pay for his daughter dianes eighteenth birthday party the tennis party meanwhile had retreated into the summer drawing room this is diabolical chuntered alpheus rannaldinis name added billions to the film you and hermione will get top billing now cried griselda as she waltzed round the room with granny a tombstone fell on him and squishsquash he died squishsquash he died sang granny euphoric that with rannaldini dead the police might not come and take him away she went to heaven he trilled and flipflap she flied flipflap she flied for chrissake granville snapped alpheus most of us find this an unendurable strain a second later his mobile rang hi there who did you say alpheus turned his back on the room the london times the new york ah well if it was handled in a dignified fashion right give me your number theres no need to call my agent he only handles my performing and recording rights looking smug he switched off his mobile as youre about to sing to the rooftops giggled meredith howie is surely entitled to his twenty per cent ive had offers from the express and the mail said chloe gleefully and im not giving that lazy sod howie a penny bernard a soldier used to death was amazingly calm his duty was to keep the film on course who would be needed for the masked ball tomorrow flora mikhail baby gloria hermione who probably wouldnt be up to it alpheus and granny were on standby and if it rained as forecast theyd have to do cover shots in the great hall outside the police were setting up a major incident van with statement forms floodlights and its own generator perhaps its generator will mate with our generator love is in the air sang meredith noone had thought to dim the chandeliers flora sat shuddering on the sofa clutching trevor for comfort working her way down a bottle of white trying to get rannaldinis grossly contorted features out of her head she had never needed george more but there was no answer from his house or his mobile with her luck the photographs would have been delivered before rannaldini was murdered she wished baby were here to cheer things up sylvestre was comforting jessica dc lightfoot pushy who was one moment sobbing hysterically the next upgrading her parents house from station approach to cherrylands simone was talking to her mother in paris lucy sat beside flora james at her feet occasionally twitching his toes against her ankle to check she was there thank god tristan was far away in paris noone had had more of a motive maman was very angry that i didnt make the party said simone in awe as she switched off her telephone but not nearly as angry as aunt hortense because uncle tristan never showed up and aunt hortense had dispensed with protocol and put him as her favourite nephew on her right his older brothers including my father were very angry tristan didnt even telephone aunt hortense couldnt tear himself away from madame lauzerte muttered ogborne shut up shes in wales hissed sylvestre i told you i saw tristan at valhalla pouted jessica that was why james had leapt forward earlier thought lucy in panic oh look youve spilt your wine over that lovely new settee cried pushy oh god im sorry lucy gazed down as the stain like a dark red jellyfish invaded the seablue silk rannaldini will murder me its all right dearie meredith patted lucys hanging head hes dead now run and get some salt jessica and bring me some grub ogborne called after her ooo look at that lovely man just come in squealed pushy thats detective sergeant gablecross our local sleuth said meredith hastily arranging his curls in a nearby pierglass although his athletes body had grown too big for his suits as a result of too many hastily snatched hamburgers and bags of chips there was an undeniable force about tim gablecross his square ruddy freckled farmers face with its uncompromising mouth and jutting jaw was only softened by light brown hair which waved when it rained and turneddown emeraldgreen eyes these were fringed with such long curly eyelashes that as a uniformed officer they had stopped his cap falling over his broken nose despite a west country drawl as slow as the smile that occasionally drifted across his face he was as tough as a policecanteen steak gablecrosss wife margaret was crazy about opera so he instantly recognized alpheus shaw and chloe catford no wonder dc lightfoot was going scarlet as he took down chloes name and address last time hed seen her at the valhalla orgy shed only been wearing diorissimo gablecross also recognized meredith whalen who was local and granville hastings who was waltzing decorously with lady griselda whom he had often booked for speeding all three looked as though theyd won the pools flora seymour on the other hand gazed into space cuddling a terrier and shaking uncontrollably gablecross remembered her singing in the creation in the cathedral watermeadows and knew that she lived with george hungerford almost more of a wide boy than rannaldini the only thing he noticed about the others was that they were all pissed and on their mobiles except bernard guérin who came over and introduced himself gablecross liked bernard on sight finding him exarmy efficient practical and with a sense of priorities bernard had still failed to contact either sexton or tristan who was probably already on his way back from france as bernard clapped his hands the room fell silent youll all know by now a body has been found announced gablecross and we are making inquiries we would like you to cooperate and let us retain the clothes you are wearing or if youve changed the ones you were wearing earlier for you detective sergeant anything smiled meredith gablecross who battled constantly against homophobia didnt smile back a man hasnt asked me to take off my clothes for yonks said griselda with a shout of laughter the police could use her dress as an incident tent hissed ogborne what happens to our clothes simpered pushy i was hoping to wear this little cardie to an audition next week theyre labelled numbered and put in brownpaper bags said gablecross you werent wearing those clothes earlier anyway the hawkeyed simone told pushy nor was chloe yes i was smartass snapped chloe opening her long blue cardigan to show a white shirt and pleated shorts but alpheus has changed my clothes are back at jasmine cottage said alpheus quickly ill go and get them a police officer will drive you mr shaw said gablecross firmly ogborne was gazing out on the everincreasing crowd of media im going to film them always wanted to be an operator he muttered sliding out of a side door why are all those men wandering around hangmans wood in space suits asked jessica coming back without any salt to avoid contamination of the body explained dc lightfoot admiringly would have thought it was the other way round said granny sourly ill get my job back now griselda collapsed on a sofa drumming her feet excitedly on the floor like a little girl so will i said meredith i did redecorate this room nicely didnt i those onyx pillars are to die for wonder if anyones told hermione wonder how upset shell be mused griselda they go back a long way she probably did it that singing in the wood sounded almost too good for her observed sylvestre the constant listener perhaps rannaldini had replaced her with some young chick then she certainly did it said meredith the murderer is most likely to be a member of the family volunteered jessica who never missed an instalment of the bill with four wives eight kiddiwinks and a million steps and illegits to take into consideration giggled meredith as he handed sylvestre a bottle of red to open the police will be spoilt for choice he went to tother place and frizzled and fried sang granny happily christ what a bunch thought gablecross and leaving dc lightfoot and ds fanshawe to get their clothes off them went off to break the news to lady rannaldini detective sergeant gablecross found helen in a terrible state mindlessly tidying her little study straightening straight objects looking around with huge darting eyes her grey face such a contrast to the lilacs and honeysuckles blooming so luxuriantly on her beautiful silk dress gablecross felt desperately sorry for her but with murder it was his duty to zap her and start scribbling straight away im afraid weve found your husbands body in the wood lady rannaldini what helen went utterly still except for her darting eyes oh my god you dont mean he was caught in the fire how terrible they say you suffocate first she pleaded no no sir roberto died from strangulation and gunshot wounds it wasnt an accident gablecross could have sworn it was relief that flickered over her face there was a long pause which he let her fill is everything in his watchtower destroyed i guess so all his precious compositions whispered helen a muscle jumping in her freckled cheek his lifes work gone i cant bear it what were your husbands movements today he went to his watchtower midafternoon she was twisting her very loose wedding ring round and round earlier i saw him walking round the garden with flora seymour who looked very upset he also rowed with rozzy pringle and alpheus shaw i heard them both shouting i dont know what about artistic people shout all the time a red glass paperweight trembled like a raspberry jelly as she straightened it then some very important rushes arrived of my husband conducting the first and last scenes in the film and mr brimscombe our gardener and clive my husbands bodyguard carried this machine out to his tower so he could watch them my husband was very particular about how he looked on the rostrum did he have anything to eat he had a late lunch of caviare with blinis and sour cream and some peaches from our conservatory taken out to the watchtower around four who would have prepared that mrs brimscombe clive would have taken it out rannaldini didnt like people she paused people he didnt want to visit his tower are you sure he suffocated first officer what did you do this evening i got my clothes ready for london ive got several committee meetings and a dinner in aid of the red cross tomorrow rannaldinis letting me have the helicopter she added proudly then at nine thirty i listened to a play on radio three about puccini by declan oharas son patrick dyou know his work its excellent did you know puccini didnt finish turandot like a tap whose washer had gone gablecross knew shed give him the whole plot but he let her run on captivated by her slight american accent toscanini conducted the première but only as far as puccini had written helens eyes filled with tears toscanini knew my husband and rated him very highly as a conductor did you leave your room while you were listening to the play the phone rang in the kitchen around ten past ten but the machine had picked it up by the time i got there so i left it the calls are always for my husband that was the only time you left the room yes but i missed the end of the play which was maddening did you have any supper mrs brimscombes so dear she tried to tempt me with an omelette but im afraid i chucked it down the john it was so hot and i had a headache you didnt feel like joining the tennis party i popped down earlier with eulalia harrison a charming journalist from the sentinel who was actually interested in hearing my views for a change for a second her bitterness at always playing second fiddle showed through but i didnt stay frankly officer she started to shake again i feel like clarissa eden the crew and the cast have been flowing through this place as if it was the suez canal for three and a half months i want my house back having seen that lot said gablecross drily id feel more like mrs noah frantic for a first glimpse of mount ararat he was touched by the gratitude that swept her face oh you do understand and now rannaldinis not going to be here to revel in those big rooms which have been revamped like buckingham palace this is about the only place that hasnt been meredithed she glanced bitterly round the exquisite little study they do say you suffocate before the flames burn you she was shuddering so violently she had dislodged a false eyelash a funny thing to wear to listen to the radio on sunday night thought gablecross i keep expecting him to burst in officer he was so dynamic wed like you to hand over the clothes you wore today i havent changed out of this dress thats fine could you let us have it when you go to bed id also like he consulted his notebook to speak to your son wolfgang and your daughter tabitha it was as if he had mentioned people shed forgotten existed in a state of grief and shock people invariably look for others to blame why arent they here exploded helen any idea where they might be wolfie was organizing the tennis how dare he disappear when he should be here for me tabs just as thoughtless my son marcus is quite different she picked up a silverframed photograph of a beautiful boy seated at a piano he won the appleton you know marcus would never abandon me at a time like this can you think of anyone who might have killed your husband gablecross let an unbearably long pause elapse until helen said in a low voice tristan de montigny tried to kill him on friday night hermione chloe and gloria prescott were all furious they hadnt got a particular part particularly gloria who everyone nicknamed pushy my husbands been so kind to her lending her the limo and the helicopter she took so much for granted he had that terrible row with alpheus this morning and one with mikhail and hermione too he felt she hadnt sung her part very well but my husband fights with everyone a moth was banging like a muffled funeral drum against the window he cant bear music to be any less beautiful than he hears it in his head her mobile rang helen snatched it up rannaldini its the scorpion she whispered in terror gablecross seized the mobile piss off he roared next moment two photographers had rammed their lenses against the window look this way helen bugger off bellowed gablecross yanking the dovegrey curtains across their faces from now on the media would move into paradise waving their chequebooks like flies round a cowpat eyes in their backsides making the work of the police ten times more difficult turning back to helen gablecross caught a glimpse of a photograph pushed to the back of a shelf of rannaldini smiling down at a ravishing girl she was the spitting image of rupert campbellblack it must be helens daughter how did your husband get on with tabitha images of the photographs in rannaldinis watchtower swam before helens eyes with a naked scornful tabitha on the top as she burst into tears there was an impatient knock and a tall young man in a dark blue polo shirt and tennis shorts barged in with his dark blue eyes gold hair and thighs as strong smooth and brown as its onyx pillars the drawing room leading out on to the terrace might have been decorated to compliment his handsomeness but he looked much too large in here wolfie disliked helen intensely for neglecting tab but he hated to see anyone in distress what the hells going on im sorry weve found your fathers body sir the colour drained out of wolfies suntanned face he had a heartattack im afraid hes been murdered the boy took it wonderfully calmly was it something hed half expected even longed for it must have been a terrible burden to have had rannaldini as a father wolfie turned to helen im so sorry crossing the room he hugged her awkwardly patting her shoulder until her sobs subsided in reality he was playing for time his mind racing how did he die he asked still with his back to gablecross he was strangled and shot wolfie felt a lurch of fear had tabitha killed him what time did he die we dont know the pathologist hasnt arrived yet the police mustnt find out his father had raped tab he must remove that tape from the machine in the kitchen can i get you a drink or a cup of coffee he asked gablecross im fine gablecross could see wolfie wrenching his thoughts into order he could smell his sweat and see the gooseflesh on his bare legs and arms id like a few words with you sir let me just find someone to look after my stepmother and wolfie had bolted the kitchen was empty but to his horror so was the answeringmachine who could have whipped the tape sprinting down the passage he put his head round the blue living room door wolfie shouted everyone they were all drunk who could he trust lucy he pleaded could you look after helen for me and ring mrs brimscombe and ask her to come and help her to bed im ever so sorry wolfie lucy jumped to her feet perhaps we should ring james benson suggested meredith hell be out at some smart dinner party said griselda ill come and check how she is the moment the police have finished with me wolfie promised lucy im going to fetch you a sweater first said lucy gablecross interviewed wolfie in the kitchen the boy was now making coffee and wearing a red vnecked jersey which he loathed because his stepmother cecilia rannaldini had given it to him for christmas as if there were never any question that he wouldnt wolfie said that he and simone had won the tournament returning to organize supper hed found a message from tabitha his stepsister on the machine dyou know where the tape is must be still in the machine lied wolfie tab went home because her parents dog had disappeared shes living in one of my fathers cottages as i had a second key she asked me to fetch her dog and take it back to penscombe gablecross admired a screen covered in hundreds of photographs of rannaldini with the famous couldnt mrs lovells husband have taken the dog hes away rather inconsiderate of mrs lovell to expect you to drive over a hundred miles in the middle of a tennis party she was distraught about her parents dog said wolfie quickly it was a very old family pet did you see anyone when you first returned to the house i heard miss bussage in her office and my stepmothers wireless did you hear anything unusual only hermione singing in the rushes as i walked back to the house sound carries much further on thundery nights although wolfie wrinkled his forehead perplexed i dont remember the bit she was singing being filmed on friday what time was this around half ten i think switching the kettle on to boil for the fourth time he made two cups of coffee why didnt mrs lovell take the dog with her in the first place sharons on heat tabs father has a pack of dogs tab hadnt seen him for two years probably didnt want to rock the boat could a more major crisis have made her rush home asked gablecross a dog going missing is a major crisis in that family said wolfie coldly how long did you stay at penscombe only to hand sharon over wolfie was treading carefully now someone had just brought gertrude their missing dog back shed been run over so i didnt stop as he handed gablecross the sugar and a biscuit tin he could only think of tabs tearful choked words when she rang to thank him on his way back to valhalla please dont tell anyone rannaldini raped me it would kill mummy he had wanted to drive straight back to penscombe to comfort her very attractive young lady mrs lovell gablecross helped himself to a chocolate biscuit did that cause any tension between your father and stepmother dont be ridiculous snapped wolfie it still seems excessive to abandon your guests and drive all that way in the middle of a party my guests said wolfie dismissively have been freeloading here all summer i felt they could fend for themselves the iron has entered into that young mans soul decided gablecross hes not only madly in love with tabitha lovell but lying through his extremely good teeth glancing at the screen again he noticed how colourless the famous people appeared beside rannaldini you couldnt fail to respond to the flashing whiteness of the smile the hypnotic eyes the undeniable magnetism could you come and identify the body sir certainly said wolfie emptying the rest of his cup of coffee into the wastepaper basket they found the forensic team sifting through the ashes videoing evidence scattering grey aluminium powder on the remnants of the watchtower in the forlorn hope of finding fingerprints the pathologist whod just arrived was examining rannaldinis body only when the sheet was drawn back did wolfies composure crumble the strikingly handsome rannaldini now looked like his spitting image puppet a grotesque satyr swollen almost beyond recognition blood and saliva dripping from his nose and tongue lips pulled back in a hideous leer how horrified papa would have been to be videoed without lucy here to brush his hair said wolfie starting to laugh then finding he couldnt stop its all right lad gablecross put a hand on his shoulders alpheuss dressinggown had fallen open to show the muscular legs wolfie noticed the starchy white residue on his fathers thighs the bite on the ankle and the huge erection stiffening as rigor mortis set in probably been dead for no more than two hours said the pathologist replacing the sheet gablecross glanced at his watch about half ten then blood had blackened the grass washing away the earth laying bare the cotswold stone underneath wolfie wondered if someone had mistaken his father for alpheus gripped again with terror that tab might have killed him wolfie lurched away retching into the brambles as he returned wiping his mouth on the back of his hand he said defiantly i dont care how many people slag him off he was my father and a great man while gablecross interviewed helen and wolfie ogborne had joined the mob swarming all over valhalla as they filmed photographed and gabbled into tapemachines describing everything they could see in the darkness armed with valentins lightweight video camera ogborne had turned up the brim of hermiones sunhat like a souwester he was delighted to catch alpheus leaving in a police car to collect his clothes combing his rich auburn locks for the television cameras where are you from asked a bbc cameraman bourbon television said ogborne never heard of it wherere they based paris said ogborne who was now filming the paparazzi who like puppies fighting for their mothers teats were jostling each other to get a closeup of wolfie returning stonyfaced from identifying the body news travels fast directors a frog sos most of the crew explained ogborne huge story for us were trying to sign up the mistress said a reporter from the mirror which one asked ogborne he had lots the big one hermione thats it know where she hangs out whats it worf when two hundred readies had been thrust into ogbornes hand he pointed to river house shes very greedy he called after the departing reporter why in hell hadnt he become a cameraman before great hat said the man from the bbc theyre all the rage in paris said ogborne you can have it for fifty quid if you like thoroughly overexcited by so many hunky young police officers talking softly into their mobiles and flashing their torches clive sought refuge in an ivyclad ruin near the graveyard to ring beattie johnson rannaldinis been murdered how much are you going to pay me for the memoirs and the photos weve already been offered them beattie like rannaldini adored giving pain shit by who wouldnt you like to know well go with the cheaper talk to you in the morning possibly a million smackers the poorer clive switched off his mobile and froze as he saw a torch approaching like a willothewisp from hangmans wood beside him tabloid started growling and whimpering putting a hand down to quiet the dog clive felt the rigid bumps of his hackles then his own hair shot on end as he realized that the violettinged light was too big for any torch and that it wasnt attached to any policeman bobbing past him it went straight through a yew hedge to disappear among the dark holm oaks of the graveyard clive couldnt breathe he felt icy sweat trickle down his ribs under his leather jacket even if rannaldinis body was destined for months in the morgue the violet light was trying to guide him to the graveyard to join valhallas dead the wind was getting up feeling for once in need of company clive raced towards the house alpheus had just returned with his clothes to the drawing room when ogborne wandered in carrying a plate piled high with potato salad and chicken how can you eat at a time like this snapped alpheus his mouth pursing and watering simultaneously because its probably the last time i will eat here said ogborne philosophically sexton had to dip into his own pocket to pay the wages last week and now rannaldinis no longer here to fork out but were all on contracts spluttered alpheus finally tracking down sexton on his car telephone bernard was able to tell him the sad news sexton immediately got the contract out of his briefcase and checked the small print he then gave a whoop of joy they were definitely insured against violent death without rannaldinis interference theyd finish the movie twice as quickly and they could scrap those pompous beginnings and endings include the polo and he could be an extra in a panama hat wally the chauffeur looked on in amazement as sexton leapt out of the now stationary car did a little dance punched the air and said yeah yeah yeah do we have cause for celebration asked wally we certainly do tyrants been toppled sexton then checked his pocket computer and punched out a number id like to speak to rupert campbellblack hes out said a gruff tearful voice no no hes just come in yes snapped rupert rannaldinis been murdered said sexton so weve run out of dosh because he was making impossible demands weve only got a week of nightshootin left and then a day or twos polo polos tabiffas baby shame if we had to junk it there was a pause as rupert did some sums ill come in if i can call the shots naturally said sexton hanging up he did another little dance turn round wally were going back to valhalla but dont forget wally we was in olland park all day wasnt we naturally said wally who also liked the idea of being paid outside in the darkness an evening standard reporter screamed as she fell over mikhails sleeping body under the weeping ash sorry sorry dyou know anything about this murder vot murder someones killed rannaldini god is merciful said mikhail and went back to sleep the moment he escaped from gablecross wolfie rang rupert mr campbellblack this is wolfgang rannaldini my father has been murdered i know i thought it wouldnt look good to say he rrraped tabitha so i said gertrude had been rrun over and tab came home to comfort you and mrs campbellblack good boy said rupert well done and thank you having given up her clothes flora looked like a preschool boy when she returned in lucys striped pyjamas trevor lay on the floor beside her legs stretched out like a frog as clive and tabloid entered the room everyone reached mentally for their swords clive had been rannaldinis éminence grise the devils right hand for a second he and tabloid hovered two dogs without their master a favourite has no friend murmured flora lucy leapt to her feet sit next to me clive she said ill get you a whisky fanks lucy said clive a tinge of colour creeping into his waxy white cheeks fanks very much indeed it was strange that the three fearsome dog rivals for sharons paw lay down beside each other without a murmur clive was followed by mr and mrs brimscombe both looking aged and shaken mr brimscombe had taken off his boots pooh said pushy noticing his grimy toenails protruding through the holes in his socks flora jumped up and hugged them both this must be absolutely horrible for you but dont worry she whispered im sure lady rannaldinill keep you on i know mum would snap you up in a trice if she wasnt so broke griselda patted the sofa beside her come and sit down mrs b fantastic chocolate roulade ive had thirds hows lady rannaldini taking it in a shocking state mrs brimscombe lowered her voice poor soul keeps crying and laughing she wont go to bed i wish dr benson was here to give her something she flinched as a flash of lightning pierced even the thickly lined blue curtains followed by a deafening clap of thunder both james and trevor leapt into their mistresses arms i expect theyll drag the lake to find the murder weapon jessica could be excitedly heard telling sylvestre the lake has dried up said mr brimscombe bleakly at first it sounded like applause in extremely bad taste but the clapping grew louder and louder until they realized it was the rattle of rain on roof window and very dry leaf its raining screamed flora running out on to the terrace and thrusting her face up into the deluge flora flora flora shouted the paparazzi simultaneously trying to shield their cameras and take a picture everyones clothes and names and addresses had at last been taken they could now go home or to bed nightshooting would start around six pm i still havent been able to contact the dop the operator or the director bernard told gablecross itll be a terrible shock to tristan rannaldini was like a father to him at that moment a spectacularly goodlooking young man wandered in rain had darkened and flattened his hair back from his forehead throwing his angelic features into relief a drenched duckegg blue shirt and white jeans clung to his body only under the chandeliers could his grey complexion and red eyes be detected montigny assumed gablecross baby cried flora shooting in through the french windows into his arms hi sweetheart said the young man then looking into her anguished eyes hey hey whats up with you bad news im afraid said bernard rannaldinis dead baby didnt miss a beat about time too he said approvingly and crossing to the drinks tray poured himself a large whisky and soda with a completely steady hand murdered said alpheus sternly really baby looked only mildly interested ill buy whoever did it a huge drink miracle it hasnt happened before at least show some respect for lady rannaldini spluttered alpheus the widow howling for her dead husband baby dropped his voice an octave to sing mikhails line and shes a very rich widow now which should appeal to you alpheus this is detective sergeant gablecross baby said bernard hastily wholl want to question you tomorrow the grand inquisitor sang baby in amusement youre so rugged sergeant itll be a temptation to tell you everything totally undeterred by gablecrosss black pugnacious scowl baby went on for a start all these people have a motive speak for yourself roared alpheus undeclared tax and cuckoldry in your case drawled baby sexual romps with ruminants in chloes ill kill you screamed chloe jocking off in isa lovells case excessive cruelty in helens excessive cruelty to tristan in lucys stop it baby yelled lucy blushing furiously utterly unfazed baby turned back to flora and drew her into an alcove rannaldini had photographs of us making love on the lawn at angels reach she said numbly he was going to blackmail george and if george didnt back off about the bypass he was going to send them to gordon dillon and as if that wasnt enough he said you were hiv positive glad he thought i was positive about something that man was such a liar baby rubbed floras hands to warm them you poor angel what a terrible weekend youve had but i promise you im clean i had a medical for an insurance policy last month and frankly he added pushing the rainsoaked tendrils back from her forehead well finish twice as fast now the bastards dead then i can take you back to oz away from all this squalor its too late sobbed flora baby pulled her into his arms for gods sake a man has been murdered bernard tapped baby furiously on the shoulder may he roast in peace said baby unless youre going to let me identify the body to make sure the conniving shit really is dead im off to bed one must always leave a party early to give everyone a chance to talk about one come on flora darling the rumble of disapproval died on peoples lips as helen appeared in the doorway in a long white nightgown i dont know what to do about locking up she told gablecross in a high singsong voice rannaldinis not back yet and i hate leaving the front door open next minute she was thrust aside by miss bussage who having handed over her clothes was now sporting a mans dressinggown slippers and a hairnet that flattened her cropped hair the maestro may have passed away she called out defiantly but his genius lives on ive got all his compositions and his last will on disk not to mention a copy of his memoirs and duplicates of all the photographs for a second gablecross noticed collective horror on everyones faces then there was a thud as helen rannaldini fainted a strange quiet lay over valhalla the deluge had shredded roses all over the lawn and flattened the dreaming spires of rannaldinis delphinium bed mr brimscombe tugged on his boots and hobbled as fast as possible to hoover up the petals before his master surfaced then suddenly realized that rannaldini would never shout at him again waking also realizing his father was dead wolfie was ashamed to feel as if a poisoned spear had been yanked out of his side then he blushed with shame and revulsion as he remembered tab had been raped he longed to ring her but felt it would only remind her of rannaldini instead he got dressed and set about the long haul of comforting staff and telephoning relations including gisela his mother in munich rannaldinis body still lay under canvas in hangmans wood they would all feel better when it left for the morgue meanwhile every radio station was playing rannaldinis music howie had been on to american bravo and instigated a massive repress of all his records bbc tv had already announced they would be rerunning rannaldinis masterpiece don giovanni starring hermione harefield and cecilia rannaldini tomorrow evening in conjunction with radio news programmes worldwide led on the murder showing clips of the don carlos press conference with rannaldini and tristan swearing eternal brotherhood and to ogbornes delight of alpheus rearranging the police car drivingmirror in order to comb his hair before facing the media by nine uniformed police were trooping in in raincoats to start a fingertip search through a drenched hangmans wood others were going along the high street and up the drives of the big houses dotting the valley asking people if theyd seen anything even more extraordinary than usual last night as cast and crew woke from fitful sleep to clutch their hangovers euphoria that the fiend was no more was tempered by fear that his killer was still at large this was heightened by excitement particularly among the women as news leaked out that rupert campbellblack would be pumping in millions to save the film and henceforth acting as executive producer at midday oscar had arrived from paris with valentin and three crates of rouge which might now last until the end of the shoot no doubt peppy koala will be telling me where to put my lights he grumbled and adding that he hoped ruperts temper was better than his daughters bore valentin off to lunch at the heavenly host there he was incensed to find every table taken by the media who were equally incensed to be banished outside valhallas main gates the vast crowd there included journalists and photographers jabbering away in every language under the sun a fleet of television vans arclights satellite dishes mobile canteens a bar and portaloos as everyone rampaged through paradise frantic for stories hypealong wielding even more mobiles than sexton and unusually sombre in a black armband flowered tie and flared pale blue suit told the cast and crew that the police would prefer them not to talk to the media unless they offer you at least a hundred grand shouted baby whod just spent a lucrative hour on the telephone to the sydney morning herald lucy had been woken within seconds of finally falling asleep by james squeaking excitedly and rozzy banging on the door distressed not to be able to find hermiones cloak and whys the place swarming with police rannaldinis been murdered dont make stupid jokes its true rozzy rozzy was furious that lucy hadnt rung her before i suppose im not important enough oh rozzy groggily lucy switched on the kettle you had a migraine we didnt want to disturb you rozzy was really upset rannaldini was a genius and wanted to know all the details hows tristan taken it she asked finally i dont think hes back said lucy should she tell rozzy about jessicas sighting and simones account of tristan cutting aunt hortenses party rozzy got so upset if she were left out all day the rain poured down on fans who poured weeping into paradise to leave flowers wrapped in cellophane at valhallas gates maestro take me with you to heaven said one card many fans also made pilgrimages of condolence to dame hermiones gates alpheus dropping off a large bunch of salmonpink gladioli that the paradise garden centre were selling off cheap after the weekend was displeased to see the vast number of young people among the crowds rannaldinis popularity had clearly not been on the wane outraged that someone had nicked all her lilies in the night hermione arrived veiled and smothered in black with her arms full of yellow roses covered in greenfly as she knelt in prayer for at least five minutes for the benefit of the worlds press she was filled with fury that rozzy had already left a beautiful bunch of lilies in their own vase of water as the day progressed and the rain continued to gush out of valhallas gargoyles to the worry that they wouldnt be able to film outside was added the fear that tristan had done a runner we cant stop production this pictures costing thousands of pounds a day sexton told gablecross and the couples of plainclothes men and women whod arrived to question everyone on the unit understood said gablecross you carry on where are you planning to shoot if the rain stops on the terrace then in the maze ok ill move my team in noone must go near hangmans wood the areas cordoned off anyway well draw people out as we need them we also need to fingerprint everyone gablecross was paired with the most ravishing black girl wearing a white tightly belted trenchcoat whom he introduced as dc karen needham want to work in movies quipped sexton as he ushered her into his office dc needham giggled gablecross looked bootfaced and asked sexton what he had been up to last night dining at my house in town then driving back to valhalla lied sexton happily as dc needham started scribbling in her notebook me and my driver wally had just stopped for a sandwich and some petrol around one oclock weve got all the receipts when bernard rang me wiv the sad news we agreed i should be the one to tell dame hermione what was her reaction gutted she and rannaldini go back a long way and up a long way thought gablecross irrationally remembering the rampant cock how did she spend the evening he asked idly several people heard her singing in the wood around the time of the murder must have been a tape or the rushes dame hermione came ome from milan around seven thirty watched pride and prejudice on the telly a jane austen freak is dame hermione what the hells happened to tristan he added with unusual irritation the fuckers always turning off his mobile because he wants to think driving towards paradise through the deluge tristan noted spiky conkers on the horsechestnuts and a tangle of purplyblue cranesbill and pink willowherb on the verges echoing alpheuss dressinggown rounding a corner he suddenly saw a flotilla of pizza cartons plastic coffee cups fag ends and beer cans hurtling down the overflowing gutters towards him and went slap into a rugger scrum of paparazzi shouting scribbling banging taperecorders and lenses against his windows tristan ducked in horror had his hideous secret been rumbled the policemen on the gates refused to admit him until he had given them his name and address as he stormed up the drive police and alsatians were weaving in and out of hangmans wood ahead the german and italian flags drooped at half mast gripped by a terrible fear that tab had taken an overdose tristan dived into the house two minutes later he stormed into sextons office what the hells going on theyve dismantled the great hall and the royal box and we havent reshot whats that fucker rannaldini up to now tristan had triple bags under his cavernous bloodshot eyes his lank damp hair looked as though it hadnt seen a comb for days the buttons of his faded peacockblue shirt were done up all wrong he had only slotted his belt through one loop of his jeans which were far too loose he was frantically chewing gum he looked wild angry dangerous a tramp off the street reeking of sweat and sex gablecross opened his mouth but sexton was too quick for him rannaldini was murdered last night tristans suntan seemed to drain into his black stubble leaving his face dirty grey oh mon dieu who killed him thats sergeant gablecrosss job said sexton almost too cosily let me introduce him and his charmin sidekick dc needham tristan nodded then sat down in one of sextons leather armchairs in an instant his face was wet with tears i cannot believe it rannaldini was father to me often i wish him dead for fucking up my movie but he was great man you are not having me on mindlessly parking his chewinggum on the front of sextons desk he groped for a cigarette then dully slapped his pockets i lose my lighter when did he die around ten thirty last night sexton reached forward with a match someone torched the watchtower for a second tristans face like lady rannaldinis last night showed a flicker of something other than horror had he also skeletons wondered gablecross everything was destroyed confirmed sexton tristan breathed in smoke so deeply he almost choked then opened his eyes in horror he didnt die in fire no he was strangled and shot said sexton quickly shut up you fat git thought gablecross furiously let me get at him before he organizes his alibi but tristan had jumped to his feet pacing round the room firing all the same questions not taking in any of the answers someone had sewn a patch of a greyhounds head on the back pocket of his jeans i told detective sergeant gablecross wed be shooting in the maze when the weathers cleared interrupted sexton this pulled tristan together as the drug of the film kicked in id like to ask you a few questions sir began gablecross karen needham whipped out her notebook got to have a shower murmured tristan and before they could corner him was out of the door twenty minutes later showered shaved reeking of eau sauvage and looking again like calvin kleins favourite model he had disappeared into the production office with sexton and a euphoric bernard delighted to be needed and included again rannaldini would have wanted us to carry on were tristans first words he then ruthlessly scrapped rannaldinis opening and closing scenes save for a fleeting glimpse of the inhabitants of the royal box of gordon dillon and of rannaldini briefly exuding magnetism on the rostrum then we wont have to reshoot the ending baby screwed up so that means five days nightshooting in the maze and on the terrace weather permitting counted bernard on his big red fingers followed by two or three days polo which means we could wrap by wednesday the eighteenth tristan glanced at sexton in excitement can we afford polo rupert campbellblack said sexton carefully has agreed to bail us out tristans outraged non was as loud as the shot that killed posa non non non how did this happen i phoned him said sexton simply its all very well you avin lahdidah views about artistic integrity but without him i cant pay any more wages i had nowhere to go like a fart in tight jeans whats in it for rupert money and tabiffa sobbing her little heart out if we cut out the polo scenes shes persuaded all rupes toff friends to appear for a crate of bubbly apiece or somefink sexton turned the screw blithely tab knew how much you wanted polo we cant have rupert involved said tristan mutinously not after what happened with tab and me he must want to kill me you wasnt mentioned i dont fink he knows you wanted your flick saved you ungriteful bastard the row was interrupted by griselda barging in brick red with hangover but in tearing spirits hello tristan isnt it awful and a relief about rannaldini how was the lily in the valley ok said tristan in a surprised voice it was as if she were asking about some event that had happened centuries ago weve got a problem went on griselda hermiones in the first setup this evening and her pale green cloaks missing from wardrobe her maid swears madam didnt take it to milan since meester campbellblack is bankrolling us you better send rannaldinis gulf to paris to fetch another said tristan bitchily theyll have to make a new one protested griselda and i dont fink rupert will like us squandering his dosh said sexton in alarm you sort it out grizel said tristan hermione wont be fit to work tonight well shoot her later in the week and concentrate on chloe mikhail and baby in the maze this evening id better go and see hermione he leapt up restlessly hows wolfie taking it immaculate coping wiv everyfing said sexton admiringly helens in a bad way cant stop crying probably suspects shes been cut out of the will said meredith protecting his curls with a pale blue umbrella as he scuttled in to discuss the evenings sets hi tristan you missed all the fun last night the rains stripped off all the rose petals in the centre of the maze well have to use potted ones have you met butch sergeant gablecross yet all flics are pigs said tristan bleakly all over the unit people gathered whispering in sodden huddles alpheus was incensed that owing to hermiones compassionate leave and the scrapping of the scenes in the great hall he and flora had been told to push off until the end of the week ive never known such lousy scheduling he fumed im never working for montigny again he could hardly have foreseen rannaldinis murder snapped bernard he threatened to kill the guy on friday night snapped back alpheus and stalked off to grumble to sexton about his totalled jaguar don carless giggled flora out of his caravan window tristan watched the deluge lay waste to rannaldinis domain once proud delphiniums prostrated themselves on the paths their petals swept away by the racing muddy water torrential rain was bouncing a foot off the hard ground rattling on the caravan roof like a firing squad could rannaldini really be dead tristan had visions of his godfather hobnobbing with wagner and taking the heavenly choir apart perhaps étienne was already introducing his old friend to the sexiest angels can we have a word sir it was gablecross and the ravishing karen needham im busy snapped tristan as he dialled oscars number can you and valentin film the basheddown delphiniums how was your screening asked karen perching on the windowseat and picking up saturday nights glossy brochure of the lily in the valley i think claudine lauzerte is the most beautiful woman in the world i also now if youd excuse me could you tell us where you were last night gablecross sat down beside karen i have no time now exhausted shocked obsessive or just plain arrogant thought gablecross bloody frogs they were just like publicschool boys not in any way superior just assumed they were with such a high profile said karen sympathetically you must get really twitchy before a film comes out not just about the critics savaging it but because the journalists get the opportunity to pick over your private life tristan looked into her kind beautiful eyes longing to lay his head on her trenchcoated breast and sleep for a thousand years i have to rise above the parapet he confessed and geeve interview because so much money and peoples careers are involved my father was well known in france i loved his early paintings said karen the ones of the garonne gablecross looked at his running mate with reluctant respect tristan was thawing by the second but froze up instantly when gablecross asked him when he had returned from paris i drive through channel tunnel yesterday at what time midafternoon if you could let us have your ticket then what did you do always as film is ending i need to psych myself into next one which will be story about hercules at the end he is given poison shirt by jealous wife and in his agony tears up forests and builds his own funeral pyre i need woodland location so i go to forest of dean and drive around for hours thinking and sleep in my car gablecross if he lost a couple of stone would make a good hercules thought tristan idly as he talked he had been opening his post systematically binning the letters and even a new chequebook and smoothing out envelopes on his blotter can you tell us exactly where you spent the night asked gablecross tristan ignored him did you study my fathers paintings at school he asked karen as she retrieved his letters and chequebook from the bin but when she said she had he gazed at her dumbly unable to remember what hed asked then his mobile rang ello si having jumped on it he immediately shoved karen and gablecross out of the caravan slamming the door in their faces resourceful karen however who had attained a levels in french as well as english and art had deliberately left her notebook behind what was he saying asked gablecross after shed retrieved it he was talking very fast but the general gist was that he wouldnt say anything and noone had seen him arrive or leave and hed speak to whoever the person was later well done said gablecross grudgingly spirals of white mist drifted across the valley like ghost priests hurrying to welcome rannaldini to the other side on the steps outside the house gablecross was assuring wolfie that his fathers body would soon be off to the morgue when a convoy of fleet water board lorries came splashing up the drive instantly like a malignant crow in her black suit miss bussage swooped out of the front door down the path flanked by lavender bushes take it away she hissed at the first driver youre too bloody late the maestro wanted his ponds and lake filled up but hes dead so we dont need you any more yes we do shouted wolfie following her out through the omnia vincit amor arch forecast says the heatwaves coming back im head of the house now he added coolly and no ponds are drying up on me then turning to mr brimscombe who was rubbing his green fingers in glee that at last someone was taking on bussage please show the drivers where we need the water youre not the head of the house bussage exploded with rage i typed his last will he left everything to cecilia and her family she was the one he loved who got the part of delilah not a penny to you or your boring mother or that golddigging helen or her slut of a daughter in daylight wolfie could see the scurfy grey roots of bussages oily dark hair her malevolent little eyes her open pores youre fired you disgusting bitch he said furiously you cant fire me i bloody can dialling the car pool he ordered a driver to take miss bussage to her sisters house in an hour itll be a pleasure lisped clive thatll give you time to pack wolfie told her well send the rest of your stuff on later reaching inside his blazer pocket resting his cheque book on his knee he wrote her a cheque thats six months salary consider yourself lucky ill fight you through the courts feel free short of chaining herself to the balustrade there was not much bussage could do returning to her office where she had reigned supreme and for a while experienced true love she took the disks of rannaldini memoirs and envelopes containing the most salacious photographs out of a filing cabinet and locked them into her briefcase then went down to the cottage to pack surely my father should go in an ambulance protested wolfie as rannaldinis body was carried on a stretcher across yellowing lawns to a black mortuary van its considered unlucky to carry a body said gablecross gently ambulances only take the living as the mortuary van doors opened miss bussage came out of valhalla having loaded up her bags clive waited smirking by the limo saying goodbye to noone bussage handed her card to gablecross ill be at this address id like to set the record straight ill be in touch on the steps outside the omnia vincit amor gates baby flora granny and an ashen wolfie watched with mixed emotions the black van rumbling down the drive he was charismatic glamorous fearless began flora slowly a brilliant musician and the greatest conductor in the world her voice broke wolfies face wobbled for a moment then he put an arm round floras shoulders thank you he mumbled and instinctively baby launched into the heartbreakingly beautiful lament which he and alpheus had sung over posas body a few seconds later granny had joined in singing alpheuss part his clear voice ringing out less powerfully than alpheuss but with far more feeling i have cast this man of pride and passion into the tomb he sang you should have played philip whispered flora taking his hand bernard had tried to persuade rozzy to join him for a late lunch but she wanted to pray for rannaldini in the chapel gablecross found bernard tucking into a large steak pomme frites and half a bottle of rouge in the canteen and started grumbling about tristans lack of cooperation hes only a boy protested bernard hes had a bloody awful life but the last six months have been the worst rannaldini was a monster tristan doesnt mean to be rude but the film comes first how long have you known him ive known the family for thirty years breaking up a french loaf with those big red hands which would have no difficulty strangling anyone bernard told gablecross about being in the army with tristans brother laurent tell me about the tennis match stormy bernard smiled showing his rockinghorse teeth women at the end of a shoot all probably having their periods at the same time all crying chloe and gloria furious a part had gone to rannaldinis second wife lucy missing tristan flora missing george theyd had some row mikhail upset about his wife griselda and meredith upset rannaldini had sacked them alpheus cross wolfie had smashed his jaguar and rannaldini wouldnt give him another granville hastings upset his boyfriend was on some troop ship wolfie in love with tabitha simone mad about wolfie noone very happy said gablecross who without realizing it was steadily eating bernards chips rannaldini was wearing alpheuss dressinggown could someone have meant to kill him possible bernard tugged his moustache nice guy alpheus but somehow more unpopular than rannaldini think any of them could have killed rannaldini all of them it was the worst shoot ive ever been on something had to give rannaldini needled tristan crazy tristan adores that little madam tabitha rannaldini put the boot in there tell me more said gablecross having averaged a couple of hours sleep and half a bottle of gin a day over the past week baby looked frightful you could drive to rutminster on my red veins he told lucy as she got to work with her paintbrushes and pencils smudging moulding embellishing only half listening to the interminable news bulletins and the chat between baby and flora who had sought refuge in her caravan hermione helen and gloria are all seeing bereavement counsellors said flora then why cant i grumbled baby you loathed rannaldini chided lucy i know but i adore talking about myself noticing flora was trembling again baby put a hand on hers its ok sweetheart rannaldini was murdered for revenge or to stop him doing something even more unspeakable now hes out of the way theres no need to murder anyone else there is if someones still got the memoirs and the photos shivered flora next moment they were distracted by john dunnes voice on the wireless the music world is in shock and mourning today for sir roberto rannaldini he was saying we have on the line someone who worked with sir roberto for many years the great diva dame hermione harefield turn it up beseeched baby roberto rannaldini was a great conductor a father figure and the closest possible personal friend hermiones voice throbbed with emotion he had an amazing gift for recognizing genius in the young nearly twenty years ago he cast me as elisabetta in don carlos the part i am singing at the moment after that first night i well remember rannaldini saying you have the loveliest voice i have ever heard dame hermione no i tell a lie i wasnt a dame in those days the inhabitants of lucys caravan were clutching their sides when hermione was interrupted by an impatient clicking on the line and a shrill voice saying get off the fucking line mum i gotta ring ladbrokes little cosmo who had smashed his mobile in a fit of temper that morning wished to use his mothers telephone to accompanying squawks john dunne could be heard saying firmly im afraid weve lost dame hermione miss bussage enjoyed the journey to her sisters house if as promised she had become the fifth lady rannaldini she would have travelled always in a limo although she would have preferred that leering scoundrel clive to have worn his chauffeurs cap she had no regrets valhalla without rannaldini would have been like lemon and black pepper without oysters anyway whichever newspaper eventually bought the memoirs would give her enough to live on comfortably for the rest of her life when she arrived she couldnt resist getting out the floppy disks and the photographs so she and her sister could have a gloat together only when she tried to print out the disks did she find theyd been switched for blanks and the dirty pictures all replaced with a pile of rannaldinis fan photographs her howl of rage could have woken rannaldini in his chill chamber in rutminster mortuary eighty miles away with all the rescheduling gablecross and needham were anxious to interview the released singers before they dispersed they caught alpheus by the pool bronzed and glistening from his daily twenty lengths what a hunk thought karen feeling herself blush as alpheuss wet hand held hers a fraction longer than necessary as he crinkled his eyes at her i dont know if policewomen are getting younger but theyre sure getting more beautiful you sure keep in shape theres no excuse for singers to gain weight said alpheus lovingly drying his rippling muscles what were you doing between nine thirty pm and eleven thirty yesterday asked gablecross sharply finishing off a tennis match i bet you play real good said karen admiringly i used to be rated in the top fifty as he vigorously rubbed his hair alpheus was frantic to sculpt his waves with a blowdryer but didnt want to appear a cissy in front of karen i can only give you a few minutes officer he said ive shifted a recording to milan tomorrow and lady rannaldini is kindly lending me the gulf why did you throw the game asked gablecross i had a delightful but not very strong partner and my mind was on other things according to our information you left around nine thirty and didnt stay to watch the finals i didnt want to catch cold in ninety degrees to be truthful alpheus pulled a face i was choked about not winning singers are overly competitive after that he said he had swum his twenty lengths in the dusk then i jogged back to jasmine cottage showered changed then called my agent christopher shepherd of shepherd denston my carlos contract promised to release me by july i wanted him to pacify the record company and negotiate a few days vacation with my wife before i start don giovanni what time did you ring him around ten thirty i guess but it wont show on the phone bill my agent and i have a code i let the phone ring four times so he knows its me and calls me back he takes twenty per cent of my earnings so he can pay for a few calls may we have your agents number karen had studied body language alpheus was clearly nervous the way he kept fiddling with his hair how did you get on with rannaldini she asked between great artists there is a bond said alpheus firmly you were overheard having an argument on saturday morning of course we fought artists do i was angry he had favoured granville hastings not a great voice on the tape rannaldini wanted to justify his decision to employ him all conductors do this my powerful instrument can stand it said alpheus pompously god if he didnt get to a blowdryer soon hed have an afro is it true you were close to your tennis partner gloria prescott it is the duty of the established singer to encourage talent said alpheus its even more gratifying when a fine voice belongs to a charming young woman he winked at karen weve had information you argued with rannaldini about her and about the attention rannaldini was paying to your wife rumour rumour if you say good morning round here people think youre in a relationship little minds have little else to do than fabricate stories about the famous why did you move into dame hermiones cottage to spend quality time with my wife were big animal people mr bones our german shepherd pines without her we cant bring him here because of your goddam quarantine laws so cheryl never visits for more than a week that should endear me to a traditionally dogloving english cop thought alpheus sourly when cheryl is here we like to be alone he went on and frankly not having been to an english public school like you officer alpheus crinkled his eyes again lets flatter the squarefaced bastard i found the dormitory atmosphere at valhalla claustrophobic so dame hermione a good friend lent us jasmine cottage now if youll excuse me alpheus smothered himself in a white towelling bathrobe have you any idea who might have killed rannaldini must be an outside job noone involved in this movie would want rannaldini off the credits you wore a pink and purple dressinggown to play philip sing philip said alpheus fussily dyou know where it is in wardrobe i guess rannaldini was wearing it when he was murdered said gablecross clearly this jolted alpheus his weddingring glittered and quivered as his shaking hand moved through his hair had cheryl taken the dressinggown from the back of the wardrobe at jasmine cottage he wondered and given it to rannaldini whod always coveted it dyou think someone could have mistaken rannaldini for you i have no enemies said alpheus coldly alpheus shaw claims to have no enemies said gablecross nor has he many friends said flora but i mustnt speak ill of the alive in case you take it down in evidence against me they found her slumped in lucys caravan watched beadily by foxie her puppet mascot and trevor the terrier she was threequarters down a bottle of white and was reading a small leatherbound book in bad light she looked wretched deathly pale and redeyed i suppose youre not allowed drink would you like a cup of tea weve had about a gallon each said gablecross sitting down opposite her karen edged wideeyed towards lucys makeup table tipping the spine of floras book gablecross saw it was macbeth enjoying it suits my mood shivered flora and witherd murder she read out thus with his stealthy pace with tarquins ravishing strides towards his design moves like a ghost cant imagine anyone withered or ghostly being strong enough to murder rannaldini rage and adrenalin pronounced gablecross give the smallest frailest person strength that puts little meredith in the frame said flora hes never forgiven rannaldini for calling his auto da fe set suburban fond of him were you rannaldini no i loathed him he seduced me when i was sixteen then dumped me but its still a shock what were you doing between nine thirty and eleven thirty last night getting pissed mostly then i went home to feed the cat my parents live next door you can see the stone angels through the trees i hadnt realized how dark it was so i skirted the rose gardens the maze and the stables and ran past our pond on the right who saw you at home only the cat whos not great on alibis did you notice anything unusual on the way like hermione praising another singer flora topped up her glass sorry silly joke i heard her singing elisabettas last duet might have been a cd or a tape there were lights on in river house and magpie cottage i heard sheep bleating they always bleat when anyone comes through hangmans wood hoping its the shepherd with their hay the grass is so poor live at home do you asked gablecross who knew the answer no i live with george hungerford at least i did until recently i was going to marry him she accepted one of gablecrosss cigarettes with a shaking hand ill pay you back that lipstick really suits you she added to karen who put it down hastily and picked up her notebook flora dolefully relayed the drama of george landing his helicopter in the middle of her snogging scene with pushy he went ballistic i told him to fuck off she said finally and sadly so george has landed his helicopter here before said gablecross quickly didnt you notice one landing last night around ten thirty and someone running towards the watchtower floras eyes flickered in horror it couldnt have been george she whispered im sure hes in germany she kept fiddling with her mobile to make sure it was switched on how did you get back to valhalla i drove it was dark by then it gets very creepy funny things have been happening recently topping up her drink she listed grannys patchwork quilt the adder in lucys makeup box slug pellets in jamess waterbowl tab nearly burning to death in the auto da fe why didnt anyone call the police we were so desperate to finish the film the budget was spiralling like rannaldinis staircase that we avoided anything that might hold it up oh i forgot foxie she waved her puppet fox was cut to pieces i was so lucky rozzy pringle spent hours sewing him together like surgeons in casualty labouring through the night taking foxie from her gablecross examined the joins can i borrow him no flora snatched him back i need the luck outside a huge rainbow reared up on the other side of paradise its stopped raining lets go for a walk hearing the word trevor ran yapping out of the caravan flora followed him carrying her glass and foxie the fingertip team whod been struggling through hangmans wood all day were drenched pricked lacerated and stung handlers patrolled the edge of the trees arent they sweet sighed flora as their alsatians strained at their chokechains barking at trevor who yapped back dancing just out of reach think of those brave pointed noses sniffing out clues we use dogs more to intimidate the public confessed gablecross not very reliable at finding things i did a dogevading course once volunteered karen i hid in a badger set covered myself with twigs and a bloody great dobermann came up peed on me then passed on pissed on flora started to laugh then shuddered look theres clive no doubt flogging his story which must be horrendously steamy to that disgusting crone eulalia harrison from the sentinel when did rannaldini actually die hard to be accurate bodies cool very slowly on a hot night what happens if you dont find a body at once asked flora as they splashed through puddles the colour of weak tea flesh gets eaten by foxes and badgers now i know why you didnt want any lunch flora told foxie petulantly the eyes go first added gablecross crows peck them out oh my god flora started to tremble rannaldini had wonderful eyes conductors eyes he could transform an orchestra just glaring at them she leapt as her mobile rang george she gasped in ecstasy then slumped viking how kind if youre sure it wont be too much trouble im too pissed to drive ill get a taxi thats one of my exes viking oneill she told gablecross listlessly im going to stay with him and his wife for a few days just leave us the phone number and address the chapel clock struck seven thirty the deluge had swept cypress twigs on the paths into long brown snakes the rainbow was fading as they moved through the yew rooms of rannaldinis garden the rain had dusted and polished the nude nymphs lurking in every corner there would be noone to fondle them now what happened when you got back to valhalla asked karen i saw the watchtower on fire and thought of tabloid trapped in his kennel so i left trev in the car on the edge of the drive and hurtled through hangmans wood risky under the circs whole place ablaze i got to know tabloid well when i was sleeping with rannaldini you didnt notice anyone in the woods only firemen and clive god knows what he was doing there was a disgusting smell of burning feathers probably rannaldinis mattress going up safety regulations werent his forte could you describe his tower for us well the top floor was all bed with an appallingly narcissistic mural round the walls of an audience in evening dress cheering him on to intenser orgasm the next floor down was all dark blue jacuzzi the next was a redwallpapered pouncing chamber full of low sofas and bowls of exotic fruit on marble tables and a picasso on the wall you dont know where he kept his safe nope or where he worked on the ground floor he had an edit suite was that where he did his composing asked a scribbling karen decomposing now flora giggled then began to cry im so sorry she groped for a piece of orange loo paper jokes are the only way i can cope it happened when my nan died karen put an arm round floras shoulders its a typical reaction to shock rannaldini never took you into any torture chamber asked gablecross he didnt need a chamber said flora bleakly his presence was enough they had reached a balustrade looking over the fastfilling mere reaching behind a cascade of bright pink roses for a tin of fish food flora chucked a handful of pellets into the water goldfish lying still as autumn leaves burst into activity but a huge black fish ten times their size suddenly swam to the surface ravenous mouth not only devouring the pellets but ready to swallow anything alive that got in its way just like rannaldini shivered flora dont ever kid yourself he was a victim we only met up after he chucked me because i sang in the creation he took me back afterwards to the watchtower then beat me up because i wouldnt stay the night you can see why george hated me being around him this summer let us forget the universe life and heaven itself a ravishing voice floated across the hot muggy air what matters the past what matters the future i love you its baby sighed flora collapsing on a stone bench in ecstasy doesnt he make even the hair on your legs stand on end was george jealous of baby asked gablecross idly oh no stammered flora babys just a friend are you sure you didnt go to the watchtower to get these back they were in rannaldinis dressinggown pocket when he was murdered gablecross splayed out the photographs on the bench like a poker hand next moment the ground was covered in fish pellets and trevor had rushed forward to hoover them up oh god whimpered flora baby comforted me after george and i had our screaming match so you took him home gablecross pointed to a shadowy angel in the background i thought he was gay by the time i realized he wasnt it was too late seem to be enjoying yourself oh i was hugely was rannaldini blackmailing you he threatened to give them to george or the scorpion did you burn down rannaldinis watchtower no no protested flora huddled on the stone bench she burst into tears again i love george so much i keep seeing rannaldini in the wood sneering even in death whatll they be doing to him now cutting him up weighing every organ they wont find a heart did you kill him no but i wanted to i must get a taxi they were interrupted by retching trevor had thrown up all the pellets back into the mere instantly the great black fish swarmed up to the surface and swallowed the lot yuk screamed flora snatching trevor and foxie she fled towards the house poor flora said karen indignantly as she and gablecross made their way through the twilight towards the maze im sure she didnt do it in the right place at the right time with the right motive shes terrified isnt she mind you id be terrified of losing a lovely rich bloke like that not so lovely said gablecross grimly whats carving up our flora is panic that george has done it night brought terror the famous valhalla maze planted in the eighteenth century towered twenty feet high and extended more than a hundred yards in diameter even in daylight people got lost for hours but now round every twist and turn of the ebony ramparts the murderer might be lurking while carlos sang of his ecstasy that at last his beloved elisabetta had summoned him by a letter signed e to a midnight tryst chloe as eboli the real writer of the letter was being tracked through the maze by tristan and valentin on the crane racing to meet the man she believed loved her chloe paused to spray on scent and rearrange her breasts in the lowcut taffeta like all newcomers gablecross and karen needham were drawn to the fascination of filmmaking from the terrace they could see not only the singers almost sanctified by their wonderful costumes chloe in her crimson ball dress mikhail and baby in dinner jackets but also the great paraphernalia of crew cables and lights with bernard barking out instructions and tristan completely absorbed despite the tragedy that had broken over his head encouraging bullying shouting cut over and over again now he was patiently explaining the plot to mikhail this is turning point of play once eboli realize carlos loves the queen she will shop them to the king posa realize that not only will his beloved friend carlos be burnt at the stake for cuckolding the king but all his plans for liberating flanders will go up in smoke so he moves in to silence eboli i wont need to act at all fingering his flickknife mikhail glowered at chloe the crew glanced round nervously their instinct was to huddle together but in doing so could they be standing next to the killer as tristan filmed an apprehensive excited baby in the centre of the maze gablecross and karen buttonholed chloe in her caravan her beauty was heightened by lucys makeup and the crimson dress which matched her sly smiling mouth and showed off her smooth golden shoulders one eye was hidden by a black patch the other glittered like a yellow tourmaline traditionally princess eboli was blind in one eye explained chloe baby strokes my face in wonder then realizes as he reaches the eye patch hes declared passionate love to the wrong woman as chloe snuggled into a bluechecked armchair sipping bottled water and rotating a slender ankle to prove her long skirt wasnt concealing treetrunks she seemed to glow with inner happiness not entirely induced by a long lunch with eulalia harrison she was devastated by rannaldinis death she told gablecross he had been wonderful to her she had spent sunday afternoon at harvey nichols sale trying on hundreds of things but not buying anything she had been furious to be knocked out of the tournament mikhail simply hadnt tried afterwards i dragged him into the maze hoping to sober him up enough to rehearse tonights big scene but we rowed because i wouldnt go back to valhalla and sleep with him like all men he was incensed that lara his wife had rumbled us but still wanted to carry on the affaire he passed out at about nine oclock under a weeping ash how did lara rumble you asked karen rannaldini was lord of misrule on friday night he dragged lara all the way from moscow then deliberately arranged for her to catch her husband kissing off my lipstick even worse he relayed over the speakers a tape of tristan and meredith bitching about everyone particularly hermione tristan went berserk and tried to strangle rannaldini as she talked chloe kept stretching like a cat hollowing her belly in ecstasy as she looked up under her eyelashes at gablecross he found himself squaring his shoulders a crow with a sore throat has better intonation than dame hermione went on chloe but she didnt deserve that humiliation and by playing the tape rannaldini completely destroyed tristans street cred as a nice guy dyou think he killed him possibly rannaldini was a dealmaker tristan a dreammaker it was inevitable theyd fall out if they worked together according to simone tristan cut his aunts eightysixth birthday party in paris so he could have got back i always suspected he was one of rannaldinis illegits rannaldini was far nicer to him than to wolfie on the other hand tristan could be gay and in love with rannaldini only that could explain how their relationship survived such fearful rows you reckon gablecross tried to hide his interest karens eyes were on stalks as she scribbled frantically to keep up well tristans incredibly buddybuddy with his foppish french crew and hes taken all the attractive women in the cast out to dinner but never lifted a finger serena westwood whos beautiful had a nextdoor room to him in prague not a pass was made didnt he like tabitha campbellblack piped up karen so did rannaldini bats about her taking another slug of bottled water chloe told them about the newspapers flaring up under tab that was probably the first murder if tristan hadnt dragged her free shed have burnt to death and good riddance to most people shes such a brat anyway they fell into a showy clinch and he whisked her home leaving ranners foaming at the mouth and tristans admirers ready to slit their throats but during the night something happened perhaps he couldnt get it up perhaps rannaldini put the boot in but the next morning he blew her out the atmosphere was terrible wolfies had to carry tristan ever since chloe smiled wickedly what other soap updates would you like flora had a schoolgirl crush on rannaldini until he dropped her from a great height this summer he dropped gloria hermione and serena and didnt provide parachutes for them either and he was atrocious to helen always flaunting other women any of that lot could have done it a lot of people chloe pondered might have bumped off rannaldini for being horrible to tristan who does inspire devotion im sure bernards a closet gay and in love with him rozzy pringles got a real old ladys crush posies in his caravan darningneedles at the ready and lucy latimer our makeup artist as they like to be called shakes so much if tristan drops into her caravan you risk getting your eyes gouged out with a mascara wand lucys one of those plain women men leave children and dogs with rather than wives for anyone else chloe glanced up at the telephone list beside the mirror most of the frog crew were in paris on sunday night but are quite capable of putting a crosschannel hex on rannaldini mikhails a kleptomaniac removes your earrings when he makes a pass and never gives them back wolfies cute he arrived carrying a torch for flora but transferred his affections to the brat pushy galore thats what we call gloria prescott heard wolfie threatening to kill rannaldini around ten fortyfive on sunday night i should wear a chastity belt when you interview pushy detective sergeant shes into hunks looking up from her shorthand notebook karen said tartly alpheus shaw told us gloria was a delightful young woman and a lovely singer in a second chloes look of amused composure was wiped off her face alpheus shaw offshore to his accountant is a serial adulterer she hissed hell have to quarter his consumption if hes going to play don giovanni with any conviction i dont know who had the bigger ego him or rannaldini but rannaldini was so incensed that alpheus beat him at swimming he seduced alpheuss ghastly wife cheryl and playing leporello listed every woman alpheus had been up and down to this summer which included hermione and pushy alpheus has also been up to one stradivarius of a tax fiddle putting among other things mr bones his german shepherd on the payroll as his financial manager rannaldini threatened to expose him refused to replace the jaguar wolfie totalled and teased him about his big nose oh mr shaw had plenty of motive to murder rannaldini slowly the quiver of rage subsided on a happier note i guess we have to congratulate you said karen innocently id love to play delilah again chloes face convulsed with fury id got that part that bastard rannaldini who saw himself as a global puppeteer pulled strings and got it given to cecilia his geriatric exwife no doubt in lieu of alimony again the rage cooled this is all offtherecord of course chloe smiled sweetly eboli is such a mischiefmaker i was psyching myself into the part would you like to make a statement perhaps teased chloe mikhail tries to stab me in the next scene please stick around and guard me detective sergeant as she turned to the mirror dabbing away a few beads of sweat with a powder brush wolfie popped his head round the door five minutes chloe gablecross consulted his notes at nine thirty you were heard down by the tennis court making a call on your mobile asking how things were going to my mother i always ring her on sunday night and you were phoned back at nine thirtyfive and said again gablecross referred to his notebook ok terrific ill be with you as soon as i can there was a pause sorry to disappoint you sergeant it was mummy ringing back we were arranging lunch id be free because of nightshooting she was letting me know wednesday was fine could we have your mothers phone number i think i chucked it shes touring abroad and gave me lots of numbers probably some hotel karen made a note to follow this up you left the tennis after that she asked playing for time chloe rummaged in her handbag for a silver scent spray squirted it behind her ears and into her cleavage lovely perfume sighed karen i can never remember what its called chloe turned back to gablecross i went for a jog round paradise the tennis had hardly been arduous youve been most helpful said gablecross leaping to open the door just a jog at twilight sang chloe disappearing into the night that woman is the biggest bitch stormed karen there isnt a member of the cast she hasnt slagged off but very useful gablecross squinted at his reflection in chloes mirror perhaps he was hunky rather than fat wonder why she never married prefers to be the leisure activity of some guy cared for by a wife said karen dismissively and her alibi is extraordinarily thin shooting was progressing so much faster now rannaldini was no longer around to say no no no that gablecross was anxious to nail mikhail before he pushed off he found him in the bar a great russian bear dropping five alkaseltzers into a pint mug of water is my fault mikhail rolled dark eyes to heaven i drink two litre of vodka yesterday and even vorse i have munchies ven i vake and eat jacket potato with baked beans and two sandwiches filled with bacon avocado and mayonnaise now i feel seek he proceeded to refute chloes story bloody bitch is bloody liar i never sleep viz her and spend only five minutes arguing in maze she said you argued for several hours rubbish i pass out with respect sir you might not have been in a fit state to remember i remember her going i pass out under wipping ash i also have a perfect motive for murder rannaldini set up party knowing id be kissing everyvun then he introduce my vife i love my vife and he visks her off to votchtower and make me cockhold karen who was given to laughter buried her face in her notebook how dyou know rannaldini took your wife to his watchtower have you spoken to her since then of course not mikhail smote his breast rannaldini visk all vomen to votchtower whoever murder rannaldini is ero vork is vonderful i am booked for figaro for recording of elijah cecilia rannaldini who play delilah with me who eat bass baritone for breakfast ask me to stay in rome but all that is nothing mikhail unhooked gablecrosss parker pen from his breast pocket to sign the bill vizout my lara vot price crocusyellow range rover i just buy if there is no lara to drive round steppes he would be back on wednesday or thursday he assured gablecross when they could talk more ok mr wolfgang he added as wolfie appeared at his shoulder i come and am quite sober he belched loudly i am off to murder eboli votch my knife slide into that bitch then he burst into earthshattering song vot has he said unhappy woman tremble as he strode off gablecross turned to a grinning karen nice straight bloke he liked men who loved their wives goodlooking too now where the hell did i put my pen overhead jupiter danced a stately gavotte with a newish moon below the rows escalated the beetch keeked me on front legs roared mikhail im not having him brandishing that knife at me screamed chloe a white rose in a plant pot flew out of the maze narrowly missing gablecrosss head dont worry said a soft sweet voice theyre only psyching themselves up to sing come and have a nice cup of tea my names rozzy pringle the tristanworshipper thought karen back in make up which was deserted because lucy was on the set karen saw that rozzy had a lovely face but so crisscrossed with lines it was as though some victorian beauty was peering through a lattice window since her trip home for glyns birthday rozzy had abandoned her short becoming curls and regressed to her seventies style of straight hair falling to below her collarbones with a straggly fringe her pale pink lips and big darkringed eyes were seventies too as were the flat shoes and the braless figure in the calflength floral shift gablecross thought she looked like a hippie deborah kerr his wife margaret was a huge fan of rozzy it was my husband glyns fiftieth birthday yesterday she confided switching on the kettle she took some slices of chocolate cake from a polythene bag so ive brought back some of his cake weve been married twenty years it seems like yesterday how long have you been married officer gablecross clapped his head with his palm you must remind me he begged karen its our twentieth anniversary on sunday murder inquiries take over you forget everything have you got kids karen asked rozzy id so love to have had sighed rozzy my husband has two from a previous marriage but how pretty you are child rozzy gazed at karen in wonder i bet youre hungry weve got basil in the windowbox outside ill make you some tomato sandwiches piece of cakell be fine said gablecross who wanted to start the questions you must be upset about rannaldini very rozzys eyes filled with tears he had such a dreadful childhood you know his father was a german officer fighting in italy at the end of the war his mother an italian intellectual they fell in love rannaldini was the result the officer went back to germany the italian intellectual was married anyway to a farmer but always felt little roberto had blighted her political career she was terribly harsh on him putting three tomatoes in a bowl rozzy poured boiling water on them then when rannaldini was only in his teens she went on he realized his fairy godmother had given him good looks alarming charm and musical genius the world was at his feet and im afraid it spoilt him but underneath he was sick at heart because hed had four wives and endless endless women but never been able to maintain anything permanent what about dame hermione asked karen they made a huge amount of money for each other said rozzy tartly ditto cecilia rannaldini howd you know so much about him we often worked together with the swiftness of the working stepmother forced to do things in a hurry while she had been talking rozzy had made a pot of tea put milk in a jug laid out cups and saucers skinned and chopped the tomatoes and topped them with basil salt and pepper now she slapped them between slices of buttered brown bread voilà she put the plate of sandwiches in front of karen please tuck in too detective sergeant gablecross patted his gut cant get into any of my suits could you describe your movements on sunday it seemed her husbands birthday party hadnt been much fun i came out of the kitchen and found glyn kissing sylvia our nannystrokehousekeeper rozzys lip trembled strokes the operative word shes very pretty and it was his birthday this sandwich is yummy did you have a lovely dress said karen longing to cheer the poor lady up rainbowstriped silk said rozzy i made it myself what time did the party end asked gablecross helping himself to a slice of chocolate cake after midnight but im afraid i sloped off to bed about eight itd been going since lunchtime i had a terrible migraine about quarter to eleven i suddenly remembered i hadnt rung lucy weve become such friends on carlos i was so distracted by the din still going on at our end that i forgot what id rung up for so i called her back five minutes later to remind her to get hermiones cloak out of wardrobe the wretched things gone missing i wonder if mikhails whipped it can i have your telephone number at home asked gablecross actually i rang on my mobile i found sylvias things by glyns and my bed rozzy blushed scarlet a horrid porn mag and a jar of baby oil so i took refuge in the spare room which doesnt have a telephone she gazed down at her roughened hands what a bastard karen attacked the chocolate cake id have given him a smack in the face for his birthday rozzy smiled flora got her mother georgie maguire to sign her latest album and some photographs glyn is such a fan he was over the moon until sylvia gave him a single of swonderful he played it all night what a plonker said karen furiously gablecross shot her a reproving look he found rozzy a little too helpful he knew the type professional martyr brave little wife who hadnt the guts to walk out and who couldnt bear to relinquish public sympathy lacking love at home they embraced the whole world husband probably was a shit rozzy clutched herself when she wasnt bustling about and blinked a lot but gablecross had stopped relying on body language after hed seen himself on tv making a statement at some press conference blinking and twitching enough to be the yorkshire ripper when did you last see rannaldini he asked on saturday morning hed caught me watering his plants very early i couldnt bear the way he let them die in the drought he pulled me into his study and shouted at me it didnt last long he seems to have rowed with everyone recently gablecross said starting on the tomato sandwiches didnt he and tristan de montigny fight over tabitha campbellblack i dont know what you mean gablecross had noticed that womens voices grew shrill and mens thickened whenever tabithas name was mentioned we gather she was the only woman tristan showed any interest in gablecross knew it was cruel but he wanted to test rozzy rozzy went on pouring tea into his cup until it spilled over tabitha had nearly burnt to death she said sharply she was badly frightened he was a grownup comforting a child whose fault was it that the newspaper caught fire wolfies he hadnt checked properly and one can still contained petrol could he have tried to kill tabitha of course not but tab and tristan are quite unsuited he reads bach cello suites for pleasure in the evening tabs thick insensitive and arrogant just like her father tristans interest in her was over before it began rannaldini gave tristan a hard time went on rozzy clearly not wanting to discuss tab any more but he did love his godson tristan and i get on really well too hes doing rosenkavalier at glyndebourne and hes asked me to sing octavian who could have killed rannaldini i have no idea perhaps it was some mafia plot when did you come back to valhalla early this she glanced at her watch heavens its after midnight early yesterday morning how fars mallowfield about fifty miles away seeing his detective constable was falling asleep gablecross ate the last sandwich and called it a day what a lovely lady sighed karen bit too good to be true wed better talk to glyn and check out her alibi but it looks as though shes in the clear i wonder how dc miller got on with rupert campbellblack there are some advantages to this job if you get to meet rupert campbellblack said dc miller in excitement hes supposed to be the handsomest man in england only because hes loaded and owns a bloody great mansion snapped ds fanshawe slamming his foot on the accelerator as he turned into ruperts drive in the hope of smearing the rosepink lipstick dc miller was applying to her delectable mouth the beeches forming a halo round ruperts lovely pale gold queen anne house were already turning in the park below beautiful horses with whisking tails had taken refuge from the heat under great belllike trees the rim of brown rush above the waters edge showed how much the lake had dropped a dozen cars were parked outside an open front door but noone answered the bell hes not worried about burglars said debbie miller shuffling down a rose walk ankle deep in petals ducking to avoid spiky unpruned branches they reached ruperts yard which was immaculate but deserted except for a comely girl groom who was reading a handsome chestnut colt his daily mail horoscope its peppy koala said debbie in awe oh can i stroke him hes almost as goodlooking as you are fanshawe who considered he had a way with the ladies smiled at the girl groom where is everyone he asked waving his id card down at the graveyard id wait until they come back but fanshawe was in a hurry and paused only to take the serial number of the dark blue helicopter parked in a field behind the stables beyond a tennis court surrounded by a shaggy beech hedge under the shade of a huge cedar half an acre of grass was fenced off before the land rolled into fields for generations the campbellblacks had buried their bestloved animals here grouped round a single grave were about a hundred people estateworkers grooms gardeners ruperts ancient housekeeper mrs bodkin and her husband most of whom were in tears thats lord ohara and his wife maud in the big black hat hissed debbie who scoured the tabloids every day theyre ruperts inlaws and theres taggies elder brother patrick isnt he to die for and his partner cameron cook she makes films and theres taggies sister caitlin she married lord baddinghams son archie and billy lloydfoxe who showjumped for england and his wife janey beattie johnsons great rival beatties already been digging up the dirt down at valhalla next to her that gorgeous boy whos crying is lysander hawkley now this is interesting hes married to rannaldinis third wife kitty shes the roundfaced one comforting him and oh look theres ricky francelynch isnt he gorgeous and his wife daisy the pretty dark one she paints they must have driven over from eldercombe you ought to work for hello said fanshawe sourly what the hells going on edging forward they caught sight of tabitha who looked as though shed been struck by lightning a big purple bruise on her left temple and cuts down her right cheek added the only colour to her deathly pale face she seemed about to collapse and was being supported by ruperts head groom dizzy next to them with a face of granite stood rupert holding xavier and bianca by the hand in her other hand bianca clutched a jamjar full of harebells scabious and meadowsweet while xavier held on to a carrierbag and a labrador as sleek and black as his face a dozen other dogs milled round snapping at flies and panting but unusually quiet and on the other side of the fence in silent sympathy stood ruperts great horse penscombe pride tiny the shetland and several red and white cows taggie campbellblack paler even than tabitha biting her lip to stop herself crying held gertrude wrapped in an old orange and blue blanket in her arms dropping a last kiss on her white forehead she laid the little dog on her beanbag already in the grave on a wonky wooden cross taggie had written the words gurtrude are most preshous treshure is berried hear noone had corrected her spelling stepping forward xav dropped a packet of kitkats and a box of bonios into the grave beside gertrude then took his mothers hand suddenly bianca ran forward and knelt by the grave if youre just pretending gertrude she called out in a shrill voice nows the time to wake up for a second laughter rippled round then declan ohara stepped forward known to cry on every possible occasion today he was dryeyed we all loved gertrude his deep tender irish brogue echoed round the fields she lived with us in london and the priory opposite for eight years and then with rupert and taggie for ten but even this year she would struggle across the valley every morning for a bonio and a bowl of milk what we will remember is gertrudes kindness and her merriness but none of us would have imagined that such a frail body contained a heart as stout as beth gelert as tab gave a sob covering her face with her hand debbie noticed the dark bruises along the side and up the little fingers she must have fought someone off like a wild cat for a second she swayed as rupert caught her she buried her face in his shoulder nothing in gertrudes life became her like the leaving it intoned declan she died as one oh for christs sake declan get on snapped rupert we will never forget you declans voice broke and on your grave with shining eyes may the cotswold stars look down there were flowers everywhere xavier picked up a trowel to help his father as with gritted jaw rupert heaped powdery earth over gertrudes body the moment hed finished muttering about organizing drinks frantic not to break down he belted back to the house pity with such a turnout it wasnt videod declans wife maud was saying fretfully slumped in despair taggie stood alone by the grave but as she turned for home debbie and fanshawe pounced it was a while before she took in what they were saying tabs had a terrible shock over gertrude she muttered i dont think she can talk to you she was at valhalla yesterday said fanshawe flashing his teeth we need to ask her her whereabouts uniformed police will be along to fingerprint her later he added smoothly youd better come in said taggie tabitha was in an even worse state shivering on the drawingroom sofa gazing into space debbie noticed her ankles crisscrossed with red weals ill ask the questions hissed fanshawe great turnout for a little dog he began tab looked at him uncomprehendingly wonder if you could tell us what you did yesterday from eight oclock onwards i worked my horse said tab in a high jerky voice what the fuck are you doing snarled rupert as he barged into the room investigating the murder of sir roberto rannaldini determined not to let nobs order him around fanshawe stood his ground were checking mrs lovells movements in case she saw anything unusual she didnt said rupert coldly she came home because gertrude died can we ask her a few questions no you fucking cant he turned to tab you ok darling from next door could be heard voices and the popping of champagne corks could we ask you a few questions then asked debbie smoothing her blonde bob rupert really was gorgeous if you want to but youd better be quick ill do this one hissed debbie as they followed rupert into his office debbie was very much into the nonconfrontational nonjudgemental police interview she was unfazed by the fact that rupert was reading faxes watching the first race runners in the paddock on channel four and filling in entry forms at least it meant he was relaxed id like you to shut your eyes make your mind go blank mr campbellblack and remember exactly what tabitha said when she called you last night ill shut my eyes if you both will said rupert a shade more amiably ok said debbie what time did she ring after a long pause fanshawe opened his eyes to see rupert vanishing through a side door mr campbellblack he shouted you are impeding a police inquiry and we are in the middle of a funeral only of a dog sir the fury on ruperts face made them both retreat we are investigating the murder of mrs lovells stepfather protested fanshawe who was only a human said rupert contemptuously and a particularly loathsome one at that now get out arrogant shit fumed fanshawe as he belted down the drive how dare he talk to us like that all those upperclass fuckers stick together same when lord lucan copped it they close ranks and keep their traps shut and just think how gablecross will sneer when he hears weve been thrown out sighed debbie ds gablecross was a deep thinker he rose early like the sun moved slowly round examining everything from a different angle before setting in the west sleeping on things before he came to a decision reassured by his lazy smile and deep west country drawl few people realized the bitterness and frustration simmering beneath the surface in the middle eighties the world had seemed at his feet a loving wife had looked after him his three children heroworshipped him working on hunches playing suspects against each other he and his running mate charlie had been the most dazzlingly successful villaincatchers in the west country charlie had not been above knocking suspects about like a foxhound he was the kindest animal in the world until he got on to the scent of a quarry but then gablecrosss life had changed his wife margaret had returned to teaching the implication being that as he was more interested in catching villains than angling for promotion they could no longer support three children on a sergeants salary she had swiftly risen to deputy headmistress of the local comprehensive she was so conscientious that gablecross often returned after midnight to find her asleep over reports or exam papers he had preferred the old days being greeted by charred steak and kidney and margaret feigning sleep through gritted teeth upstairs his children had also become teenagers questioning his every attitude and regarding policemen at best as fascist pigs who persecuted blacks gays women and teenagers worst of all last christmas charlie had been shot in a drugs raid his killer had been the brother of a young black guy who had committed suicide after charlie had forced a confession out of him and banged him up for five years but if gablecrosss world had been turned upside down so had the law as a result of the act hunches suddenly had to be justified and everything backed up with forensic or taperecorded evidence supposed to make it easier to prove guilt this gradually took the personality out of investigation and only the safety players prevailed as a result gablecrosss battlescarred contemporaries had taken early retirement or dull jobs in security but being a hunter was the only thing gablecross knew surrounded by the freshfaced young turks of the inquiry team he felt old edgy almost a figure of fun particularly as if to rub salt in the wound of charlies death the dandified egomaniac gerald portland had teamed him up with the only black on the inquiry team karen needham karen who had watched every instalment of prime suspect intended to be the first woman head of scotland yard a dusky cleopatra with long shiny hair drawn back in a dark blue bow she had an undulating body and legs so long they made all skirts look like minis whenever she swayed through the incident room the telephones and wordprocessors fell silent karen like debbie miller was messianically into the peace interview you made witnesses and suspects feel you were fascinated in them and what they had done you utterly understood their trespasses whether they had abused a tiny child or bashed up an old lady faced with her sweet smile and big kind eyes everyone sang to the rooftops all the young turks told gablecross he was a lucky sod to be paired with someone so pretty and clever but gablecross who liked women felt he was being sexist if he told karen she looked beautiful and racist if he complained about her slow driving and the even slower way she took down evidence in her clear round hand otherwise she had only one drawback she couldnt contain her laughter even during interviews over the absurdities of life chief inspector portland was crazy about her in his most paranoid moments gablecross imagined their pillowtalk who would you like to work with karen id like to zap that arrogant geriatric racist homophobic pinkobasher tim gablecross gablecross found portland hell to deal with one of a breed known as butterflies the handsome chief inspector had moved from station to station upping his status and his salary ironing out his accent he had a rich wife children at private day schools their photographs prominently displayed on his desk and an old house outside rutminster much modernized and crammed with inglenooks portland had been so busy going on courses he had never had time to be a policeman although he was a good manager and out of laziness able to delegate he didnt want anyone stealing his limelight he would have preferred a team composed entirely of keen deferential youngsters but to crack this murder and cover himself with glory he needed gablecrosss local knowledge and his genius at nosing out a killer despite a shower gablecross felt crumpled and sweaty when he rolled up for the first earlymorning briefing on tuesday portland on the other hand his chestnut hair matching his smooth brown face looked as sleek and shining as a new conker having hung his coat with the cardin label on the back of his chair loosened his tie and rolled up his very white shirtsleeves to show off suntanned arms he smiled briskly at gablecross lady chisledon phoned to complain you didnt have enough identification tim when you popped in yesterday said the photo on your id card makes you look more villainous than any of your suspects suggest you get a more flattering one and stop frightening the witnesses sitting and standing around portlands office laughing deferentially were the inner cabinet they consisted of two boffins from the incident room where a home office computer was gathering all data on the murder two reps from the uniformed housetohouse task force and twelve plainclothes officers in teams of two these included gablecross and karen gablecrosss bitter rival the fit flatstomached kevin fanshawe and debbie miller whod fallen foul of rupert yesterday the blushing dc lightfoot whod been traumatized by the valhalla orgy and the aggressive dc smithson who was above all present and politically correct sir from now on the cabinet would meet every morning to absorb what had happened the day before gerry portlands job was to read autopsy reports printouts and statements corroborate all the evidence and give each team lines to follow and then go and sleep on the sunbed thought gablecross on the wall beside group photographs of portlands various courses was a map of paradise and valhalla with rannaldinis watchtower the tennis court and hangmans wood ringed in red a day chart listing the pairs of the inquiry team and the leads they were following was flanked by a blowup of hypealong cassidys photograph of the entire unit the meeting began with a debriefing some officers had been unravelling the tangled skeins of rannaldinis last hours when he seemed to have upset everyone some talking to the family others touring the houses of paradise problem with this lot guvnor said fanshawe is theyre used to dodging awkward questions and evading the press theyre lying but theyre all shit scared they cant believe the reign of terrors over wont be when rupert campbellblack moves in snapped portland he was livid that fanshawe and miller had been chucked out there was no way rupert was going to walk all over his team you sort him out tim he added as a sop to the crack about the id photograph nail him when he rolls up to kick ass on the set this evening dont let karens legs distract him as he smiled at her the politically correct dc smithson looked bootfaced only by persistent lobbying had she got the girlie calenders taken down from the male officers walls on their return from penscombe fanshawe and miller had interviewed mr brimscombe deadheading the rose walk he had seen tabitha racing towards rannaldinis watchtower in a pretty grey dress wafting perfume and all dolled up for the first time in months emptyhanded she had waved and run on several people according to the housetohouse team had seen after ten fifteen the ghost of caroline beddoes clutching a little dog with her ripped grey dress soaked in blood after one sighting the captain of the paradise cricket club had rushed into the pearly gates begging for a quadruple whisky wolfgang rannaldini had claimed tabitha went home because her stepmums dog went missing said gablecross dead now said debbie miller kevin and i stumbled on this weird funeral yesterday tabitha looked like a battered ghost leave her a couple of days till we get the postmortem but her alibi looks very thin have a look at her cottage portland told fanshawe talk to the servants at penscombe and valhalla have a word with tabs husband we know wolfgang switched on the machine at valhalla around ten fortyfive he went on and claims she asked him to take her own dog back to penscombe chloe catford claims wolfie swore he was going to kill his dad after hearing that tape said gablecross unfortunately its gone missing wolfie probably whipped it the memoirs and rannaldinis safe had also gone walkabout miss bussage was the chief suspect in the case of the former but she certainly hadnt smuggled the safe into the limo when she left go and see her tim grinned gerald portland youre good with maiden ladies ask her if she knows why rannaldini went to the doctor on friday and if sheknows the whereabouts of a picasso and the étienne de montigny hanging in rannaldinis watchtower both may have been torched in the fire but if stolen could be a motive for murder other tasks included checking who had helicopters in the area other than rupert campbellblack and george hungerford and which one had landed beside hangmans wood on sunday night out of the window through the trees gablecross could see the herbert parker hall home of the rutshire symphony orchestra he wondered what their boss george hungerford had thought of floras and babys photographs hungerford was seen driving towards valhalla like a bat out of hell around ten twentyfive on sunday night said one of the housetohouse team and montigny went the other way only earlier tristan was seen at valhalla by jessica god shes gorgeous sighed dc lightfoot and by that russian mikhail pezcherov but he was too smashed to be trusted pezcherov claims he spent five minutes on sunday night in the maze with chloe catford she says it was three hours volunteered gablecross time flies when youre enjoying yourself giggled debbie miller checks would have to be carried out on whether chloes mother alpheuss agent and rozzy pringle had made phone calls when they were said to have done lady griselda bernard guérin granville hastings none of them fans of rannaldini had all been crashing around looking for balls near the watchtower at the time of the murder flora seymour and meredith whalen have very thin alibis but sexton kemp looks in the clear said gablecross i spent most of last night trying to pin down baby spinosissysomething said fanshawe crossly dame hermione was also too upset to speak to anyone but im certain theyre talking to the press if not to us hermione was heard singing in the wood around ten thirty said gablecross could have been another singer piped up karen needham flora seymour or chloe catford shes a cracker fanshawe raised his eyes to heaven or gloria prescott said dc lightfoot another cracker which ones she portland peered at the blowup that one shes blinking but her boobs arent said dc lightfoot excitedly and got punched in the ribs by dc smithson go and see dame hermione tim said portland youre good with middleaged nymphos too but remember her alarms wired by umbilical cord to the chief constables navel so watch it gablecross ground his teeth the rest of the team laughed the french crew had evidently been hopeless to interview their english which had improved so dramatically during filming had deteriorated equally dramatically when confronted by dc smithsons truculence i was weeth heem and he was weeth me and other heems and heem was with heem snapped dc smithson theyre more obstructive than that appalling campbellblack but not quite as gorgeous sighed debbie we have a host of suspects portland rubbed his hands together priority is to find the memoirs and rannaldinis safe clive may have got them said gablecross he was whispering to that ugly cow from the sentinel yesterday well nobble him today while portland gave the others lines to follow gablecrosss mind drifted back to something old miss cricklade who took in washing had told him when hed given her a lift into rutminster that morning what with dame hermione miss bussage in abingdon clive if he could catch him rupert campbellblack on the set this evening it was going to be a long day he was brought back to earth by dc smithson whining that everyone at valhalla was a publicityobsessed nutter well as one not unacquainted with the media portland examined his fingernails you have to know how to use them i suggest we ask the help of lady rannaldini to appeal to the nation for info she was in bad shape yesterday said gablecross quickly but portland wasnt listening he loved press conferences and publicity he couldnt wait to wrap up the meeting so he could gloat over the smashing photographs of himself in the mornings papers doubt if youd learn much gablecross was saying certain its an inside job im the best judge of that said portland coolly lady rs a lovely lady shes chairman of enids nspcc committee she could start by paying more attention to her own child snapped gablecross few people had seen inside hermiones pretty georgian mill which stood hidden by trees two hundred yards from the river fleet because she was far too lazy and tight with money to entertain gablecross was surprised therefore to find the dark green front door open and his wifes favourite singer standing radiant and smiling in the hall only when hed waved his id card at her did he realize that he was about to shake the outstretched hand of a replica of hermiones waxwork in madame tussauds pack it in he hissed as karen burst out laughing show some fucking respect dame hermione veiled and clad entirely in black lay on a dark red chaiselongue with sexton and howie dancing attendance hermione had not forgiven howie for being in the know about pushys top notes and espousing her cause as delilah and was determined he shouldnt get any cut out of her newspaper deals offers of which were pouring in from all over the world and being handled by sexton howie who loathed the country was equally determined to hang in spurred on by gerry portlands mockery and having often been impeded in car chases by dame hermiones limo parked slap across paradise high street gablecross was determined to stand no nonsense this excited the hell out of hermione who loved her men masterful whipping back her veil she patted the sofa beside her i know were going to be friends lets call each other by our given names mines hermione and yours is officer said karen tartly shut up snarled gablecross its timothy does she have to be in here hermione glared at karen yes said gablecross regretfully ive just been talking to my very good friend chief constable swallow announced hermione which translated thought karen means mess with me and youre a dead duck looking round the room she decided you could fall asleep counting the photographs paintings and sculptures of hermione magazines with her face on the cover lay on a nearby table among the trophies on the shelf was the artist of the year award shed won in october i urged the chief constable to call a press conference hermione was now telling gablecross so i can beseech people to come forward and shed light on this dreadful crime my son little cosmo has lost a father i a cherished friend lady rannaldini might want to do it said sexton as he whisked out of the room to get to the telephone before howie lady rannaldini has no experience of the media said hermione dismissively nor is she as universally beloved as you dame hermione lied howie indeed hermione bowed then turned to gablecross i have had a thousand and twentythree letters already timothy and lost ten pounds in weight sexton thank goodness was as adept at twiddling the knobs on her weighing scales as rannaldini had been on her recordings i feel i owe it to my public and to rannaldini to appeal to the nation on television went on hermione i wouldnt hermsie sexton trotted back into the room and squeezed her hand they always turn out to be the one wots done it sexton sexton hermione gave a low laugh how wise you are its the guardian on the phone whispered sexton ill tell them youre out howie leapt to his little feet out thundered hermione as if shed sallied forth on some junket i shall never go out again i must speak with them for rannaldinis sake she seized the telephone mr rusbridger alan no my producer has brought me fresh fruit and belgian chocolates to keep up my strength for the sake of my public do you know what helen is wearing for the funeral she asked sexton as she came off the telephone five minutes later could you ask lady griselda to pop in this afternoon i shall wear black of course and a veil thin enough to show the tragedy etched on your lovely features howie was laying it on with a jcb karen got the giggles again and had to take her notebook over to the window and gaze at the driedup river as gablecross tried to pin down hermione on her movements on sunday night people had seen her returning around eight in rannaldinis helicopter i had been concertizing at an openair gala in milan because the proceeds were going towards a new hospital added hermione virtuously i only charged my charity fee of sixty thousand pounds thats more than i earn in four years thought karen in disgust around the time rannaldini died gablecross pressed on at about ten thirty several witnesses heard you singing a number from don carlos in the wood they said a voice had never sounded more exquisite then it must have been mine twinkled hermione did you walk through the wood on sunday night timothy timothy if i sang pianissimo from the garden at river house my voice would float across to valhalla but i didnt go out it must have been a tape or a cd rannaldini had plenty he was clearly comparing them with the rushes people have said your voice was unaccompanied i often sang for him alone so you didnt leave home at all certainly not i rushed back from milan to spend quality time with my son cosmo i spent the rest of the evening recharging my spiritual batteries i needed to be fresh for monday in case rannaldini wanted to reshoot act five or if hed carried on with the schedule i had an important ballroom scene in act two scene two i wont pass for nineteen if i dont get my eight hours she added skittishly what else did you do i was tucked up in bed with camomile tea like the flopsy bunnies hermione put on a soppy face by nine oclock to watch pride and prejudice its my favourite novel whos your favourite character in it asked karen innocently emma woodhouse replied hermione without missing a beat shes beautiful and headstrong fans have often compared us for a second karens eyes met sextons she wondered if she recognized pleading and my husband bobby rang me from australia for a chat around ten fortyfive said hermione airily does your husband mind little cosmo being rannaldinis son asked gablecross not in the least we have a very close and open marriage timothy bobby is devoted to little cosmo gablecross couldnt dent her rannaldinis playing the evil tape on friday night his flirtations with pushy serena cheryl lara even tabitha his threats to replace her with a younger singer had been all part of a game to goad her into singing more beautifully what he loved about me timothy was my ability to rise to the challenge ours was a special relationship are you married my wifes your greatest fan blushed gablecross surreptitiously scraping a sticker saying american bravo library copy do not remove from its case hermione brandished a cd called only for lovers whats your wifes given name ive had two thousand five hundred and twentytwo letters and lost over a stone you know i simply cant eat ive roasted a little chicken for lunch said sexton bustling in in a striped apron well perhaps i could manage a slice admitted hermione as she wrote her name on the cd sleeve shoulders shaking frantically karen was gazing intently at the river again were off karen said gablecross icily leave the poor child cried hermione she is only weeping like the whole world for maestros death then catching sight of rannaldinis photograph on the cd case handsome and smiling with his hands on her bare shoulders hermione broke into genuine tears of despair you will bring his killer to justice wont you timothy on the way out sexton made a brief statement i ought to fill you in on my movements on sunday night tim frankly it was sunday bloody sunday i ad a hellish day trying to drum up money rannaldini had fucked us with his delaying tactics refusing to release any dosh until tristan gave in to his demands i left london after midnight shattered but i wanted to be there on monday morning in case fings turned nasty after rannaldini playing that evil tape on friday night anyway wally and i was about to come off the motorway wiv only the hard shoulder to cry on when bernard rang and said rannaldinid copped it what time was that sir one fifteen i called rupert campbellblack luckily hed just got back and agreed to come in and save the movie just like that asked karen hes that sort of bloke then we belted down to valhalla as bernard and i agreed there was pride in sextons voice now i should be the one to break the sad news to dame hermione look after her gablecross was amazed to hear himself saying the fat cows lying through her teeth fumed karen as they walked back to the car imagine thinking emma woodhouse was the heroine of pride and prejudice the only thing the silly bitch reads is rave reviews and the directions on the prozac bottle and sexton had a lot to lose if the film went bellyup mused gablecross and rupert campbellblack had only just come in at one fifteen said karen what was he doing in the meanwhile she wished gablecross would loosen up as a cop you often had to laugh to stop yourself crying she wasnt looking forward to him wincing over her driving all the way to abingdon to see miss bussage rupert arrived at his first nights filming in a murderous mood if he hadnt spurned tab and let her fall among thieves she would never have married so disastrously and rannaldini would never have been reduced to kidnapping gertrude he felt directly responsible both for the rape and gertrudes death and his brain filled with blood whenever he thought of it he had agreed to save don carlos because he wanted to make a notsoquick buck and amends to tab but talking to her the following day he learnt of tristans treachery and only hung in because of her pleading but the fucker blew you out i know sobbed tab but i still love him and maybe with rannaldini out of the way she was so near the edge raging one moment sobbing wildly the next or just gazing into space he didnt want to push her into the abyss over at valhalla excitement at his impending arrival had reached fever pitch chloe already buoyed up by fifty thousand from the daily mail calls from la scala and the opéra bastille and the press yelling chloe chloe chloe whenever she passed was now squirming lasciviously in front of the mirror in make up i want an ace face for rupert lucy lockett that would be an everest for you said baby irritably as he pored over accounts of the murder in all the papers the prospect of having tab as a stepdaughter would deter even me sighed chloe but one could always dally ruperts mad about his wife said lucy crossly as she clipped chloes fringe to one side thats a nice picture of moi chloe glanced sideways what papers that the scorpion they list you as a prime suspect alongside most of the cast plus helen wolfie and tristan ouch careful squeaked chloe as lucy knocked over a bottle of base narrowly missing three thousand pounds worth of crimson taffeta dont mention that name in our makeup artists presence one flareup was averted by lucys mobile ringing which triggered off another no i cannot do your roots meredith shouted lucy i dont care if rupert is due later the cast has priority from an upstairs window helen watched the press go berserk at the bottom of the drive as her exhusbands dark blue helicopter landed it was absolutely typical not only had rupert won tab back he was now swanning in like a prince stalking towards the maze with fat sexton running to keep up passing jessica and simone who swung round in wonder when would rupert bloody well lose his looks you wouldnt have a moment to pop in and see dime hermione panted sexton not unless you provide guards and a chastitybelt replied rupert here comes beautywithcruelty sighed meredith adjusting the baseball cap now hiding his roots the setting sun had lent a warmth to ruperts sleek blond hair and added a touch of colour to his unusually pale face but his mouth was set in an ugly line and the glare he gave tristan could have halted global warming for several decades its very good of you to help us out nervously tristan extended a hand which rupert ignored this was the bastard whod broken tabs heart having nodded curtly at wolfie and lucy who he knew slightly as a friend of tabs and kissed griselda who he remembered from deb dances in the early seventies he said ok lets get on with it rupert had never taken on anything he couldnt do brilliant at showjumping he had been a highly successful if unorthodox mp and minister for sport a hotshot financial director of venturer television and now because hed learnt patience at last and refused to push horses that needed more time he was one of the leading ownertrainers in the world but the snails pace of filming defeated him how could you spend a hundred and fifty thousand a day on something quite so ridiculous the caterwauling from the speakers gave him a headache the only time that number of people had stood around at penscombe in the last twenty years had been at gertrudes funeral what the hells going on he asked tristan carlos receive letter summoning him to a rendezvous he think it is from his stepmother who he adores but it is from his fathers mistress who adores him so if you imagine your mistress i dont have a mistress said rupert icily dommage chorused chloe and simone the crew grinned well imagine your son being madly in love with your wife impossible said rupert even more icily marcus is a homosexual well tristan struggled on carlos is so carried away with excitement he declares passionate love to wrong woman is he pissed then how could he possibly mistake clare chloe interrupted chloe in outrage sorry chloe for hermione hermiones three times her size chloe blew rupert a kiss why didnt you choose singers the same size persisted rupert they were chosen for their voices tristan was just managing to keep his temper in the dark it is easy to mistake people it isnt dark rupert glared round at oscars lights we could be in blackpool at the height of the season later theyd moved on to the trio tomorrow the earth will open up to swallow you sang chloe scowling at baby may the earth open up to swallow you sang mikhail scowling at chloe if only the earth would open up to swallow me sang baby cut shouted rupert the music ground discordantly to a halt tristan is directing this film monsieur campbellblack bellowed an apoplectic bernard why do these singers keep repeating themselves demanded rupert sarcastically i thought we were trying to make this film shorter this film shorter this film shorter the crew corpsed again the chief constable of rutminsters called swallow said meredith chattily shut up meredith howled tristan and bernard and why isnt that camera motorized rupert pointed at a buckling ogborne pushing valentin along the tracks we gave up ploughing with horses forty years ago at penscombe whys that man with a beard sticking a knife into that pretty girl demanded rupert ten minutes later hes a freedom fighter hissed griselda typical leftie behaviour said rupert scornfully why havent you given him sandals and an adams apple after mikhail had offered rupert a slug of vodka he decided he was quite nice for a leftie there was a sticky moment during the break when a hopelessly goaded tristan made the mistake of assuming rupert spoke as little french as his daughter how can that imbecile sexton have brought in such an ignorant pigheaded obstructionist ape he stormed to valentin because youd have folded if he hadnt said rupert coldly like children who behave worse when their mother wants them on their best behaviour tristans cast started acting up i have stained the name of my mother sang baby piously in the middle of a perfect take vot colour ave you stained her sang back mikhail i have stained her prussian bluehoohoo cut howled tristan cut cut cut you fuckers then stopped in midblast as a mobile rang telephones are not allowed on the set roared bernard its mine mumbled tristan disappearing into the dark labyrinths of the maze the trees on the horizon were still black silhouettes but colour was creeping into the foreground pigeons were cooing sleepily thrushes repeating phrases like singers when at four thirty tristan called a wrap despite ruperts constant interference a miraculous minute or two was in the can mikhails flickknife had gone safely back to the props van everyone was glad to gather round marias barbecue on which tandoori chicken sausages and tomatoes stuffed with herbs sizzled enticingly as an extra treat after a long night maria had made a huge bread and butter pudding bottles of red and white were on the tables rupert was very hungry and could have done with a drink but he was loath to fraternize back at penscombe his stable lads would be out on the gallops in an hour he hated to miss anything gablecross whod been waiting patiently all night edged towards him can i have a word mr campbellblack no you cant said rupert curtly im off despite ruperts antagonism tristan having heard hideous rumours about rannaldini and tab had returned to his caravan and was taking a huge bunch of freesias from a bucket wrapping them in the only pages of yesterdays le figaro not devoted to the murder he caught up with his new executive producer as rupert was leaving the canteen would you please take these to tabitha and give her er my love suddenly in front of the entire unit ruperts rage boiled over not after the way you fucked her up dumping her the moment you pulled her tristan was greyer than the predawn sky but he held his ground it is not as you think dont tell me what i think you fucking frog i may have made it possible for you to finish your poxy film because tab put so much work into the horses but believe me sunshine it has nothing to do with you back off and leave her alone lucy couldnt bear to look at tristan she had never hated anyone as much as rupert particularly when he snatched tristans flowers to chuck them on the barbecue but suddenly rozzy erupted from nowhere shut up you fucking bully she screamed grabbing the flowers from him oscar choked on his half pint of red bernard on his bread and butter pudding everyone who had turned away in embarrassment turned back in amazement rozzy swearing you shouldnt judge without knowing the facts she shouted if tristan hadnt risked his life dragging tab from the fire she wouldnt be alive today naturally tab was terrified and tristan comforted her you ought to go down on your knees with gratitude youve still got a daughter you loathsome brute rupert looked at rozzy incredulously my god the mouse has roared and how dyou know he seduced tab said rozzy furiously youve only got her word for it just as youve only got her word that rannaldini shut up you bitch wolfie was shaking rozzy like a rat take that back instantly bernard moved in to separate them and rozzy collapsed sobbing in his arms much more exciting than verdi said meredith selecting another spicy sausage why dont you film this instead tristan a piercing shriek from the direction of wardrobe stopped everyone in their tracks wearily putting clothes back on their hangers griselda discovered hermiones new willowgreen roselined cloak had been delivered from paris during the night assuming someone had signed for it griselda had picked up the receipt on the dotted line in unmistakable emeraldgreen ink was scrawled the word rannaldini i know hes alive gibbered griselda as with purple turban askew she lumbered elephantine and quaking into the canteen pissed again muttered ogborne but as everyone crowded round the signature on the receipt which gablecross promptly pocketed was agreed to be perfect perhaps bussage is getting her revenge for being fired said wolfie whod gone as green as his fathers signature she faked papas name on enough fan photos and documents but when bernard rang the messenger who was speeding towards dover he insisted that a gentleman smelling very strongly of scent and wearing a long black cloak with a turnedup collar had signed for the parcel it had been very dark he had assumed it was one of the cast it must have been the cloak rannaldini wore to sweep on to the rostrum on friday night whispered a terrified griselda theres obviously a perfectly simple explanation said rupert escaping to his helicopter and the safety of penscombe all the birds were singing the grumbling of the crows in the beeches providing the fauxbourdon as simone baby and lucy trailed wearily back to their beds i dont know which is worse shivered lucy a murderer mad enough to dress up as rannaldini or the return of rannaldini himself im sure i saw him yesterday at that blockedup window simones pointing finger trembled well he made a copy of everything else drawled baby why not of himself thank god the sun was rising shining cheerfully into their faces lucy fell into bed but not to sleep how wonderful rozzy had been oh why hadnt she been brave enough to stick up for tristan having drawn a blank with rupert gablecross was driving wearily out of valhalla in the hope of a couple of hours sleep when he noticed lights on in clives flat over the stables remembering his conversation yesterday with miss cricklade he pulled in miss cricklade the local busybody lived on the west side of paradise high street between training her binoculars on valhalla and watching pride and prejudice on sunday night she had seen clive rannaldinis dreaded éminence grise calling on nicky willard next door around eight oclock he had only stayed ten minutes but during this time a little white mongrel had been yapping continually in his car if she went on like that miss cricklade had told gablecross indignantly she would have lost her bark like my judy did when she went into kennels i was about to complain when clive came out and drove off but he was back to see nicky around nine thirty miss cricklade had gone on nickys mum and dad had gone to bath for the evening i gave a scream when i saw valhalla going up in flames next moment clive came out of willards house like a bat out of hell i dont think george and grace willard would have liked him being there i dont trust that clive nor did gablecross he had waived sentences against him in the past in return for information now it was time to call in the marker particularly as bussage had implied that clive knew where rannaldinis safe containing a second set of memoirs was hidden he had to lean on the bell for five minutes before he was let in by clive clearly furious at the interruption there was not a speck of dust in the upstairs flat which was furnished with chrome and black leather sadomasochistic literature and videos filled the bookshelves posters of muscular youths on motorbikes with tufts of blond hair emerging under bikers caps adorned the walls on the mantelpiece was a photograph of a young clive and a middleaged woman with pigeons on their shoulders in trafalgar square even though it was five oclock in the morning clive was fully dressed in leather trousers and a very white vest showing off tattoos of bleeding hearts and black widow spiders gablecross realized he must keep his wits about him if this especially slippery fish wasnt to slide through his fingers and baldly kicked off with the fact that several independent witnesses had reported clive spending several hours at nicky willards house on sunday night nicky willard was only sixteen going on fortyfive unless clive wanted to be banged up for five years he had better sing to the rooftops clive promptly played then handed over the tape hed stolen from the answeringmachine at valhalla on sunday night no wonder wolfie had wanted to kill his father thought gablecross no wonder rupert had wanted to kill everyone where does the little dog come in he asked sternly clive displayed uncharacteristic shame he admitted stealing gertrude but hadnt realized rannaldini would use her as bait rupert will kill me if he finds out i want a safe house he whined hell certainly rearrange your features where are rannaldinis keys there was no sign of them in the ashes the murderer must have whipped them which means hes got the master key to every bedroom good god more than that every room including the dressing rooms the caravans and the cottages was bugged for sound there were hidden cameras everywhere so he could watch people or video their goingson he had a stranglehold like the spanish inquisition suddenly gablecross didnt feel tired any more what exactly were your movements on sunday night he asked as clive made him a cup of black coffee i delivered taggies dog to the watchtower around eight fifteen brought tabloid back here walked him and rannaldinis other rotties and gave them their dinner then i went over to watch the box with nicky around nine thirty around eleven thirty we saw flames coming out of the watchtower so i drove back to see if i could rescue rannaldini or anything whats happened to the safe dunno rannaldini was always movin it around come on stealing that little dog consorting with a minor dyou want to be banged up for seven years clive didnt by that time nicky willard would be twentythree and have lost his bloom on the other hand he didnt reveal all his cards he had failed to flog the memoirs to beattie johnson on the night of the murder because shed obviously had an offer from bussage unable to get into the safe without rannaldinis keys clive had subsequently ransacked bussages files substituted the blank disks and fan photographs and flogged her set of the memoirs for two hundred thousand to beattie with a further eight hundred thousand promised on publication none of this did he tell gablecross but feeling flush he admitted quite by chance that rannaldinis safe was currently hidden in the priesthole behind the mantelpiece see its ollow clive banged a panel which swung open to reveal a large cupboard containing lots of cobwebs and a large steel box rannaldini kept it in his indoor school didnt entirely trust bussage i moved it ere after the murder its funny clive poured gablecross more coffee since its been ere i keep thinking the buggers alive with a shiver he glanced around the flat im sure i saw him outside the chapel last night what did you intend to do with the safe hand it in when i got a moment very commendable said gablecross sardonically particularly when the bell rang again and clive sulkily had to admit bobby clintock another of gablecrosss contacts and the best safecracker in rutshire armed with rugs and explosives at five thirtyfive a loud thud set the horses neighing and the rottweilers barking in their quarters below shit muttered clive peering through the smoke the montignys not there nor the picasso must have been torched in the fire thats five million up the spout otherwise they found a lot of foreign currency enough cocaine to make a snowdwarf a printout of three hundred pages of the memoirs and a pile of videos and photographs pushy galore straddling a sofa didnt do much for clive and neither did bussage roped to the table then he saw chloe jesus expect the goatll sell its story to farmers weekly poor old granville hastings gablecross picked up a photo of a devastatedlooking granny no wonder he didnt want the police called rannaldini must have locked this stuff away on the sunday afternoon before he died there was even a copy of his last will dated july leaving everything to cecilia and her children except for four million each to hermione and little cosmo and a hundred thousand to clive and miss bussage nothing to helen or wolfie no wonder wolfie had been going to kill his father flicking through a yellow memo pad gablecross found notes that rozzy pringle had throat cancer the poor lady and reminders to contact rozzys husband glyn and also tristans aunt hortense in the tarn in a bible he discovered a letter in french on writing paper headed with a crest of a snake and a drawing of two lovers and shoved it in his inside pocket to read later turning he found bobby clintock salivating over hermiones naked body and clive drooling over a book of medieval tortures with many of the pages turned down what was it with this guy asked gablecross in disgust he was bored with normal pleasure said clive flatly where was his famous torture chamber didnt exist clives pale eyes flickered did you take that rottie away from the watchtower earlier so you could kill him without it barking youll have to take my word on that thanks for your cooperation said gablecross as clive and bobby albeit with great reluctance helped him to carry the safe to his car gerry portland was outraged when gablecross emptied the contents of the safe on to his desk timoutonalimb again how dare you go off intimidating suspects and blowing safes nothing has been printed there were two of them and bobby clintocks much bigger than me you could have torched the evidence whats the defence going to say to this having bollocked him however portland was soon immersed in the material jesus jesus how the hell did rannaldini pull birds like that as a result the mornings briefing was lively excited and often ribald if you see steam coming out of my ears announced portland its because tims got hold of a copy of the memoirs we also have the missing tape from the answeringmachine at valhalla he pressed the play button oh wolfie help me rannaldinis just raped me and hes killed gertrude oh please get sharon from the cottage tabs clipped breathless voice faltered as tears took over despite the sun streaming through the window a shiver went through the room it was after hearing this tape went on portland that young wolfgang announced he was going to kill his father if hed gone to the watchtower and read the draft will hed have had the added incentive that hed been disinherited rupert also received a phone call from tabitha a few minutes later rupert looked capable of murder last night admitted gablecross fanshawe who was livid about gablecrosss latest coup and debbie miller had been to magpie cottage yesterday the only unusual thing on monday morning betty had told them was that tabs and isas double bed had been neatly made on the other hand the bathroom had been a shambles fanshawe had pocketed a pale coral lipstick lancômes brilliant beige clinique blusher base and powder and a hairbrush full of blonde hairs kicked under the bath perhaps so isa shouldnt see it had been the packaging from a newly opened bottle of scent called quercus perhaps she didnt want her husband to know she was on the pull said debbie gablecross reported on his and karens visit to miss bussage the lady was very bitter about her sacking and unashamedly confessed she had meant to steal a copy of the memoirs and photographs said she was protecting rannaldinis reputation i reckon she was going to flog them piped up karen certainly enjoyed being flogged said portland grinning down at the photo of bussage roped to the kitchen table disgusting chuntered dc smithson anyway went on gablecross she reckons everything including the draft will was switched in the files before she put it in her briefcase which she did immediately after wolfie sacked her on monday afternoon he allowed her only an hour to pack because shed slagged off tab and she had the key to the briefcase on her bussage suspects wolfie and lady rannaldini because they were both disinherited and of course clive but noone featured in those memoirs would be too happy to have them floating about the riveting thing she told us said karen in excitement was that rannaldini visited james benson on friday to discuss having his vasectomy reversed this made everyone sit up not the most pleasant or successful of operations observed portland rannaldini must have been thinking of having more children any idea who with hardly lady rannaldini said fanshawe who was desperate to regain the ascendancy that marriage was into injury time gloria prescott claims he proposed marriage to her he was clearly closer to harriet bussage than her unprepossessing appearance would suggest said gablecross and he was cuckoo about tabitha he was shooting blanks on sunday night mused fanshawe but one way to torture lady rannaldini wolfgang dame hermione and rupert campbellblack in one stroke would have been to have got tabitha pregnant as he talked sergeant fanshawe was edging backwards so he could look at the photographs over portlands shoulder his jaw dropped at the sight of a naked tab christ shes beautiful any man would kill for her although he edged closer judging from that pickie she and rannaldini must have been familiar for a long time the leaves are off the trees perhaps shes lying about the rape may not have known the photograph was being taken said gablecross and he explained about rannaldini having every room fitted with bugs hidden cameras and twoway mirrors every night he watched his guests in bed on television monitors did they know and perform mused portland can i have a seat in the stalls pleaded dc lightfoot and was kicked by dc smithson so the murderers not only got the keys to every bedroom but the code to every safe secret cache and priesthole in valhalla said gablecross what weve got to establish is was rannaldini the murderers only target did he or she kill to stop the memoirs christ portland shuddered at a hideously humiliating photograph of an emaciated helen campbellblack or to steal them from the watchtower and flog them to the press for some vast sum also with a second set on the loose stolen from bussages briefcase the murderer may kill again to get hold of them there had been another sighting on sunday night of tristan de montigny said dc lightfoot janice rannaldinis groom saw him sneaking into the south wing in a dark green polo shirt and white chinos around nine ten but he rolled up at valhalla the next day in jeans and a peacockblue shirt so he changed his clothes for some reason whos close to him asked portland lucy latimer said gablecross you and karen go and see her janice had also volunteered that tabithas husband the black cobra had also most unusually rolled up at the yard to look at rannaldinis horses at around eight thirty and had received a call on his mobile dc smithson consulted her notebook around nine twentyfive he said its no good i cant manage it the coast isnt clear and rang off he left the yard around nine thirty he presumably wouldnt have been very pleased that rannaldini had raped his wife doubt if hed show it cool customer quite cool enough to murder youre a racing buff tim said portland go and chat him up and how did you get on with rupert campbellblack tim asked fanshawe who knew that he hadnt and who was livid gablecross seemed to be portlands pet today we couldnt get near him said gablecross tersely baby spinosissimo interests me hes as elusive as campbellblack but all that drinking and extravagant camping it up means somethings eating him probably flora seymour quipped fanshawe pointing to one of the photographs of flora and baby entangled on the lawn at angels reach hes clearly not all gay try and pin him down today tim said portland and what about dame hermione we couldnt dent her either sighed gablecross swears she never left home on sunday night claims to have been talking to her husband in australia while the murder was taking place melbourne cid can check that said portland she wasnt watching pride and prejudice protested karen proudly and i had a word with her maid ortrud who detests her who said hermione had wild flowers and grass all around the hem of her négligée next morning well done portland beamed at her you go and see her kevin he added as a sop to fanshawe she likes charmers she asked ds gablecross to call her hermione giggled karen it was hilarious when he shook hands with her waxwork when we arrived fanshawes guffaw was easily the loudest i hate that man thought gablecross portland was flipping through the photographs wincing as he came to the ones of granny anything on granville hastings hes due back tomorrow said karen and that sexy gloria prescott fanshawe blew a kiss to heaven we had a brief word as she was leaving on monday said she was calling her mum at the time of the murder which checks out debbie and ive arranged to see her tomorrow lucky sod and what did lady griselda have to say portland asked dc lightfoot and dc smithson shes made a statement dc lightfoot went rather pink that she was looking for bloody balls while rannaldini was murdered or shed have done the bloody job herself because she was so furious with rannaldini for ripping up the beautiful dress shed made for dame hermione meredith whalen was even more forthright dc smithson pursed unpainted lips he said why didnt we buck up and bury rannaldini so he could organize a grand ball for three hundred people to dance on his grave portland laughed so everyone else did has meredith got an alibi he asked dc lightfoot puffed out his cheeks and went even pinker well he claims to have sloped off and had a halfhour loveydovey chat with his boyfriend hermiones husband bobby in australia after hed finished umpiring the finals oh my god youre right lad chipped in gablecross that was when dame hermione claims she was having a loveydovey chat with bobby in australia perhaps they were on a conference call giggled karen melbourne can sort that out too grinned portland rozzy pringle poor lady checks out he went on but why did rannaldini make a note to ring glyn her husband you and karen go and see him tim i could have cheered when rozzy told that mcp campbellblack to eff off said dc smithson every surface of portlands immaculate office was now covered with paper cups and overflowing ashtrays as other pairs were given their orders gablecross fought sleep buoyed up by the findings of the safe the team were now exhausted at having to assimilate so much information and in need of another fix it came from the gallant fingertip team who having crawled through brushwood brambles and nettles had finally concluded their search their findings had been passed on to the lab to be printed and analysed but included said portland as he opened an orange file an opaque glass lighter patterned with lilies tristan de montigny was looking for his on monday morning and he made a film called the lily in the valley said karen excitedly good girl an empty twolitre bottle of vodka thatll be mikhail pezcherovs said fanshawe green chewinggum probably chucked out by some young lady sweetening her breath for a lovers tryst went on portland vomit containing sweetcorn scrambled eggs and smoked salmon a tumbler engraved with rannaldinis initials and marked with coralpink lipstick a handsome gold signet ring a dark crimson lipstick chloe thought karen with satisfaction among other discoveries were a blue petrol can reeking of paraffin several used condoms a dog lead a number of green and pink tennis balls and a bullet lodged deep in the ground also noted had been a crushed clump of deadly nightshade hemlock and agrimony well provide you with the list portland glanced at his watch that should give you plenty to be going on with then turning to dc lightfoot with a sceptical grin any more on rannaldinis ghost in the highwaymans cloak signing lady griseldas receipt lightfoot shook his head nothing except we searched wardrobe and rannaldinis house not a trace of the cloak anywhere oooh how creepy shivered debbie people on the unit think so too said dc lightfoot theyre very jumpy clive is certain rannaldinis still around volunteered gablecross theyre a bunch of hysterics said portland slowly but we mustnt rule out the fact that the murderer could be impersonating rannaldini to give himself anonymity and putting the shits up everyone now bugger off all of you he waved the video tapes im going to spend the morning at the pictures then as everyone shuffled out of the room with their paper cups and ashtrays he said mind staying on a second tim fanshawe looked delighted gablecross was clearly in for a bollocking gablecross thought so too until portland smiled engagingly count yourself publicly reprimanded he said slamming the door but well done weve made a big step forward lets chew the cud and have a decent coffee he added switching on the percolator then go and see what the pathologist has to tell us her reports going to be longer than rannaldinis memoirs i called off the press conference you were right lady rannaldinis off the wall and dame hermione wanted to charge twenty thousand for the use of her services the postmortem revealed a wonderfully fit body showing no sign of ageing with the huge shoulder muscles of a conductor and an athlete it would have taken a superstrong person to strangle him dr meadowss freckled face was perplexed or someone fuelled by such a hatred or fear he died she consulted her notes some time between ten fifteen and eleven fifteen there were broken blood vessels and deep tissue injuries to the neck and whoever strangled him was wearing a large stone or a signet ring probably on the little finger of the left hand the stone cut into the flesh and appears to have swung round to the palm side perhaps because the wearer had lost weight check on everyone wearing rings said portland for a second gablecross had visions of ruperts big gold ring glinting in oscars lights he was shot through the heart by a gun of the type went on dr meadows but the angle of the exit wound in his back suggests it happened when he was lying down fired by someone about twelve feet away at the same time asked gablecross no i reckon about fifteen minutes after the strangulation he had lacerations on his face and a big gash on the side of his head which suggests he was pushed or fell against a sharp object or perhaps the murderer hit him with an iron bar or a spade there was also she went on saliva on his chest hair traces of saliva in his mouth saliva canine and human blood on his dressinggown and a bite on the ankle from an old dog with very few teeth in addition there was perfume and lipstick human hair and flakes of skin on his dressinggown and flakes of skin under his fingernails quite a lot of activity said portland there was also extensive bruising on his chest and face a couple of cracked ribs semen stains down his left thigh and vaginal fluid on his penis suggesting brief penetration then ejaculation after the victim managed to struggle away that figures gablecross and portland exchanged glances carpet fibres on the elbows and outside edges of the forearms also suggest that intercourse or rape took place indoors on the lounge floor of the watchtower suggested gablecross the rape victim clearly put up one hell of a struggle added dr meadows but from the colour of the bruises and the drying of the semen now this is interesting the rape took place a good twenty minutes before the point of death as i already surmised the shooting took place a good quarter of an hour after that so he pushed his victim on to the carpet mused gerry portland raped her maybe the dog probably campbellblacks dog gertrude bit and distracted him and the victim escaped he pursued her into the wood said gablecross and walked some seventyfive yards looking for her grass seed enchanters nightshade and traces of hemlock were all found on his bare feet and dressing gown volunteered dr meadows there was no evidence he was dragged outside perhaps the rape victim waited behind a tree and surprised him suggested portland perhaps but the evidence shows he was retracing his steps because he fell backwards as he was strangled with his feet pointing to the watchtower probably heard dame hermione singing said gablecross putting his palms to his forehead desperately trying to visualize the whole thing it would be impossible to strangle someone while they were raping you then shoot them as well youd have to pull the trigger with your little toe another abnormality went on dr meadows at the moment of death there was extreme sexual arousal but no hint of panic or fear he was completely relaxed so the murderer appears to have been someone he knew and was delighted to see dame hermione pondered gablecross hed had a helluva row with her perhaps he was delighted shed rolled up to make it up or perhaps he thought tabitha had forgiven him or someone disguised as them murmured gerry portland it would be hard to discern features at that hour of night thought gablecross like carlos mistaking eboli for elisabetta finally dr meadows turned over a page rannaldinis body was near enough to the watchtower for the murderer realistically to hope hed be torched in the fire and all the evidence of rape and dna destroyed with him there was ash on his body but no smoke breathed into his lungs so he died well before the watchtower caught fire which the fire brigade think was started by paraffin around eleven twenty said portland presumably from the blue can found in the wood from which all the fingerprints had been carefully wiped added gablecross so again the two men gazed at each other if one person had done all these things said portland quickly they would have been raped in rannaldinis watchtower strangled him outside blasted him with a had a butchers at the memoirs and decided to torch them as well they would have to have humped a can of paraffin and a gun into the wood continued gablecross and mr brimscombe said tab was emptyhanded when he saw her running towards the watchtower still could have used those hands to strangle him or after being raped she could have escaped run to the phone alerted wolfgang or her dad both of whom could have rolled up separately and taken out rannaldini they both wear signet rings on their little fingers perhaps tabitha or someone strangled rannaldini found they werent strong enough and finished him off with the gun dr meadows shrugged possible but unlikely bearing in mind the time lapses occurring between the two events unless someone quite separate from the rape said gablecross turned up with a gun shot him to steal the montigny the picasso and the memoirs and flogged them both for a fucking fortune good thinking could be the work of four isolated people or a gang of people working together lets dna everyone who doesnt check out portland turned to meadows you have been a miracle as usual he was about to kiss her hand but then dubious at where it might have been kissed her freckled blushing cheek instead you and karen buzz off he added to gablecross and see what you can find out from lucy and baby try to nail isa lovell and granville hastings as soon as possible im off to the one and nines back at valhalla james no respecter of the rigours of nightshooting decided that ten thirty was time for a walk and squeaked and pawed the cupboards of the caravan until his weary mistress dressed and took him outside walks once her favourite pastime gave lucy no pleasure now every time james froze or dived into the undergrowth she expected the murderer to jump out resolutely avoiding hangmans wood she headed northeast towards cathedral copse james however decided this was boring and swinging round totally ignoring lucys shrieks hurtled towards hangmans wood bent on games with german shepherds lucy had no option but to tear after him nothing much grew under the towering beeches of cathedral copse but in hangmans wood beneath ancient limes chestnuts oaks and sycamores broad enough in girth to conceal any lurking killer thrived a treacherous tangle of travellers joy nettles brambles and goosegrass everything reminded lucy of death and decay ivy hung brown and sere from treetrunks moss on the banks was dusty parched and yellow only an occasional torchbeam of sunlight penetrated the tree ceiling pushed down by mondays downpour the german shepherds had left but there were rustlings and bangings everywhere oh come back please james shrieked lucy then she heard footsteps thundering after her and broke into a run tripping over the roots that groped the path like arthritic fingers they were getting nearer she let out a scream of terror then felt a complete idiot as with lurcher acceleration which on the hard ground sounded like a herd of buffalo james shot past her shimmied round and landed at her feet with nonchalantly wagging tail bloody dog grabbing his green collar lucy shook it furiously dont you dare run off like that again next moment karen and gablecross pounded round the corner you all right miss fine muttered lucy in embarrassment james hurtled up and frightened the life out of me were all a bit uptight every shadow seems a ghost gablecross introduced karen and said he hadnt bothered lucy before because shed seemed so busy but could he ask her a few questions after theyd checked out the wood james had had his breakfast and stretched out on the bench seat pensively licking liver gravy off his whiskers had no intention of relinquishing his position so when karen and gablecross appeared lucy cleared a couple of chairs and switched on the kettle as she put her brushes and combs to soak in a bowl of fairy liquid she described the tennis tournament i gave wolfie back his signet ring after the last match she said finally then i came back to valhalla and rang my mother everyone seems to have rung their mother observed gablecross it was sunday night you feel a bit low she was pleased to hear from you not awfully confessed lucy she was asleep i hadnt realized it was gone eleven oclock then i went along to the party any idea who might have done it any of us i suppose except oscar and valentin and darling rozzy who was at her vile husbands birthday party lucy got a packet of shortbread out of the cupboard and mikhail who was far too hammered to do anything james whod been corrugating his long nose in search of fleas opened a long yellow eye as lucy took off the wrapping lovely dog said karen from a safe distance theyre known as gazehounds because they hunt by sight rather than scent and funnily enough when i was taking him for a quick run round hangmans wood after the tennis he suddenly bounded forward wagging his tail as though he recognized someone who does he like well tabitha wolfie baby granny flora rozzy of course he adores alpheus too alpheus loves dogs and misses his german shepherd mr bones tristan asked gablecross innocently oh yes lucys voice softened james adores tristan but it couldnt have been tristan he was in france mikhail says he saw him hed have seen him in quadruple he was so drunk gablecross liked lucy she looked so reassuringly normal her voice after the initial screaming was so soft he liked her large sludgy green eyes and her turnedup nose and big generous mouth plenty of openings in an open face rozzy pringle adores tristan doesnt she not difficult said lucy quickly hes been so kind to her and i dont know what wed have done without her she sewed up floras puppet fox when some fiend cut it to pieces a lot of unpleasant things have been happening she went on as the kettle boiled and switched itself off she told them about the slug pellets and the champagne that burnt a hole in the tablecloth what happened to the glass it shattered as rannaldini took a sip out of it dame hermione sang a top note rannaldini doesnt normally drink before conducting maybe hermione meant it for me and launched into song when she realized hed picked up the glass oh god who brought the glass in asked karen i dont remember lied lucy we were so busy that night id always assumed it was rannaldini or clive on his instructions doing these horrible things but now her voice trailed off people talk to you said karen admiringly like they talk to minicab drivers and hairdressers said lucy with a shrug theres no eyecontact they tend to babble things out because theyre nervous of going on the set and youre not likely to meet them socially after the movie she added with a trace of bitterness so they feel they can let their hair down does rozzy pringles husband know shes got cancer oh no whispered lucy in horror who told you that were not free to reveal our sources said gablecross sententiously oh goodness lucy collapsed on the bench seat too close to james triggering off a low growl and a flash of long fangs oh poor rozzy shes frantic for people not to know it could finish her career i have to cover for her each time she goes for treatment oh please dont tell anyone with frantically trembling hands she gathered up the empty blue mugs shed put in front of gablecross and karen and shoved them back in the cupboard who else knows only tristan i shouldnt have told him rozzy would kill me but i was so upset tristan was wonderful he offered her a part in der rosenkavalier way in the future which shell never be able to take up but just to keep up her spirits tristan de montigny has admitted he was in england on sunday night said karen noticing lucys eyes darting in terror said he was looking for locations in the forest of dean thats utterly logical gabbled lucy he hadnt slept for weeks keeping the whole show on the road talked a lot to you didnt he probably because i didnt want to know my motivation for putting on blusher women got very jealous he spent so much time with you persisted karen but he doesnt seem to have wanted to sleep with any of them he was too involved in the film muttered lucy goodness ive forgotten to make you those coffees she switched on the kettle again he didnt want to sleep with me or anyone else she stammered because hes in love with my friend tabitha and felt he could talk to me about her could he have killed rannaldini certainly not he adored him said lucy too quickly he put up with murder oh god from him was he in love with him what a horrible thing to say you claim he adored your friend tab but the night he got off with her rannaldini made him back off any idea why no squeaked lucy getting three cups out of the cupboard again with a terrific clatter had they found out about maxim raping delphine could rannaldini have threatened to out tristan asked gablecross tristan finds it hard to form close relationships lucy was having great difficulty in unscrewing the gold blend jar because her hands were shaking so much his mother died just after he was born so did his brother laurent tristans vile father never forgave tristan for being the one who lived he was brought up by a hoary old aunt who never praised him he may have been deprived of love but hes the kindest most thoughtful person in the world glancing down lucy saw she had emptied the kettle into the full jar of coffee and burst into tears i like my coffee strong said gablecross gently relieving her of the jar before she scalded herself the only reason lucy might have killed rannaldini he thought regretfully was because she was madly in love with tristan de montigny but he still had to go for the jugular did you know rannaldini raped your friend tabitha on sunday night and killed her stepmothers dog gertrude no i dont believe it gasped lucy shaking her head from side to side so the sudden cascade of tears flew around oh poor darling tab oh poor gertrude and poor taggie no wonder rupert was so upset and horrible last night if only people knew the truth that must be why tab hasnt answered my calls could she have led rannaldini on asked gablecross god no lucy fumbled for a piece of kitchen roll to mop her eyes shes far too cool and she simply doesnt need to were off to see baby said gablecross getting to his feet any idea where he might have been on sunday night none why does chloe loathe him so much because hes walking away with the film and because he granny flora and me are always giggling in corners chloe says were like a ladies doubles match and just as boring i love baby lucys voice broke again beneath that flip exterior hes determined to become a great singer hed only have killed rannaldini for twiddling the knobs on his recording after theyd gone lucy dug out her switch card she still couldnt find her passport and dialled the flower shop in rutminster mrs lovells a very popular young lady sighed the florist a gorgeoussounding foreign gentlemans just spent a fortune on an arrangement lucy proceeded to bawl her eyes out then felt bitterly ashamed why wasnt she thinking of poor tab who deserved to get together with tristan again the heatwave had returned the catmint round the terrace swarmed with butterflies red admirals peacocks painted ladies of both sexes said gablecross disapprovingly sums up the lot of them in the summer drawing room they found the biggest peacock of them all having abandoned any attempt to sleep during the day baby was reading viz and already at eleven thirty halfway down a large gin and tonic the grand inquisitor he sang and dc needham nodding at karen he rose to his feet and fell back again this is the room he went on to which i am summoned from the polo field for a pep talk from my father plus ça change gablecrosss lips tightened ok mr spinosissimo getting out the word was like navigating a lorry round hyde park corner put that magazine away and tell us what you were doing on sunday i went to oxford i drove my own car a red ferrari then looked at magdalen and christchurch i checked in at le manoir aux quat saisons around teatime learned my words for act two scene two which was scheduled for monday night i was rather far down a bottle of krug when i realized id been stood up so i attacked another one then i must have passed out which room were you staying in asked karen who was feeling really sorry for him it was called hydrangea youll find it booked under alpheus shaw theres so much press interest in this film one cannot be too careful then seeing the disapproval on gablecrosss square face its a joke detective sergeant not a very funny one how did you pay with huge difficulty sorry another joke falling even flatter i paid in cash i had a win at ascot on road test a good horse said gablecross remembering the peace interview technique did anyone see you arrive of course and leave around two oclock id sobered enough to drive home i patted the night porter on the head did you stop on the way back for petrol i dont remember where did you keep the receipt i guess not my ambition is to be so rich it doesnt matter if i do was there a balcony outside your room yes i went out and practised a bit act two scene two changed carloss life and mine too for that matter getting to his feet baby poured another gin and tonic for himself then long glasses of iced orange juice for the others presumably there was a fire escape by which you could have left and come back said gablecross i didnt check did anyone see you during those gablecross counted on his fingers nine hours a waiter brought me the second bottle of krug raymondo i think his name was id have delayed him if hed been prettier what was the name of the lady who stood you up snapped gablecross baby was ashen beneath his suntan his jaw rigid with pain but still he joked even for those eyelashes really you must dye them for full impact sergeant i am not going to tell you you need an alibi pleaded karen i dont care out in the park baby could see a black horse rolling its back legs whisking from side to side like a bottomslimming exercise when it struggled to its feet grey with dust much bigger than the horses around it baby recognized the prince of darkness it was a guy he said flatly married very high profile wouldnt do either of our careers any good and would create a frightful scandal which would break his very straight familys hearts then seeing gablecross frowning and perplexed baby laughed no its not alpheus you need this other gentlemans corroboration even if he didnt show up said gablecross mulishly two bottles of krug dont constitute an alibi and a bar of chocolate and some jellybeans dont upset the detective said gablecross angrily if you play ball with us we wont shop you i cant seeing the hurt in his eyes karen said were you very close the closeness i guess was on my side he pleases himself what pisses me off is ive been had or rather wasnt had on sunday night did you know rannaldini had twoway mirrors and bugs in every room even lucys caravan really baby cheered up instantly no wonder he was so vindictive after hearing the terrible things people said about him any idea who might have killed him harder to think who might not question of bottle what about tabitha only thing shed kill for is cruelty to animals although i gather that rannaldini killed her stepmothers dog my moneyd be on baby looked furtively round the room our hostess shed been cut out of the will according to clive there was a horrific photograph of her in the memoirs gablecross returned to the attack you werent meeting tristan de montigny i wish sighed baby tristans definitely not gay he asked me to the cinema and didnt put his hand on my crotch once karen burst out laughing gablecross snorted in disapproval the man you went to meet does his wife know hes gay i have no idea youre lying snapped gablecross it was flora seymour stood you up wasnt it because rannaldini showed her these shit as baby gazed at the photographs he looked shocked for the first time where did you find those in the pockets of the dressinggown rannaldini was wearing when he was murdered does flora know where you found them i told her on monday oh hell she told me rannaldini had pictures of us but shed shoved off to london by the time id come off the set on monday night i suppose george hungerfords seen them by now two witnesses saw george in paradise around ten thirty well theres your murderer baby had regained control of himself theyre very good he picked up the pictures i must have lost ten pounds and my double chins gone did you really see a ghost on friday night no confessed baby i was so pissed off with dame hermione masking me fainting was the only way to make sure they didnt use that take i must go and practise wandering out on to the terrace he threw out his arms and opened his lungs drunk with love full of an immense joy elisabetta my dear my happiness i await you what a pity that guys gay sighed karen as fags go i rather like him confessed gablecross but i wonder if he really was meeting anyone at the manoir meanwhile news of dna testing had roused others from their beds in panic its so definite grumbled griselda i might have pricked my finger when i was turning down that dressinggown for alpheus or put my saliva on it when i broke off the cotton with my teeth and alpheus might have left semen stains on it any time as he romped with hermione chloe and pushy said ogborne ugh said simone and mikhail could easily have gobbed on it during the quartet or dame hermione or chloe even i do not gob snapped chloe granny and sharon were in the earlier part of the scene sharon slobbers on everyone bless her said griselda and how many peoples might rannaldini have bonked in it since he neeked it from alpheus yawned sylvestre i cannot find my passport anywhere moaned lucy weve got to produce proper identification i wonder if my driving licence will do gablecross was dreading the next encounter they found granny gazing wistfully at a strip of wasteground covered in thistles poisonous hemlock mildewed burdock gaudy pink willowherb rusting sorrel yellowing nettles it divided the footpath from one of rannaldinis wonderfully cherished fields of wheat stretching golden to infinity this disgusting piece of land is called a setaside said granny his diction as silvery as his hair in the lateafternoon sunlight unlovable and neglected just as i feel having been cast aside by my young man linking arms with karen on one side and gablecross on the other he led them gently into the shade of an elder tree overhanging and snowing down pale starshaped flowers on a fallen log which he brushed clear so they could all sit down he was impeccably dressed karen noticed in primroseyellow cords an offwhite linen jacket and a grey silk spotted tie one must always wear a tie said granny as if reading her thoughts it can double up as a noose if things get too unbearable i got my dear john letter from giuseppe this morning he produced a page of scrawl with a shaking hand saying he and i are finished he has dumped me after five years for a record producer called serena westwood just for a contract with bravo he left me its entirely rannaldinis doing he knew giuseppe was greedy and as my career declined i would be less able to keep him in fast cars and expensive red wine so he delighted in goading me by introducing my boy to rich successful young women its strange the departure of such a little hustler should cause so much anguish i want to howl like a dog im very sorry karen took his hand gablecross asked him about sunday night the tennis tournament was a lark gratifying for two old fossils like grisel and me to get so far but hard to concentrate with young wolfgang gleaming like the young siegfried on the other side of the net we cheered ourselves up pretending rannaldini was the ball afterwards we got even drunker and i searched for balls with grisel bernard and lucy i think it was awfully dark by then the vibrations in his beautiful voice became more pronounced as he described the cutting up of his patchwork quilt ghastly to know someone hates you so much one thing that has struck me every time tristan is nice to anyone lucy tab flora something horrible happens to them i was favori du roi on friday i was telling everyone in the canteen how tristan had kicked ghastly howie denston up the ass for not getting me work then offered me a dream of a part ochs in der rosenkavalier a few hours later the patchwork quilt was in ribbons only a theory an interesting one said karen why didnt you call the police we were in the middle of a party well next day then i assumed it was rannaldini and he was quite above the law gablecross steeled himself was this the reason for a second granny stared at the photographs of himself it seemed at first in a giant airingcupboard later photographs showed him shoving loot into a shoppingbag he gripped karens hand even tighter and started to cry tears falling quietly in time to the raining elderflowers im so ashamed i dont know what came over me losing the patchwork quilt which was pretty or losing giuseppe who was even prettier he only stayed an hour on friday night arrived in a chauffeurdriven limo from the airport came out of the tomb made baby faint he had that effect on men then buggered back to london and miss westwood without removing his makeup i knew it was all up on saturday morning i went into peggy parkers clive must have followed me to rutminster i only took a couple of double damask tablecloths and some napkins goodness knows who i was planning to have to dinner ive never done anything like this before but itll be all over the papers menopausal old queen remanded for psychiatric counselling im sure peggy parker wont press charges karen hugged him shes such a music lover she might ask you to sing at one of her soirées said gablecross drily prison would be the favourable option granny wafted english fern as he mopped his eyes with a pale blue silk handkerchief you children have been so sweet to me why should anyone want to kill rannaldini asked karen for peace sighed granny what a darling old boy said karen as they trailed back to the car ill have a word with george hungerford when he gets back from germany gablecross made a note he and peggy parker are on the board of the rutshire symphony orchestra georgell owe you a few favours if he really was in paradise at ten twenty on sunday said karen having conveniently discarded debbie miller and arranged to meet pushy in the pearly gates at lunchtime fanshawe found her giving her own press conference to a crowd of reporters only his knowledge of the back lanes of rutshire enabled him to shake them off and find privacy in the green dragon at eldercombe pushy looked enticingly pretty her simple black dress clung to her tiny figure her newly washed blonde ringlets were tied back with a velvet ribbon but she wore too much eye makeup for real mourning roberto rannaldini was the most vital person ayve ever met she confided as she sipped a babycham he begged me to be the next lady rannaldini and although he was much too old ay felt ay could grow to love him off the record kevin it made folk very jealous having slipped the photos of a nude liplicking pushy straddling rannaldinis sofa into his hip pocket fanshawe asked if lady rannaldini had known her husband was having an affaire with pushy course not ay never slept with him thats why he respected as well as loved me glorias eyes filled with just enough tears not to swamp her mascara roberto was so caring when ay left a party frock at home he sent the helly to get it if ay wanted to go shopping he lent me the limo but ay was careful not to upstage lady rannaldini fanshawe got out his notebook what did you do on the night of the murder ay was so choked not to be in the finals ay went for a walk it was such a lovely evening then ay came into the house to phone mum as ay told you ay always do on a sunday night because roberto had urged me to use the valhalla phones at all taymes anyway ay nipped into lady rannaldinis cosy den next to the kitchen to borrow her harpers some play about puccini was on the radio but she wasnt there so ay borrowed her handset ay know it was cheeky and settled into the big sofa in the hall between the kitchen and lady rannaldinis den its very spooky that part of the house when ay became lady rannaldini ay was going to whaytewash all that dark panelling anyway ayd rung mum and was still reading harpers tabithas dad and stepmum were in it ay dont know if aym telling tales you mustnt hold back anything that might help us to find your fiancés killer said fanshawe gravely well wolfie came past around quarter to eleven aym so little he didnt see me and he switched on the machine in the kitchen next moment he came out whayte as a sheet this time i am going to kill my father he shouted there was a crunch on the gravel and he was gone but even stranger around eleven fifteen the clock in the all had just struck ay nipped back to return lady rannaldinis handset and her harpers and it was most embarrassing even though i hadnt heard her come back and i was outside the only door to that room all the time she was back in there perhaps she emerged from some secret passage anyway she reeked of paraffin and had torn that lovely dress and walked straight past me next moment i heard her running up the back stairs that is extremely valuable information said a jubilant fanshawe would you like to make a statement if it helps roberto of course i dont think youve met my colleague dc miller said fanshawe beckoning a hovering debbie from the public bar pushy looked quite hostile until debbie told her alpheus had raved about her beautiful voice and i gather you knew elisabettas part very well backwards maestro used my top notes instead of hermiones in the recording her intonation was very suspect you and rannaldini had an argument on saturday morning went on debbie only a lovers tiff i was upset his exwife got a role i wanted but cecilia is a name people heard elisabettas last aria in the wood they said it sounded miraculous that must have been my tape did you know rannaldini was planning to reverse his vasectomy asked fanshawe what did i tell you that was the only condition id have made before i gave him my body i dote on kiddies rannaldini and ay had agreed to be celibate for one another those were exactly the words shed told eulalia harrison in their indepth interview yesterday so they must be true having got his statement firmly in the can sergeant fanshawe kept his indepth question to the end was it because gloria had insisted on celibacy that rannaldini had been reduced to raping tabitha campbellblack in a flash the innocent virgin became a fishwife the absolute fucker screamed pushy not minding who heard her we agreed to keep ourselves chaste ill have him for breach of promise these photographs that have come into our possession do suggest your relationship was a little closer the bastard swore noone would ever see them i want my solicitor screeched pushy helen had been ashamed how relieved she was that rannaldini was dead no longer did she tremble to hear the front door creaking and the cats feet padding stealthily along the corridor she had been comforted by the flood of letters many written by authors or television producers seeking her opinion by the telephone calls fielded by the police and the obituary in the times which described her as the last and most beautiful of rannaldinis wives on the other hand she couldnt quite believe the lawyers assurances that the last will was unsigned and tabs naked photos danced slyly before her eyes then gerald portland had telephoned yesterday asking her to appeal for information in a press conference helen had panicked faced with a barrage of questions shed break down and the truth would come out yesterday tuesday the tenth had also been a terrible day for wolfie the cast and most of the crew had taken refuge in their beds but he bernard and the production office had had to work flat out all day in preparation for ruperts first night on the set in the middle of the afternoon wolfie had just realized the dustman hed tipped twenty pounds to take away the empties had been none other than nigel dempster in disguise he was also thinking that if mr brimscombe didnt stop moaning about his missing petrol can there would certainly be a second murder when he was summoned to the house to find his stepmother in hysterics perhaps shock had worn off and the loss of his father had kicked in despite the heat he drew her into her study shutting the door and all the windows oh wolfie ive done such a wicked thing it cant be that bad even if shed killed his father shed had enough provocation i burnt down the watchtower then at wolfies look of thunderstruck amazement with paraffin from teddy brimscombes petrol can the memoirs were so hideous and in the new will he hadnt left me a cent im sure it isnt valid wolfie was amazed helen had had the nerve the lawyers will sort it out papa wasnt ungenerous dont you stick up for him he cut you out too wolfie winced did anyone see you i dont know i heard hermione singing and i ran away the memoirs were so dreadful she was shaking so violently wolfie was forced out of pity to take her in his arms he said such humiliating things about me hed taken nude photographs of me i looked like a skeleton i had to stop them being published everyone was in them chloe hermione gloria serena who i thought was my friend that slut flora her voice rose shrilly im sure he loved you best wolfie patted her jagged shoulder like a cat reacting to human warmth helen pressed against him wolfie longed to pull away he could feel her rubbery breasts and bony pelvis against him her freckles on her deathly white disintegrating face were like flecks of blood on the snow even tab she hissed naked whole rolls of film and she was tarted up in a black gstring in some of them i dont believe it wolfie leapt away with clenched fists it was as though she was branding the words on his heart with a redhot poker he wanted to shout that his father had never left tab alone but ringing in his ears were tabs anguished pleas not to tell helen about the rape oh christ he groaned slumping on the sofa his head in his hands she led him on said helen spitefully even at our wedding look she thrust a photograph which wolfie had so often admired of late of a sixteenyearold tab smiling into rannaldinis admiring eyes hed just bought her a fucking horse snarled wolfie and soon she got a socking great allowance a cottage and a sèvres vase which she smashed youve no idea how they both tormented me then when wolfie didnt answer please dont tell anyone i set fire to the watchtower ill sort it out said wolfie wearily knowing that gablecross and karen were due to see lady rannaldini fanshawe having relayed the dramatic findings of his interview with pushy to gerald portland then magnanimously and patronizingly passed those relevant to helen on to his rivals thus armed on wednesday afternoon gablecross and karen found helen in her little study painting a not very good picture of the valley was it freudian karen wondered that shed left out magpie cottage gablecross noticed her skeletal thinness the staring eyes the deathly pallor the spread of grey in the foxred hair and thought how much she must have suffered as before she didnt offer them even a cup of tea two other officers dc smithson and dc lightfoot he began had spoken to mrs brimscombe she told them karen continued gently that you had two dresses made up from the mauve silk patterned with lilac and honeysuckle the second one was the one handed in to the police the first must have been the one you wore earlier thats rubbish stammered helen mrs brimscombe says she came down to the utility room after putting you to bed on sunday night and found the first dress in the washingmachine with all the colours run lady rannaldinis so particular she told dc smithson she always insists silks are handwashed she must have put the machine on herself helen was frantically straightening paperweights she was offthewall that night she told wolfie shed seen a purple willothewisp bobbing through hedges towards the cemetery its supposed to mean death at valhalla the truth is detective sergeant when i put on my first mauve silk dress on sunday afternoon i noticed a rip in the other one helen was talking carefully now as though she was reciting a poem she hadnt quite memorized so i left it in the utility room for mrs b to mend shes so on the blink she obviously thought it needed washing then panicked because shed put it on the wrong wash she was probably terrified her voice hardened fractionally thinking i wouldnt keep her and teddy now rannaldinis gone she seemed calmer but when gablecross told her pushy claimed to have smelt paraffin on her ripped dress as she rushed upstairs at eleven fifteen she lost her temper that evil creature she hissed she tried to destroy my marriage now my husbands gone shes trying to destroy me she humiliated me in every way using my phone and my bathroom pinching the cars and the helicopter when i needed them how could she think id burn down the watchtower her voice rose to a shriek destroying all my husbands precious compositions of course not karen jumped to her feet and putting an arm round helens shoulders settled her back in her chair let me get you a glass of water theyre both lying moaned helen brimscombe because shes old and confused gloria because shes a vindictive bitch mrs brimscombe gablecross flipped back a few pages confirms she made you a sweetcorn and smokedsalmon omelette for your tea the vomit of which was found ten yards from your husbands watchtower i never gasped helen i told you i chucked my omelette down the john she must have made a second for someone else film people are always demanding things but when gablecross pointed out that they would be able to check helens dna profile which had been taken that morning with the saliva in the vomit helen caved in and burst into tears i did go into the woods i so prayed my husbands passion for gloria was dying out and i wanted to check if they were together i found myself drawn to the watchtower around half past ten the door was open helen was rocking back and forth clutching herself on his table i found this llloathsome photograph of gloria with nothing on i tore it up then i heard a noise i was so upset and so terrified it might be my husband furious with me for destroying the photo that i rushed into the wood and threw up then i ran home it was horrible she raised streaming eyes to gablecross who grunted sympathetically did you notice any keys anywhere he asked sure helen wrinkled her freckled forehead they were on my husbands table thats very useful information said karen returning with a brimming glass which she placed on the table beside helens chair try to remember she added soothingly as helen leapt to her feet and shoved a little flowered mat under the glass you were in such a state lady rannaldini one often blocks these things out did you strangle your husband oh no no helen licked her lips in terror hed have been far too strong and id never set fire to his watchtower bussage may have taken copies but all the originals of his compositions and memoirs were there i admired him so much as a composer he used to write beautiful letters helen had moved to another table straightening lining up picking up a little ivory fan i remember him quoting donne no spring or summer beauty has such grace as i have seen in one autumnal face young beauties force our love and theres a rape karen continued the poem then raised an eyebrow at gablecross who nodded did you know rannaldini is alleged to have raped tabitha just before he was murdered she asked softly there was a crack as the little fan broke she must have led him on said helen quite unable to control her venom she was always flaunting herself omigod she looked at them appalled shes got a fiendish temper you dont think she killed him when helen had calmed down a little gablecross asked if shed seen anyone else in the wood promise you wont say who told you helens eyes were rolling crazily again of course not said gablecross cosily youve been a marvellous witness i saw my exhusband rupert whispered helen in the wood with a gun in his hand jesus sarge karen was jumping up and down in excitement as they emerged out of the dark panelled hall into the lavender yellow roses and falling sunlight of the forecourt hadnt we better tip off gerry and go and nail rupert too early hes at newmarket and well need far more evidence than a crazy exwifes terrified impressions in a pitchdark wood she may well have wanted it to be rupert do you think she hates him enough to shop him possibly i think shes pathological where he and tab are concerned particularly now she knows rannaldini raped tab i certainly wouldnt rule her out as the killer lets go and talk to another side of the triangle isaac lovell who hates rupert even more than she does im expecting isa within the hour janice the head groom told karen and gablecross when they walked into rannaldinis yard slim foxy knowing a goer in the sack janice was soon confiding that she would happily have murdered her late boss for the way he treated his horses that was his torture chamber she added pointing the yard brush at the indoor school he used to lock himself in with a green young horse and do terrible things to make them go the way he wanted she had stayed with rannaldini she said because she was so sorry for the horses and as gablecross stretched out a hand towards the heads hanging out of the boxes they all flinched away except for the prince of darkness who safely muzzled scraped angrily at his halfdoor hell get you with his feet or crush you against a wall if he cant use his teeth said janice for sunday night she had the perfect alibi a skittle contest between nine thirty and midnight at the pearly gates i was choked when isa turned up at the yard at eight thirty i wasnt expecting him he always slides in well like a cobra never giving you any time to tart up hes gorgeous the bastard she added to karen i was dying to get away but he insisted on looking at every horse in case theyd lost condition in the drought were turning them out just at night because of the flies how did isa get on with rannaldini worse and worse noone pushes horses harder than isa its an insult to his genius to expect him to flog them home but rannaldini wanted more winners he went berserk when peppy won the derby last week janice glanced round the yard in terror i cant believe hes not here any more he threatened to jock isa off and drop jake as trainer thats like an ad agency losing the cocacola account it would ruin jake was isa upset not outwardly thats what makes him so attractive never shows what hes thinking not a lot probably except about horses said gablecross noticing an empty box with stickers on the green halfdoors saying champion and world beater and the engineer painted in blue letters above them the damsel in distress and now her charger had fled rupert campbellblacks groom dizzy collected engie this morning explained janice good thing rupert didnt come thered have been bloodshed if hed seen isa in the tack room she handed out chipped mugs of orange squash and settled down to clean a bridle isa was paranoid about his private life staying private she went on im sure rannaldini hoped to share groupies and experience but isa wouldnt play ball hes a terrific stud but he likes to poach under cover of dark like a gypsy he was well pissed off on sunday night his mobile rang it must have been around nine thirty because the stable clock was striking and he couldnt walk out of earshot because he and i were both in the princes box so he pressed the receiver to his mouth and muttered that he wasnt going to be able to make it then he switched off his mobile and said he was off to magpie cottage youd better keep it switched off casanova i said to him in case any of your ladies ring when tabs there he threw me such a filthy look i went cold he can put the evil eye on you by the time id turned out the prince he was gone what dyou reckon to his marriage asked karen who was busy taking goosegrass out of the stable cats tail pretends he doesnt give a stuff shes a madam but you cant help loving her and she doesnt deserve a pig like isa any more than her stupid neurotic mother deserved rannaldini i heard rannaldini and isa rowing again last week just before he left for australia im taking my horses away because you havent made my poor stepdaughter very happy rannaldini was saying in his oiliest voice and isa hissed back thats because you want her yourself you fucker well stay away from her perhaps he loves her sighed karen romantically it sounds really weird janice dug her sponge into the saddle soap but because of the blood feud between the campbellblacks and the lovells i think isa feels bitterly ashamed about wanting tab so much almost like a paedophile fighting to stop himself jumping on a little kid so he rejects her does that make sense utterly karen nodded wisely as the stable cat settled purring happily between her luscious thighs a puritan conscience coupled with an overaberrant libido seldom leads to an easy love life gablecross gave her an oldfashioned look did you see anything unusual on your way to the pearly gates he asked janice only tristan de montigny screeching down the drive in that fuckoff car nearly running me down heres isa please dont tell him ive been gossiping i might want a reference gablecross had long heroworshipped jake lovell as a showjumper then a trainer and no jockey had captured the publics imagination more than his son other riders feared isa whispering of the risks he took how he slithered through gaps of which noone else was capable how he hurtled past uttering gypsy curses turning dark evil eyes on the opposition until it melted away but as he got out of a secondhand merc chewing gum and dressed in patched black jeans and a nettlegreen shirt dark glasses hiding the evil eyes he looked harmless enough about five foot eight the same height as rannaldini but half the width he stood watching them as narrow and dark as a cypress at noon having taken in karens beauty he ignored her addressing all his remarks to gablecross who immediately softened him up by congratulating him on winning the grand annual in australia last week gablecross then displayed so much knowledge about the princes form last winter that isa took him over to be introduced having ruffled the princes mane and scratched him behind his ears isa removed his muzzle before giving him a polo but as gablecross approached his equine hero darted huge teeth at him with a furious squeal shurrup isa cuffed the prince affectionately on his black nose in his soft birmingham accent he confirmed janices statement that hed dropped in on sunday night to check the horses and his wife who he hadnt seen since his return from australia in june long time to leave such a beautiful young woman chided karen times are hard for jump jockeys snapped isa you go where the work is at first he flatly denied taking any calls at the yard we have evidence gablecross flipped back through karens notebook that your mobile rang around nine thirty and you cancelled an arrangement to meet someone because the coast wasnt clear is that a fact isa was feeling the princes legs for swelling he had a bad habit of galloping round on this hard ground people seem to know more about my life than i do who were you talking to there was a pause i dont remember my mobile rings all day probably my father and me telling him rannaldini was at home and we couldnt remove a horse which horse sparkling that grey on the left rannaldini had a bee in his bonnet the horse wasnt doing well enough wanted to give it a blood transfusion before its next race in the autumn sometimes it peps them up more often it wrecks them can we have your fathers number so we can check on the time said karen creating a convenient diversion the prince lunged at karens notebook sending her scuttling across the yard hes exdirectory ill get him to call you how was mrs lovell when you got back asked gablecross idly i missed her she left a message on my machine saying she was going back to penscombe because rannaldinid found her stepmothers dog and shed be back around midnight have you got the tape yes but the message will have been wiped by now you must have been disappointed isa didnt answer his hands tested the princes back your cleaner karen peered at her notebook said there was evidence that mrs lovell had been er dolling herself up makeup unscrewed powder spilt on the dressingtable place reeking of perfume new dress packaging and labels on the floor karen was taunting isa now and more unusual the bed was made first time since we were married said isa why dyou think she made it turning over a new leaf perhaps she wasnt domesticated he took another piece of green chewinggum out of his hip pocket or expecting someone else what did you do while you were at the cottage opened a can of diet coke ate a chicken leg fed sharon read my mail and the racing pages of the sundays there was a good piece on the grand annual in the sunday express he bolted the princes door and moved on to the grey sparkling who greeted him with evident pleasure i also picked up my washing he added bitchily which my wife hadnt touched since before i left for oz and took it home to my mother he had been spending most of his time over at jakes yard because of his fathers deteriorating strength he cant look after thirty horses on his own babys horses are here he pointed to a bay and two chestnuts down the row but im thinking of taking them back to warwickshire the grass is better there friend of babys are you i find horses and ride for him no idea who he might have been meeting at le manoir aux quat saisons on sunday night none said isa flatly our relationship is strictly business how did you get on with rannaldini he was an owner theyre always easier when you win for them did you argue a lot yes did anyone see you leave magpie cottage on sunday no but i was back in warwickshire by midnight so you had plenty of time to murder rannaldini why take out my most important owner because he was intending to take all his horses away he wasnt if youve been on this case since sunday sergeant you must realize rannaldini was a control freak who tested everyone who owns his horses now hes dead imagine its his son wolfgang not my greatest fan hes got a stupid publicschool crush on tab so that wouldnt be a motive to kill his father would it did you know his last will cut out both your motherinlaw and tab so you dont stand to gain a penny so i was much better off with him alive wasnt i did you know your wifes claiming that rannaldini raped her on sunday night and there are traces of lipstick perfume and powder on his dressinggown and his body isas face was expressionless but sparkling jumped away with a snort of pain as his fingers tightened on her foreleg i didnt rannaldini always had the hots for her people said shed never looked more beautiful or excited as she ran towards the watchtower odd she should tart up like that to pick up a dog she had opened a new perfume called quercus added karen i gave it to her said isa roughly she knew i was coming round has it entered your thick heads that she was tarting up for me when the loss of her parents dog put everything out of her head did she tell you rannaldinid raped her asked gablecross then swore as they heard janice calling from the tack room sorry to bother you she smirked but its cecilia rannaldini returning your call for once isa had the grace to blush whys he talking to her hissed karen gablecross shrugged presumably as the chief inheritor of rannaldinis estate shes his new boss quite capable of murdering anyone fumed karen as they left the yard i wonder if that was his chewinggum found near the body late on wednesday afternoon pc brown and pc jones rolled up at lucys caravan tracking down the relevant cast and crew had been a nightmare miss lucy latimer yes how nice to see a smiling face thought pc jones weve come to give you a dna test well need identification thats fine thank god ive just found my passport ive been searching all day would you like a cup of tea this is james he wont bite she pointed to a shaggy red dog taking up most of the available seating very nice lady said pc brown as they ticked lucys name off their list twenty minutes later sergeant gablecross said she was a cracker bit long in the tooth said pc jones who was all of nineteen never really fancied older birds unless they look like claudine lauzerte or joanna lumley by the time lucy had finished making up the cast that night she was really feeling her age and her back was killing her ill have to go and see james benson she groaned let me give you a massage in the break said rozzy might save you the money lucy stretched on the table stripped to the waist breathing in oil of rosemary almost falling asleep as rozzys wonderful healing fingers crept round the back of her neck unknotting the muscles next moment she jumped out of her skin as james let out a furious growl hackles up long teeth bared something loomed in the window was it rozzys shadowy reflection then lucy screamed as a lens crashed against the glass and she saw the blurred outline of a cameraman james continued to bark his head off a second later hypealong barged in through the caravan door and had used up half a roll of film before lucy could grab a towel now i know what you girlies get up to you bastard yelled lucy dont do that to us chided rozzy thank god weve got a guard dog good boy jamesie she held out a hand but james was still growling and barking you frightened him said lucy indignantly ive got a bad back and a gorgeous front gimme that role of film naaah nice for my scrapbook hypealong sat down in lucys makeup chair and picking up a powder brush pretended to mop his brow give us a drink as lucy got a bottle of white out of the fridge he swung round to face them with shining eyes latest gossip is that rannaldini had the whole of valhalla wired up like fort knox and the police have the memoirs and steam is coming out of glamour pants portlands very clean ears oh god thought lucy numbly thats how they knew about rozzys cancer had gablecross and karen already known about maxim being tristans father were they flying kites when they interviewed her now youre not to spread naughty gossip chided rozzy taking the dangerously tilting bottle from lucy or ill water your flowered tie dont be daft said hypealong this is the best fuckin publicity ive ever had on a film if don carlos doesnt earn out in its first weekend im a flying dutchman having interviewed so many people in one day and left poor karen to type up their statements for tomorrows meeting gablecross felt too hyped up to go home and hung around the set watching listening and once again failing to nail either rupert or tristan who were still bitching at each other for the fourth night running therefore guiltily aware that he hadnt rung in gablecross drove through eldercombe village long after midnight after the splendours of valhalla and the pretty cottages along paradise high street with their front gardens full of phlox and standard roses his house on the greenview estate seemed humiliatingly poky bought on a mortgage back in the seventies a hungerford house had been every young couples dream newly painted in pastel colours with friendly neighbours and the morning sun streaming into a modern kitchen it had had a genuinely green view across eldercombe valley to ricky francelynchs house floating in woods like a grey battleship but in no time at all developer george hungerford had started slapping more and more houses around them blocking out any view filling the estate with less friendly neighbours where children took drugs heaved bricks through windows and resented having a cop living so near the value of gablecrosss house had plummeted and a move to a larger one where the children could have rooms of their own and surrounded by fields was only looking possible with the added boost of margarets income as deputy head tim was proud of his wifes achievement but he wished the name of the headmaster brian chambers a smiling leftie with a brown beard who drove a preg volvo estate fell off her tongue a little less often chambers and margaret shared a love of opera and swapped cds tim knew he was getting a taste of his own medicine for spending so much time over the years with comely women witnesses he knew margaret longed to hear about the goingson at valhalla how she would have given anything to meet hermione chloe alpheus and granville hastings but he was still resentful of brian gablecross thought the pack at valhalla were crackers and he needed to mull over them with his wife he hadnt sussed tristan de montigny or mikhail at all finding her awake last night he had asked her if shed ever heard of baby spinosissimo but at the first brian thinks hes remarkable he felt himself shutting up like a clam and the signed cd from hermione had stayed in the glove compartment difficult crimes always pushed away the rest of gablecrosss life over the years margaret had learnt to cope with the defensive walls the pensive silences and the dawn homecomings her first pay packet had been spent on a microwave expecting earache gablecross was amazed to be greeted by an empty house going into the kitchen he found a tomato salad a french stick a quarter of dutch cheese still in its cellophane wrapping and a tescos lasagne awaiting him against the lasagne was propped a note five minutes in the microwave gone to a staff meeting no doubt tucked up in some bar or worse with brian chambers thought gablecross savagely he ignored the lasagne making do with a pickled onion a slice of ancient pork pie and the rutminster echo whose first four pages were given over to the murder and infuriatingly included excellent photographs of gerald portland and fucking fanshawe grinning beside gloria prescott tomorrow he must go and see tabitha and try to pin down tristan he put aside the paper and tried seriously to work out who might have killed rannaldini but he couldnt concentrate with margaret still out it was only when he went into the lounge half an hour later for a large scotch to calm his rage that he found his wife fast asleep on the sofa the independent open at the murder fetching the duvet from their bed he laid it over her he mustnt forget their wedding anniversary on sunday the great excitements of thursdays inner cabinet meeting were first that bob harefield had been in the air flying to adelaide on sunday night when both hermione and meredith claimed to have been telephoning him and second mikhails twolitre smirnoff bottle contained traces of h but absolutely no alcohol so the bugger was pretending to be drunk the whole time chuntered gerald portland mikhail had also pretended to pass out under the weeping ash for four hours until an evening standard reporter tripped over him but in the meanwhile could have been quite sober enough to nip into the wood and strangle rannaldini and although his english wasnt good enough to understand the memoirs he could have burnt down the watchtower after making off with the montigny and the picasso mikhail who also flatly refused to admit he had nicked gablecrosss initialled parker pen even when he was caught signing autographs with it in paradise on thursday morning was without contrition i ate rannaldini he said dragging karen and gablecross into the heavenly host for a late breakfast whoever kill heem is an ero eef people think me drunk they leave me alone after rannaldini take my lara i do not sleep for twice nights of course i drop off under whipping ash why was your vodka bottle lying near rannaldini said gablecross sternly i suppose it sleepwalked karen who was deboning mikhails kipper got the giggles you realize you have no alibi i have no vife either vot is life without her she says i am piss artist next day i go on vagon so why was your bottle began gablecross i go to votchtower to kill rannaldini for making me cockhold but forest fire stop me getting hands on heem i hope fire does my vork and now perhaps someone will believe i only spend five minutes with screeching beetch chloe on sunday night and that i saw tristan in valhalla around nine thirty suspicion in fact was hardening on tristan who was flatly refusing to have a dna test to stop rupert throwing his weight around and demoralizing tristan even further sexton had arranged for him to see a rough cut of the film so far which rupert had reluctantly adored he loved sharon eating alpheuss slippers he loved the hunting and all tabs horses he cried buckets when posa died and after a long silence at the end said in a disappointed voice isnt there any more montignys a shit he added as an afterthought but an extremely clever one i even forgot they were singing and hes made valhalla look almost as good as penscombe being tonedeaf however and unable to appreciate alpheuss heavenly deep voice rupert thought he was the weak link more like the chairman of the local rotary club than a king in fact poor alpheus had just arrived back from a masterly boris in vienna where he had taken twelve curtain calls why wasnt he treated with more reverence at valhalla hed only popped back anyway for a tiny scene praying in the chapel before his coronation and intended to push off and sing in new york on friday and saturday returning in time for the polo shoot on monday but sexton on ruperts orders refused to let him go youve been overpaid for these extra days alphie so stay ere in case we need you alpheus was hopping particularly as hed just read hermiones interview in the daily telegraph now rannaldini has passed away it is my duty to shine more brightly as the only star in don carlos alpheus was also brooding over the loss of his jaguar which a newly steely sexton was refusing to replace at ten thirty on thursday morning therefore alpheus drew fanshawe and debbie into his caravan and confessed he had been withholding information because he wanted to protect his colleagues after wrestling with his conscience since monday he felt he must reveal that on his jog through the dusk to jasmine cottage on sunday night around ten thirty he had seen sextons maroon roller parked under dame hermiones judas tree having taken a statement trying not to betray their glee that they were about to rush in where gablecrosspatch had failed to dent fanshawe and debbie also at long last found a chink in simones frantic schedule as she stuck polaroids of mikhail baby and chloe into a huge scrapbook she said how furious she was with chloe how dare she tell flics i had said my uncle tristan never went to aunt hortenses birthday party she eavesdrip my private conversation with lucy noone appreciate pressure in making this movie tristans head was too much in it to go to a party can you imagine beethoven stopping composing ninth symphony to go to aunts bunfight furiously simone drew a black pentel moustache on chloes polaroid she was very young fanshawe told simone to have such a responsible job i am tristans niece everyone theenk favori du roi so i must be better than everyone you notice things it is my job bet you didnt notice ten things out of the ordinary on sunday night said debbie miller bet i did simone covered chloes dimpled chin with a black beard mikhail change his shoes and put on loafers before he finally come into house and i notice lots about chloe for first time she come in without lipstick always she wears bright crimson colour and she look much better without it she had also changed her clothes she still wore tennis skirt but folds pleats suggested debbie oui oui but the pleats were bigger and on her tshirt the blue stripes were paler and wider but look same why she must have change for a man said simone darkly but didnt want to show it well done who dyou think it was probably alpheus they leave at same time thats six things said a counting fanshawe and sexton simone giggled he had reine de pré in his hair and steeking out of the back of his trousers and gaillet in the buckle of his guccis and in his medallion debbie miller was writing frantically whats reine de pré and gaillet wild flowers should have been london pride giggled debbie he claimed he was in town perhaps it was sexton rolled in the grass with mees chloe superbitch thats eight things and bernard ave ash in his hair and helen come in wearing false eyelashes and black pencilled eyebrows as eef she cover up singeing very good said fanshawe delightedly so bernard and helen could have been in the wood squeaked debbie and sexton up to no good shrugged simone chloe could also have been with mikhail or alpheus although i think now they both hate her who around here wears signet rings or rings on their left hand little finger asked fanshawe rupert campbellblack simone glanced up at the telephone list granny tristan although he hasnt worn it recently now sexton is interesting he used to wear a signet ring on weddingring finger but since ermione thinks he go to eton he move it to leetle finger and it is too loose so he old it on like prince charles valentin oscar and bernard all wear wedding rings she continued griselda wear bloodstone on little finger ermione often wear big diamond rannaldini gave her gloria like flaunting big sapphire probably a fake rannaldini also give her that too wolfies signet ring keeps falling off because he lose so much weight too so in the finals he gave it to lucy to wear for him was lucy there all the time no she take james away for queek run he was whining but she was back before we finish and she give ring back to wolfgang so both lucy and wolfgang could have nipped into the wood and done the business thought fanshawe why dyou want to know simone gave chloes polaroid a squint we have reason to believe the murderer was wearing a big ring when he strangled rannaldini then it could have been me laughed simone on the little finger of her tiny left hand glinted an amber in a gold setting thats beautiful gasped debbie who gave you that a secret admirer too precious to tell anyone you had no motive to kill rannaldini teased fanshawe only for putting artistic consideration before continuity said simone with unconcealed venom after all this evidence sextons alibi of speeding in his maroon roller down the m after a weekend of heroically raising money and hermiones of watching pride and prejudice ringing her husband bobby and spending quality time with little cosmo were looking thin fanshawe and debbie found hermione alone and just managing to polish off a large tub of pistachio and ginger ice cream she had lost a stone and a half received six and a half thousand letters she told them and was ready to return to the set tomorrow because she couldnt let down rupert campbellblack hermione rather liked fanshawes sleek dark hair and flat stomach until he accused her of not watching pride and prejudice dont be ridiculous its my favourite novel why isnt timothy conducting this interview nor did you ring your husband oh well it must have been the day before when one is jetlagged and wrestling with artistic problems time ceases to have any meaning evidently how dyou explain the fact that mr kemps rollsroyce was parked under your judas tree at around ten twenty and mr kemps clothes when he finally rolled up at valhalla some time after two oclock in the morning were covered in ladys bedstraw and meadowsweet in fact mr kemp lied to us about being on the m at the time of the murder dame hermione he was at river house with you if sergeant fanshawe had expected a battle of wits he was disappointed indeed dame hermione bowed her head i must tell you the truth officer are you married i have a partner i am a married woman but sexton and i found we cared deeply for each other and our love tryst occurred in the summerhouse on sunday evening sexton laid down a carpet of ladys bedstraw and meadowsweet which was what elisabetta would have lain on in the sixteenth century didnt you notice the fire engines and the police sirens and the watchtower going up in flames asked fanshawe in amazement the summerhouse is behind river house so one cannot see the watchtower and frankly officer we were too busy setting each other aflame debbie miller had contracted karens complaint and was laughing so much she had to gaze out of the window why did you lie about this dame hermione i couldnt humiliate my husband bobby you and rannaldini managed to humiliate him for the last few years snapped fanshawe presumably your husband knew which side his bread was buttered when the royalties came in unkind officer hermione bowed reproachfully did you know that rannaldini was planning to have his vasectomy reversed so he could have children i am not past childbearing age cosmo would have adored a little sibling numerous independent witnesses heard you singing in the wood on sunday night dame hermione i suggest rannaldini had humiliated you and mr kemp intolerably on friday night he was about to pull the plug on the sham of your marriage and replace you as elisabetta with gloria prescott your career was on the slide and rannaldini had plans to marry again and make a total fool of you in his memoirs nonsense squawked hermione i insist on talking only to timothy fanshawe however had the bit between his teeth i think you went into the wood distracted rannaldini with your lovely voice and mr kemp did the business getting his clothes and shoes covered with wild flowers in the struggle nonsense nonsense you have no proof it was my bentley you saw in the bushes sexton arrived with armfuls and armfuls of ladys bedstraw and meadowsweet the most tender and cherishing lover i shall ring my friend chief constable swallow at once where was little cosmo while this was going on tucked up in bed of course where all good boys should be unfortunately for sexton a complaint had just been logged by the incident room from a couple driving towards the m around one am last monday morning they had been pushed into the hogweed on the verge by a lunatic overtaking in a maroon roller number plate sk to their apoplexy twenty minutes later the roadhog had hurtled past in the same roller but in the other direction going towards rutminster and shoving them into the hogweed again outraged to learn that sergeant fanshawe had made a breakthrough on his patch bonking on ladys bedstraw indeed gablecross set off for penscombe determined to succeed where fanshawe had failed by nailing tabitha not wanting anyone censoring his questions however he and karen lurked over excellent fish pie in the dog and trumpet until the dark blue helicopter had carried rupert lysander and xavier off to newmarket all round the pub walls were photographs of generations of campbellblacks triumphing at horsy events noticing the ferocious intensity on tabithas face as she rode a much older and larger boy off the ball in some pony club polo finals gablecross thought she would have had little difficulty in strangling rannaldini one of the specialities chalked on the blackboard was campbellblack chowder whats that made from shark and piranha asked gablecross as he paid the bill no way laughed the landlady thats taggies recipe shes the best thing that ever happened to that family got her hands full at the moment tabs still in shock and wont eat floods one moment shouting the next ruperts a continually erupting volcano just seen taggie dark glasses hiding her poor red eyes driving off to cotchester with bianca better and better thought gablecross with taggie out they must lose no time shit muttered karen as she drove up to the gates theres even more paparazzi here than at valhalla ruperts beautiful house pale gold as a drowsy lioness in the burning afternoon sunshine made gablecrosss hungerford home seem even pokier fucking nobs as annmarie the au pair knocked nervously on the study door a shrill voice shouted i dont care what daddy or tag say im not having any lunch having admired tabs amazing beauty in the silver frames in helens sitting room and without clothes between the pages of rannaldinis memoirs gablecross was appalled by the reality her normally flawless skin was grey and blotchy the bruise on her cheekbone parsnip yellow her eyes reddened and staring the drastic weight loss had given her the prematurely aged look of a terminal anorexic her very loose signet and wedding rings clashed as she ran a hand covered with more yellow bruises through her lank hair despite the heatwave she wore grey cords and an insideout dark green cashmere cardigan on a nearby table were a billowing ashtray and a threequartersdrunk vodka and tonic all over the floor open at the murder hunt were todays papers which tab had pinched from the kitchen despite taggie trying to hide them newmarket was on channel four with the sound turned down slumped on a blue and white striped sofa tab was flipping through a photograph album when gablecross and karen flashed their id cards she said would they please go away to make up for her mistresss rudeness sharon jumped off the sofa grabbed a lemonyellow silk cushion and carried it over to gablecross singing with delight lovely dog gablecross patted her lovely flowers said karen enviously you are popular its like a funeral parlour can you get me another vodka and tonic tab shouted in a slurred voice to annmarie mixing tranks and booze thought karen as she clocked a stubbs of two chestnut mares and a turner of cotchester cathedral against a raindark sky on the walls dyou want a cup of tea before you go asked tab weve just had lunch thanks gablecross nearly shattered his coccyx as he sat down heavily on an ancient beef bone removing it from the bowels of the armchair he placed it on the floor tab went back to her album patting the sofa for sharon to sit beside her exhorting her to admire the pictures of gertrude there she is at daddy and taggies wedding and there she is disapproving of daddys helicopter god she was sweet then in case sharon was hurt but so are you having glanced at gablecross who tapped his head and mouthed plastered karen took out her notebook at first tab denied everything discounting the people whod seen her racing towards the watchtower and later weeping bloodstained on the edge of hangmans wood her fingerprints were all over the telephone box and on a glass found in the wood persisted karen her lipstick was on the glass and her powder and traces of quercus were all over rannaldinis dressinggown really drawled tab disdainfully but her hand trembled as she pointed to a picture of gertrude wearing a green paper crown at christmas why did you doll up and put on a new dress on sunday night it was an old dress a present i hadnt worn it before because i didnt like it id been riding all afternoon it was baking i was expecting isa i hadnt seen him for ages so i tried to look nice weve only been married six months then i heard gertrude was missing and forgot everything so you rang rannaldini no wolfie snapped tab but i dialled the house instead of his mobile by mistake and it was switched through to rannaldini who said he had gertrude what a coincidence said gablecross sarcastically so you dolled yourself up to go and see him no for a second tab closed her eyes clenching her fists against the memory of a hurtling weight knocking her to the floor but i wanted to get to gertrude she paused for a second feeling her way shed cut her paw rannaldini didnt want me to take her hes bats about taggie and probably wanted to return her personally so i grabbed her and ran off but i tripped over a bramble cable gertrude hit her head on a stump as i fell thats why she bled so much then i realized she was dead there was a rattle of ice as tab grabbed her vodka and tonic her graves behind the tennis court why did you leave that message on wolfies machine that youd been raped tabs eyes flickered in terror her tongue ran over her gnawed reddened lips noone raped me she whispered youre lying rannaldini had a nasty dog bite dog hairs and dogs blood on his dressinggown im afraid gablecross gave a sigh the only way to find out the truth is to dig up gertrude and do a postmortem tab caved in completely no no please not she gasped itd destroy taggie all right rannaldini did rape me she was shaking so violently karen put down her notebook youre being too rough on her she hissed let me talk to her pushing sharon off the sofa she sat down and put her arm round tabs shoulders i cant take away the pain she said gently but itll go i promise im sure you have secrets you never told your mum about going too far with boys smoking dope at school rannaldini was stunningly attractive karen picked up the telegraph arts page which had a big picture of him conducting look at his beautiful hands your husbands been away a long time probably neglecting you tabs eyes filled with tears yes he has rannaldini didnt neglect you hed given you a wonderful horse paid for you to go to america paid for your wedding given you a cottage and a wonderful job working on don carlos i know sobbed tab but he screwed up my mother and tristans film and im sure he screwed up tristan and me only because he wanted you so badly and you found him attractive no let me finish karen was holding tabs hand and stroking it it was a hot summer evening you werent getting it from isa you have a bath and wash your hair you ring rannaldini and he suggests you go over so you put on a pretty dress and makeup for the first time in weeks and wafting perfume you arrive all hot and excited and rannaldini greets you wearing nothing but a dressinggown but knowing his reputation you still go in i wanted to see gertrude for christs sake the last telephone call rannaldini made in his life was to you that was me protested tab furiously ringing isa telling him id found gertrude and was taking her straight back to penscombe thereby giving yourself a pink ticket for as long as you liked with rannaldini interrupted gablecross brutally meanwhile you accepted a drink from him he thrust a vodka and tonic into my hand what did you talk about i said how excited i was to have a chance to go home and make it up with daddy gertrude was in my arms doing a lot of wagging i couldnt bear to waste any more time so i put her down and was just pecking rannaldini goodbye when he swung his head so his mouth landed on mine then he pushed me to the floor why didnt you scream for help rannaldini had his hand over my mouth i saw the black hairs like bristles on crackling tab started to shudder again her face beaded with sweat youre quite safe soothed karen sergeant gablecross and i are here annmaries in the kitchen look the nice old gardeners outside to tab mr bodkin seemed miles away merging into the heathaze shimmering on the gravel and the smokyblue trees beyond i tried to bite him my teeth clashed on his weddingring the weddingring my mother gave him for gods sake tell me what he did to you karen was stroking tabs hair its quite ok to be frightened tab described the rape quite dispassionately breaking down only when she came to gertrude he hit her with a bust then threw her against the carved chest bastard her voice rose to a scream its ok to be angry i pushed him against a table and snatched up gertrude who was pouring blood and stumbled down the stairs into the wood what happened to your glass i dont know it was found by his body gablecross was on the warpath again sure you didnt kill him because you were so angry no or lie in wait once you found gertrude was dead and kill him when he came out looking for you no why didnt you run back to the tennis court where all your friends were i lost my bearings i was so terrified hed come after me i just wanted to get away howd you get home i was waiting by the telephone box i heard someone singing and footsteps i thought it was rannaldini i ran into the road and a big car coming from paradise screeched to a halt i begged the driver to give me a lift he wanted to take me to casualty in rutminster i asked him to drop me on the road to cotchester but he swung his car round and took me the whole way home tab didnt remember anything about the car or the man except that he was kind he wrapped a rug round me and gertrude she was bleeding all over the car he turned the heating up so high he was pouring with sweat by the time we got home how old was he old at least forty karen suppressed a smile as gablecross winced noone you recognized no and he wouldnt come in i thanked him for saving me and he said in this funny accent ive got to thank you for saving me from something much bigger and drove off did you notice this picture in the watchtower gablecross held out a photograph of the snake charmer yuk said tab it was on the wall in the sitting room are you sure quite rannaldini pointed it out saying wasnt he handsome in those days i told him he looked better now i wasnt leading him on it was true he looked like an italian waiter when he was young tab took a slug of her now tepid vodka maybe the worst was over karen got up and prowled round the room gablecross renewed the attack why did you really kiss rannaldini he asked did you lure him on to rape you so you had an excuse to strangle him in selfdefence for the hundredth time i kissed him because i was so grateful hed found gertrude what crucifies me is the thought of her terrible last hours kidnapped totally confused and terrified because she was deaf and blind and then murdered all very touching said gablecross sarcastically i think you fancied your stepdad something rotten and if as you allege this was the first time how the hell dyou explain these like a straight flush he triumphantly splayed the photographs in front of her for a minute tab was speechless as the colour swept her face merging with the blotches until it was all the same ugly red as she gazed down at her own lascivious beauty the halfclosed eyes the curling tongue the thrustforward breasts the pink lips glistening between the long slender white thighs the full split beaver said gablecross roughly my father had a dog called beaver said tab slowly then she flipped how absolutely gross she struggled to her feet to grab the photographs then finding her legs wouldnt support her collapsed back on the sofa its a trick my head on someone elses body but in your own bedrooms at valhalla and at magpie cottage said gablecross we checked out the background you have been a busy girl i have not tabs scream was so raw that sharon whod been trembling and swallowing throughout the interview crept under the sofa her bone was black with buzzing flies now gablecross chucked it out of the window i never took off my clothes for rannaldini whispered tab god how revolting a horrible thought struck her perhaps isa had taken them and given them to rannaldini perhaps rannaldini had hidden in the cupboard perhaps clive oh christ i swear i never knew they were being taken where did you find them taking pride of place in rannaldinis memoirs are you sure you didnt catch a glimpse of them on sunday night and burn down the watchtower no this is the first time god in heaven why couldnt this sweating redfaced thug leave her alone karen was flipping through the little cards that had come with the flowers did you ring anyone else after the rape no only wolfie and daddy not tristan de montigny to tell him what had happened why ever should i he was in france tristan threatened to kill rannaldini on friday he was seen in valhalla at the time of the murder tab started in horror the colour deserting her face leaving a grey wasteland if youd tipped tristan off rannaldini had raped you accused gablecross you could have pushed him over the edge perhaps he heard your message on wolfies machine no clapping her hands over her ears tab frantically shook her head no no no wolfgang threatened to kill his dad after he heard that tape taunted gablecross hope you werent telling porkies might ave encouraged that young man even your father to kill rannaldini or did you tell your husband i didnt hello im back lovely basket of fruit arrived for you tab darling as a slender very tall girl walked in gablecross leapt guiltily to his feet this must be ruperts wife taggie she looked hardly older than her stepdaughter unfortunately he was too late to stop sharon wriggling out from under her chair frantically searching around for a present she snatched tabithas photographs off the table and proudly bore them over to taggie drop sharon for gods sake tab stumbled forward snatching the photographs then crumpling to the floor sobbing hysterically they think i killed rannaldini that i led him on to rape me please dont look at those pictures seldom had karen witnessed such fury a tigress protecting her cub how dare you bbbully her after all shes been through you horrible horrible beast yelled taggie even gablecross stepped back youre right he is a beast agreed karen together she and taggie lifted a weeping tab to her feet for a second she froze rigid with revulsion then collapsed weeping in taggies arms i didnt want anyone to know about the rape i wouldnt have blurted it out to dad or wolfie i was just so devastated about gertrude i know darling i feel so awful about mummy shes had such a terrible time with the press over the years imagine the fffield day beattie johnsons going to have when she finds out rannaldini raped me particularly if the police say i led him on and what will the lovells say jake hates me and isas never forgiven me because of peppy koala oh taggie ive made such a mess of my life you havent taggie tugged the red scarf from her dark hair holding it for tab to blow her nose on as if shed been bianca youre good brave and beautiful like a beautiful car that doesnt work wailed tab i loved lysander isa and tristan so much why didnt any of them love me because im bad luck thats why and i dont want to bring any more to mummy i love her so much too but shes never rung to see if im ok i expect the police have already told her i pulled her husband whats she going to think when she sees those pictures what would you think if you knew your sainted mother had grassed about your beloved fathers gun wondered gablecross bitterly what will she say when it all comes out mumbled tab perhaps it can be hushed up taggie turned beseechingly to karen tabithas been very cooperative said karen who was feeling thoroughly ashamed of herself taggie turned back to tab look why dont we ask mummy to stay for a bit her far too kind heart was already sinking as she made the offer but a tiny spark had ignited tabs face could we oh taggie you are kind i hate her rattling about in that creepy house stalked by rannaldinis ghost and you must open your lovely basket of fruit said karen mangoes and persimmons someone wants you to start eating again she handed tab the tiny envelope they were from wolfie perhaps he might drop mummy off sniffed tab id love to see wolfie again gablecross was profoundly depressed karen had bawled him out for bullying tab rupert campbellblack had lodged a ferocious complaint with the chief constable gerry portland was threatening to take him off the case altogether and he had absolutely no idea who had killed rannaldini it was nearly dark walking towards the valhalla car park he nearly had a fit as he saw a young boy sobbing in ruperts arms then he realized it was flora back for a brief appearance as elisabettas bodyguard whod just been subjected to another short back and sides for the sake of continuity george is a ghastly bore and a pleb darling rupert was saying and far too old for you youre older than taggie and youre happy wept flora were not talking about me and im certainly not a pleb george is so insanely jealous noone as gorgeous as you stands a chance if hes kneecapped old biddies in the past hes quite capable of doing you a mischief and putting a contract on rannaldini thats what im afraid of sobbed flora i love him so much passing wardrobe gablecross saw rozzy pringle getting dress shirts ready for the extras in the ball scene looking at the big hot iron in her hand the scissors and pinking shears hanging from the walls and the safetypins and needles spilling out of boxes he thought there were plenty of murder weapons here sergeant gablecross called rozzy blushing slightly youve been working so hard i thought you might have forgotten your wedding anniversary on sunday so i got a card and wrapped up some presents you shouldnt have done that gablecross spoke roughly to hide the lump in his throat how much do i owe you its a present or presents she laughed youve been so sweet to us not what rupert campbellblack thinks hes a brute youve saved my bacon i had forgotten said gablecross gratefully as he scribbled all my love tim in a happy anniversary card thanks so much every man should have a woman like you i wish my husband thought so sighed rozzy it was a highwaymans night with racing black clouds and the stars making only cameo appearances except for blazing jupiter still pursuing a glittering yellow halfgrapefruit of a moon gablecross couldnt wait to get home to margaret he needed to run his latest suspicions past her and have a moan about karen getting on his nerves approaching the greenview estate passing the waiters wearily closing up the chinese restaurant he reached in the glove compartment for hermiones cd saw brian chamberss blue volvo coming the other way and nearly drove into a wall passing his house he saw margaret in the kitchen in her dressinggown she didnt look glammed up maybe theyd just had sex or she knew brian well enough not to bother too much swinging the car round gablecross drove over to rutminster hall he knew having got away with a solo raid on clive and having received a warning from portland this afternoon he was putting his career on the line but like a junkie needing a fix he had to follow his hunch if george hungerford had experienced a quarter of the murderous rage he himself had just felt towards brian chambers and he was not taking karen a tough uncommunicative businessman would never open up in front of a woman rutminster hall lay on the other side of town as far as possible from the greenview estate george wouldnt spoil his own rolling hillside with eczema rashes of little houses thought gablecross savagely no lights were on but music was pouring so loudly out of the speakers that george didnt hear the car coming up the drive only people who lived in magnificent parks could get away with playing music that loudly only when gablecross banged the car door did george come racing round the side of the house flora for a second he seemed to disintegrate with disappointment then seeing gablecrosss id card he brusquely invited him in i havent got long it was a lie he had all eternity to long for flora gablecross knew george was a mate of the chief constable so hed better tread carefully he was also aware that george was a major player in the world property market who had often sailed too close to the wind but who had shown a softer side as managing director of the rutminster symphony orchestra where he had fallen in love with its youngest player flora seymour this was the man who had ruined gablecrosss view and made the value of his house plummet but he couldnt hate him because george looked so desolate thin unshaven black beneath the eyes he hadnt slept since his row with flora and was now like citizen kane dying of loneliness inside his vast ugly castle they sat on the terrace george with an untouched whisky gablecross with a perrier below them lay newmown hay like a choppy pale grey sea through a gap in the trees as if mocking them stood a moonlit temple of flora nice place morgue without flora when asked what he had been up to on sunday george claimed he had stayed in to watch a video of the orchestras recent tour of switzerland they had played brittens piano concerto and glazunov three his staff had sunday night off so there were no witnesses a helicopter landed in valhalla wasnt mine never left its hangar it was no secret said gablecross that george had hated rannaldini and had intended to slap a bypass or even a motorway through his land bastard hated me back tried to take over my orchestra furious that flora preferred me should never have let her get into his clutches look what happened rannaldini cut her hair forced her into a mans suit and onto some dyke no wonder she ricocheted into the arms of that aussie poofter rannaldini set the whole thing up george knew the world was swarming with gays that it was cool for girls to get into passionate friendships with them flora had adored campbellblacks son marcus gays understood women were more sympathetic he knew he was hamfisted shyness made him inarticulate in theory he confessed i shouldnt deprive the world of such a beautiful voice in practice i want her home where i can look after her same with my wife agreed gablecross all i can say is theres a very very unhappy young lady at valhalla ive been preoccupied admitted george i owed forty million to german banks gablecross agreed it made his twohundredpound overdraft seem rather paltry im out of the woods now but i wasnt nice to live with i even grumbled about her little dog miss him like hell hes so clever if i came down to breakfast in a tie he knew i was going to the office and there was no point in getting his lead for a walk this is don carlos isnt it said gablecross recognizing the music as philip launched into his great soliloquy george nodded hed got hooked on it when he was helping flora learn her part and had identified increasingly with philip but having found a jewel would he kill someone whod pushed her into infidelity wondered gablecross ill have that drink after all he said why dont you call her george said hed been going to ring her on sunday when a courier had arrived with an envelope photographs do not bend heart do not break inside had been pictures of an ecstatic flora on the lawn at angels reach with a ridiculously handsome youth with no double chin beer gut or grey hairs shouldnt deprive her of happiness with someone younger babys a charmer but hes very queer said gablecross gently if you have betrayed me philip iis voice reverberated round the park by almighty god tremble i shall have blood what were you really up to on sunday night asked gablecross i stayed at home come off it mr hungerford you were seen driving through paradise around ten twentyfive george looked down at the temple of flora no longer floodlit as the moon crept behind a cloud i drove over to paradise he took a slug of whisky saw a light on in rannaldinis watchtower i was going to park my car in the woods above valhalla and beat rannaldini to a pulp without flora i already had a life sentence but by the telephone box around ten twentyfive i saw this young girl so ghostly i crossed myself she had blood on her face and all over her dress and she carried a little dog for a terrible moment as she ran into my headlights like a moth i thought it was flora and trevor i just braked in time gablecross felt a lurch of excitement she wanted me to drop her on the cotchester road but i took her all the way to penscombe the dog was dead i wrapped it in an old tartan rug of trevors poor little thing still bled all over my car what did she look like blonde about five eight from her profile i twigged she was campbellblacks daughter i rang the house and said i was bringing her home she had no idea who i or anyone was didnt address a word to me except to thank me when i dropped her off at around half eleven i waited till rupert came out and folded her in his arms never felt lonelier in my life see anything else odd on the way only a man in a lightcoloured bloodstained suit crossing the cotchester road as we drove out of paradise but i reckoned by then i was just seeing things the helicopter that landed on sunday night must have been ruperts christ what a break gablecross knew it was unprofessional but when hed taken georges statement he rang taggie to say theyd identified the man who had brought tabitha home and it was unlikely that either of them had murdered rannaldini nightshooting on thursday began with a hefty consumption of porridge eggs bacon and sausages sugar puffs had also rocketed in popularity they are all comfort eating sighed maria as she prodded a sizzling leg of pork for the midnight break frightened out of their wits seeking the security of being children again no i am sorry valentin pet you cannot even have a vin ordinaire one of the sparks drunk last night had fallen off a ladder pulling two huge lights on top of him and holding up production for an hour consequently rupert had banned drink from the set and the canteen the entente had never been less cordiale all this put a terrible strain on tristan as tempers shortened and the crew grew more bolshie from exhaustion it was impossible to sleep in the day with the dread of the murderer stealthily letting himself into ones bedroom with the short nights there were only five hours of real darkness to film two complicated scenes and with dame hermione returning to the set theyd be lucky if the camera turned over before dawn filming had moved to another part of the garden by a fountain overlooked by huge sycamores white roses swarming over a pergola shedding an increasing carpet of petals on to the damp grass were an increasing continuity problem for simone rupert had already rolled up in a foul temper hed had no wins at newmarket and helen was coming to stay he was hopping with gablecross for upsetting tab but even more unhinged by a telephone call from beattie johnson of the scorpion his vicious exmistress threatening to reveal yet another scandal from his past i knew youd cheat on taggie in the end you bastard rupert was slumped in rannaldinis executive chair a straw hat with a jockey club ribbon tipped over his greek nose venting his spleen on sexton for agreeing to pay an extortionate sum to lord waterlane for the loan of rutminster polo ground on monday and tuesday plebs like sexton were stupidly overawed by titles sexton himself was sweating over fanshawes visit to river house police fink weve done it rupe flora meanwhile had returned for a last nights shooting a ghost of herself three days in london with abby and viking utterly mad about each other and wildly excited about the fastapproaching birth of their baby had made her loss of george even more acute as her eyes were too red and swollen even for lucy to repair tristan had agreed she could be filmed in dark glasses having changed into a rather shiny dinner jacket her bodyguards disguise for the ball she had nipped into the production office on her way to the set in the forlorn hope george might have left a message in the last hour there was nothing hollow with desolation she slouched towards the ruined cloisters that flanked the chapel broken columns and arches smothered in ivy and moonlight cast jagged shadows on paving stones almost worn away by the pacing of monks over the centuries did any of them ever pray for anything as fervently as she was now begging for georges return poor god must feel like an undertaker his services only sought at the death of a love affaire then floras despair turned to terror as she breathed in indescribable menace she couldnt move a scream froze in her throat she was being suffocated by chloroform then she realized it was maestro rannaldinis aftershave as a figure emerged from the darkest shadows and swept up the cloisters his black cloak slithering after him like a peacocks tail in the moonlight as he opened the chapel door she could see a pale cruel carved profile and a handsome head of pewter hair screaming flora fled back to the production office thank god a group was chatting outside ive just seen rannaldini she shrieked i saw him i swear i saw him bernard was quite gently telling her she was imagining things when valentin with rare animation announced that he too had seen rannaldini disappearing into the chapel earlier by the time hed woken his fatherinlaw oscar and theyd screwed up enough courage to follow rannaldini inside he had vanished probably returned to grab the murillo madonna said rupert contemptuously there are no such things as ghosts it is a figment of your feverish frog imagination another reason for not drinking until nightshootings over i saw heem said valentin sulkily he had that queek walk with his head thrown back i saw his cloak slithering whispered flora who was having difficulty getting her lighter to her cigarette i think hes still alive dont be fatuous snapped rupert rannaldini is dead how dyou know for certain asked baby who had rolled up eating a danish blue sandwich studded with whole garlic cloves to ward off hermione pushy and chloe through the night did you actually see the body wolfgang did said rupert sharply if youve been bullied by some bastard for twentyfour years you tend to recognize them very true agreed baby i couldnt mistake you and youve only been bullying me since tuesday bernard brayed nervously but before rupert could retaliate baby put an arm round floras quivering shoulders and bore her off to his caravan for a large drink rupert said we mustnt said flora listlessly fuck him i nearly did earlier he was so sweet to me said george and i are totally unsuited hes right marry me instead that is the loveliest compliment ive ever been paid said flora in a choked voice i cant think of anyone id be happier with but im stuck with loving george blowing her nose firmly she looked up at baby worried how grey and pinched he looked suitably lovesick for carlos said baby handing her a large vodka and tonic dame hermione assured me earlier that she didnt believe a word of the beastly rumour that i had aids bitch god i wish the memoirs werent on the loose every time i open a paper i expect to see you and me cavorting naked on the lawn at angels reach doubt if theyd find space for us theyre so obsessed with rannaldini the murder was still dominating every radio and television bulletin and every newspaper press and police helicopters prowled overhead giving poor sylvestre terrible sound problems there was increasing pressure on gerald portland to find the killer rannaldinis records were expected to dominate the charts for months to come very shrewd career move to cop it mused baby even shrewder if he hasnt and talking of dreadful things i saw clive in an extremely expensive new beige leather suit secreting himself into eulalia harrisons bedroom just now what dyou think that means something horribly sinister perhaps the sentinels bought the memoirs eleven oclock it was dark at last illuminated by the powerful lights from beneath like giants with hollowed eyes and great black devouring mouths valhallas trees glowered down thunder rumbled behind the black mantle of cloud everyone had been ready for hours but still dame hermione had not emerged from her caravan glancing up at the house rupert saw one of those aggressive croppedhaired harpies he used to tangle with when he was an mp glaring out of an upstairs window she looked vaguely familiar where the fuck is tristan he howled winding hermione up like big ben giggled chloe who ready and ravishing in her crimson taffeta was making sly sliding eyes at rupert christ shes looking good muttered sylvestre who the hells giving her one valentin oscar again wolfie mikhail again you again me again alpheus again rupert probably the goat again intoned ogborne god i could murder a beer back in her caravan which like the canteen had been towed up to the set hermiones determination to look even lovelier than chloe was not helped by her breaking down every few minutes how could sergeant fanshawe think sexton and i killed rannaldini i loved him so much you are the belle of this wonderful ball tristan was telling her for the hundredth time but you darent dance with carlos because all the court is spying on you tristan looked so strung up and defeated lucy wanted to kiss away the migraine that was crushing and pincering his tired brain like one of rannaldinis tortures but instead she carried on pressing powder into hermiones forehead which was wrinkling again you were there tristan when i made my début as elisabetta in paris rannaldini was my handsome prince my forbidden carlos married to cecilia whos now got all the money hermione snorted indignantly then reverting to tragedy can you believe he has gone oh dont cry again prayed lucy who had just added mascara to every single lower lash they all jumped at an imperious rattattat on the door itll be sunrise in a second shouted rupert what the hell are you doing briefing hermione said tristan evenly brief is not the word youve been in there two hours i am directing this movie said tristan haughtily even more deeply into the red for christs sake move it is that rupert cried hermione in excitement no it isnt said rupert running away chloe and pushy thought this was hysterical despite the delays everyone clapped dutifully when hermione finally arrived because hypealong had bribed the entire crew with miniature bottles of jack daniels very welcome at a time of ruperts enforced abstinence as chloe had slagged off hermione in the mail that morning and hermione had slagged off chloe in the telegraph and pushy in her pink satin had trashed them both in the mirror robertos chopper was always at my disposal the mood was far from sunny all three women claimed theyd been utterly misquoted and that eulalia harrison would set the record straight when her definitive piece appeared despite her alleged weight loss hermiones gold flesh was spilling over the top of her vermilion strapless dress like a cheese soufflé wonder bravissimo called out ogborne helen could use that cleavage as a cachepot said rupert hopefully for a cactus giggled chloe she looks like the town tart with all that slap realizing that hermione had resorted to some lastminute blusher a cursing lucy rushed forward to tone down her cheeks leave her alone exploded rupert shes masked for most of this scene at last everyone was in position quiet behind the camera shouted wolfie cut shouted tristan a minute later what is the matter hermione flora is masking me im guarding you protested flora and whys she wearing dark glasses so affected and attentionseeking flora burst into tears rupert turned on hermione shut up you fat cow hermione burst into tears down streaked her mascara from every individual lower lash lucy flipped you stupid man ill need at least twenty minutes to patch her up rupert had just fired lucy for insubordination when baby strolled out of the darkness unbuttoning his dinner jacket he flashed a white tshirt saying come back rannaldini all is forgiven there was a horrified silence rozzy whod just arrived with beautifully ironed dress shirts for him and mikhail gave a gasp of disapproval how could you baby show some respect for the dead and consideration for poor wolfie and lady rannaldini and even dame hermione she added as an afterthought rupert looked at baby for a second then to everyones amazement he began to laugh beattie johnson had successfully passed herself off as eulalia harrison for nearly a week her most pressing problem was what to pack into sundays sixthousandword spectacular for the scorpion and what to hold back for the book she intended to rush out to be entitled with a thong in my parts the material based on rannaldinis memoirs and the dirt she had picked up in the last few days was god or rather devil given she would have loved more time on the piece but valhalla gave her the creeps she wanted to go back to dressing like a human being and she was terrified that when clive discovered that out of the promised million he would only get the already paid two hundred thousand he would come after her with a bicycle chain the police also had a copy of the memoirs and were such frightful gossips they might leak some of the juicier material before beattie got it into the paper finally her boss gordon dillon was clamouring for copy by early tomorrow and she had to break off tonight to dine with alpheus who she hoped would put icing on the more outrageous cakes sighing with pleasure beattie scrolled down potential headlines how funloving flora swapped her dreary developer for a tasty tenor how champion jockey isa lovell swings both ways how dame hermione and alpheus were caught in flagrante how granny took a trip to parkers department store the dark secret of rosalind pringles lost voice how lust for my stepdaughter tabitha consumed me the woman tristan de montigny loves and why he must never have children that was a chaud pomme de terre and needed to be checked out on a trip to paris why lady griselda never married why hermiones hubby encouraged me to keep her happy in bed helen campbellblack on tabitha the tramp and taggie the thicko that would put rupert into orbit but not half so much as rannaldinis favourite canard how rupert posing as the perfect dad to adopt two kids flew to buenos aires to seduce abigail rosen poor saintly taggie would be very upset there were darker secrets the sadomasochistic lengths to which rannaldini had gone to titillate his jaded palate the attempt to murder his stepson marcus during the appleton piano competition you were rotten to your rancid core roberto crooned beattie as she flipped through his photographs of anorexic helen rubenesque hermione ravishing tabitha and rannaldini himself with tristans mother delphine more voluptuous than any pagethree girl that was a copy of étienne de montignys painting the snake charmer who the hell had stolen the original the scorpion had reporters looking for it everywhere beatties favourite was chloe and the goat such a shame that her proposed caption how publicschool girls love their nannies was too hot even for the scorpion and would have to wait for the book outside in the dark haunted garden she could see tristan talking to oscar her one regret was that despite sleeping down the landing from him all week she had neither pulled nor interviewed the gorgeous director her mobile rang it was gordon dillon had she any idea who killed rannaldini none at all the police are being singularly inept they think its some psychopath wholl kill again sooner you get that copy filed the better if you pinpoint the chief suspects we can run a competition next week asking readers to guess the murderer we might market a board game like cluedo or havent got a cluedo in portlands case you sure noones rumbled you noone theyre all so selfobsessed im having dinner with the worst well take care of yourself ive never had a story like this gordy out of the window she could see the dark rings of the maze and rannaldinis unicorn glade both places where in the old days rannaldini had laid her at the centre of the former she could make out the glimmering silver figure of a pawing snorting unicorn nearer a fountain and a cascade of white roses were illuminated by huge lights come eboli hermiones voice soared gloriously into the darkness the feast has but started and i already tire of its joyful noise shed better organize her own feast reflected beattie which included gulls eggs wild salmon and raspberries and cream with this web i will snare such a fly as alpheus murmured beattie as she put an icewrapped bottle of dom pérignon into the picnic basket she always sweated like a pig as she approached a deadline what a relief in her role as grotty eulalia that she didnt have to bath or tart up for her date alpheuss long nose was thoroughly out of joint having seen a clip of him riding rupert campbellblack had pronounced he made a sack of potatoes look like frankie dettori and refused to let him participate in the polo shoot we cant afford the insurance if you have a fall nor did alpheus feel remotely compensated by the beautiful suit griselda had hired for him to wear as a kingly spectator going into the production office on thursday night he found it deserted except for mikhail four forks sticking out of a dinner jacket pocket gabbling endearments into the telephone it will not be much longer my darlink alpheus who had picked up enough russian while singing boris pursed his lips mikhail was clearly getting over lara very quickly realizing hed been clocked mikhail hastily hung up and clanked off this left alpheus to conduct a long telephonic interview with le monde until he had made sure that rozzy had departed carrying mikhail and babys dress shirts and was able to nip into wardrobe and appropriate his new threethousandpound suit alpheus was pleased about his dinner with eulalia a doublepage spread in the sentinel would be most useful particularly if it could be held over until september when he had a wigmore recital and a new solo album which would need every help to knock rannaldini off the numberone spot you must be the handsomest man in opera if you didnt sing you could make a fortune modelling sighed eulalia putting in another roll of film so few men can carry off white suits having embarked on a rare third glass of dom pérignon alpheus was feeling romantic and manly in the dusk at jasmine cottage the dog daisies glowed like little moons down in the valley tractors with headlamps were cutting rannaldinis hay blotting out the din made by hermione and chloe turn your head slightly youve got such an imposing profile went on eulalia im sure when the independent described you as wooden last year it was only in the context of a great tree sheltering the whole production she was probably right reflected alpheus eulalia he decided looked like a fashion model in a leftwing paper with granny specs dominating a pale set face leg and armpit hair marginally longer than the hair on her head and a long floating black dress giving no advance information about the figure underneath pushing her on the swing earlier he had deduced from the dark shadow between her hairy legs that she wasnt wearing any panties unfortunately from eulalias point of view alpheus was far more interested in analysing himself and his art and singing snatches of don giovanni with an engaging smile than in dishing the dirt he had no idea who tristan was screwing or who might have killed rannaldini having spent a further halfhour relaying how he sang his first philip ii alpheus leant forward removed eulalias spectacles told her she had lovely eyes and suggested they try some of that delicious picnic to mop up the dom pérignon what a nurturing young woman said alpheus selecting a gulls egg youve even remembered the celery salt alas the totally undomesticated eulalia had not realized gulls eggs needed boiling and the first one alpheus cracked went all over his new white suit eulalia was unfazed elderflower boiled with hemlock and comfrey will get egg yolk out of anything she said and next moment had pushed alpheus back on to the damp grass released his cock spread it with celery salt and had her incomparably wicked way with him alpheus had never encountered such vaginal muscles they were like the strong fingers of some pinkcheeked milkmaid what couldnt he do with a helpmate of such intellect who could also cater so deliciously to his physical needs under those ethnic clothes and all that hair eulalia had a surprisingly lovely body if she flossed and showered a bit more and wore the right clothes oooooh oooohooo looking up at the newly emerged stars alpheus felt himself ejaculate with all the splendour of the milky way that was tremendous he said graciously then eulalia spoilt it all by asking if she was a better lay than chloe or dame hermione or pushy and if he were screwing her to get his own back on cheryl for going to bed with rannaldini it is difficult to hit the roof when one is lying under a woman journalist who had told her such monstrous untruths spluttered alpheus i dont figure the sentinel would be interested in such sleaze he had never cheated on cheryl anyone who implied differently was jealous probably chloe who had become overly possessive when hed formed a working partnership with dame hermione bollocks you lying old hypocrite eulalia jumped to her feet in her floating black dress her spectacles glinting evilly in the starlight she suddenly looked like the grand inquisitor snatching up a handful of grass and wildflowers shoving them between her legs she ran down the mossy steps to her car going inside alpheus discovered his lovely suit was covered in grass stains as well as egg yolk he was not hunting for comfrey and hemlock at this hour the grandfather clock in the hall was striking half twelve checking the kitchen calendar which featured a guillemot with a fish hanging from its beak rather like bernards moustache alpheus realized it was now friday the thirteenth and shivered the only answer was to burn the suit and blame its disappearance on mikhail who had admired it hugely then he remembered all the photographs eulalia had taken somehow hed got to stop her using them when hermione and chloes little scene still wasnt in the can by twelve thirty a despairing tristan called a break he was sure the crew were deliberately going slow there were dark mutterings as they set off sulkily for the canteen how could they be expected to flourish on roast pork minty new potatoes spring rolls red cabbage and apple pie and cream without a few glasses of red just one glass tristan pleaded with rupert its getting cold no said rupert switching on his mobile immediately it rang dont want to alarm you rupe confided an old racing crony from the sun but were convinced that eulalia harrisons beattie johnson in disguise rupert felt icicles dripping down his spine any chance of us getting your side of the abigail rosen story no snarled rupert and hung up no wonder eulalia had seemed familiar over the years beattie had nearly destroyed him and everything he loved this time she wasnt going to get away with it he had never bedded abby rosen he would kill to protect taggie the telephone rang again talk of the angel it was taggie with brilliant news gablecross had found the man whod driven tabitha home on sunday who could give her an alibi rupert had never dreamt he would feel passionately grateful to george hungerford whatever happens he told taggie i want you to know ive always loved you looking up he saw what must be eulaliabeatties window in darkness it was much colder everyone was putting on jerseys the clapperloader was changing his board to friday the thirteenth ruperts friend on the sun wasted no time in breaking the news of beatties masquerade to hermione who choked on her second helping of roast pork to chloe who went green and to flora who looked about to faint soon the rumour was circulating to universal panic nearly everyone had spoken on and off the record to eulalia suddenly the large police presence hovering in the surrounding bushes or watching from the top floor of the south wing seemed totally inadequate beatties not answering her mobile said a shaken griselda she was talking to clive earlier probably buying the memoirs for the scorpion tristan had gone very white but determined to limit any damage said that ruperts friend from the sun had probably been fishing we must stay calm he told oscar the crew were sourly drinking perrier mikhail was appropriating more forks bernard retreated to a quiet corner of the canteen with a roll a piece of brie and his crossword he was glad there were people around the park beyond was very shadowy and dark then he gave a gasp as his crossword swam green before his eyes its been completely filled in by rannaldini his hoarse voice was falsetto with fear even his ms are the same like football posts he brandished the pages with a frantically shaking hand as everyone gathered round mon dieu valentin crossed himself where did you leave it on the set on top of my briefcase beside tristans chair wolfie had gone dreadfully pale i dont believe it he stammered returning the crossword to bernard i swear the body was my fathers of course it was how often do i have to tell you there are no such things as ghosts snapped rupert ill take that newspaper if you please said dc lightfoot lucy cried simone dragging flora into make up pointing to the white strip on her neck above the suntan which had been revealed by her latest short back and sides that strip shows the executioner where to drop the axe sobbed flora as lucy blended it in if beattie dumps george and i are finished a worried trevor couldnt lick away her tears fast enough a bored james whined irritably from his bench seat oh shut up james wailed lucy despairingly ill walk him and trev for you after the break said rozzy soothingly helen was packing five suitcases of clothes to be unhappy in at penscombe when a trembling mrs brimscombe rushed in oh my lady theyre saying that woman typing next door all week is that beastly johnson omigod helen clutched a bedpost eulalia had been far more supportive than the bereavement counsellor they had spent hours and hours discussing helens hangups about tabitha rupert and taggie she must be stopped she whispered meanwhile talk of bernards briefcase had reminded rupert his own was still on the set with beattie on the prowl he had better retrieve it a chill breeze scattered another snowstorm of petals from the rose arch and shook the pearly drops of the fountain an owl hooted ahead a cigar glowed like a tiny brakelight then as ruperts eyes became accustomed to the dark his blood ran cold and his heart stopped for there on the set sitting in his executive producers chair was rannaldini the collar of his highwaymans cloak was turned up caressing the planed cheeks of his cold haughty face his pewter hair gleamed in the moonlight in a garden heady with the scent of lilies honeysuckle and nightscented stock rupert was suddenly asphyxiated by a waft of maestro who are you he managed to croak but as rannaldini slowly turned towards him rupert bolted crashing through the dark garden hurtling into the canteen sending cast and crew flying he rushed up to the bar gimme a quadruple whisky mr sexton insist no drink dont be so fucking silly ive just seen rannaldini mr sexton say no drink persisted maria i thought you didnt believe in ghosts said a grinning baby having gone behind the bar and poured rupert a large bells wolfie went in search of the briefcase but when he returned with it five minutes later he said the set had been deserted well theres no way im putting up with this sort of thing said rupert shirtily ill leave you to it he told tristan who tried not to look relieved at least theyd get on quicker i want everyone back on the set by one thirty he shouted as he picked up his mobile and vanished into the darkness beattie returned to valhalla kicking herself for wasting time on such a jerk as she let herself into her suite however she found a note typed on dovegrey productionoffice paper shoved under her door meet me in the unicorn glade at one fifteen and i will tell you who killed rannaldini beattie wanted to bay like a bloodhound hell it was ten past already she hoped she wasnt too late this was going to be the greatest exclusive ever the scoop de grâce quickly checking that noone had tampered with her machine she pressed the save button and set out for the unicorn glade thank god when she was having an affaire with rannaldini she had memorized the shortcut through the maze it was so dark and claustrophobic you could easily lose your bearings she ran so fast she kept cannoning off the sides the rough clipped yew twigs scraping her face and arms right left right she panted and right towards the pole star she could hear the crew chatting as they returned to work and left right left towards the great constellation of pegasus and she was out on the other side leaping in terror as an icy hand clawed her face then she laughed realizing it was only a weeping willow wet from an earlier shower jumping the devils stream rannaldinis only spring still flowing running under a rose arch she was into the unicorn glade based on a fifteenthcentury tapestry hanging in the musée de cluny in paris this small exquisite private garden had only been open to outsiders since rannaldinis death filled with scented flowers and herbs it was populated with little stone foxes weasels cats and greyhounds lying down with crossed paws beside rabbits to symbolize that even natural enemies can live in harmony legend had it that the unicorn could only be tamed by a virgin and in the original tapestry a chaste lady sat in the centre of the garden with the unicorn crouched beside her his front hoofs on her knee as she stroked his neck but as the joke went there had never been any virgins in valhalla so this touching tableau had been replaced by a lone unicorn gleaming silver in the starlight as he tossed his head and pawed the grass beattie could almost hear the proud little fellow snorting as she leant against him to regain her breath caressing his smooth back she ran her fingers up his mane and his grooved horn which was raised like a sword on guard as a child she had always longed for a pony ruperts horses and olympic gold for showjumping had been one of the reasons shed fallen so much in love with him if he hadnt dumped her she would never have been bringing the gorgeous bastard down glancing round at opulent shrub roses towering delphiniums and massed white foxgloves any of which could conceal the writer of the letter she was suddenly overwhelmed by a feeling of doom and froze with terror as one of the shadows separated and came towards her then as the moon emerged from a scurrying black cloud she saw rannaldinis face colder and whiter than any moon but with eyes crueller and hotter than hell the dark cloak slid over the dewy grass as he swept towards her on his way to conduct a requiem the words i never meant to slag you off withered on beatties lips she couldnt scream only retreat as he came nearer and nearer then she tripped backwards over a little stone fox and felt herself falling the pain was unimaginable by three oclock in the morning the wind had risen all the crew had put on jackets and hermione had grumbled bitterly enough about the treacherous night air to have appropriated rozzys dark red mohair cardigan and bernards duffel coat noticing rozzy shivering uncontrollably and fighting a racking cough tristan took off his bomber jacket and put it round her shoulders you must take care of that throat in fascinated horror lucy watched rozzy turn her head and drop a kiss on his hand as it rested for a second on her shoulder her ecstasy was unmistakable earlier in the day rozzy had been into rutminster for treatment for her cancer but recently lucy had noticed her poring over the score of der rosenkavalier marking in the part of marschallin with yellow pentel had rozzy convinced herself she could sing in the opera after all wolfie constantly taunted by nightmarish visions of tab being photographed in the nude by his father glanced up at valhalla where chandeliers blazed in nearly every window to create an illusion of a ball in progress a light was still on in helens bedroom she shouldnt be going to penscombe he muttered furiously to lucy shell only upset tab christ i miss her poor wolfie lucy hugged him shell be back for the polo shoot when youve finished snogging lucy and wolfgang called out tristan but so acidly noone laughed quiet please brayed bernard at three fortyfive pushy deciding noone on the set was paying her enough attention suggested that as she was so much younger than chloe and hermione she and flora should have a carefree little bop together for the sake of continuity while the older women discussed the ball we did have a love scene earlier she pouted no cried flora in revulsion it was the scene with pushy that had wrecked her and george seeing flora about to bolt and knowing he wouldnt get another nights filming out of her tristan told pushy to pack it in weve got to get this ball scene in the can before sunrise and before rupert come back and knock our heads together no way hell return till rannaldinis safely back in his coffin said ogborne in a sepulchral voice threequarters of an hour later oscar pretending to look into his viewfinder had fallen asleep flicking his fingers for ogbornes help valentin laid his fatherinlaw across two chairs a faint pink flush in a very pale sky heralded the approach of sunrise pigeons were cooing blackbirds pecking the lawn for worms cut and print well done everyone particularly chloe shouted tristan thank god there were pros like her who could dispatch a scene in one take thank god the deepest anxiety could be dispelled temporarily by a good nights work beyond the set emerging from the uniform greyness of night he could see urns overflowing with pink geraniums white and yellow roses swarming up dark yews and cypresses beyond the tall chimneys of river house soared like pale lupins why arent i filming dawn tristan sighed as the crew dismantled the camera tracks took down lights and prepared the film cans for the courier to take for processing lucy wearily removed makeup and wigs and thought longingly of her bed everyone was cheered up by a particularly sumptuous breakfast of fluffy buttery scrambled eggs smoked salmon and bagels followed by strawberries and cream dc lightfoot gablecross and karen who didnt want to miss the fun and half rutshire constabulary whod been flatfooting round like the chorus of the pirates of penzance were soon tucking in as well even the french contingent managed to crack a smile when rupert rolled up with several crates of white and red you can drink yourselves insensible now having nervously glanced around for rannaldinis ghost he dragged a newly arrived sexton into the production office expecting another bollocking about overpaying lord waterlane sexton was amazed when rupert announced that george hungerford was a seriously good guy i fort you loathed him said he was more of a yobbo than me only because he was threatening to ram a motorway up my estate hes given tab an alibi and hes offered us his polo field for nothing and he says we can have the wrap party there too get us away from valhalla what about lord waterlane asked a wistful sexton whod been invited to lunch at the house of lords itll really piss him off the greedy sod said rupert happily and his vulgar wife too who was expecting to nail the cast to open her fêtes for the next forty years good bloke george you are so bleedin irrational sighed sexton i know how to save money and im also dazzling at playing cupid flora who had changed out of her dinner jacket into a pair of grey linen shorts and a red and yellow striped blazer looked as young and desolate as a small boy going back to prep school for the second term everyone was hugging her taking her telephone number and saying theyd see her at the wrap party yes lovely ill be there lied flora through numbed lips shed send them a crate of champagne or rather plonk in her new impoverished state and be at the bottom of the river fleet by then as she walked wearily down to make up to collect trevor an early bumble bee was burying its face in a dark blue delphinium the clouds overhead were turning from yellow to pale pink a black crow swayed on top of one of the lawson cypresses in the fields below black plastic bags of hay lay on the gold stubble like slugs any minute rozzy would rush out and scatter little blue pellets one magpie for sorrow rose out of the unicorn glade even the sight of trevor standing on top of james to see out of the caravan window and wagging his tail so hard he nearly fell off didnt bring a smile to her lips as she opened the door both dogs hurtled down the steps having had pees that went on for ever crapped extensively and examined all the croquet hoops on the lawn to see what foxes and badgers had been about they belted off trevor to woo maria in the canteen james to find lucy it was now light enough for flora to define the stones in the regard ring george had given her on the eve of filming r for ruby e for emerald g for garnet a for amethyst r for ruby d for diamond spelling the word regard at the thought that her darling george would never have regard for her again flora collapsed against a huge oak tree sobbing piteously everyone swung round a hush fell at the utter desolation of the sound baby was about to race over and comfort her when rupert put a restraining hand on his arm and nodded towards the rose walk where from arches of acidgreen hop fantastically garlanded with a pink rose appropriately called the new dawn emerged george hungerford he was wearing a dark red polo shirt dirty white chinos which looked about to fall down because hed lost so much weight and odd shoes his dark hair was all over the place and in his hands in gaudy contrast to rannaldinis exquisite pastels was a hastily snatchedup bunch of marigolds salmonpink gladioli scarlet roses and mauve dahlias which quivered increasingly like some exotic butterfly noone uttered a word as he approached then in front of four of the finest singers in the world in a croaky strangulated bass he started to sing zärliche libre beethovens little rondo about tender love which flora had sung to him so often he started too high couldnt reach the top notes and had to begin again blood was trickling from hands clutching the roses too tightly at one moment his voice was so choked by tears he couldnt go on and the cooing pigeons had to fill in the gap flora appeared frozen to the oak tree only her knees were quivering as much as georges flowers next minute trevor had erupted jauntily from the maze nose caked in mud from burying a pork bone and giving a joyous bark he hurtled across the grass squashing the flowers as he landed in his masters arms once again george nearly ground to a halt but having dried his eyes on a wriggling trevor he managed to falter to the end there was a long silence followed by a burst of cheering and clapping swinging round blinking incredulously flora catapulted across the grass crashing into georges chest the arm that wasnt holding trevor and the flowers clamped around her dont say anything its my fault im such a stupid tosser mumbled george as he led her off down the rose walk into the sunrise oh how sweet sobbed lucy running off into the park tristan wanted to race after her and apologize for being so sarcastic earlier but he still had so much to do why cant don carlos have a happy ending said griselda wiping her eyes on a tablecloth even rupert and gablecross blew their noses noisily ive always thought flora a drama queen said hermione sourly now now hermsie said sexton reprovingly as he topped up her glass floras a sweetheart and didnt rupert make a terrific cupid bringing them togevver baby however whod been in low spirits all evening drained his glass of red turned to rupert with an expressionless face and said thank you mr cupidblack for ruining the only chance of happiness ive ever had and wandered off unsteadily towards the house another drama queen said chloe scornfully whats the stupid queer going on about asked rupert in bewilderment irrespective of his sexual orientation said tristan sharply baby really loves flora at least george and floras is one relationship beattie johnson hasnt screwed up said sexton whats up for this evening well really have to motor tristan reeled off a punishing list of cover shots and weve got to shoot alpheus praying before his coronation and hermione walking up the aisle to join him and i must reshoot carlos removing posas knife ive decided it would work better with a gun and the scene in the centre of the maze didnt work either too small and claustrophobic the unicorn glade is ringed with yew hedge we could fake it as the centre of the maze lets go and look said oscar helping himself to a second plate of scrambled eggs for the journey a yawning valentin brought a bottle and glasses as well see you in alf an our princess whispered sexton to hermione before belting after the others a thrush was singing joyfully night is over night is over had rannaldini deliberately grown roses up his nymphs to see thorns plunging cruelly into their naked flesh wondered rupert a faun leering wickedly out of ferns snaking above a water trough seemed to wink at him what are we going to do about that beattie johnson muttered sexton in an undertone if hermsie found out he hadnt been to eton shed drop him like an ot coal take her out said rupert george has some ideas well thrash it out after this noticing crows circling like vultures above the unicorn glade he quickened his step admiring the stone rabbits and hounds frolicking peacefully with cats and foxes amid the flowers but although the sun no longer cast a rosy glow the little white unicorn snorting and pawing in the centre had become a strawberry roan and eulalia in her flowing black robes resting against his raised head had become an hermaphrodite as the men moved closer they noticed an expression of terror grotesquely contorting her features then they realized it was her blood streaming over the unicorns noble head and running in rivulets down his shaggy mane his grooved horn had pierced through her back and was now rising from her belly like a bloodstained phallus jesus rupert was the first to speak its beattie shes finally stabbed herself in the back are you sure drawled oscar hastily refilling his glass draining it then filling it for valentin quite said rupert lifting her skirt as he had so often in the past look theres a cat tattooed on the inside of her left thigh to get into the part shes even dyed her bush black and green said oscar pointing to the handful of wild flowers beattie had earlier stuffed between her legs a little taperecorder had been attached to her thigh but the tape had been removed her spectacles are broken tristan picked up the buckled paneless granny glasses the resourceful ogborne never without a camera was taking pictures even of the ashen wolfgang throwing up into some mauve campanula shes also been shot said sexton walking round the body theres an exit wound big as a grapefruit on this side you all right he asked a returning wolfie who wiping his mouth on his sleeve looked terrified and absurdly young wolfie nodded heres a note he retrieved a grey crumpled piece of paper from some catmint meet me in the unicorn glade at one fifteen read rupert ill have that if you please mr campbellblack said gablecross firmly noone is to touch the body after weve searched miss johnsons room id like statements from all you gentlemen as gablecross and karen panted up the stairs they were met by helen in a coffeecoloured silk dressinggown and a frightful state i havent had a wink of sleep every light in the place has been blazing all night liberty productions are damn well going to pick up the bill eulalias phones been ringing all night too and her rooms locked so i cant get in to answer it its too bad after all the hospitality weve given her she was even more hysterical after beatties door had been broken down to find drink rings and cigarette burns all over the jacobean furniture black coffee spilt on the priceless persian rugs and scrumpled tissues all over the floor gablecrosss first impression was that beattie had done a runner except for an ashtray brimming over with fag ends her desk had been cleared there was no hard copy notebooks floppy disks tapes of interviews or telephone conversations all the drawers were empty in the bathroom however was a spongebag and a bottle of black hair dye as they discovered her computer smashed on the floor her mobile rang answer it snapped gablecross pretend youre beattie hi there purred karen where the fuck have you been it was the graveyard tones of gordon dillon and wheres the fucking copy what copy asked karen innocently stop playing games six thousand fucking words ive been trying to get you all night i hope you locked up the fucking memoirs what memoirs really reflected karen as a journalist mr dillon should know not to use the same adjective more than once on the same page rannaldinis for christs sake are you pissed theres nothing here something must have been saved on the machine nothing im afraid the computers been dropped and its entrails are spilling all over the floor you could consult them like the romans did they might tell you who killed rannaldini karens accent had slipped westward who the fucks that detective constable karen needham of rutminster cid and ignoring gablecrosss horrified expression and furiously waving hands im afraid a body has been found and miss beattie johnson appears to have been spiked like her rotten copy youll get fired roared gablecross no i wont said karen who could hardly speak for laughing gerry utterly loathed beattie once again gerald portland was absolutely hopping i put twenty men on night duty at valhalla he shouted at the emergency meeting three hours later and they spend all night drooling over gloria prescott stuffing themselves with roast pork and dont notice a socking great murder two hundred yards away well be a laughing stock and the scorpion will lynch us they are alleged to have paid a million for those memoirs theyre going to bill that fucking bitch as the greatest journalist since homer theyre offering fifty thousand for information leading to the capture of her murderer so noone will call us any more jesus portland had indeed been no lover of beattie while the rest of the media had nicknamed him pinup portland she had called him inspector portly just because hed gained a few pounds on a caribbean cruise and described his upwardly mobilized accent as so camp you could cut it with a boy scouts penknife how come none of you realized it was her he shouted at his team bloody good disguise guvnor dc lightfoot scratched his head could have sworn she was the spinster maidenaunt type id forget that line of reasoning if i were you snapped portland pathologist says shes got a vagina like the m i beg your pardon dc smithson pursed her lips as the men grinned so many people have been up and down stupid its very well worn its early days but the pathologist also reckons she was killed between one and two and had intercourse perhaps half an hour before that the plants stuffed up her vagina appear to contain some rare specimens mustard and cress giggled karen someone portland threw her a look of fond reproof appears to have bitten beatties shoulder we can dna that her specs were broken so were looking for fragments on the murderers clothes they had already found the murder weapon a chucked into the long grass by the devils stream it had been taken from props who has a key fanshawe asked everyone in that department but the prop master said the doors are often open all day it would be easy for the murderer to get a key cut its a singleshot gun he continued so the killer would not be expecting to miss itd been handled in filming during the auto da fe by baby and mikhail and covered in their prints which forensic are isolating it had been a pretty lively evening according to dc lightfoot what with the sightings of rannaldini and the filling in of bernards crossword which had gone off to the graphologist as a final act of defiance one of rannaldinis cigars had been found stubbed out in beatties ashtray wow sighed karen dyou think our murderers really dressing up as rannaldini and thats what terrified beattie she probably wrote worse things about him in her pieces for sunday than anyone else possible mused portland examining the note again meet me in the unicorn glade at one fifteen this was written by someone familiar with a keyboard its not a twofinger job who would have wanted to murder beattie everyone said portland with feeling if she had the memoirs and if she hadnt theyd all blabbed or been stitched up by her paddy ruperts racing crony on the sun had quickly been on to portland saying hed tipped off rupert and all the big names that eulalia was beattie just after twelve thirty sounded like a turkey farm in middecember paddy had added gleefully most of them were only too happy to give their side of the story for a consideration news travels so fast on a film set everyone must have known beattie was eulalia by the middle of the break still didnt give them much time to send her a note and murder her before they had to start work again said gablecross if the murderer had a master key said karen excitedly they could have let themselves into eulalias room much earlier discovered she was beattie and waited till friday just before she filed copy to kill her and whip the piece so they could get hold of as much sleaze as possible good girl said portland approvingly mrs brimscombe says beattie went out about ten thirty said dc lightfoot murderer could have nipped in then nicked all the stuff printed out the piece and left a note under the door risky said karen if beattie returned found the memoirs and disks missing and the piece run off she might have smelt a rat or two and not gone to the unicorn glade more likely said fanshawe dismissively anyone would have thought dc needham was running this meeting the murderer killed her then returned to her room fucked the computer having printed off and nicked beatties stuff then hidden that and returned to the set by one thirty as though nothing had happened unlikely it was as early as that said gablecross who was pissed off with karen but wasnt having anyone bullying her sylvestre the sound man who can hear mobiles three streets away heard a scream around one twenty and assumed it was some singer acting up but swears he heard a crash as late as one thirtyfive by which time most of them would have been back on the set not mr campbellblack said gablecross darkly he hates beattie most of all he pretended to see a ghost and buggered off to visit george hungerford or so he says they came back together both quite capable of putting out a contract on beattie tristan de montigny disappeared into the darkness with his mobile alpheus shaw gablecross pointed up at the unit photograph says he made a few phone calls in the production office where he was seen by mikhail then he returned to jasmine cottage for an early night baby says he was with flora immediately chloe gloria hermione et cetera learned it was beattie he continued they were trying to get on to her begging her not to shop them i imagine those were the phone calls lady rannaldini heard through the night she swears she had no idea that eulalia was beattie i think shes lying shes now shoved off to penscombe to stay with rupert and taggie sexton kemp rolled up on the set at four thirty funny time to be wandering around said fanshawe who was still hoping to nail hermione and sexton for the murder lucy latimer spent most of the evening giving dame hermione resprays rozzy pringle ferrying clean shirts very easy to come and go on a film set gablecross shook his head never use everyone at the same time better search their rooms said portland cant at the moment dc lightfoot looked at his watch theyll be sleeping they get wakeup calls around five funny old time for beattie to cop it mused portland missing the nationals then answering his telephone great thanks ill be along rubbing his hands he told his team theyve identified the fingerprints on the and the wheel marks in the field off rannaldinis drive but as portland left the room gablecross followed him into the corridor looking extremely sheepish could i have a word guvnor then pulling a letter and a bit of paper out of his inside pocket im afraid in the excitement of blowing clives safe i forgot id left this in my other jacket it was in french karens translated it having made a statement about beatties murder helen had left for penscombe this in turn left her maids betty and sally with more time on their hands they were so terrified of hearing rannaldinis cloak slithering along the corridors that they always worked as a pair now they were concerned about their beloved tristan he had always been so courteous and grateful filming all night caught up in admin all day he looked absolutely dreadful they had learnt never to touch his papers but after theyd emptied the ashtrays and removed the cups chewinggum papers and glasses on the morning of friday the thirteenth they decided to turn his mattresses noone deserved a good sleep more having worked at valhalla sally and betty were not easily fazed they had found strange sex toys in the past but were truly shocked to discover between tristans mattresses a little pornographic painting of their late master with a long whip in his hand flicking the lash round the neck of a beautiful girl never thought tristan was into sm muttered betty as they hastily remade the bed at lunchtime betty had a drink with fanshawe in the pearly gates and after the second vodka and bitter lemon confessed their finding blimey fanshawe had never downed a st clements faster belting back to the house gathering up sally on the way up in tristans bedroom they found the montigny had vanished i know it was here panted sally we saw the horrible thing tristan mustve come back seen youd cleaned the room and whipped pardon the pun the evidence said fanshawe but all was not lost his eyes lit on a pair of offwhite chinos and a bottlegreen polo shirt lying newly ironed on the bed when were those washed first thing monday morning replied sally we always go round the rooms gathering up the washing even on the morning after he was murdered and everyone was flapping around because tristan hadnt come back wolfie said itd be better if we kept to our routine gablecross and karen were both dreading their next interview it coincided with an unexpected hailstorm which had sent the press racing for shelter lucys caravan was empty they found her rescuing a meadow brown from the stony deluge and setting it down under the protection of a hawthorn bush her days sleep had been wrecked by flickering nightmares of rannaldini by a restless james barking at prowling police and paparazzi and by her churning misery that tristan as never before had not apologized for bitching at her her eyes were red and swollen her skin shiny and unhealthily sallow her dark brown curls in need of a wash but her smile was welcoming and she was still thought gablecross easily the most attractive woman on the unit he and karen accepted cups of tea but neither had the stomach for battenburg cake james hates marzipan too said lucy going back to sticking polaroids into a scrapbook with toupee tape initially the questions were innocuous what had she been doing in the break had she noticed anything odd i didnt really have time to notice anything sweet little kids karen admired lucys nieces round the mirror as she took out her notebook at first when it spun glittering gold on the table lucy thought gablecross had thrown down a coin then she realized it was a signet ring had she seen it before of course its tristans mottos in french know what it means for a second lucy looked at the chained hissing serpent peering at the tiny words beneath if you disturb the montigny snake she said slowly the montigny snake will come looking for you ie leave us alone and we wont hassle you rannaldini didnt leave tristan alone did he careful thought lucy not realizing she had stuck hermione in upside down take a look at this said gablecross we found it in rannaldinis safe the same snake crest headed the yellowing sheet of writing paper beneath was an exquisite little drawing of two entwined lovers the writing was so beautiful you were inclined to believe anything it told you my french is hopeless she mumbled heres a translation said karen my dear rannaldini read lucy as the colour drained slowly out of her face she forced her other hand to grab and ground the frantically shaking hand holding the letter so it was true she whispered before she could stop herself what said gablecross sharply nothing stammered lucy that étienne confided in rannaldini so much come come those two were friends for thirty years étiennes paintings are all over the house you can do better than that obscene incestuous union i can never bring myself to love him étienne clearly wasnt tristans dad was that why tristan killed rannaldini dont be ridiculous lucy glanced up at gablecrosss square bullying ruthless face why did he lie that he wasnt back in valhalla on sunday night whys he refusing a dna test he was clearly in shock when he finally rolled up on monday that was something else we believe he killed rannaldini and then beattie because he was terrified of the truth coming out his fingerprints are all over the gun that killed beattie they cant be whimpered lucy in terror oh please he was in shock not because he killed rannaldini but because when he reeled home rapturous goofy from making love for the first time to tab her voice broke rannaldini sent for him and told him this horrific thing that he wasnt a montigny at all and far far worse that his mad brute of a grandfather on the other side had raped delphine his mother because he was so wildly jealous that shed married étienne the result was tristan there it was out karen winced gablecross whistled wow so that was it thank you miss latimer please dont tell anyone you forced it out of me gabbled lucy in desperate agitation oh god what had she done you know how proud tristan is of being a montigny how naturally aristocratic he had no mother to bring him up étienne was so cold and dismissive his great arrogant family of brothers all got preferential treatment unlike them tristan got nothing personal in the will being a montigny was all he had to cling on to she picked up the signet ring maxim delphines father was sectioned and a violent psychopath according to rannaldini tristans so honourable he felt that as a result he shouldnt have children the hailstorm had turned to rain weeping down the windows there was such a long pause that lucy stumbled into more revelations im sure rannaldini made the whole thing up probably forged this letter he was crawlingly obsessed with tab he couldnt bear tristan near her hed have made up anything to stop him probably why tristan killed him why did he lie about bottling out of his favourite aunties eightysixth birthday party cant you understand pleaded lucy she wasnt his auntie if he was no longer a montigny any more than simone was his niece or his brothers his brothers hed have felt a fraud at that party and he claimed to have spent all night in his car ive told you about that lucys voice was rising he was exhausted everyone drains him this film has been so awful the next one now his roots have been severed was all he had an embarrassed upset james had curled up almost as small as tristans signet ring which gablecross was holding up to the light he dropped this beside rannaldinis body i dont believe it he hadnt worn that ring for ages it was so loose it kept falling off beside rannaldinis dead body intoned gablecross the montigny snake went looking for rannaldini and coiled itself round his neck until it squeezed the life out of him no no lucy clapped her hands over her ears same reason he stole the snake charmer course he didnt betty and sally found it under his mattress on thursday by the time theyd alerted a police officer hed whipped it rannaldini was going to publish a copy of the painting in his memoirs tristan couldnt cope with a pornographic photograph of his mum being on display so he killed rannaldini and beattie no no lucy burst into tears head on the table clenching and unclenching her hands cooee cooee said a voice it was chloe avid with excitement eyes swivelling reeking of the same beautiful scent i hope youre not bullying darling lucy tim shes got a long night ahead and i dont want my lipliner looking like an ishealive ishedead heartrate in intensive care leaving lucys caravan on the way back to the car park both feeling sick gablecross and karen saw a lone figure slumped at a table outside the canteen and realized it was wolfie can we join you asked karen slipping into the chair beside him you can arrest me if you like mumbled wolfie why shouldnt i have killed my father he left me nothing and stole the only two girls ive ever loved his teeth were chattering frantically its all right lad gablecross patted the boys shoulder your dad had cameras and bugs installed in every room even at magpie cottage tabitha never posed for him i could swear it and went on karen taking wolfies hand im sure he left you nothing because he was jealous of you wolfie raised incredulous swollen bloodshot eyes because tab liked you so much added gablecross i read it in the memoirs papa was jealous of me suddenly wolfie was grinning from pink ear to pink ear because of tab certainly was said karen it was you she turned to after he raped her but wolfie wasnt listening i dont give a stuff about the money i can earn my own tabs the only thing i care about then getting to his feet and going somewhat unsteadily towards the bar lets have a drink the only problem he added wryly is that shes madly in love with tristan still its a start over in his caravan tristan had neither been to bed nor had a moment to rejoice over the ecstatic reviews flooding in for the lily in the valley there had been so much to do someone had nicked alpheuss white suit from wardrobe the stolen to kill beattie had had to be replaced helen had gone ballistic about the electricity bill and been ringing all day from penscombe mr brimscombe had gone equally ballistic because the police had trampled over all his flowers rupert and george who were all buddybuddy now kept wanting to have meetings about polo shoots he tried to work out tonights reshoot of the attempted murder of eboli an action sequence that required multiple angles and shots so it could be edited to look fast it would have been complicated even in the unicorn glade this however was now giftwrapped in red and white ribbon and crawling with scenesofcrime officers so theyd have to go back to filming in the centre of the maze then there would be several hours spent lighting alpheuss nose before he prayed in the chapel but at least that was an interior which wouldnt be sabotaged by any sunrise tristan was reeling from tiredness then another hammerblow struck dupont had rung to say that aunt hortense had been diagnosed with cancer of the pancreas which could finish her off at any moment she was heavily drugged and hardly conscious down at the château in the tarn tristan was devastated hortense might not be his real aunt any more but she was all he had he had been saddened and amazed to hear how upset shed been that hed cut her party perhaps she was a little fond of him but he had been too traumatized by events to call her to apologize the moment they finished shooting tomorrow hed fly out to toulouse he felt his world crumbling if she died before he got there hed never discover if rannaldini had been telling the truth she keeps asking for you chided dupont tristan also felt bitterly ashamed that he wished hortense had waited until hed finished shooting to decide to die visions of beatties stinking impaled body swam before his eyes he felt himself retching just like rushhour on the piccadilly line grumbled chloe as most of the unit including several plainclothes policemen squeezed into the centre of the maze ouch someone goosed me only my brolly bad luck boomed griselda everyone giggled nervously quiet please roared bernard who knew if they were standing next to the murderer shirts already soaked in sweat were additionally drenched by the towering rainsoaked yew walls even tristan was wearing his directors cap back to front to stop the drips running down his neck now i know how labs feel when theyre rammed into their kennel after a wet days shooting grumbled griselda the shooting ees to come said mikhail admiring his everyone else shivered and tried to read rozzys copy of the evening scorpion killed in action said a huge headline above an incredibly glamorous photograph of beattie there were endless delays the moon sailing through an archipelago of angry indigo clouds was making lighting a nightmare are we going to have problems with those police helicopters tristan asked sylvestre music should blot them out but well have to watch the long pauses theyd just finished rehearsing when the crush was intensified by ruperts arrival as one who believed one should get back on to a horse immediately after a fall he had dragged along a reluctant scowling tab wolfie promptly dropped tristans shooting script in the mud which went unnoticed by tristan who also felt his heart fail tab looked so thin so pale so impossibly ferociously adorable griselda hugged her which made tab scowl more than ever how ridiculous were overcrowded enough as it is hissed rozzy as she turned over a page of the scorpion to find a large picture taken years ago of rupert arm in arm with beattie friend of the famous said the caption having left tab in the care of an utterly tonguetied wolfie rupert pushed off to talk to sexton the only thing that had driven her out of the house tab hissed to lucy was the arrival of helen she insisted mrs bodkin unpack for her then grumbled she couldnt find anything then pushed taggies divine food round her plate all lunch going on and on about beattie and nurturing a viper in her bosom daddy said any selfrespecting viper would die of malnutrition trying to survive on all that silicone hes such a bitch but he does make me laugh oh god luce isnt tristan divine im not cured at all glancing surreptitiously across at tab tristan found her gazing at him with such longing it burnt him he mustnt weaken if only he could bring himself to explain about maxim stand by to shoot shouted bernard well have to wait thirty seconds for this cloud tristan called oscar lowering his viewfinder from his eye oh heres timothy i wonder if his wife liked her present said rozzy as gablecross karen and two uniformed men with their hats on forced their way in the grand inquisitor sang baby then as the music died in the speakers he launched into a policemans lot is not a happy one happy one hello tim cooed chloe kissing him on both cheeks tristan de montigny began gablecross furiously wiping off lipstick oh go away said tristan irritably were about to shoot tristan de montigny repeated gablecross sternly you are being arrested on suspicion of the murders of roberto rannaldini and beatrice johnson you dont have to say anything but you may harm your defence if you fail to mention when questioned something you rely on in court anything you say may be given in evidence there was a scream from rozzy and a rumble of horror that rose to a roar no thought lucy in dread i shopped him only the people hemming her in kept her from fainting as chests were thrust out in outrage and the moon went in again the maze seemed even more terrifyingly claustrophobic you cannot arrest me said tristan haughtily i am making a film and i have to fly out first thing tomorrow to toulouse where my aunt is seriously ill and thats the last wed see of you matey thought gablecross unfortunately thats irrelevant he said youve been arrested on suspicion of murder at least we finish the scene said bernard firmly there was a murmur of assent gablecross looked round at the solid phalanx of crew muscular arms folded like a rugger team blocking any escape and felt there was no way an english lorry could get through a french blockade stand by to shoot nice and quiet behind the camera called bernard up started the strings out sailed the moon gablecross had to admire the professionalism particularly tristans roll sound turn camera he said quietly standing there as if without a care in the world never taking his eyes off his singers eboli with heavy sarcasm was now attacking elisabettas hypocrisy for posing as a virtuous wife when she was all the time having an affaire with carlos until mikhail whipped out his spinning it over and over like a hired killer the yew walls seemed to expand as people flattened themselves against them suppose the gun was loaded then baby leapt forward squeezing mikhails hand like a dogs muzzle why dyou hesitate taunted chloe yellow eye flashing everyone jumped as the clattered to the ground lucy felt her eyes filling with tears of despair as mikhail begged baby to hand over to him any incriminating papers he might be carrying to stop them falling into the hands of the inquisition to you the favourite of the king sang baby in bitter irony it is the only moment in the opera when carlos doubts posas loyalty mercifully no helicopters interrupted the long long pause then puppylike carlos became all apology handing over his important papers not realizing he was fatally incriminating his friend before falling into his arms the acting had been so wonderful that for those few moments people had forgotten the murders as the entire orchestra pounded out the friendship theme lucy frantically mopped her eyes i have betrayed my friend she thought in agony cut that was perfect tristan told everyone well done if the gates clear print well wrap now call a weekend break said bernard who was quivering with rage and by then youll be bailed i may not you oscar and valentin know exactly what to do taking off his directors cap tristan plonked it on bernards head nows your chance to play truffaut then he kissed bernard on both cheeks handed him his shooting script and added with a break in his voice here are my important papers finally he turned to gablecross mockingly holding out two clenched fists put on the handcuffs ogborne and the crew closed in menacingly but when tristan shook his head they fell back all this was too much for tab with a scream of rage she flew at gablecross hammering him with her fists hes innocent you stupid asshole tristan wouldnt hurt a fly you just need a conviction yesterday you thought id killed rannaldini with some justification murmured chloe once you get him into that horrible place went on tab hysterically youll trick him into a confession bébé bébé stop it please tristan turned back in anguish and pulled tab off gablecross a second later she had fallen against him sobbing pitifully its all right his arms closed round her i didnt do it i promise for a second he laid his ashen face against her pale hair and they clung to each other like souls in torment mr de montigny said gablecross not unkindly tristan searched the appalled often weeping faces for one he could trust lucy please look after her but as he was led away tab had to be prised off by wolfie hell be ok lucy made heroic attempts to sound convincing how dyou know screamed tab its all a terrible mistake reassured wolfie how dyou bloody know either tab was about to fly at him when she caught sight of the photograph of beattie and her father stop reading that shit she snatched rozzys newspaper and tore it to shreds before storming like eboli out of the maze she found her father heaping abuse on gablecross timdimbutnotatallnice strikes again he yelled then turning to tristan dont worry well bail you first thing tomorrow having poured so much money into don carlos there was no way rupert was going to lose his director before filming was completed poor poor tristan but also poor me sighed sexton they were insured against violent death but not against the director murdering the producer although it must be a fairly frequent occurrence he had better get on to the backers to reassure them as tristan vanished into a police car which in turn vanished under a black tidal wave of press hermione could be heard complaining its very inconsiderate of timothy my last night on the set a most taxing scene who will now give me direction the wrong mans been arrested screamed tab cant you think of anyone but yourself she picked up valentins discarded plate of porridge and was about to ram it in hermiones perfectly madeup face when wolfie grabbed her wrist pack it in youre behaving like a stupid child im not stupid why dont you do something to help tristan rather than standing round like a stuck pig after that rupert took her home there was no time to think then until alpheus and hermiones little scene in the chapel was safely in the can but as dawn broke on tristans first morning behind bars wolfie realized lucy was missing he found her sobbing in make up it was my fault he was arrested i let out his terrible secret she didnt want to hurt wolfie by revealing his fathers part in it but she had to tell someone she could trust wolfie was totally practical as soon as we get away tomorrow were going to france to track down aunt hortense and the truth well take the gulf and leave before anyone finds weve gone gerald portland had been determined to fight off any takeover by scotland yard they hear the west country burr he said furiously and think were turnipheads down here pressure from the media and the public not to mention those viragos in their newly printed i loved rannaldini tshirts who were doorstepping rutminster police station had been so intense that portland had rushed gablecross into making an arrest before he had sufficiently gathered his evidence fortunately by the time tristan had been booked in and his clothes including his beloved peacockblue shirt had been whisked off to forensic and hed been forcibly dnatested by having a cotton bud rammed under his tongue and stripsearched christ did you theenk i had beatties floppy deesks shoved up my ass it was too late to start questioning him tristan meanwhile had been transformed into a snarling wild animal the final indignity was when he was forced to redress himself in the nadir of chic a papery white boilersuit i am totally eenocent of murder but not for much longer he yelled as the custody officer rammed him in a tiny cell with only a single mattress on a low flat board for a bed and one small frostedglass window but at least it had its own bog and he was so exhausted and so relieved not to have to brief hermione that not even the arrival of a caterwauling drunk at three in the morning which he thought for a hideous moment might be mikhail roused him for long from the best nights sleep hed had in months prisoners must be checked every twenty minutes the hatch on tristans door was going up every twenty seconds as women officers and secretaries made flimsy excuses to visit the cells winnie the polish cleaner only four foot ten who had once cornered an escaping serial killer with her squeegee mop was continually standing on top of her upturned bucket to peer in hes getting better viewing figures than four weddings and a funeral grumbled ds fanshawe all this at least gave gablecross a chance to work out his line of questioning and gain three hours sleep beside a tightlipped margaret before a quick briefing of the inner cabinet we think weve got our man announced portland application has been made to the french justices to search montignys flat in paris police have already raided his rooms in valhalla where they found a packed case so he may have been going to do a runner then turning to gablecross and karen he said sternly just remember montignys got to cope with what hes done dont try to traumatize him any further youre not there to trick him just unlock his memory never underestimate the blackest villains longing to be thought well of so dont be judgemental or hostile are you hearing me tim all you want to know is what happened and how it came about let me get at him muttered gablecross get us a curl of his hair karen whispered debbie miller karen was terribly nervous it was the first time shed had to interrogate a murderer the minute theyd exhausted a fortyfiveminute tape gerry portland would seize a copy for a listen it was suddenly so set in stone it scared her that as the interviewing officers she and gablecross had priority and could order members of the investigating team to follow up leads for them but karen was not as nervous as tristan when he woke up and reality kicked in it was not just backstothewall but shoulders rammed against the skeleton cupboard the lock of which gablecross would soon be relentlessly picking christ he had so much to hide how could he hold together a brain disintegrating like a paper handkerchief in the bath he had refused a lawyer there was no way he wanted grey desiccated dupont jetting over at thousands of francs an hour crying crocodile tears then telling his brothers and all paris now i know why étienne rejected the boy all tristan wanted for the moment was a telephone nearly giving the duty officer monitoring his call a coronary as he broke into rapid french to find out how last nights shoot had gone surprisingly well according to bernard theyd finished all the cover shots and ruperts briefing of hermione walk up the sodding aisle and kneel down beside that american dickhead had been terse but effective bernard admired rupert more and more particularly when this piece of information made tristan laugh but only until hed asked for news of hortense drifting in and out of consciousness but sinking fast im afraid ive gotta get out of here raged tristan dont worry ruperts been on to the french ambassador and the home secretary half the night are you ok mon enfant well noones tugging out my toenails or threatening to burn me at the stake he had regained his cool by the time he entered the interview room which was windowless oblong furnished with only a square black table and chairs and he remarked almost as minimalist as his flat in paris karen giggled gablecross rolled up his sleeves loosened his tie and switched on the tapemachine which clung to one of the cracked walls like a leech to relax him karen at first asked him about his childhood drawing him out on hoary old hortense on the hostility of his father on his admiration for laurent the freedom fighter who never squealed under torture and on rannaldinis affection which had done so much to dispel tristans sense of failure as a son then making sterling efforts not to sound hostile gablecross switched to the day of rannaldinis murder and tristan told the same story how hed returned in the middle of sunday driven round the forest of dean looking for locations in particular the final scene when hercules rip up enough oak trees to build his own funeral pyre like films about fires do you asked gablecross casually have you any idea how rannaldinis watchtower caught fire i tell you i was miles away in dean forest he had bought a halfbottle of brandy at an offlicence he added but had lost the tab and had slept in a field i need peace for three months to avoid importuning courtiers i scuttle down passages like louis xiv i was unhappy with rannaldinis opening and ending they were too selfindulgent i needed to plot my campaign what was the field like tristan shrugged just a field what were you wearing when you came through the channel tunnel on sunday careful thought tristan a blue shirt and jeans how dyou explain this then karen produced an evening standard photograph obviously snapped by some fan of tristan in a bottlegreen polo shirt and offwhite chinos outside his car in dover maybe i was wearing that i dont notice clothes i search for trouser for five minutes yesterday morning before i find i had them on tristan smiled helplessly the lovable eccentric gablecross wasnt beguiled betty says before you left for paris on saturday you were looking everywhere for that blue shirt which sally knowing it was a favourite had whipped to mend a rip in the shoulder and sew on more buttons she left the shirt washed and ironed on your bed on sunday morning on monday morning before you got back it had gone and both sally and betty found your white chinos and green polo shirt in the dirtyclothes basket tristan raised his eyes to heaven they drag clothes off me rozzy too they ave millions of clothes to wash how can they remember the days you didnt drop into paradise to change certainly not he darent light a cigarette in case his hand shook but just as betty and sally had lovingly chronicled the progress of his clothes so two village groupies with binoculars had seen his dark blue aston parked in a secluded field down rannaldinis drive wheelmarks had been found here traces of similar plants hemlock water dropwort and lesser rosewort had been found on tristans wheels they probably flower in dean forest said tristan vaguely as he started to sketch karen the damson bloom of her skin even under the fluorescent light was exquisite the lesser rosewort is only indigenous to rutshire snapped gablecross round and round went the wheels of the tape taking down evidence to be used against him underneath the outward languor hes shitscared thought gablecross tristan expressed no surprise that his prints were all over the murder weapon i was unhappy with the scene id shot earlier we use knife while everyone sleep on thursday afternoon i took gun from props and try out hand movements in front of big mirror in my room having replaced it and the key i type memo on production writing paper saying i need as well as carloss important papers for reshoot on friday night and leave it in jessicas intray at first tristan deflected every question coolly he was enchanted by the recovery of his lalique lilypatterned lighter which he explained had been a present from the crew after the lily in the valley and which had vanished from his desk last week and his signet ring which hed lost on the night of the auto da fe i lose weight it must have slipped off hes lying thought gablecross there was no way that shiny ring had been exposed to the elements for nearly three weeks both lighter and ring were found near rannaldinis body in hangmans wood he said careful thought tristan for the hundredth time i must ave dropped them when i went to see rannaldini previous you often walk in the woods of course i am man in love with the dark i spent my childhood in cinemas or watching videos with curtains drawn your crèmedementheflavoured chewinggum was also found near the body anyone could have peenched that i leave packs everywhere my dear detective sergeant tristan yawned so hard he nearly put his jaw out i have been working on film about murder for nearly a year i am not so stupid i litter possessions round rannaldinis body like millais sower and leave my prints all over murder weapon someone is framing me any idea who probably rannaldini from the grave at one moment he nearly fell asleep i am bored talking about myself cant we talk about you sergeant or more excitingly you he smiled at karen who blushed despite the overwhelming evidence she kept praying tristan hadnt done it he was so glamorous she admired the flawless bone structure beneath the smooth olive skin the curls dark as winter dusk the greyhound grace exaggerated by the tenpound weightloss and he was so polite opening doors when she went out leaping to his feet when she came back when he wasnt pacing up and down he was drawing or scribbling why dyou keep making notes she asked to stop me going crazy i am in last stage of making film its like a marathon winner being dragged away ten yards from the tape worst still greatest scene in don carlos takes place in prison eef only i had had these experiences to draw on when i direct it the claustrophobia moths concussing themselves against overhead light the tiny cell that makes carloss dungeon look like trafalgar square how much more realistic would i have made the grand inquisitor he glared at gablecross who refusing to rise proceeded to take tristan in minute detail through the early hours of friday the thirteenth what did you do during the break caught between hermione and rupert with everyone rowing and running off on wildghost chase i have orrible migraine and need strong pills to zap it i go back to the house even more orrible i see eulalia arrison approach down southwing landing since she arrive she hassle me for interview and plus so i leap behind big cupboard you should have told her you had a migraine said gablecross sardonically tristan almost smiled she goes into her room i hide in mine and take pills they were called imogram you didnt call anyone certainly not tristan steeled himself to look gablecross in the eyes making a note to check the lack of calls with his mobile company karen asked what had happened to the rest of the imogram in my room or maybe i put them in jeans pocket i heard eulalia leave room some time after one then i must have dropped off because a crash wake me like medicine cupboard falling off wall i looked at my watch realized to my horror it was two oclock less twentyfive minutes and race back to the set there is evidence intercourse took place before beattie died did you give her one like james emerging from the lake tristan gave an exaggerated shudder it would have been easier to kill than fuck her the tape ran out every time there was a break one tape was sealed untouched in case it was needed in court knowing portland would be listening acutely to the other karen was relieved she wasnt interviewing tristan alone hearing his heartbreakingly husky voice she increasingly couldnt concentrate for wondering what he would be like in bed imagining that wonderful sulky mouth kissing hers the long powerful body crushing her own violent images god she must pull herself together his body language told her nothing he sat very still never pulled faces fiddled with his hair licked his lips or blinked even in that white paper boilersuit he looked like a hopelessly glamorous intern in a hospital soap he had drawn a beautiful picture turning her into a fawn and was working on a crosslooking warthog what were you asking me he drawled insolently was he really so tired that he forgot a question before he could answer it she wondered or was he playing for time at midmorning on saturday wolfie popped into rutminster police station bringing tristan a running order for mondays polo shoot and a sprig of honeysuckle from lucy hearing during a break in interrogations that hed been in gablecross had huge delight in ordering fanshawe and debbie miller to drive out to valhalla and check a few of tristans statements with wolfie rolling up at valhalla however a fuming fanshawe and debbie were greeted by rozzy devastated about tristans arrest and begging them to take a posy of gentians a picnic of quiche chicken breasts peaches and a thermos of proper coffee back to the station for his lunch i cant get away sergeant fanshawe i have to dogsit for lucy james looking unbelievably bootfaced was taking up wardrobes entire sofa wheres lucy gone demanded fanshawe away with wolfie said rozzy in a worried voice she wouldnt tell me where but shes taken her passport everyone on the unit has been ordered not to leave the country said fanshawe in outrage even a furious oscar and valentin had had to forgo their bastille day jaunt i begged her wailed rozzy oh when are they going to let poor tristan out when he starts levelling with us said fanshawe youve no idea where lucys gone to have a nice break with that yummy wolfgang giggled debbie gablecross will be choked he thinks shes gorgeous outside rutminster police station television vans and the cars of the press desperate for news clogged up the weekend traffic like autumn leaves time had ceased to have any meaning tapes and breaks came and went antagonism intensified between gablecross and tristan who had drawn a whole family of bullying warthogs in the airless room the shadows deepened beneath all their eyes gerald portland still listening to the tapes was stepping up the pressure show him his dads letter ask him about the montigny tell him we cant find any migraine pills or memos about pistols in anyones outtray and if that doesnt work tell him theyve trashed his flat in paris and found some interesting stuff karen switched on the tape again have you seen this painting before she waved the photograph of the snake charmer just beautiful gablecross examined delphines naked body give me that howled tristan but as he dived across the desk gablecrosss pudgy fingers closed over the photograph not so fast baby boy betty and sally found the original under your mattress on thursday for christs sake what more lies are they going to tell i never saw that painting except in rannaldinis watchtower in film we are making philip search for letters under elisabettas mattress if i was going to steal painting i would hide it somewhere more subtle rannaldini was going to publish the photo it says chapter four myself when young on the back wonder if he gave her one you didnt want a porn pickie of your mum doing the rounds did you of course i fucking didnt shouted tristan draining a paper cup of black coffee as if it were whisky and fumbling for a gauloise tabitha campbellblack was distraught when you were arrested why did you blow her out the morning after you got off with her was this anything to do with it as gablecross threw down a copy of étiennes letter with the crest of the chained serpent tristan let out a hiss far deeper and more venomously fearful than any snake rannaldini disturbed the montigny snake didnt he persisted gablecross was that why you went looking for him there were signetring marks on his neck i told you i lost it ages ago dyou know what this is a letter from my father to rannaldini but was he your father what does he mean about your being the product of an obscene incestuous union gablecross lingered brutally on the words and saying as a result he could never love you ive no idea shaking violently tristan stubbed out his hardly smoked cigarette his face was foggrey his eyes darting with terror karen longed to take his hand was that why you cut auntie hortenses party because you werent a montigny any more no was your mad granddad your father was that the secret rannaldini had discovered who told you that tristan went berserk lunging across the table catching gablecross by the shoulders shaking him who fucking told you the duty officer would have intervened at this juncture if he hadnt gone flat on his back slipping on winnies overpolished floor outside the interview room stop it shouted karen she didnt mean to blurt it out she for a second tristan froze then releasing gablecrosss shoulders he turned on karen which she we dont reveal our sources she mumbled jolted by the horror and incredulity in tristans eyes it was lucy she was the only one who knew she was only trying to explain why you were so traumatized stammered karen you stupid bitch sighed gablecross tristan slumped on his chair how could lucy he repeated dully it was as though horatio had betrayed hamlet or posa his beloved friend carlos after that the fight went out of tristan rannaldini showed me the letter he told gablecross and i lose everything i look at great beech trees posed like divers on edge of cotswold bank i ask myself how they stand so towering and beautiful they can hold up the sky it is because their roots like steel pipes go deep into the earth rannaldini sawed through my roots that night putting his head in his hands he groaned he wreck my picture he wreck any hope with tabitha he want to publish disgusting painting of my mother for gods sake i thought he loved me karen fought back the tears he was jealous said gablecross gently echoing the words he had said to wolfie he treated you appallingly glancing up in anguish tristan noticed for the first time the understanding and compassion in gablecrosss eyes the longheaded legend you were doing a public service lad ridding the world of rannaldini went on gablecross almost caressingly there was a long pause just the faint whisper of the turning tapes and the sound of a latenight drunk kicking a beer can along a pavement then tristan realized he was being set up i am not that publicspirited he said flatly and continued to deny everything if youre not prepared to help yourself snarled gablecross as his cell door banged and he was left alone with the script of hercule which he would never now make tristan was kneed in the groin by desolation he thought of aunt hortense gasping her last of sunflowers cicadas frogs and tractors their lights going back and forth like low shooting stars in the night hed never see her or france again the honeysuckle was filling his cell with sweetness like lucys slow shy warm smile since he had been in prison the thought of her had kept drifting into his brain like an aria now he couldnt trust her any more with a sob of despair he picked up the sprig of honeysuckle and ripped it to pieces lucy was speechless with admiration for the way wolfie calmly hijacked rannaldinis gulf and ignoring furiously waving policemen and ground staff flew off to the southwest of france i learnt to fly before i could walk he explained grisel saw us leaving so the whole unit will think weve sloped off for a dirty weekend cause a lot of gossip let it said wolfie cheerfully might make tabitha jealous valhalla had been hot but the midi seemed a hundred times hotter the wind blowing like a hairdryer about to fuse whipped lucys curls into a frenzy now i know how a frozen chicken feels when its shoved into the microwave she grumbled stupid from lack of sleep she was passionately grateful for the cool efficiency with which wolfie hired a car located the village of montvert and booked into its best hotel appropriately named la reconnaissance having departed in such haste lucy was dismayed she hadnt packed deodorant a hairbrush or base to tone down her shiny increasingly flushed face at least well get a decent dinner this evening said the everpractical wolfie who was consulting the menu and the wine list as she came down and theres the château he added pointing up at the disdainful back of a large grey house nestling in woodland on top of the hill the montigny family never forgave the villagers for burning the place down during the french revolution said lucy as they got back into the hired car and she eased her bare legs gingerly on to the scorching leather seat when the family returned from exile they pointedly built the new château facing away from the village and overlooking the pyrenees oh what a sweet dog can i ring rozzy to ask if james is ok certainly not shed want to know where we were and promptly grass to her friend gablecross we dont want interpol muscling in anyway well be back tomorrow as wolfie swung off the main road and headed for the mountains lucy groped for her dark glasses to ward off the dazzling golden glare of the sunflower fields am i too underdressed she asked nervously glancing down at her orange tshirt and grey shorts hortense sounds a martinet tristan says shes been having little heartattacks for ages growing more and more eccentric she used to play golf with the duke of windsor and once smashed a louis xiv chandelier demonstrating some iron shot evidently she cuts up le monde every morning and lays all the stories she wants to read on chairs so noone can sit down shell need a fleet of sofas to accommodate the coverage of tristans arrest said wolfie probably been kept away from her if shes so ill i do hope shell see us tristan also said she was terribly mean the estates next to a golf course and she rushes out grabs any lost balls and wraps them up for her nieces and nephews for christmas tristan realized she was losing it last birthday when she sent him a blackboard with the letters of the alphabet round the frame wolfie stopped lucys rattling by asking her irritably if she remembered everything tristan had ever told her probably lucy flushed an even more unbecoming shade of red wolfie noticed the anguished way she glanced at every farmbuilding they passed as if she was expecting some horrific content of battery hen or veal calf oh no she wailed as he slowed down behind a lorry theyve got lambs in there i bet they havent been watered for yonks nearly removing the side of the hired car as he shortened her misery by overtaking the lorry wolfie snapped that shed got to toughen up you cant suffer for every squashed earwig in this world hortense suffered protested lucy she claimed that the best years of her life were spent fighting for the resistance despite being captured and tortured by the bloody krauts oh wolfie im sorry im used to it said wolfie calmly then catching sight of two fat men towing trolleys and sweating in plusfours heres the golf course and theres the château to repel intruders two hissing stone montigny snakes were chained to the pillars on either side of the big iron gates ahead at the end of an avenue of limes and flanked by ancient arthritic oaks stood a grey square house with its pale grey shutters closed against prying eyes and the afternoon sun the good news was that all hortenses greedy relations had temporarily pushed off to another family house in brittany to celebrate the sixtyfifth birthday of tristans eldest brother alexandre the judge with them leaving the coast even clearer had gone the even greedier dupont who was already carrioncrowing at the prospect of a large cut of hortenses estate the bad news was that hortense whod kept such iron control of her life was now lying upstairs under a mosquito net morphinised up to the eyeballs recognizing noone yesterday she was convinced the bolsheviks had taken over the château sighed florence the kind plump housekeeper who was almost as old as her mistress today the nazis have moved in and shes back in the resistance so im afraid you wont be very welcome she added apologetically to wolfie but tristan could be in prison for life begged lucy the police think he killed rannaldini to stop him spreading some vicious tale about his parentage if she hadnt seen a flicker of fear in florences faded grey eyes lucy might not have persisted hortense is the only person who might know the truth she went on please let me stay in case she regains consciousness florence was wavering when there was an imperious skidding crunch in the gravel and rupert resplendent in a pale yellow suit and grey striped shirt emerged from a cloud of dust and a hired mercedes apparently unaffected by the heat he made lucy feel plainer and hotter than ever what are you doing here she snapped resisting arrest disobeying the orders of gablecross casing the joint bonjour madame slipping into effortless french rupert turned all his charm on florence absolutely bloody typical fumed lucy shell take one look and roll over but fortunately it seemed that aunt hortense loathed men particularly those who looked like blond luftwaffe pilots almost as much as germans rupert was sent packing as summarily as wolfie lucy who was allowed to stay on for a little while couldnt hide a suspicion that both men were glad of an excuse to escape well go back to la reconnaissance and chivvy ambassadors said rupert sauntering towards the mercedes join us for dinner if you can get away well leave everything in your loyal hands quoted the everpragmatic wolfie clearly delighted at a chance to ingratiate himself with tabithas father frantic with thirst lucy gulped down a whole jug of orange pressé heat was coming in great waves through the kitchen window only endless sprinklers kept the garden green beyond like purple shagpile stretched fields of lavender once the maid had disappeared to shop in montvert florence relented and got out the family scrapbooks shed kept since tristan was a little boy it wrung lucys heart to see him always hovering at the edge of family groups like an outfielder desperate not to miss a smile that miraculously étienne might one day throw him at least the later scrapbooks were crowded with tristans cuttings florence had already pasted in the marvellous reviews of the lily in the valley dominated by the luminous beauty of claudine lauzerte to stop herself falling asleep lucy begged to be given a tour of the house downstairs big high rooms papered in cranberry reds prussian blues and deep snuff browns were the ideal setting for the impressionist collection acquired ahead of fashion in the late nineteenth century and for étiennes great powerful oils but not to lighten the heart of a little boy everywhere frayed tapestries of hunting scenes hung above cabinets lovingly painted with fruit flowers and birds leggy gold tables and chairs seemed poised to race through the french windows into a park shimmering with heathaze you couldnt see the mountains for dust the great hall housed the family portraits that was louis who died at crécy and edouard who was wounded at agincourt and theres blaize florence ran her finger inside the frame to test for dust who died in spain on a secret mission he was murdered by the spanish inquisition lucy peered at blaize in excitement handsome hawkfaced with dark cynical watchful eyes he was definitely a montigny and one of the reasons tristan had embarked on don carlos and theres henri painted by david said florence proudly such a great general that napoleon coaxed him out of exile to fight at austerlitz and borodino the montignys have always been a great military family soldiercitizens of the world like posa thought lucy tristans brother laurent was brave wasnt he more hotheaded said florence somewhat disapprovingly a piednoir builder fell off a ladder here one day madame hortense rang six doctors but none would treat him laurent jumped in the jeep drove to the nearest put a shotgun to his temple and didnt remove it until hed come back and set the leg how romantic sighed lucy no wonder tristan heroworships his memory why isnt there a painting of him florence glanced round nervously laurents portrait had hung in the hall she admitted smiling a welcome to everyone coming through the front door but étienne was so devastated when he was killed the painting was locked away with everything else in his room but surely after étiennes death protested lucy he left instructions in his will that the door was to remain locked at least let me look at tristans room it was very small florence looked unhappy when tristan went to university étienne turned it into an en suite bathroom dont show your anger lucy had to keep telling herself there should be a portrait of tristan hes the handsomest of the lot she said crossly in answer florence looked up at the gilt montigny snake chained to the lintel seek not to disturb the serpent she whispered her face creasing into a hundred folds of anxiety im only seeking to disturb the wretched thing lucy was nearly in tears because i want to find out the truth tristan was desperate to question hortense about his parents but he was too busy with carlos to fly out and now it may be too late it was a secret madame swore to étienne she would take to the grave florence glanced up at a gold empire clock which featured neptune brandishing his trident the nurse will be going in ten minutes you can sit with her instead of me aunt hortense had blurred weatherbeaten features and wild white hair like a gargoyle caught in a snowstorm she lay without covers her long nightgown rucked up to show purple bruised shins and a plaster on every toe beside her on the bed were two marmalade cats and a tiny brindled italian greyhound which one of her gnarled ringed gardeningbegrimed hands repeatedly caressed opposite the bed filling the wall was a ravishing rubens of milkmaids tending a herd of paddling red cows and chatting up a swain driving a horse and cart we hung it there last week whispered florence madame wanted something beautiful to look at to the right hung a small photograph of a young hortense being handed the croix de guerre for her courage during the resistance with her boyish brown curls her deepset dark eyes and quick smile she bore an uncanny resemblance to tristan perhaps wondered lucy but hortense would have been too old at fiftyfive could she have had an illegitimate daughter she must have a story to tell in moments of consciousness aunt hortense played la grande dame for all her worth i wouldnt dream of discussing family matters with a complete stranger she told lucy coldly i just wanted to talk about tristan carefully lucy explained the situation that tristan had been arrested for two murders that he hadnt done hortense however was only interested in why he hadnt come to her party i broke totally with protocol and put him on my right and had to talk to air all lunch i suppose his film and claudine lauzerte were more important he sent you a lovely present said lucy recognizing rozzys giftwrapping on the louis xv desk you havent even opened it why dyou stick your nose into everything snapped hortense are you a journalist tristan stayed away from your party because he felt a fraud said lucy desperately rannaldini had just told him he wasnt a montigny that étienne wasnt his father at all stammering lucy went through all the palaver of maxim being so jealous of delphine marrying étienne that hed raped her for a second hortenses eyes opened a centimetre like an old crocodile really so tristans father was his grandfather and on his deathbed étienne kept rambling on about fathers and grandfathers we once had a footman called maxim confided hortense oh for gods sake exploded lucy there was a knock on the door the nurse was back to give hortense a shot oh please dont cried lucy in despair shell go even more doolally i will not said hortense tartly ill have you know young woman im in considerable pain and theres no need to shout lucy fought sleep it was still unbearably hot and the scent of jasmine growing up the still warm walls was almost sickly the melon frames gleamed in the moonlight she watched the tractors hung with lamps going back and forth labouring to get the harvest in before next weeks forecast storm the combines roared so loudly it was like working in a munitions factory grumbled hortense down in the village they were celebrating bastille day fireworks rose and fell against a pearly grey night lucy could hear the accordion playing la vie en rose glancing at hortense she noticed tears trickling down her wrinkled cheeks and took her hand im so sorry to hassle you could rannaldini possibly be tristans father i wouldnt put anything past that devil always hanging round delphine like a wasp round a melon or bernard have you seen the ghost of the montigny snake yet said hortense as she drifted off to sleep at last ive found someone i can charm announced rupert the proprietor of la reconnaissance had sloped off to a bastille day party but his busty hennahaired wife had taken one look at monsieur campbellblack personally cooked him and wolfie foiegras pancakes and miraculous coq au vin and unearthed several bottles of the best claret rupert had ever tasted for five hours he and wolfie had not drawn breath not chivvying ambassadors but discussing everyone on the unit and particularly the polo shoot they had enjoyed a glorious bitch about isa and helen and rupert was touched by the way wolfies rather solid face lit up whenever tabs name was mentioned now they had moved on to tristan and a large bottle of armagnac im sure hes not papas son wolfie decided against a second piece of camembert if papa had fathered such a genius he could not have resisted boasting about it also papa was half german and i dont think tristans got any german blood with him one thinks of the shifting subtlety of composers like ravel and debussy rather than heavyweights like brahms beethoven and bruckner does one yawned rupert i wouldnt know i suppose rannaldini could have made up the story about maxim years ago just to crucify étienne he was such a manipulative shit he could have reflected wolfie filling their glasses it was a relief to talk about his father objectively people always pussyfooted round the subject why are you actually here asked rupert suddenly because i owe tristan replied wolfie my father fucked him up and ive got to find out the truth and because i adore tab wolfies drunkenly crossed eyes filled with tears and i can only compete with tristan when hes no longer crippled by this awful stigma its like fighting a man with both hands chained behind his back anyway wolfie smiled slightly tab told me not to hang around like a stuck pig and get tristan out of prison and also i really love the guy hes so great to work for you feel like a dry leaf suddenly swept up by the warm southwest wind of his enthusiasm i couldnt go back to straight law again hum said rupert did you kill your father when tab told me hed rrraped her i wanted to but it seemed more important to find out if she was safe wolfie longed to ask if rupert had killed his father he felt the man was quite capable of murder but also had enough sense of fair play that if he had killed rannaldini and beattie not to want tristan to take the rap was that why rupert was so sure tristan wasnt guilty on the other hand had he come down here to check out the montignys as suitable inlaws for tab or was he merely a commercial animal in search of his director i know tabitha loves tristan wolfie added wistfully but im in that state of love so well described by stendhal utter despair poisoned still further by a shred of hope he is a clever boy thought rupert probably too clever for tab tabs not perfect he told wolfie shes got my terrible temper she can be an appalling drama queen and she doesnt have the greatest sense of humour nor do i sighed wolfie people always tell me im too serious ive heard all those jokes about slim volumes containing two thousand years of german humour i like krauts said rupert i knew a lot on the showjumping circuit good blokes feet on the ground but knew how to party getting up he wandered unsteadily over to the window unzipped his flies peed into the garden causing scuffling and angry mewings from madames two cats and only just zipped up in time as a besotted madame returned with an even more ancient bottle of brandy if monsieur campbellblack would come into the back room tristans arrest was on the latenight news clips were being shown of valhalla of rannaldini conducting of tristan arriving at the police station and of étienne in a big straw hat painting in the château gardens when hermione appeared opening her big eyes and saying she had every confidence because her very good friends chief constable swallow rupert campbellblack and sexton kemp were now at the helm rupert and wolfie collapsed with howls of drunken laughter im suffering from dutch helm disease said rupert pretending to fall over poor old tristan but bloody good publicity said wolfie wiping his eyes christ shes beautiful sighed rupert as claudine lauzerte was shown talking to tristan on the set of the lily in the valley très jolie très chic agreed madame oscars lighting helped said wolfie quickly tabs much more beautiful sos taggie admitted rupert even so i wouldnt mind having madame lauzerte as my luxury on desert island discs thank you said wolfie as madame filled up his glass i should like to pick up the tab on this he told rupert firmly i should like to pick up tab any time he added perhaps he did have a sense of humour after all you have a very charming son madame told rupert skittishly it is rare for fathers and sons to get on so well very agreed rupert then turning to wolfie if tristan had really loved tab he wouldnt have backed off after a onenight stand i dont believe in that kind of sacrifice yes you do said wolfie resolutely tab told me you backed off for nearly a year because you didnt feel you were good enough for taggie maybe i did rupert scratched his head in pleased surprise maybe i did and talking of selfsacrifice whys lucy here because she wants to slay the dragon of this frightful calumny said wolfie and unconsciously in the hope that tristan will be so touched by her enterprise and nobility hell realize shes the one he loves not tab he wont unfortunately men dont love buckets like that just for their virtues lucys not a bucket protested wolfie she can look gorgeous rupert raised a sleek sceptical blond eyebrow i wouldnt ask you to shoot on a cocksonly day he drawled telephone called out madame it was lucy any progress wolfie asked her none lucy lowered her voice shes a stubborn old bat she wouldnt squeal when the gestapo tugged out her toenails and shes not likely to tell me anything she was wandering so badly this evening that she insisted on having the blackout put up in her room hearing a burst of music wolfie looked round and saw madame was teaching rupert the cancan and started to laugh do you want us to come and get you neither of you sounds capable snapped lucy then after a pause im sorry its been a long day but florence is letting me stay the night she made me a gorgeous gruyère omelette and opened a bottle of sancerre i just wish are you ok wolfie hunkydory thingsh will be better in the morning goo night lucy lucy couldnt remember ever being more tired but just as she was about to fall into the arms of morpheus she thought of tristan in his small cell and how much she would prefer the arms to be his by this time morpheus had retreated in a sulk and lucy was left to agonize until four in the morning when the roar of the combines and the waiting started again she went downstairs and raided the family albums poring over photographs of picnics balls and shootingparties of weddings and christenings when the limes in the avenue were only shoulder high and the jasmine round the house wasnt planted étienne was everywhere always surrounded by adoring women while hortense and his three elder sons looked on stolid and disapproving but she found no sign of laurent unless he was that beautiful young man with the lively restless notveryhappy face to the rear of one group gazing down at a girl whose slim back was to the camera and whose long dark hair was tied back with a scarlet ribbon around ten on sunday morning lucy was toying with a croissant black cherry jam and coffee so dark brown it reminded her of tristans eyes when a bell jangled in the kitchen im plunged in pitch darkness i dont know if im alive or dead said a querulous voice over the intercom will someone immediately bring me a cup of tea let me take it lucy begged florence havent you gone snapped hortense as lucy opened the shutters not yet i havent got what i came for i suppose youre in love with my nephew like the rest of them youre certainly no oil painting just as well judging by some of the oils downstairs said lucy id hate to be as fat as the rubens nude or as bloated as that francis bacon cardinal aunt hortense gave a snort of laughter does tristan love you no a great friend of mine a most beautiful girl bien élevée very and she adores him married i suppose not acutely shes got a horrid husband and rannaldini told tristan he couldnt marry her because he wasnt a montigny and because of his bad blood because maxim had raped his mother carefully laboriously lucy went though the whole story until hortense said sharply you told me all that last night lucy raised her eyes to heaven but you havent told me whether its true i swore to my brother étienne never to discuss the matter but its so unfair to tristan life has always been unfair to tristan he was such a sweet little boy i was far too strict with him i didnt want him to grow into a cissy i knew women and possibly men would spoil him later there was a patter of feet as the little italian greyhound scampered in leapt on to the bed and covered his mistresss grey wrinkled face with kisses still they love you ive spoilt my animals so dreadfully what will become of them when im gone tristan would look after them if you got him out of prison who is tristans father if it wasnt rannaldini could it be oscar or even bernard guérin he and tristan are incredibly close its a secret ill take to my grave youre not going to your grave let me wash your hair whatever for im a hairdresser and you have designs on my nephew dont treat my head as though it was a glass bauble snapped hortense a quarter of an hour later give it a good hard rub despite pointing out that the fluffy fringe over her forehead was very common hortense was grudgingly delighted with the result even making lucy hold up the mirror at the back where a pink bald patch had been covered over afterwards she let lucy make her up theyll be doing that to me in my coffin very soon she added dont be so macabre do you want me to come back and do it for you then not if you make me wear that lipstick i look like a jewess lucy giggled as soon as florence had gone off to church hortense decided shed like to give her makeover an outing and announced she wanted to pay a visit to her brothers grave its horrendously hot a good dress rehearsal for hell fires and i dont think youre well enough im the best judge of that everywhere outside was evidence that hortense had lost her grip on the place a jungle of plants their huge leaves pressing against the glass was struggling to get out of the conservatory ivy throttled the shutters an emerald carpet of algae covered the moat grass had grown over the steppingstones of the path leading to the fields of lavender but if étienne had painted with a palette and tristan with light hortense had created as dazzling effects with plants as lucy wheeled her down the garden she pointed out some pale yellow hollyhocks with pink centres those came from monets garden at giverny like a brass section about to explode to the right was a proud clump of regale lilies pick them for my brother ordered hortense rozzy would do her nut thought lucy as she laid the lilies across hortenses knees what a pity we couldnt have used this for charles vs tomb she sighed as they approached a splendid mausoleum étienne alexandre henri blaize de montigny painter she read out in a shaky voice although étienne had died eight months ago there were as many flowers outside the tomb as at valhalla pilgrims acolytes students and admirers came from all over the world and denied access to the château paid homage at the grave now leave me said hortense ill call you when i want to go back the noonday sun was punishing beads of sweat were breaking through hortenses makeup red lipstick was escaping down the lines round her mouth as lucy wheeled her back those lilies were struck down in their prime like laurent reproved lucy why didnt they fly his body back and bury him here because he was blown up said aunt hortense tartly by his own side tristan told me persisted lucy why didnt étienne insist on an inquiry he had the clout would that have brought laurent back as lucy eased hortense back into bed her flesh felt as soft as marshmallow was étienne buried or cremated she asked buried of course great crowed lucy that means his body can be dug up and dnatested to see whether hes tristans father or not how dare you suggest that you conniving hussy gasped hortense hoarsely coming in here stirring up trouble then after an eternal silence she seemed to cave in all right étienne wasnt his father now are you satisfied no stormed lucy im not leaving till i know who it was but hortense whether deliberately or not had fallen asleep after that lucy lost any sense of time as night fell and lightning flickered round the hills illuminating the clouds she made one last attempt please please tristan cant marry and have children if he believes a psychopath rapist was his father he needs a family of his own so badly to give him the love none of you provided all he ever did was try to please étienne the clock ticked the cicadas chirped lucy longed to pick up la grande mademoiselles velvethandled musket which hortense kept always by her bedside and empty it into her i have nothing to say but as the nurse frogmarched lucy out hortense called after her goodbye miss latimer dont forget to put your name and address in the visitors book i bloody well wont shouted lucy what dyou want me to say that youre a stubborn old bitch who through your pigheadedness sent tristan to prison for life she wept all the way back to the hotel i handled her all wrong she told the chauffeur if by any chance she changes her mind heres my mobile number she found wolfie only just recovering from last nights excesses rupert had flown home all she knew was tristan would be charged in court tomorrow back in rutshire as gablecross and karen were tied up full time with tristan other detectives took over their leads fanshawe had never been happy with chloes alibi about jogging round paradise in the dusk she would also have more to lose than most if beattie had dumped about her in the scorpion so late on the afternoon of saturday the fourteenth fanshawe and debbie went over to valhalla and found chloe working out in the gym she was wearing shorts and a pale blue sleeveless tshirt fanshawe having gone into a frenzy of hairsmoothing and toothlicking couldnt keep his eyes off her glistening cleavage and her smooth buttocks continually on display as she stretched and twisted at the bars sunday was a sad day for me sergeant she told him soulfully after a long affaire mikhail dropped me because his wife found out your mother phoned you from abroad at around nine thirty fanshawe frowned at his notes you were going to find out where she was staying i completely forgot ill do it tonight then you went for a jog round paradise i was depressed the tennis had hardly been taxing shoving her fists into her armpits chloe rotated her elbows so her breasts thrust forward i jogged over the river fleet up past magpie cottage i wanted to see if tab was in shed been terribly down since tristan blew her out hows he bearing up by the way such was chloes egoism it was the first time shed thought of tristan at least as hed been arrested this must only be a routine call we havent heard said debbie poor tristan said chloe lightly anyway tab was out so i jogged back through paradise i like streetlights at that hour she extended a smooth brown foot under fanshawes nose as though she was expecting him to kiss it mr brimscombe claims he saw you running from the tennis court into hangmans wood said debbie not without pleasure then coming out from a different northerly direction five minutes later and disappearing into the north wing he says you came out of the north wing fifteen minutes after that smelling of perfume and toothpaste an expert on floral scents he thinks the perfume was the same he smelt earlier on tabitha the change in chloe was phenomenal suddenly she was a snarling cornered vixen disgusting old lech brimscombes always spying on me what was the name of your perfume people are always giving me perfume said chloe hysterically i think its called quercus why did you go into the wood i dont remember going to kill rannaldini were you traces of quercus were found on his dressinggown i dddont believe it chloe clung to the bar for support the fingertip team found your lipstick fiery fuchsia persisted fanshawe fifty yards from his watchtower shes guilty guilty guilty thought debbie in elation she could smell chloes sweat turning acid for a second chloes eyes darted towards the door then she slumped to the floor all right you win i went to magpie cottage to meet isa lovell there it was out fanshawe and debbie both looked shocked i dont feel guilty said chloe defiantly that marriage is fucked tabs been lusting after tristan all summer it was isa not my mother who rang at nine thirty to say tab was taking some dog back to penscombe and the coast was clear i intended going straight to magpie cottage and darted into hangmans wood to put on lipstick and scent then i thought better of it i hate being hot and sweaty so i made a detour through the wood where the tennis party couldnt see me theyre such horrendous gossips back at the house i showered brushed my teeth changed into almost identical clothes so people wouldnt suspect anything and jogged over to isas what time did you arrive around ten see anything out of the ordinary i was far too excited what time did you leave asked debbie about eleven ten i guess isa didnt want me to jog home in the dark so he dropped me off halfway up the drive then drove home to warwickshire so that puts her and isa in the clear calculated fanshawe in disappointment unless they had got rid of rannaldini together oh yes chloe smiled spitefully something significant did happen alpheus rolled up in a white suit in the middle he was clutching white lilies like the archangel michael and started singing la ci darem la mano under our bedroom window isa poured a bottle of red over him and told him to fuck off such style despite repeated calls to the home secretary it didnt look as though tristan would be bailed even after his court appearance on monday as everyone in the unit was hanging about on sunday having been forbidden to leave the country sexton oscar and bernard decided to push on and film the polo scenes at george hungerfords this had been kept from tristan until griselda rang the police station late on sunday morning and chivvied the custody officer into asking tristan if he wanted the ponies bandages to match the players shirts tristan went berserk they cannot shoot polo without me but when he tracked down bernard he was even more upset to discover rupert lucy and wolfie had all done a runner we cannot film without lucy he yelled who will make up granny and mikhail who will disappear babys double chin and alpheuss nose rozzys offered said bernard fondly dont be so fucking stupid how could lucy bugger off like that raged tristan she had left him no message since the now tornup sprig of honeysuckle the final straw was gablecross popping in all dressed up for his silverwedding lunch to put him through the mangle again not only had he blocked ruperts application for bail he announced bullyingly but interpol had broken into tristans flat in paris found some very interesting material and were about to blow the safe whaaat howled tristan his fingers clamped round gablecrosss neck once more you bastard dont be stupid screamed karen leaping forward to prise tristan off feeling the shivering rigidity of his body seeing the madness in his eyes there was no doubt he was capable of murder when are you going to tell us the truth asked a somewhat shaken gablecross straightening his unusually smart blue silk tie tristan collapsed in his chair suddenly it came spilling out ok i came back to valhalla i need my address book to call an actor colin firth to see if he was interested in playing hercule i parked the aston in a field off the drive i didnt want to be pestered i sweat like a peeg so i had a shower and changed back into your favourite peacockblue shirt and jeans karen couldnt contain her excitement oui and then i buggered off to forest of dean did you call colin firth non and beyond that he wouldnt budge he can bloody well appear in court tomorrow said a furious gablecross as armed with hermiones cd and rozzys cards and presents he set off to his anniversary party he had looked almost attractive conceded karen grudgingly as she wandered round the incident room gazing at the map of valhalla flipping through statements looking for silly little details in the jigsaw puzzle as a detective you had to keep pushing yourself beyond the point you were able or wanted to go continually asking how when why even in the group photograph of the unit tristan looked sad there were enough tears in those haunted eyes to put out any funeral pyre why was he so sad karen glanced through the sundays which had all led on tristans arrest rannaldinis fans were still streaming into paradise a lynch mob had tried to burn down tristans caravan portland had put a uniformed man outside the scorpion had bussed down a lot of actors clutching more tulips in cellophane and photographed them weeping and pretending to be beatties fans much was being made of tristans cutting hortenses party his rows with rannaldini his callous dumping of tabitha the raid on the paris flat tristans family had all said je ne dis rien but alexandre the judge huffing and puffing with disapproval was expected to fly over for the court hearing tomorrow in the sunday times there was a big piece by george perry describing tristans everflowering genius and comparing claudine lauzerte with garbo oh what a beautiful woman sighed karen admiring claudines huge languorous eyes and the thick dusky hair madame lauzerte went on the piece was currently filming in an adaptation of rose macaulays novel the world is my wilderness in wales why should tristan need an address book and clean clothes to drink brandy in a field pondered karen who was he gabbling in french to on the telephone when he came back after rannaldinis murder the incident room was having difficulty in tracing the owner of the mobile as the number was unlisted how could such a devastating man have had no suspicion of a relationship except for a disastrous skirmish with tabitha for the past three years karen picked up a telephone how would you like that drink ogborne having read down the right side of the heavenly host menu all summer and chosen the most expensive food was so fat he could only fit into tracksuit bottoms undaunted he met karen at the old bell in rutminster during the break the willows trailing in the river fleet were already turning yellow holidaymakers were hanging over the bridge shooting polos been a shambles confided ogborne mikhails fallen off three times all hes interested in is getting his new crocusyellow range rover resprayed before he goes back to russia im sure its nicked tab has been yelling nonstop with no tristan to smarm charm and calm and no rupert lucy or wolfie we might as well have stayed at home hows tristan bet hes enjoying the peace hell be auditioning for hercule soon so they can send potential leading ladies in with his caviare every day cant be bad is claudine lauzerte going to be in hercule im sure if tristan had had his way shed have played elisabetta but shes even older than dame hermione did she give him that peacockblue shirt and jeans he never takes off dunno said ogborne going vague secrets and lies is on at the odeon fancy going to see it this evening i might did the crew give him a lalique lighter covered in lilies at the end of the shoot naah said ogborne bit upmarket for us karen thought shed better offer some plums of gossip well be getting the dna results tomorrow or tuesday tristans as well if they pull their fingers out she said botanists in forensic are frightfully excited among the plants shoved up beatties vagina she lowered her voice as the couple at the next table stopped talking was a really rare white rock rose and an even rarer relation of the monkey orchid the chimpanzee which hasnt been found in england for fifty years she collapsed with laughter so theres added pressure to locate their place of origin shouldnt fink they needed any potting compost up beatties snatch grinned ogborne whats claudine like well ogborne deliberated valentin described her as a bourgeois ousewife whose face had been touched by the finger of god did anything happen between her and tristan i gotta go back to the set you coming to that movie yeah sure ogborne glanced round furtively tristan was giving madame vierge direction one day he murmured she was in costume longsleeved purple dress little lacy gloves tristan was squatting down holdin her hands talking intensely as he often does with hermione and chloe or even baby and mikhail but i noticed his finger was caressing the gap between her sleeve and her glove ill see you outside the odeon at the start of the big film said karen she was not at all pleased when a call on her mobile asked her to whizz over to penscombe to investigate the whereabouts of rupert campbellblack interpol had had no success in finding him so gerald portland wanted her and gablecross to pump taggie neither of them talked on the drive karens head was full of tristan and how to prove his innocence gablecross was feeling beleaguered all his brownie points over hermiones cd and rozzys presents had been cancelled because hed had to leave his silverwedding lunch in the middle of the speeches nor would margaret ever forgive him for snatching up the pink roses and silver foliage sent by her sister and australian brotherinlaw to hand over as a peaceoffering to taggie after his mauling of tabitha last thursday noones got any right to live in such a big house fumed karen as she pressed ruperts doorbell with unnecessary force this place would make a wonderful hospital xavier and a pack of dogs answered the door for a second he and karen gazed at each other then he said my mother cant be disturbed shes crying my sister bianca is comforting her what a beautiful child thought karen wondering how he fitted into such a privileged white rightwing environment whys she crying she asked because her dog died shall i give her those flowers xav eyed the pink roses in gablecrosss hand no wed like a word with her shes down at the graveyard explained xav ill take you if you promise not to upset her my father left me in charge karens disapproval evaporated when xav introduced her to peppy koala on the way she had won twentyfive pounds on him in the police sweepstake and bought a ribbed scarlet sweater which she had worn to dramatic effect at the local disco when did your dog gertrude die asked gablecross admiring the handsome glossy chestnut tab brought her home on sunday night i woke and looked out of the window she had blood all over her dress daddy went off in the helicopter earlier did he gablecross stroked peppy koalas sleek arched neck only a little faster he took his gun because he was so angry when did he get back before tab when she arrived with gertrude daddy went out and hugged her he hadnt seen her for years she cries a lot and looks past you gertrudes funeral was the next day mummy wont cry in front of tab but tabs gone to polo today daddy promised us gertrude has gone to heaven but biancas worried rannaldinis gone there too and might hurt gertrude again but daddy said rannaldini would be sitting in a bonfire with demons sticking these into him as he closed peppys halfdoor xav tapped a pitchfork leaning against the wall tabs mothers staying too shes a drip daddy hates her are you sure your father took the helicopter on sunday night i said so didnt i wheres he now abroad to find out more about tabs boyfriend whos in prison out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thought gablecross in jubilation they found taggie planting heartsease and polyanthus round gertrudes grave bianca was helping her with a toy trowel both children were dispatched to the kitchen to organize cups of tea the moment gablecross laid the roses beside gertrudes wonky cross taggie started to cry again im so sorry she collapsed on to the grave of ruperts great olympic horse revenge but gertrude was with me the whole time before i married and when i lost the babies and when beattie johnson dumped twice i thought shed be jealous when we adopted bianca and xav we had to leave her for six weeks when we went to bogotá but beyond the odd sniff she loved them finished up the food they didnt like she always kept a biscuit hidden in her basket so she could rush out and eat it very slowly in front of the other dogs im sorry taggie raised streaming eyes to karen and gablecross she was such a mascot i live in such a lovely house but it seems so empty without gertrude i feel our lucks running out no it isnt protested karen putting an arm round taggies shoulders youve got everything to live for those kids are so cute its probably because ruperts first wifes staying confessed taggie wiping her nose with the back of her hand and covering her face with earth she keeps saying gertrude had a good innings like some stupid cricketer oh god im being a bitch lysander ruperts assistant has an incredibly clever handsome headmaster father whos coming to supper tonight he and helen can quote poetry at each other the afternoon sun peering through a lime tree showed up her dreadful pallor mrs campbellblack said gablecross feeling a louse i know this is distressing but beattie johnsons last call on friday night was to your husband according to gordon dillon on the scorpion she had some dirt on him and some other woman while youve been married taggie looked up in bewilderment karen in horror your husband was overheard telling beattie hed bury her he left the set at midnight an hour and a half later she was dead have you any idea of his movements that night taggie almost fell off revenges grave frantically digging a hole in the still ironhard earth with biancas trowel he was so pleased george hungerford had given tab an alibi she mumbled he rushed off to persuade him to get back with flora he hardly spent all night playing cupid said gablecross sarcastically are you worried your husband might have killed rannaldini and beattie of course he didnt gasped taggie oh bugger in her violence she had snapped the little trowel in two oh poor bianca of course he didnt a witness went on gablecross relentlessly had seen rupert taking a gun and leaving penscombe by helicopter a helicopter had also been seen landing at valhalla and two men running into the wood near rannaldinis tower another witness had seen rupert with a gun in his hand taggie sat back on her heels mouthing in horror he had plenty of motives gablecross ticked them off on his fingers tab being raped by rannaldini gertrude being killed rannaldini arranging for tab to marry lovell rannaldini trying to murder your stepson marcus rannaldini did that whispered an appalled taggie and your husband had more than enough reason to kill beattie where is he anyway abroad said taggie numbly he didnt leave a telephone number oh come on mrs cb your husband wouldnt cross the lawn without leaving a phone number hows tabitha asked karen gablecross like a hound tugged off the scent kicked her ankle better i think grateful for the distraction taggie planted a polyanthus upside down wolfgangs been so wonderful to tab he keeps ringing to see if helens ok helens convinced he fancies her but im sure hes only hoping to get tab oh help ill be punished for being a bitch again gablecross returned to the attack what time did your husband leave the house last sunday i dont remember i was so upset about gertrude taggie began to cry again as the stable clock struck five xav and bianca came round the corner carrying a trayful of tea in which floated three cups and some melting chocolate biscuits theyd been joined on the way by a beautiful young man and a jack russell who was roughhousing noisily round the graves with xavs black labrador how dare you bully my mother said xav in outrage whatevers the matter asked the beautiful young man in horror its all right taggie mopped her eyes on her tshirt ill give you a pound each if you go and find my cigarettes the young man told bianca and xav now what the hells going on he turned furiously on gablecross he thinks rupert murdered rannaldini and beattie sobbed taggie right the young man squared his shoulders my names lysander hawkley im ruperts assistant and its time i made a statement its nothing to do with you pleaded taggie i was with rupert last sunday went on lysander when tab rang and said rannaldinid raped her we took the helicopter rannaldini incidentally is the most evil person in the world how dyou know sir he was married to my wife kitty for five years nearly destroyed her i had to give her a lot of therapy when we were first married lysander added solemnly anyway rupert swore he was going to kill rannaldini and i wanted part of the action we landed in the park just after ten thirty we couldnt find tab but about ten minutes later we stumbled on rannaldini lying on his back in the middle of the wood it was a bit dark for sunbathing how did he look not well hed been strangled was he dead very so rupert emptied his gun into him what kind of gun a he bought it in bogotá when he adopted xav and bianca its got a silencer on it and it sounds like a wet fart if id had a gun id have done the same thing as it was i kicked rannaldini very hard in the ribs we didnt hang about wed already tried to find tab but the telephone box was redder inside than out rupert was going bananas with worry then taggie rang him to say someone with a yorkshire accent was bringing tab home and youre prepared to sign a statement thats what happened youre not just making this up because ruperts your boss no im far too stupid to do that over on georges polo field they were coming to the end of a long shambolic day valentin had just filmed baby hitting a ball around and being drooled over by chloe and a lot of groupies the sun was setting they were waiting for the gate baby had moved away from the others under the shade of a huge sycamore tree and was sharing a kitkat with his weary chestnut mare anything to do with horses reminded him agonizingly of isa they had not spoken since the night of rannaldinis murder but would have to soon about the future of babys three racehorses at least a couple in the nextdoor room at le manoir aux quat saisons had come forward and confirmed that they had heard baby singing on the balcony between ten and eleven on the night of rannaldinis murder we thought oh my god they had said then once he opened his mouth we sat back and enjoyed it is he going to be the next domingo so baby had an alibi on the other hand the police had found the bottle of quercus he had left behind in his bathroom at le manoir so he wasnt altogether in the clear you know isa a voice interrupted babys thoughts it was chloe whod been in a strange excited mood all day hes my trainer i was with him the night rannaldini was murdered weve been having an affaire you what babys pony picking up the sudden tension tossed up her head and pulled away i confessed it to fanshawe who has such a divinely uppity bum in that grey tracksuit went on chloe i felt awful shopping isa but i needed an alibi the police know i was in the wood earlier because i dropped a lipstick and theyve found the scent isa gave me called quercus on rannaldinis dressinggown baby seeing his horrified face chloe launched mockingly into ebolis lines oh heavens what thought makes you blench stock still your word freezing on your lips what ghost rises in between us then when baby still seemed incapable of speech she asked plaintively will tab go berserk and dyou think isall back me up baby reached up a hand to scratch his restless pony behind the ears good girl he murmured affectionately which is more than can be said for you chloe youre a whore thats unkind pouted chloe i have to have a man in my life have someones husband you mean tab was keen enough to get her long claws into tristan tab was lonely and neglected youve never stuck up for her before loosen up baby what will rupert do give you a medal he loathes isa isa on the other hand will go apeshit isas bats about me said chloe defensively then leapt back as for a terrifying second she thought baby was going to hit her with his stick bat is the operative word said baby harshly isas a bloodsucker hes got a perfectly good mistress called martie bankrolling him in oz he didnt break up with her when he married tab who turned out to be not rich enough because rannaldini wouldnt help out i bet isa suggested you buy some horses for him to train then ignoring bellows from bernard that the gate wasnt clear baby vaulted on to his pony and galloped off in the direction of valhalla it took chloe some hours to trace the exdirectory number of jake lovells yard having gone to bed early isa was woken not by the news of a sick horse which he would have understood but by chloe in hysterics who the hells martie she screamed my business partner a bit more than that well its all over anyway who told you about her baby i told him about us isa sat bolt upright you what the police found my lipstick near rannaldinis body and quercus on his dressinggown i needed an alibi well im not giving you one you stupid bitch anyone who kisses and tells deserves all they get and isa hung up tristan paced in torment up and down his baking airless veal crate of a cell the light was fading outside his frosted window but he could see nothing except the inside of his own heart he knew that a gentleman never named the women he had slept with montignys didnt fuck and tell as rannaldini had although étienne had fucked and painted enough for the last three years he had been having an affaire with claudine lauzerte so discreetly that not even rannaldinis secret service had rumbled them he had fallen in love with her back in when shed joined their table the first time rannaldini had taken him to don carlos his dream had come true in when hed cast her as the object of a young mans adoration in le rouge et le noir as she had grown in beauty under oscars lighting and his direction so had their passion for one another at first she had held off only when he had found her sobbing wildly over a newspaper report that he was sleeping with some starlet had he broken down her defences and theyd become lovers but at what price claudines husband jeanlouis the appropriately named minister of cultural affairs was universally acknowledged to be a brute and that was another reason why tristan had identified with carlos he had experienced all the hell of loving a married woman with a stern undemonstrative unfaithful yet possessive husband he could never drop in on claudine unannounced never expect her to ring him in case the telephone number showed up on a bill closely scrutinized by jeanlouiss accountants never ring her at home in case one of the spying servants answered nor could he write because jeanlouis or his secretary also a spy frisked the post as claudine became even more adored because of tristans films and was voted the most admired woman in france jeanlouiss jealousy increased and so did the interest of the press who followed her every move at first she had been reckless and while they were on location spent all night in tristans arms this had compensated for the endless taunts that he was a closet gay impotent incapable of sustaining a relationship he had also had to endure the hostility of beautiful women like chloe and serena who couldnt understand why he rejected their advances not to mention the endless matchmaking of his brothers wives he had prayed claudine would leave jeanlouis and move in with him or better still marry him he didnt give a toss about the twentyfouryear age gap sometimes when life became unbearable she had come near to it but just before étiennes death one of claudines friends had rung to say a newspaper was on to her and tristan and about to blow her saintly madame vierge image sky high claudine had no desire to relinquish the moral high ground so she had retreated into her arid marriage gradually for tristan hope had died but he couldnt stop loving her until suddenly he had been jolted by tab and believed by some miracle there might be life and love after claudine but rannaldini had promptly stamped on that flower in his most despairing thoughts since then tristan had dreamt that claudine having four children of her own might not mind that he couldnt give her children he had so longed to see her again at the screening of the lily in the valley he knew jeanlouis was in tuscany and was devastated when shed failed to show up on the excuse that filming commitments in wales were too heavy he had forced himself to go to hortenses party the next day but the sight of numerous montignys a tribe to which he no longer belonged milling around the lawn aunt hortense in navy blue pinstripe the croix de guerre in her lapel his selfregarding brothers and their braying wives and the smell of crayfish drifting over the white rose hedge had sent him fleeing back to valhalla here he collected the address book with claudines telephone number in wales showered changed into the peacockblue shirt and the jeans she had given him and on which lucy had put the patch of a greyhounds head and set out for the sleepy village of llandrogan he had rung from valhalla to say he was on his way his mobile cutting out before claudine could say no he had driven like the devil and arrived while she was getting ready her hair which she hadnt had time to wash still in rollers with only one eye made up and her tummy still blown out from an early supper as he bounded upstairs like tigger she had sent him down again to pour himself a huge drink which by the time she had joined him had become two she had looked so exquisite he had swept her back up to bed which had not been a success he had come instantly in the old days he would then have made love to her with his tongue and his hands until he was raring to come again now he sensed her relief it couldnt matter less chéri were both exhausted i have lines to learn and ive got to get up at six im not as young as i was it was a far cry from the lily in the valley when they had made love all night and the violet shadows beneath eyes softened by happiness had only enhanced her haunting beauty claudine herself that sunday evening in llandrogan had suddenly felt too old and set in her ways reason has reasons the heart knows nothing about she didnt want him to stay the night she longed to take off her makeup and cover her face with skin food worry about the lurking paparazzi would keep her awake when she needed to look good on the set and if she fell asleep she might snore when tristan told her about the problems with rannaldini she had been unsympathetic all directors became increasingly twitchy as the end of a shoot approached unable to bear it any longer he had dropped the bombshell that maxim was his father to his amazement she wasnt very interested the aristocracy have always been irregularly conceived chéri my sister wasnt my fathers daughter im not sure i was either jeanlouiss father was a naughty old boy too whenever we go shooting on the estate i notice how the beaters all look like jeanlouis for christs sake its not the same my grandfather was a psychopath who raped my sixteenyearold mother so im threequarters his mad tainted blood tristan had wanted to hit her but had shaken her instead stop it youre hurting me she had cried and what the fuck dyou imagine youre doing to me thought tristan i cannot have children he said bleakly claudine had shrugged there are too many children in the world theyre nothing but trouble marieclaire is threatening to marry a piednoir patrice is divorcing béatrice is pregnant by her egyptian boyfriend jeanlouis is out of his mind with worry then seeing tristans blackening face anyway chéri you have elder brothers it is not as if theres any need to carry on the montigny line when he tried to explain he knew he was boring her he would have liked to have left then but he had drunk too much brandy and was too tired so instead he had crashed out on her bed she had shaken him awake at three thirty it would soon be light im so terrified of the english press theyre everywhere it wouldnt do to forfeit being the most admired woman in france thought tristan savagely as he had driven away from llandrogan into the desolation of dawn and pulled into a field to sleep he had been reminded of the time he had broken the news of maxim being his father to lucy and how shed given him black coffee laced with drambuie wrapped him in her duvet held him shuddering in her arms and listened and listened and how her hair was the same soft brown as rainsoaked winter trees coming back to earth still pacing his cell he remembered how on the day after the murder for the first time in months claudine had actually slipped into a telephone box in llandrogan to ring him pleading with him not to use her as an alibi she must know hed been arrested but she was clearly not coming forward to save him there was no light in the little frosted window and no dawn for him as karen walked into the pearly gates with ogborne after the cinema jessica dragged her outside into the drizzle i found this in my bag i wrote oscars mobile number on the back of it on thursday its a memo from tristan to bernard and the props department saying he was planning to reshoot part of posa and carloss pistol scene in the unicorn glade on friday night and he would need the out of the props cupboard is it important karen didnt even notice the drizzle become a downpour yes it is she said joyfully and by the way mikhails looking for you said a relieved jessica hes in the production office karen found mikhail utterly despondent about his crocusyellow range rover i telephone ten garage today and ask how much they charge for bottlegreen blowjob they all shout orrible things and hang up i think you mean respray karen had only just contained her laughter when mikhail said he wished to make a statement i took the montigny from the votchtower and i borrow lighter with lilies from tristan two or three days earlier i must have dropped it in the wood i went there to kill rannaldini about ten fortyfive but he was already dead strangled and shot i also must confess i actually make friends again with my wife lara on night before murder when rannaldini took her to votchtower for bonk he boast montigny painting on wall was vorth three million finding rannaldini dead i took painting instead what did you do with it karens pen would hardly write for excitement hid it under tristans mattress for safekipping whatever for tristan wasnt bonker like sylvestre or alpheus and wouldnt squash painting but when i go to remove it on friday morning it had vanish mikhail was amazed but greatly cheered when karen gave him an ecstatic hug gablecross was never going to speak to her again but she was more and more convinced tristan was innocent the llandrogan badger action group held their monthly meetings at the leek and grasshopper hotel on sunday nights the badger setts along chantry wood were the pride of the area and at least forty badgers were known to travel nightly through the wood over jacksons meadow skirting catmint cottage down to the stream which divided the valley in summer months the action group or bag as they liked to be known anxious to observe the badgers habits and protect them from baiters fierce dogs and even fiercer farmers concerned about bovine tuberculosis set up a camera to record these nocturnal perambulations and their time and date on sunday july gareth stacey bags bearded secretary who spent a lot of time in the field and who stank worse than any badger sett after a rhubarb raid was about to give a slide show of this months findings come on buck up grumbled major holmes the village bully who didnt care much for badgers but longed to get stuck into the wine and light refreshments that followed its like magic said pretty tracey birkett who taught at the local primary that the brocks dont know we can see them all lit up out went the lights click click went stinker stacey on the screen a stout female badger appeared looping the loop upsidedown barked major holmes click click the rightwayup badger was followed by a barn owl lady wadewilliamss burmese cat a couple of cubs then a huge bull badger who produced roars of applause this woke up keith the junior reporter on the llandrogan echo furious at having to cover the event when he could be in the pub and who in the dark couldnt keep himself awake gazing at pretty tracey birkett click click click click look you gareth said merv the milkman we have an intruder by jove we do said major holmes as stinker stacey repeated the slide everyone could see a tall dark man in a peacockblue shirt jeans and loafers coming out of the wood hes yummy sighed tracey wouldnt mind having a teddy bears picnic with him said mrs jones the local baker with a cackle looks familiar said the vicar cleaning his glasses its lady wadewilliamss handyman hes always on the poach said merv the milk the handsome intruder was followed by several rabbits a fox more badgers two of them humping to loud cheers and mrs owens jack russell on a latenight spree there he is again said jones the baker in excitement got one of them greyhounds on his back pocket said merv the milk lovely bum sighed tracey birkett earning a look of reproach from the vicar hes some actor chappie said major holmes seen him before no he isnt keith the reporter snatched up the evening paper and thrust it into the beam of the projector its that froggy theyve arrested for murdering rannaldini the time was three forty am ninth of the seventh ninetysix read out tracey birkett the murders supposed to have taken place between ten and eleven said keith who was now leaping up and down in excitement turn back to the first slide of him click click click click went stinker stacey everyone peered forward in excitement ten fifty pm on the eighth of july bingo yelled keith in jubilation he couldnt have done it its a good hundred and fifty miles from here to paradise bloody hell what a scoop even the vicar forgave such language golly said tracey birkett he must have been going into the back gate of catmint cottage to see claudine lauzerte didnt they make a film together its him all right said stinker stacey wed better go to the police its him all right said dc beddoes of north wales cid must have nipped into catmint cottage given madame lauzerte un deux et trois and nipped out again puts him in the clear couldnt have strangled rannaldini you told anyone else only the daily mail but its too late for tomorrows paper storyll break with a bang on tuesday madame lauzertes not going to like it said dc beddoes disapprovingly terrible thing shed have let him do life must love her not to squeal sighed keith what a story froggy would awooing go even when gablecross and karen confronted him with the evidence of the badger action group tristan still defended claudine there was no affaire i worry about film she and her husband were friends of my father she was like mother to me we just talked last sunday at eleven at night chided gablecross and five hours later youre seen coming out long time to read the meter anyway the french police have blown your safe and found madame lauzertes letters which are not those youd write to a son even the news he was free to go didnt cheer tristan her name must be kept out of the papers he pleaded might have been if youd levelled with us in the first place migraine on thursday night indeed when you were nearly threequarters of an hour on the phone to her trying to reassure her the story wouldnt come out said tristan despairingly terrific for her street cred shes been pulling such a gorgeous young guy sighed karen over at valhalla a devastated baby had like tristan paced his room most of the night how could isa have stood him up for someone as twofaced and trivial as chloe mondays dawn and his heart were breaking simultaneously as he went out into the park torrential rain washed away his tears and the remnants of rozzys makeup which hadnt been nearly as flattering as lucys having caught and loaded his three horses into one of rannaldinis lorries he set off very slowly stopping every few minutes in case rage and shock made him drive into a wall ruperts house was ash blond in the earlymorning sunshine his dark woods lay as still as possible like shaggy dogs knowing their coats will be too hot later in the day as baby rumbled into the yard rupert had just flown in from france he was talking to a ravishing youth and to dizzy his comely head groom who were both about to ride out one beautiful horse after another like a conjurors silk handkerchiefs was emerging from the boxes still in his polo gear his face grey against his crimson shirt baby jumped down from the lorry dyou want to train my horses id be delighted said rupert then as he gave the ravishing youth a leg up i dont think youve met my assistant lysander hawkley hi said baby looking lysander up and down paradise was in rutshire but it appears to have moved lets unload your horses said rupert and then come and have breakfast this latest development enraged isa how dare baby team up with rupert had he neatly forgotten he owed isa for the last quarter i owe you nothing you little toad if you breathe a word of complaint ill tell your fatherinlaw you were shagging chloe the night of rannaldinis murder then ill tell the world how white you bled me gerald portlands gameplan was in tatters a mob of reporters had fought their way through the deluge into the rutminster courtroom or failing that had ringed the building spilling down adjacent lanes like the water hurtling down gutter and pavement they had already written their intros about the fall of the house of montigny and the most deadly snake of them all when news leaked out that tristan had been freed they immediately charged off to write bitchy pieces about utterly incompetent west country police wasting public money and being no nearer to finding the killer the scorpion whod already set the headline beatties butcher over a snarling photograph of tristan changed it to thickos in even larger type and decided to launch their poll asking readers who killed beattie and rannaldini only the daily mail rubbed their hands over tristans secret tryst with claudine and pored over copy and headlines for tomorrows paper in a security block the rest of the media took off like starlings to rutminster hall to harass the polo shoot where they were furious to find that georges security guards kept them outside the front gates and that rupert still a chief suspect had gone racing weve become a laughing stock shouted gerald portland whod specially put on a new lilacstriped shirt to wow the press and felt it was utterly wasted on his inner cabinet they would have to reexamine all the suspects a terrible weariness came over his utterly weary team even people whod covered for each other like tab and george hungerford or rupert and lysander or griselda granny and bernard whod all claimed to be searching for balls together in hangmans wood could be lying chloe claimed to have seen both alpheus and isa but neither of them had seen her hermione was still sticking to the story that shed been in bed with sexton meredith simone and pushy had noone to vouch for them at all neither did wolfie and lucy whod pushed off abroad and so far neatly evaded interpol even those with castiron alibis away from valhalla like rozzy oscar and valentin would have to be checked out again there was a lot of money on lady rannaldini who none of the investigating team liked very much bearing in mind that she claimed to have seen rupert around ten twentyfive but lysander had sworn that he and rupert didnt discover rannaldinis dead body until they first approached the watchtower as late as ten forty meant someone was lying if rannaldini was happy and excited at the moment of death as the pm revealed mused karen the murderer must be someone he was thrilled to see which certainly wasnt rupert wolfie or alpheus chipped in debbie but most likely hermione bussage or tab well wait for the dna results before we tackle tab again said portland who didnt want any more earache from rupert dc lightfoot whod fallen asleep with his head on the edge of portlands desk was gently shaken awake and dispatched with dc smithson to rutminster hall to try to find out if alpheus and mikhail had been telling porkies fanshawe and debbie were given the task of reinterviewing hermione and then lysander on the timing of his and ruperts raid on hangmans wood gablecross and karen who were right at the bottom of the list for letting tristan off the hook and hassling taggie campbellblack were allotted the dreary task of trailing over to mallowfield to interview rozzys feckless husband gablecross was in despair only karens enterprise had proved tristans innocence his loathed rival fanshawe was poised to make a strike and margaret wasnt speaking to him because hed left the anniversary party so early as she had also refused to make him any breakfast gablecross popped into the paradise village shop to buy several yorkie bars to miseryeat on the way to mallowfield ahead in the queue he saw little cosmo harefield shoving some photographs and a letter into a large brown envelope as cosmo stopped to rest the envelope on a pile of rutminster echos gablecross noticed he was addressing it to the editor of the sun please register and express this on my mothers account cosmo told eve the proprietor grandly what have you got there sonny demanded gablecross nothing lied little cosmo let me look grabbing little cosmo by his tshirt gablecross relieved him of the envelope gimme that you bugger hissed little cosmo trying to knee gablecross in the groin two photographs got slightly torn in the scuffle but were still clearly discernible as hermione and sexton on the job in custody and possession of one of gablecrosss yorkie bars and a cup of black coffee little cosmo thawed a fraction obviously you were upset about your dads death very sighed cosmo his father he grumbled had divided his inheritance between cecilia his exwife cosmo and all his stepsiblings except wolfie this meant little cosmo only ended up with four million which was quite insufficient after estate duty for a growing lad particularly one intending to own racehorses cosmo had therefore decided to augment his income give us a fag he added looking longingly at gablecrosss pack gablecross however was not going to risk it in case cosmos mothers friend the chief constable walked in he and karen then learnt that on the night of rannaldinis murder hermiones notion of quality time had consisted of shoving little cosmo upstairs with dalmatians and a jar of humbugs regarding this as insufficient cosmo who had inherited his fathers specialist interest had borrowed his mothers camera and crept across the lawn to the summerhouse peering through the windows he had discovered and photographed his mother and sexton romping on their carpet of ladys bedstraw cosmo liked sexton and thought he would suit very well as a stepfather luckily for his mother and sexton cosmo had taken a midshoot break for sloe gin and smoked salmon and unintentionally recorded both ten twentyfive and ten forty on the large clock on the summerhouse wall although this gave hermione a vaginatight alibi gablecross had ticked off little cosmo roundly for shopping his mother at a time of mourning hermione whod just endured another most unchivalrous grilling from fanshawe and debbie was extremely displeased to see ds gablecross and karen i didnt do it timothy she opened her eyes very wide why should i want to murder little cosmos father she might however feel like murdering little cosmo said gablecross spreading the photographs on the table in front of her for a moment hermione was lost for words then her face lit up but timothy these are quite beautiful far more flattering than anything valentin or oscar could produce i never knew my son was so talented they compare very favourably with the work my good friend patrick lichfield did for the unipart calendar such a lovely texture hermione ran her finger over her naked body and i look so fragile beside sextons manliness even in his birthday suit timothy you can tell an old etonian by his commanding air hermione was so carried away she didnt notice karen doubled up with helpless laughter as she fled from the room gablecross chewing his lip just managed to keep a straight face but cosmo was sending these pictures to the sun dame hermione very enterprising i told cosmo he wouldnt get a penny until probate came through i know higgy will adore them we could even try charles moore on the telegraph such a charmer that one of me on my own is so lovely serena could use it on the next cd bravo cosmo youre the kiss of death gerry portland chided karen and gablecross as they gathered round his office table later that morning to admire the live sexton show as it was now called moment you start interviewing a perfectly legit suspect tristan rupert hermione an alibi comes jumping out of the woodwork i suppose we can assume she was unlikely to have jumped out of bedstraw to murder rannaldini it would have taken her at least a quarter of an hour even to run from river house said gablecross and if shed been out of breath she couldnt have sung elisabettas last aria so beautifully shes got a marvellous body said portland and knows a few tricks for an old un hermione agrees with you said karen who was still laughing i hope the lad isnt too traumatized cameras only thing likely to be upset said gablecross that boys more evil than his father as a result gablecross and karen didnt reach mallowfield until teatime having admired the grandeurs of river house earlier gablecrosss first angry impression was that rozzy as a wellknown and much beloved singer ought to be living in a better house clearly noone had been watering the garden during the drought or washed the milk bottles sour and queuing up outside the door the carpets were threadbare the paint peeling flowers rozzy had obviously arranged beautifully for glyns party the sunday before last had shed their petals on dusty surfaces there were no portraits or photographs of rozzy even in her radiant youth any cups or awards shed won over the years had been hidden away the colours were beautiful but gablecross had the feeling looking at shelves denuded except for cards that most things of value had been hocked he was further irritated to find he quite liked glyn who had an unlined face a beer gut and who was eating pizza drinking his way down a pint mug of red and watching rutshire bowl out oxfordshire half rising to his feet he apologized but without much conviction for the bottles still littering the place from his party know i ought to make a trip to the bottle bank but its easier to bung the dustmen and they always come before i get up tend to let things slide when rozzys away but syl will have the place like a new pin for when she comes home on wednesday isnt it sylvia the housekeeper was extremely pretty with big blue eyes a shiny red bob and a regulonine smile which could be turned off as quickly she was obviously better at keeping herself beautiful than the house karen understood why poor rozzy had sleepless nights over sylvia have a drink urged glyn both of you cant be driving get some glasses syl love hows it going at valhalla must be spooky shuddered sylvia as she reluctantly left the room i gather you had a wonderful birthday party beamed karen who found herself sitting very far forward in an armchair stuffed with tapestry cushions wonderful agreed glyn syl wanted to help but roz insisted on doing everything loves to feel needed i wanted to get in caterers added glyn expansively roz wouldnt hear of it we never save any money exwife costs a bomb two kids at boardingschool when do they come home asked gablecross wednesday said sylvia without enthusiasm as she returned with a jug of orange juice cans of iced beer and another bottle of red so rozzyll be back to look after them thought karen crossly you wouldnt put yourself out for anyone did rozzy enjoy the party she asked frankly the old girl has been working so hard on don carlos and worrying about the films budget and our budget and tidying and cooking she retired to bed with a migraine bet that was diplomatic thought karen accepting a glass of orange juice perhaps rozzyd caught hers from tristan what time did she go to bed she asked getting out her notebook ooo if were going on record wed better check our facts said sylvia skittishly around er she glanced at glyn eight thirty said glyn loads of people were still here i checked she was asleep at nine thirty syl checked her at ten i put my head round the door about ten thirty and eleven those up to no good check all the time thought gablecross i finally went to bed around midnight boasted glyn reaching for the corkscrew to open the red tripped over the landing carpet woke rozzy up she came out looking all in sylvia got up to put on a record what did rozzy give you for your birthday apart from the party asked karen she got me a signed copy of georgie maguires latest album and a signed photo said glyn syl loves georgie too dont you syl swonderful smarvellous sang the record player lovely single isnt it said glyn fondly we played this and georgies album all day when did you cut your cake around eight i should think there were still people here at midnight i left them to it your wife made two calls to valhalla during the evening glyn laughed she likes to check up always checking up on me he winked at karen who didnt wink back why didnt she use the house phone she was in the spare room doesnt have a phone we often sleep in separate rooms i tend to snore particularly when ive had a few the spare room looks north over the back of the house so it was a bit quieter during the party you ever meet rannaldini sir roberto only after performances in the old days charismatic bloke think of any reason why anyone should kill him i could have done a few years ago he was always jumping on rozzy you didnt tell me that snapped syl why should rannaldini have made a note to ring you the day he died asked gablecross me said glyn somewhat flattered ive no idea perhaps rozzys singing hadnt been up to scratch or she might have overtired herself shes always been delicate she obviously hasnt told glyn about the throat cancer thought gablecross he ought to mention it instead he said perhaps her gp could shed some light can you let me have his name of course i know she was worried about the young chappie directing it that is the most loathsome creep stormed karen as she drove through the dripping dusk bernard would make rozzy much happier but gablecross was talking on his mobile to the incident room interpol had a tipoff that rupert was staying in montvert he told karen as he switched it off casing the montigny joint presumably but when they rolled up at the hotel early this morning the bird had flown another couple who sound suspiciously like wolfie and lucy who also stayed there gave them the slip rannaldinis gulf on the other hand has been clamped at toulouse airport now what the hell can that mean that at least lucys safe sarge said karen patting his arm very early that monday morning lucy had been woken by a telephone call from wolfie we gotta move it two plainclothes men are downstairs looking for rupert madame didnt tell them we were here but suggests we leg it as soon as possible out through the back garden wolfie was just gathering speed down the high street when a loitering gendarme mistook his blond hair and suntanned face for ruperts and whistled up his mate to give chase wolfie who drove almost as fast as he flew had no difficulty shaking them off the airport was in sight they could see rannaldinis gulf jet merging into the heathaze on the runway when lucys mobile rang when she switched it off thirty seconds later she was as pale and trembling as a white poplar hortense has changed her mind but weve got to hurry dupont and the rellies are expected back before lunch lucys heart sank when a waiting florence said hortense didnt want to see them she led them upstairs and with a lot of cursing unlocked a bedroom door as the door creaked reluctantly open she stood back madame said youll find all the information you need in here youre to be locked in for security reasons press that bell when you want to be let out at first it was a question of not choking to death as their eyes grew accustomed to the dark it was plain that nothing had been touched for years possibly centuries by yanking open the shutters wolfie triggered off an avalanche of dust cobwebs woven on top of cobwebs and dotted with flies and wasps formed net curtains across windows and in corners on the walls a little van gogh and several of étiennes enchanting drawings of dogs fought for space with school and army photographs and peeling posters of jane birkin juliette greco and bardot astérix leered up at them from the yellowing duvet covering the bed in the corner a halffull bottle of brandy roget et gallet cologne lps of sergeant pepper the stones and manfred mann hairbrushes their silver backs blackened esquire and playboy parismatch and shooting times were all jumbled together on the shelves newspapers on the table faded to the colour of weak tea were all dated what the hells all this about asked wolfie trying to open a window must be laurents room pondered lucy florence said étienne never allowed anyone in here after his death but i still dont see leaning against the wall was a goldframed portrait wiping away the dust and grime with her tshirt lucy gave a gasp because a younger happier bolder tristan smiled back at her then her heart stopped as she noticed the nowtowering trees of the lime walk then only reached his shoulders and that he was the same young man whod been staring down at the girl whose long dark hair was tied back with a scarlet ribbon this must be laurent painted by étienne she said in excitement god hes goodlooking wolfie rooting round a desk had found a pile of letters these must have been sent him when he was in the army in chad my darling darling laurent read wolfie sounds exciting and heres another pile with west african stamps on them swinging round lucy knew even before she saw them that the letters would be tied together with scarlet ribbon give them here she snatched the package with a shaking hand and tearing open the top one read my darling angelic delphine and knew everything oh my god listen wolfie dont be frightened laurent writes ill be home in two months to take care of you is our baby still kicking in your beautiful belly if its a boy lets call him tristan but hes not going to be destined for tragedy only joy god they got that wrong then laurent goes on i love you so desperately dont worry about papa i just cant bear to think of you in the same bed as him or even that hes your husband i know its important not to humiliate him that this should never have happened but the fact that you and i love each other is all that matters oh god wolfie lucy looked up in horror poor étienne cuckolded by his own son like philip and carlos wolfie shook his head in bewilderment lucy skimmed the rest of the letter laurent had been full of plans for the new life he and delphine would start in australia with their baby hed get a job and theyd have love to live on heres a letter from delphine to him said wolfie dated november the fourteenth that must have been just after tristan was born shes enclosed a little pencil drawing of the baby look oh how sweet lucy mopped her eyes on the back she recognized étiennes elegant handwriting tristan laurent blaize a beautiful boy one hour old i thought youd like to see your son and heir delphine had written isnt he adorable étienne is so proud of his imagined offspring i feel so guilty oh laurent please come home hes nagging me to have sex again i cant bear him to touch me heres an even earlier one interrupted wolfie darling delphine its the best news in the world youre pregnant it seals everything let me finish my stint here there are things i must do wolfie looked up at lucy that must have been for the rebels then ill come home and take you away you will divorce papa and marry me everything will be very simple christ little did he know heres another horrible one cried lucy in distress smoothing out the letter holding it up to the dim light from the windows must be early in her pregnancy she sounds just like elisabetta étienne made love to me outside today i noticed his grey eyebrows and chest hair the liver spots on his hands the pleats in his flesh when he raised himself on his wrinkled arms oh laurie i know hes your father but he revolts me i cant read any more lucy thrust aside the letter étienne was a vain old goat but he must have been crucified by the son he adored then constantly reminded of this betrayal as tristan grew more and more like laurent and that lucy choked on the swirling dust in the excitement of her discovery was what he was rambling on about on his deathbed trying to tell tristan that he was his grandfather not his father wolfie was neatly stacking the letters and tying up laurents with their scarlet ribbon if tristan is laurent and delphines son he said soberly hes not only a montigny but can marry and have children by whoever he likes lucys hair was white with dust her face filthy and streaked with tears so we found out what we came here for she said slowly then realizing the full implications oh wolfie i hope it works out for you hortense burst out laughing when she saw lucys dusty hair you look older than i do i hope you were surprised by what you discovered stunned sitting on the bed lucy took hortenses hands im sorry i was so horrible yesterday im terribly glad for tristan but those letters are appalling i understand totally why you didnt want it to come out poor étienne but why did someone as gorgeous as delphine marry such an old man in the first place rannaldini encouraged her said hortense she was a bit of a raver i think its called and wanted to escape from her straitlaced family maxim detested rannaldini and thats why in revenge rannaldini reinvented him as a sexcrazed rapist rannaldini persuaded delphine of the doors étienne would open of the exciting life she would lead among the famous how shed be immortalized in his paintings but what about maxim i always suspected hortense lowered her voice conspiratorially that he wasnt delphines father her mother had an affaire with some actor called sammy somebody they were all bohemians she added with a sniff maxim certainly doted on delphine and immediately recognized rannaldini as a rotter he was even more distraught when she married étienne a notorious womanizer even older than himself so he wasnt sectioned as a mad psychopath certainly not he went a bit dotty at the end as we all do and died in a perfectly respectable nursing home thank goodness wolfie was downstairs not hearing more evidence of his fathers fearful lies what happened to laurents mother hortense stroked her little greyhound reflectively she was étiennes third or fourth wife played bridge all day and when étienne pushed off graduated to gin tripped over a black labrador coming out of her bedroom in the dark one night and broke her neck falling down the stairs wonderful way to go so that disposed of one granny giggled lucy i dont mean to laugh the whole thing must have been terrible terrible étienne was so excited about his new baby then a fortnight later we heard laurent had died in some explosion friendly fire its called étienne was inconsolable so was delphine naturally which touched étienne because he felt she was sharing his unhappiness and at least they had a new life to look forward to together then laurents things were sent home with all delphines letters and cruellest of all étiennes little drawing étienne went on the rampage found all laurents letters locked in her jewel case and nearly killed her next day she took an overdose sent me a note begging my forgiveness and asking me to bring up tristan a farm dog bayed down in the valley the little greyhound pricked up its velvet ears and stretched everything was locked in laurents room just as it was when he went off to chad everyone thought étienne was heartbroken but it was the far more painful heartbreak of betrayal hortense lay back exhausted her face very grey i probably shouldnt have told you you should tristan has to know so he can understand étienne and forgive him then as she heard wheels on the gravel banging doors and voices outside i must go dupont et cetera must be here grumbled hortense theyll be devastated im not worse youd better escape out the back ive been doing that all day look lucy plumped up hortenses pillows i wish i didnt have to go its been a privilege dont go all sentimental on me snapped hortense look after my boy she handed lucy a square package that felt like a picture give this to him youve got all the letters havent you show them to him when the time is right but dont let them fall into other hands youll see him again said lucy reassuringly hurry gasped hortense the others will try to stop you still lucy lingered then tugging off her gold locket she hung it round hortenses neck theres a lovely dog inside she stammered hell bring you luck ill need it where im going said hortense wryly theres no return ticket dyou think tristan will fire us asked a worried lucy as wolfie considerably shortened the hired cars life jolting it over dusty carttracks hardly hes still in prison wolfie swung into the road to the airport dont worry well be home by the tea break then seeing the crowd of gendarmes round the gulf on second thoughts perhaps we wont id better drive he swung the car round again we cant leave the gulf said lucy aghast its cecilias now at least ive flown it over halfway to rome for her but its nearly lunchtime we wont get home until early tomorrow morning or until tomorrow midday if we stop somewhere nice for the night youve pulled off a miracle and were going to celebrate the moment he was released on monday morning tristan showered away every speck of prison dirt and drenched himself in eau sauvage to match his mood he then selected black jeans a black shirt and because the temperature had dropped fifteen degrees a dark brown cashmere jersey hed never worn before pale and more shadowed than ever under the eyes he had shed another halfstone in prison and looked as dramatically elongated and demonhaunted as an el greco saint to forget the horrors of prison and to blot out the even more nightmarish prospect of the mail outing him and claudine tomorrow tristan as was his custom plunged into work but as he hurtled the aston towards georges house his dreams of using a polo match under a burning sun as a ritualized symbol of conflict were shattered after a night of torrential rain georges polo field was as full of lakes and as green as ireland his only compensation was driving through a huge puddle and drenching the paparazzi hanging around outside georges massive electric gates inside it was difficult to distinguish the massive police and press presence from georges heavies and the fleet of extras whod been bussed in to act as policemen paparazzi and philips bodyguards behind the house which crouched oxblood red and elephantine on a hill a stretch of park had been levelled into a polo field surrounded by huge bellshaped trees now dark and swollen with rain overhead like a flotilla of battleships hung charcoalgrey clouds on the edge of the field outside a yellow and white striped tent whose roof was buckling under the downpour a small band in red uniforms was dispiritedly wringing out their instruments seeing his arrival the commentator stopped telling the shivering extras in their flowery dresses and pale suits that the gallant marquis of posa had just scored a goal and welcomed back our director tristan de montigny tristan was in no mood for pleasantries ignoring the ripple of applause and the large bienvenu tristan banner he drove over to the unit where the place was under water and in uproar because neither lucy nor wolfie had turned up tristan was appalled it was like coming home on a bleak winter night to find the pipes frozen and the central heating kaput noone had seen them since saturday morning i know theyll be found face down in a field sobbed simone dont be fatuous snapped tristan whod gone cold at the same thought all around him singers whod been soothed and flattered by lucy for the past three months were having tantrums and making fearful fusses about catching cold a fleet of makeup artists had been bussed in anyway to handle all the extras the most experienced hijacked to look after the stars must have graduated from the set of the hammer house of horror granny looked about as menacing as a brylcreemed barbara cartland tab pushy and chloe had vermilion lips and blackringed eyes like brides of dracula mikhails drinkreddened face clashed horribly with his crimson polo shirt why isnt lucy here to sort out my bags and my double chin grumbled baby who having played polo until the stars came out with ruperts cronies then pigged out on taggies sea trout three helpings of loganberry torte and copious glasses of wine was now trying to alleviate his hangover with a massive gin and tonic alpheus was so furious that griselda had hidden his noble brow and chestnut locks under a straw hat with a blues and royals ribbon that hed surreptitiously fed the offending headgear to sharon and trevor whod rushed on to the field noisily tearing it to shreds nemesis had struck swiftly the new makeup artist didnt have lucys blowdrying and colouring skills and alpheus ended up with corkscrew curls the colour of mango chutney and looked like paddy ashdown in a shirley temple wig simone was in hysterics that any continuity had been shot to pieces how could lucy do this to us she stormed manage without her snapped tristan nor had tristan dreamt as the day progressed how much he would miss wolfie to field telephone calls to keep track of his belongings and control the extras rupert had highhandedly sent over a couple of his grooms with all his dogs and all his poloplaying friends dogs because they all wanted their dogs in the film and because one always sees lots of dogs at polo the dogs proceeded to fight and bark and mount each other rupert meanwhile had buggered off to a race meeting at ayr i vish his bloody daughter had gone too grumbled mikhail one of the first sounds tristan heard and ignored was tab yelling her head off in true campbellblack fashion she was desperately nervous about making her polo film début playing against worldclass players even if she had known them since she was a child she had wanted to look ravishing for tristans return and been turned into the town tart by this ghastly makeup it was all lucys fault and where was utterly bloody wolfie to hold her hand find her whip and absorb abuse like a punch bag even worse as mistress of the horse she felt it her duty to see the singers played properly baby was good but mikhail had an unnerving habit of dropping his reins and swinging his stick round with both hands like a tartar warlord as he thundered down the field for gawds sake watch him sexton pleaded with tab having insurance claims already on a murdered producer and a recently absentee director he didnt want mikhail taking out ricky francelynch the england captain or his forwards seb and dommie carlisle mikhail was sulking because georges open house had suddenly become closed when one of georgies heavies had caught him sidling out with a little watteau and a sickert under his polo shirt i know the murderers still at large giggled flora but mikhail seems to be taking bulletproof vests to extremes she still looked haunted and desperately tired as she and george hardly left each others side as soon as the wrap party was over they were off to cornwall with trevor everyone was relieved to have moved away from valhallas dark mazes and haunted cloisters rannaldinis doomladen overture pouring out of the speakers however was a constant reminder that his killer had not been caught the violence of the polo was equally unnerving ponies thundering over grass as slippery as buttered spinach sticks clashing balls hurtling like cannon shot often into the crowd players deliberately colliding the ponies kept jumping out of their thin thoroughbred skins and taking off because the cast upstaging each other continually broke into snatches of their next opera or song cycle to prove there was work after carlos telephone tristan shouted bernard it was claudine in hysterics it was all tristans fault for barging into the cottage in wales the police had already been round her maid was threatening to dump to the express and jeanlouis to divorce her and she would have let me swing thought tristan savagely he remembered gablecross telling him that in big murder cases several marriages always broke up couldnt he get his friend rupert campbellblack to pull strings and stop the mail wailed claudine tristan said hed try and hung up i dont want to be bothered with any calls he ordered jessica who was nervously standing in for wolfie while they were waiting for the cameras to reload and reposition he finally got through to the château hortense was obviously a little better as she was in a meeting unable to be disturbed tristan might not have been so sanguine if hed known with whom he left a message with florence that hed be down on wednesday after the wrap party when they broke for a late lunch jessica said a french lady had rung five times on the unit mobile non non non howled tristan as it rang again i cant talk to anyone next moment he had been buttonholed by alpheus complaining about both tabitha and the makeup artist and chloe complaining that baby was being gratuitously offensive and had nearly ridden his pony over her they were soon joined by pushy could we have another makeup artist i know i can look prettier than this tristan god he missed wolfie to send them packing leaving them in midbellyache on his way to his caravan he passed jessica telling bernard that lucy expected to be back by midmorning tomorrow tristan swung round in fury lucy rang why didnt you put her on you didnt want any calls i didnt mean lucy you stupid bitch get her back at once i didnt take her number stammered jessica appalled by such unaccustomed rudeness you bloody idiot jessica burst into tears tristan couldnt remember being so angry all he had wanted during his lunch break was to pour out his heart to lucy about the horrors of prison and the difficulties of filming polo also because lucy had been so wonderfully comforting when he had found out maxim was his father and had been forced to give up tab he felt he should perhaps have provided the last piece of the jigsaw and levelled with her about claudine he wanted to explain before lucy read about it in tomorrows mail that the love that had obscured his vision for the past three years had suddenly been blown away like mist at sea but if lucy wasnt getting back till midmorning it would probably be too late oh youre wearing my sweater it really suits you it was several seconds before tristan realized the happy voice belonged to rozzy who was looking really pretty all the lines in her face seemed to have ironed out hed forgotten shed given him this jersey she tried to cover up for lucy which was difficult when james shot out of wardrobe and did four pirouettes nearly strangling himself on his lead because he too was pleased to see tristan then he slunk back in despair because he wasnt with lucy ive had to tie him to the table leg because he keeps following me on to the set poor old boy tristan unclipped jamess lead where the hells your mistress shell turn up said rozzy ive got a surprise for you she added leading him towards his caravan which did you like best my tarte aux oignons or the quiche lorraine they were both marvellous mumbled tristan whod been far too uptight to eat anything in prison my god for a second he thought hed let himself into the wrong caravan there were vases of wild flowers everywhere marjoram honeysuckle scabious forgetmenot bellflower thyme wild basil and those dark purple buglelike flowers are called selfheal i picked two vases of them because i know you will heal after your horrible experience youre so kind muttered tristan breathing in the honeysuckle which reminded him of lucys lone sprig in prison how dare rozzy ponce up his caravan all the books and magazines had been straightened all the notes secured under a paperweight the floor was hoovered even the windows cleaned so everyone could see when he was there he wanted to scream its very kind rozzy its been a pleasure she added playfully ive made you a sort of brunch i know how strong you like your coffee sit down and relax ive made you an omelette and mrs brimscombe picked me these with the dew on them this morning rozzy please tristan opened his mouth in protest and rozzy popped a raspberry into it anyway she added as the rattle of rain on the roof increased you cant film at the moment youre incorrigible im not taking non for an answer rozzy got a couple of croissants out of the microwave and dropped one on his side plate for a second tristan was tempted to pour out his problems but rozzy had enough troubles of her own having cut him a slice of omelette primrose yellow and oozing herbs and butter she poured him coffee and orange juice and shoved the butter plate against his side plate as she reached behind him to get the pepperpot out of the cupboard he felt her breasts brush against him and had to steel himself not to flinch rozzy put a hand on his shoulder youre so tense ill give you a massage later suddenly the caravan seemed tiny james sulking on the sofa was no chaperon next moment rozzys hand had clenched on his shoulder as the rain rattle on the roof was augmented by a rattattat on the door i am not going to let people hassle you hissed rozzy hi chaps that looks scrummy griseldas green and purple striped turban came round the door im trying to persuade tristan to eat said rozzy evenly dont force the poor boy nice to have you back griselda added to tristan weve got a problem alpheuss white suit has been nicked for the second time ive ordered another from paris because he wont wear a blazer but if you could wait to shoot his little scene until midday by which time lucy should be back to fix his face i wondered if we could ask her and wolfie to make a detour through paris to pick up his new suit there was another knock it was bernard this time wanting a word with rozzy i do hope theyve had a nice jaunt said griselda slapping unsalted butter and strawberry jam on a croissant as rozzy ran down the caravan steps to the shelter of bernards yellow striped umbrella wolfies such a smashing chap went on griselda with her mouth full and had such a bad time with his father copping it and lucys such a lovely girl but lonely in a way what the hell are you talking about wolfie and lucy went off in the gulf on saturday morning makes a jolly good passion wagon always thought they fancied each other dont talk such fucking rubbish yelled tristan walking out of the caravan slamming the door behind him jumping off the sofa james tried to follow him scraping his long claws against the caravan door and whining hum said griselda helping herself to a slice of cold omelette tristan seems to miss lucy almost more than you do old boy halfway across the field tristan found he was still clutching one of rozzys rosepatterned cups next moment alpheus had descended from one side mikhail from another pushy from still another tabitha has been so rude to me they shouted in unison i wish i cared snarled tristan after two and a half days of gablecrosss interrogation he could cope with scenes only if he were making them hed been so worried that finding out about claudine was going to break lucys heart and now shed buggered off with wolfie and clearly couldnt give a stuff what news from the court in france that lovely country of elegant ways sang chloe to his departing back and everyone giggled then tristan watched saturday nights rushes which he thought were quite awful and said so oscar and valentin whod worked very hard and been rather proud of their efforts looked utterly deflated what has got into our boy sighed oscar the flics obviously put him through it they had all been ecstatic about tristans release but instead of acknowledging their cards and welcomehome banner hed just stalked in and criticized everything im not working with that fucker any more said the crew and cast in unison two things relieved the impasse the rain stopped and bernard frogmarched tristan into his now empty caravan and bawled him out youre behaving like a spoilt child everyones jumpy youre meant to reassure them and as for bullying poor rozzy bernard went an even deeper shade of burgundy red when she spent so long mucking out your caravan and praying for your release in the chapel after that tristan settled down forgot his problems and filmed mêlées skirmishes and baby exchanging sizzling eyemeets with groupies and chucking down his stick in fury when philip ordered him off the field it was still gloomy and overcast however and the only patches of sky blue were the oppositions shirts which must have been specially chosen by griselda to bring out the colour of tabs furiously flashing eyes riding wonderfully wildly and as fiercely as the men a blue toggle holding back her hair and showing off her glorious jawline and cheekbones she seemed to be goading tristan to watch only her but tristan found his eyes drawn to the ponies glossy black dark brown silvergrey gleaming bay and chestnut so polished and rippling with fitness they were so helpful so responsive so neat and athletic so gallant and outwardly unfazed despite being sworn at and clouted round their delicate heads and legs by sticks and balls they reminded him of lucy when rain stopped play again he locked himself in bernards caravan and watched a rough cut gradually his confidence came back tomorrow they had only to film baby careering down the field shoving his pony against tabs pushing her off the line of the ball to score the winning goal this would be followed by alpheus in his splendid white suit summoning carlos inside for an alreadyfilmed pep talk a light days shooting which should be over by two giving them time to tie up any loose ends before the wrap party in the evening tristan felt an almost christlike elation that here were the makings of a great film which even rannaldini would have been proud of the old monster looked divine on the rostrum thanks to lucys makeup she really did deserve an oscar and darling rozzy had been wonderful in her crying scene with hermione christ hed been a shit to her after all shed been through hed better go and apologize the film had been so dark particularly in the last terrible scene that he was amazed to come out to a watery orange sunset dancing midges and housemartins swooping on insects people were gossiping outside their tents and caravans but as he paddled across the drenched field towards wardrobe he heard a bloodcurdling scream followed by a dreadful howling racing through the puddles his heart thumping he leapt the four steps up to the wardrobe caravan steeling himself for more unimaginable horrors he found james shuddering in the far corner and rozzy crouched on the floor keening in the first crazed second he thought that she had knocked over lucys blue bowl of potpourri then drawing nearer he saw the petals were tiny pieces of silk as though someone had shredded the rainbow oh my god groaned griselda behind him its her wrapparty dress shes spent months making it from fragments of silk it had literally been cut to ribbons why should anyone hate me so much wept rozzy they dont they love you pulling her to her feet tristan took her in his arms stroking her hair feeling her tears drenching the jersey she had given him a hovering desperately concerned bernard produced a brandy which triggered off a terrible fit of coughing reminding tristan once again how ill she was dont cry chérie ill buy you another dress within seconds relieved that something at last had happened twenty police led by fanshawe and debbie had surrounded the caravan they were disappointed the crime was going to be hard to date i hung the dress in the back of the cupboard when i came back after glyns birthday party exactly a week ago gasped rozzy between sobs debbie took her hand who knew it was there lucy grisel simone i dont know as the shredded fragments were shoved into a plastic bag for forensic debbie gathered up a handful silk isnt torn or severed looks as if its been chopped up by big pinking shears and tristan shivered as he remembered the speed with which lucy often cut up jamess liver with a big pair of scissors claiming he hated it in lumps oh god it couldnt have been lucy two policemen were left to guard wardrobe everyone else drifted away leaving rozzy with tristan whose hand she still clutched to make a break he crossed the caravan to comfort james who only betrayed his upset by a frantically shuddering body you still havent eaten gulped rozzy let me make you supper feeling an absolute rat but unable to cope with her dark anguish tristan pleaded exhaustion ill collapse if i dont crash out ive got to hold the centre tomorrow your dress being cut to bits is bound to freak everyone out then theres the wrap party forgive me he said as her tears started to flow again ill buy you dinner next week and please go and get yourself a new dress tomorrow reaching in his back pocket he gave her three hundred pounds then a hug outside he found his hovering desperately worried first assistant director try and comfort her he begged then his mind careered off in case lucy doesnt get back in time to make up granny can you ask bermans to put a monks black robes with a pointed hood in a taxi first thing what dyou think to that asked fanshawe ugly said debbie such a nice lady whod deprive her of a lovely dress when shes got so little might be someone with an ancient grievance because she had such a beautiful voice we should recheck those ladies who might have been singing in the wood chloe gloria hermione even flora and all the soprano extras debbie sighed then said she was evidently in tristans caravan for twenty minutes this morning he was so sweet to her tonight could it be the murderer not being able to bear him being nice to anyone back in his caravan soaked to the skin tristan realized he was out of whisky which would not have happened if that little traitor wolfie had been here nor would a pile of post rising almost to the ceiling have been left unopened without wolfie and lucy he felt totally defenceless particularly when there was a knock on the door and a reporter from the scorpion barged in brandishing a bottle of champagne to celebrate his release having seen the first edition of the mail she wondered if they could have a word about claudine lauzerte madame lauzertes been having her gâteau and eating it according to her maid whos dumped in the express and who is very much on your side tristan fuck off howled tristan as she held out her taperecorder after that the reporters descended like a pack of wolves tristan thought they would rip him to pieces fortunately georges heavies were even better at manhandling the press than bribing planning officers or kneecapping little old sitting tenants and had soon escorted tristan to the safety of georges drawing room stay the night said flora handing him a quadruple bells most of the unit seem to be theyre too scared to go back to valhalla tristan didnt need any persuading he went straight to bed and fell into a dreamless sleep alpheus was sweating his american agent had been unable to produce any record of calling him on the night of rannaldinis murder and both chloe and isa had seen and heard him singing outside magpie cottage on monday morning therefore he had had the humiliation of giving a disapproving dc smithson and a smirking dc lightfoot a revised version of his movements on the night of sunday the eighth he had indeed jogged home from the tennis but on seeing a light in magpie cottage had decided to call on tabitha having showered and changed into the first white suit he had nipped into river house to pick tab a posy from hermiones wellstocked garden what he did not reveal was that as he was breaking off hermiones lilies he had been transfixed by the sight of his costar reenacting their great shoveandgrunt scene in the summerhouse with another and stayed and watched them for a minute or two burning with lust he had set out for magpie cottage and told smithson and lightfoot who should have stopped grinning like a jackass that he had indeed sung a favourite aria under tabs window and received a bottle of red wine over his white suit i couldnt see who had thrown it alpheus was damned if he was going to give isa and chloe an alibi he also admitted that next morning he had bagged up the winesoaked suit and given it to the dustmen unfortunately charred fragments of the second gulls egg and grass stained white suit together with white rock rose and chimpanzee orchids identical to the ones used by beattie to plug herself were found in the garden at jasmine cottage suspicion was therefore heavily on alpheus alpheuss day had not improved he was furious about his shirley temple curls and rupert not allowing him to play polo if the third white suit didnt arrive in time he would be forced to wear some tacky blazer and tab had been so rude he was furious with himself for still fancying the brat rotten even worse the dna tests were due back tomorrow which would certainly identify his semen and lord knows what else inside beattie returning to jasmine cottage after filming he poured himself a rare whisky and jumped nervously as the doorbell rang he hoped to god it wasnt any more grizzled lady botanists rolling up to revere the chimpanzee orchid it was very dark outside and at first he thought noone was there then looking down he saw little cosmo one of cosmos best buys acquired for p at the paradise conservative fête had been a secondhand scout uniform in which he always dressed when he was collecting house to house for himself for p alpheus allowed cosmo into jasmine cottage to clean his shoes once inside little cosmo produced his favourite photographs of alpheus outside the summerhouse watching hermione and sexton with twelve lilies in one hand and an enormous hardon in the other when alpheus tore up the photograph cosmo echoing his late father replied that he had the negs let us do a deal suggested cosmo id like cash before i hand over the negs otherwise i thought id offer copies as goingaway presents at the wrap party tomorrow night considerably richer little cosmo left jasmine cottage closing the gate behind him he broke into elisabettas last aria in a flawless treble then pedalled off on his bike into the gloom with a maniacal cackle alpheus gave a shiver could little cosmo have murdered his father and beattie to gain control of the memoirs having been too tired to draw the curtains tristan was woken at four by pegasus aries and taurus a veritable zoo of brilliant stars blazing in through the big square window and a silver glow in the east switching on the wireless he learnt of storms causing havoc to flights and crosschannel ferries he hoped a returning wolfie and lucy would be struck by lightning or horrendously seasick then he remembered despairingly that he was still maxims bastard son without any money and that in a few hours the world would be picking over his affaire with claudine perhaps her husband would call him out and he would die impaled on a sword like beattie on rannaldinis unicorn his musings on the ruins of his life were interrupted by a forecast of a beautiful day with temperatures in the nineties opening the window he breathed in the smell of meadowsweet and wet earth and felt a warm breeze caressing his skin then he noticed the cathedral spire black on the horizon as the grand inquisitors pointed hood and remembered he had only one day left to make a great film oscar was aghast to be woken so early anticipating a light halfdays shooting he and valentin had been out on the toot on the bedside table was a halfeaten parma ham and artichoke baguette an empty moët bottle and a glass of red wine in which several moths had drowned by hastily pulling up the duvet over jessicas russet curls oscar revealed her bright mauve toenails its going to be a scorcher announced tristan and we are going to reshoot all yesterdays scenes then cutting short oscars stream of expletives we can do it if we really motor i want polo under a burning sun as a contrast to the hunt in winter jessica has booked everyones plane tickets and tomorrow they will disperse not necessarily to the right place tristan waggled jessicas left foot but to different parts of the world this is our last chance tell bernard to round everyone up i want to start shooting by nine this is the last time i work for you said oscar draining the glass of red moths and all by a miracle rené the finest makeup artist in france who had made claudine look so delectable in the lily in the valley had yesterday been discovered to be available for a fat fee and a favour to tristan and an even fatter fee from parismatch for an interview on his days work by eight oclock he was busy transforming hungover geese into swans by nine oclock by even more of a miracle all tristans troops in various states of disarray including ruperts polo friends had assembled on georges field for a pep talk giving them no time to gossip over the daily mail or let the alkaseltzers melt in their glasses tristan quietly told them exactly how much they had to get through and how long they could allow for each setup this is the clock he pointed to the big tickless clock that timed the polo chukkas at the end of the field this is the schedule there will be no tantrums we are going to concentrate and get it right on the first take surreptitiously reading the mail folded to the size of a cd case oscars eyebrows were getting nearer and nearer to his widows peak no wonder tristan was uptight yesterday he murmured to valentin and where does this put tabitha oooh squawked jessica looking over oscars shoulder youre in the paper tristan froggy would awooing go what a gorgeous picture of you and oh my goodness put that away and just shut up tristans voice wiped any incipient grins off peoples faces i would dearie whispered meredith stemming jessicas protest with half a buttered croissant hes not as sunny as usual have a read in the break there will be no breaks said tristan icily weve got our director back muttered ogborne to bernard at least on a polo field there wont be any pretty ornaments for meredith and simone to fight over except the players giggled meredith gazing in wonder at ruperts friends ricky francelynch and the carlisle twins oscar glanced round at rainfluffed already turning trees at the emeraldgreen pitch the wonderful view dotted with russet villages fields striped where the hay had been cut and pale gold where the wheat ripened the blue curve of the river fleet emerging from the mist and sighed with pleasure tristan was right to reshoot but what the hell is rupert going to say of all the fucking twotiming shits roared rupert brandishing the mail whatevers the matter said taggie aghast montignys been screwing madame lauzerte for the past three years they only released him from gaol because he was caught bonking her in wales the night rannaldini was murdered oh the beast wailed taggie and all the time hes been twotiming darling little tab i never liked him poncy intellectual you cant trust the frogs and he had the gall to summon her onto the set by nine oclock she mustnt see the mail itll break her heart tristan was very white when he came off the telephone to rupert hes one to talk said meredith indignantly there was a frightful scandal some years ago when it came out that hed been rogering amanda hamilton who was not only aeons older than him and the wife of the finance minister but also liked being spanked ruperts conveniently forgotten all that dont let it faze you i wont said tristan he knew exactly what he wanted rattling out orders like a kalashnikov driving everyone seldom had there been such tension on a film but despite police everywhere and a murderer in their midst by one thirty they had beaten the clock by one minute twenty seconds they had shot mêlées cavalry charges throwins and polo groupies slavering over baby chucking down his stick the temperature was rising steadily the grass drying off fast mist swirled upwards all over the park at any moment the puddles would boil over the extras even if they did all look like claudine lauzerte had cooperated all the way the discipline of the crew despite thumping headaches had been superb there was just alpheuss little scene and tabs big one when she rode baby off and they could wrap claudines pompous husband is close friend of papa simone whispered to griselda should i accept huge sum for interview with the daily express of course sweetie imagine tristan and claudine being an item jolly humiliating for little tab to lose out to a woman nearly three times her age tab the only person not cooperating was in a worse mood than yesterday sending alpheus and bernard flying with her pony and yelling at wardrobe because her polo shirt had suddenly become too loose her toggle too shiny her hat too big and her boots too revoltingly new she had also refused to let rené make her up i dont want to look like bloody claudine lauzerte even though rené was raving over her beauty look at the length of her nose and the eyes and the moulding of her face she must steal the show thats another reason for wanting to murder her said chloe sourly i think we can take it shes read the mail now tab was bawling out the props department youve put out the wrong fucking saddle for my pony mines got a blue and black check saddlecloth none of this would have happened if flaming wolfie had been here wolfie and lucy learnt in st malo that tristan had been released and duly celebrated the following morning they caught the early boat while lucy was buying a large bottle of femme for rozzy for looking after james wolfie picked up the mail turned green and hastily hid it the bastard he thought furiously how could tristan have done that to poor darling tab he must get home and comfort her having dumped the hired car at st malo they took a taxi back to valhalla to steady her nerves lucy took increasing nips from a bottle of brandy shed bought for tristan last night she had written him a long letter explaining everything she had learnt at montvert and then sealed it into a huge brown envelope which contained all the other relevant material then she wrote tristan de montigny private and confidential on the outside she had also washed her hair shaved her legs bronzed them with piz buin then in a st malo boutique she had spent too much money on a lovely shortskirted sleeveless dress in wild rose pink and on a sexy sophisticated scent called fracas to wear at the wrap party now she could only think in a few minutes ill see tristan and ill die of excitement but after tomorrow i wont see him any more and ill die at valhalla she was disappointed to find no james in her caravan rozzy must have taken him on the set unzipping one of the bench seat cushions she hid all tristans parcelledup papers and paintings inside it was so hot she changed into her new pink dress took another slug of brandy and because of her shaking hands rather overdrenched herself in fracas someone had taken wolfies land rover over to georges house so instead he grabbed rannaldinis pearlescent orange lamborghini which looked much in need of a jaunt he whistled as lucy jumped in beside him that dress is sensational georges gates were so swarming with police and press wolfie had to produce his passport why did you and i go through all that he asked wryly as he stormed up the drive just to enable two people were absolutely crazy about to end up together at least well be giving tristan the best wrapparty present ever said lucy raising the bottle to her lips thank you wolfie for everything its a pity she added wistfully you and i dont fancy each other ive known more unlikely things said wolfie pulling up on the edge of the field thinking how pretty she looked with her pale cheeks flushed and her pink dress showing off her long legs he amazed himself by taking her in his arms and burying his lips in hers wow gasped lucy when he finally let her go you are the most terrific kisser pulling his blond head down she kissed him again unfortunately pearlescent orange lamborghini diablos are very noticeable particularly with meredith turning pale and crying out to everyone as they reassembled after the break my god rannaldinis cars just rolled up on the opposite side of the field most people were therefore vastly relieved when instead of a blackcloaked ghost lucy and wolfie hastily wiping off lipstick emerged giggling from the lamborghini must go and find james lucy set off unsteadily towards wardrobe must go and make my peace with bernard said wolfie setting off nervously towards the set heavens there were a lot of police around the extras in the stands granny in his press box the marquees the band were all massed on the south side of the field to allow the camera team in their car to race unimpeded up and down the north side wolfie bellowed mikhail cantering up on a smart bay pony how vas your dirty veekend everyone screamed with laughter and surged forward tripping over cables to hug him it was just the tensionbreaker they needed have a drink said ogborne thrusting a beer can into wolfies hand thank god youre back to defuse tristan and tabitha on cue up thundered tab leaping off her pony and pummelling her way into the crowd hi there mumbled wolfie turning very red next moment hed turned even redder as tab whacked him viciously across the face with the palm then the back of her hand bastard she screamed how could you leave everyone in the lurch and let tristan down like that how am i expected to organize the ponies on my own and star in the film youve let me down as well i hate you she was about to slap him again when seeing how handsome he was even with his navy blue eyes watering with pain she burst into tears and pummelled her way out of the crowd again dont worry wolfie griselda clouted him on the shoulder there isnt a soul she hasnt bawled out girls suffering from posttristan tension lucy meanwhile was waiting for a rail of dresses or one of the trestle tables covered in pastelcovered shoes suddenly to take off towards her as a tethered james bounded forward in rapturous excitement to her horror no dog materialized wheres james she asked rozzy after shed hugged her and handed over the bottle of femme in your caravan hes not then he must have jumped out of the window mrs brimscombes cindys on heat hell turn up why didnt you bring him asked lucy trying not to sound panicky or accusing he ran on to the field after a squirrel yesterday and nearly brought down one of the ponies tristan banished him said rozzy slightly defensively he wouldnt eat or settle while you were away then he got all excited on sunday night when i said mummys coming home but when you didnt he gradually lost heart then seeing lucys anguished face rozzy added hastily dont worry im sure its some bitch lucy yelled griselda rushing up with an armful of polo boots thank god youre back dear old renés taken over and made everyone including mikhail look like claudine lauzerte can you do granny first alpheus second i darent tread on renés toes said lucy in horror well for a start youve got to do something about alpheuss hair hes now called surly temple said baby leaning down from his pony and hugging lucy we have missed you i must find james and tristan and tab to explain muttered a distracted lucy then catching sight of a pile of tack on a nearby table thats tabs saddle the one with the blue and black check saddlecloth well im not giving it to her in her present mood said rozzy you take it lucy as she carried the saddle past handsome players on their shining ponies and breathed in the intoxicating smell of old leather dung sweating horse and expensive aftershave and heard the thundering of hoofs the bagpipe skirl of excited neighing and the chatter of the crowd accompanying rannaldinis overture she realized how right tristan had been to want polo to kickstart the film next moment granny had erupted from the press box tearing off his hot black inquisitors robes to roars of applause and revealing an elegant body adorned only by lavender silk boxer shorts lucy lucy im roasted alive in these clothes please turn me into gordon dillon again serve him right for burning all those heretics giggled meredith i must say the old dears kept his figure hello lucy how was my beautiful france shouted oscar lovely shouted back lucy embarrassed but touched as everyone gathered round everyone that is except tristan who by sheer willpower had driven his army on through the morning victory had been in sight now anarchy had broken out as all the troops deserted their posts to welcome lucy nor had his temper been improved on looking through valentins long lens to see wolfie and lucy in an orange lamborghini and a passionate embrace monsieur de montigny could i have a word about claudine lauzerte asked lynda leepotter who was snazzily disguised as a policewoman not a single syllable i talk enough to the flics snarled tristan get back to fucking work he roared at the crowd around lucy her cheeks were flushed her eyes sexily smudged her long legs smooth and brown below the clinging pink dress moving closer tristan caught a whiff of brandy which annoyed him almost as much as the fracas wafting muskily from her hot excited body instead of the usual sweet delicate bluebell the diatribe pouring forth was mostly in french but lucy got the gist that tristan felt she had been totally irresponsible that she had wrecked yesterdays shoot by buggering up any hope of continuity and had now come back to rot up this one totally appalled that a mouth that was made for kissing drinking red wine and quoting poetry should be shouting such terrible things lucy remained speechless couldnt you have waited two more days to push off on your dirty little weekend howled tristan get out youre fired youve got it wrong stammered lucy we only went to france to i dont want to know interrupted tristan collect your cheque from production and get out you ungrateful bastard screamed lucy after all wolfie and i have done for you and still clutching tabs saddle she fled back to wardrobe whaddja do that for baby turned furiously on tristan youll have a strike on your hands strike and you wont be paid a penny yelled tristan get back on that pony and you get back into those black robes he roared at granny then scowling round wheres wolfgang so i can fire him too late sighed meredith happily grisels just dispatched him to bristol airport to collect alpheuss suit tristans just fired me lucy stumbled into wardrobe sobbing helplessly oh darling cried rozzy putting down her steam iron to hold out her arms im so sorry dont cry hell calm down hes just got so much on his plate hes still an ungrateful bastard hes convinced wolfie and i have been bonking all weekend when weve been working our backsides off proving he can marry tab after all i dont know why we bothered have you told him rozzy handed lucy a wodge of kleenex no wolfie can then hearing tab yelling outside oh god ive still got her saddle i cant cope with her bawling me out as well you give it to her i must go and find james hell i havent got a car take mine said rozzy tears blinding her lucy somehow reached valhalla she was so furious and upset she went straight to the production office and wrote a furious letter to tristan this is to let you know youre a montigny and can marry your precious tabitha and be happy after all you ungrateful pig dont be horrible to wolfie im going to give all the papers and photos and things you need for proof to rozzy having printed off the letter she wrote dearest tristan at the top and your loving lucy at the bottom and streaked the ink with her tears she was shoving the envelope into tristans pigeonhole when she caught sight of a ravishing photograph of him on the front of the daily mail how young and carefree he looked she was just tearing it out when she noticed the pictures beneath one of claudine lauzerte and another slightly blurred of claudine with her hair rather too long for a middleaged woman some would say streaming down her back as she kissed a beautiful darkhaired boy who was fingering her cheekbones in wonder their eyes were shut but their long long eyelashes tangled lucy gave a moan slowly agonizingly she read the copy and understood why tristan had never made passes why he disappeared to his room early but never seemed to sleep much why he was always so sad the prince with the heavy heart and how ludicrous had been all those speculations that he was impotent or terrified of women or in love with some smooth older man like cary grant in to catch a thief when all the time he was sleeping with the most beautiful woman in france how idiotic for lucy herself to pretend she had thought of anyone but him since december or that every drop of makeup every false eyelash hadnt been put on his singers to please him it had been the best makeup she had ever done because it had been an act of love she had only gone to france in the faint hope that tristan might realize he loved her not tab but all the time neither tab nor she had been in the frame how he must have loved claudine not to betray her i love him she sobbed in a frenzy of despair no pain could be more unendurable but there could be when she got back to her caravan there was no james to whack his tail against the walls and squeak with joy neither the police nor any of the local rescue kennels had news of him when she rang in increasing panic with a shiver she remembered the gypsy encampment outside paradise which had moved on since she and wolfie had left for france maybe they had stolen james or he had gone back to his own people to die noticing rozzys endofshoot presents all beautifully wrapped in purple paper and shocking pink ribbons lucy was creepily reminded of alpheuss dressinggown weeping with despair she plunged into the woods in search of james back at rutminster hall gablecross and karen had watched the filming of babys winning goal now the crew was setting up for babys and tabithas rideoff looking round at the ravening media baying for blood and the massive police presence watching from the house or mingling with the extras or hiding in the trees that surrounded georges increasingly churnedup polo field gablecross felt a growing unease all this attention only exacerbates the problem he muttered to karen murderers get off on it theyre turned on when they read about themselves it pushes them into overdrive but even more ominously tristan and madame lauzerte have shoved our killer off the front pages the only way he can get back again is to commit another murder hes outwitted a massive international murder hunt but ultimately he gets his biggest buzz out of someone knowing exactly how clever hes been which means hell have to kill again so that beforehand he can boast to his victim how he did it karen shivered the polo had been so glamorous she had hitherto thoroughly enjoyed herself several photographers had taken her picture the dashing carlisle twins had asked what she was doing later glancing round she said weve got an almost full cast of suspects except wolfie and lucy replied gablecross whom interpol had alerted of their arrival in england hello tim hello karen it was rozzy with two cups of coffee i gather you went home yesterday how did you like glyn very much lied karen hes a charmer said rozzy wistfully was sylvia much in evidence no lied gablecross i hope youll catch the murderer today rozzy lowered her voice because were all dispersing tomorrow ill miss you both so much the feelings mutual have you seen lucy she was here confided rozzy she and wolfie went all the way to france to clear tristans name and the beast has gone and fired her the poor darlings rushed off to valhalla in floods sorry to hear about your lovely dress said karen horrible wasnt it for a second rozzys eyes brimmed but tristan whos a darling when hes not being a beast gave me some money to buy another so i rushed into rutminster first thing find anything nice asked karen in peggy parkers of all unlikely places i thought she was all lurex and sequins gablecross looked at his watch tristan and oscar were still fussing over lights anxious to get going before their ponies became maddened by flies ricky francelynch and the carlisle twins were pointedly hitting balls to one another ouch yelled sexton as one hit him on the ankle ow christ ere comes trouble he added as parting crowds and crew like a flea comb rupert stalked up to tristan have you got some sort of deathwish he hissed how dare you reshoot everything when were so pushed for time and money and if you think im going to put a farthing into your crappy production after the way you screwed up my daughter why didnt you level with her that you were regularly ramming ten inches of parisian sausage into that geriatric claudine lauzerte amazing you could get in for the cobwebs dont clench those frog fists at me you havent got a jambe to stand on rupert seized tristans arm and was clearly about to thump him when sexton bravely interceded look rupe we all know youre fired up but we are against the clock so why dont you castrate and incinerate tristan and tug out his toenails after weve wrapped valentin burst out laughing rupert was dickering whether to deck sexton and valentin as well when everyone was distracted by the arrival of hermione flanked by outriders waving graciously from the back of an open limo like gulls following a plough a flock of paparazzi had crashed the party in her wake i have come to stand by my director tristan de montigny in his hour of need she was loudly confiding to hundreds of black taperecorders my heart also goes out to claudine lauzerte and her husband jeanlouis the minister of cultural affairs at this difficult time were you aware dame hermione that tristan was having a far from cultural affaire with madame lauzerte shouted james whitaker below the belt james said hermione reproachfully tristan certainly was said adam helliker to howls of mirth are you in this scene dame hermione asked classic fm magazine indeed hermione inclined her huge flamingopink picture hat but only as a face in the crowd you cant hermsie seizing her hand sexton helped her out of the limo the point of this scene is that carlos is ordered by philip to dump his polo totties and marry an unseen frog princess namely you it blows your cover if youre seen in the crowd but polo is international pouted hermione it would be logical for elisabetta to jet down for a chukka or two god in heaven tristan clutched his head well have to shoot round her now where is my son whose photography hermione turned back proudly but little cosmo had jumped limo and was ringing ladbrokes who were taking bets on who had killed rannaldini cosmo was gratified that his mother was but decided to put a couple of hundred each on his stepbrother wolfgang and meredith his putative fathers boyfriend neither of whom appeared to have any alibi the burning sun was boring through tabithas hat at any moment shed burst into flames having screamed at everyone on the set she was now leaning against her pony a beautiful grey gelding called the ghost unable to mount until her missing saddle turned up flora whod been gossiping to baby came over with a glass of iced orange juice gee thanks said tab listlessly you are lucky keeping baby as a friend tristan wont even speak to me even george seems to like baby now george now knows that babys only a friend and that his heart lies entirely elsewhere said flora then realizing what shed said added hastily oh look grannys back in the press box in his black robes such a surreal sinister touch last time i acted with granny i was nearly burnt to death shuddered tab oh my god she whispered for there away from the crowd his glossy black hair gleaming his shadow as misshapen and knowing as a velazquez dwarf the personification of darkness in that burning afternoon sun stood isa what the hell are you doing here croaked tab come to wish my wife and my old friend good luck mocked isa never taking his eyes off baby oh help thought flora in terror isas the one hes just the right height to pass himself off as the ghost of rannaldini and he exudes such evil up galumphed griselda oblivious of any tension ive found tabs saddle at last it was under a table she shouted as she handed it to ruperts groom dizzy who slapped it onto the ghost tightened his girths and pulled down the stirrups hes ready tab she cried but tab was gazing up at baby whod gone even whiter than she had so youre the one isa loves she whispered noone fucking told me you bastard baby dépêchezvous tab shouted bernard how longs it been going on hissed tab before our marriage i suppose youd like me out of the way wouldnt you she was taunting baby now in your present mood anyone would snapped baby gathering up his reins isa probably wants your horses back hissed tab my father wont want to train them when he hears what youve been up to picking up the vibes babys mare nearly took off come on tab everyones waiting chided dizzy giving her a leg up rozzy rushed forward to give her boots a last polish griselda tucked in her shirt and smoothed down her breeches rené took the shine off her nose with a powder brush your collars sticking up tab cried out simone a little piece of hairs come loose from your toggle cried rozzy oh fuck off the lot of you screamed tab cool it tab yelled ricky francelynch please dont shout grumbled dommie carlisle ive got a bloody awful headache shouldnt have spent last night shagging someone called pissy or cushy ogborne revved up the car valentin in the passenger seat could see through his long lens the players shouting at each other the ponies legs a jumble against the pink faces and pretty clothes of the excited crowd rannaldinis overture was echoing round the field quiet please everyone yelled bernard were turning over clocking the loathing on babys face tab panicked hes going to kill me she thought but it was too late as ogborne trod on the accelerator tristan in the back of the car had shouted action ricky francelynch stroked the ball to baby who hit it perfectly galloping after it towards goal too fast thought rupert in sudden terror as tab came thundering in at an angle to push him off the ball but babys pony held firm and dapplegrey and chestnut shoulders met in a shunt so forceful it took both horses off the ground in a cloud of dust but gave tab the slight advantage to stroke the ball back upfield to safety wonderful breathed tristan keep rolling but as tab leant over putting her whole weight on her right stirrup to take the backhand the leather gave way like a broken arm there was no way she could save herself she was toppling over next moment the ground came hurtling up to meet her the crowd gave a collective scream of horror fuck i wonder if weve shot enough tristan was horrified to find himself thinking particularly when tab remained in a huddled heap the ghost was running around trailing his reins ambulances and police cars were careering across the field baby was instantly off his pony pleading as he knelt down beside tab oh angel im sorry please be ok but tab didnt move whiter than the burning sun above from the horrible angle of her head to her body baby knew she had broken her neck rupert whod vaulted on to someones pony beat the police cars and ambulances turn that fucking music off whyd you have to hit her so hard he yelled at baby then catching sight of his motionless daughter he dropped to his knees beside her oh my christ her stirrup with its broken leather was still attached to her foot driving back with alpheuss suit taking a shortcut through one of georges side gates wolfie heard a wail of sirens through a screen of hogweed blond grasses and mauve willowherb he saw an ambulance belting towards the main gates abandoning the lamborghini in the gateway to the field where all the unit was parked he tore after the ambulance which was temporarily trapped behind a hay lorry who is it he begged a cameraman running in the other direction campbellblacks daughter looks nasty catching up with the ambulance wolfie drummed his fists frenziedly on the back door until it opened a fraction you cant come in said an ambulance man putting his head out i bloody can whats the matter with her are you a relative brother gasped wolfie seeing his blond hair and normally ruddy face now as white as tabs they allowed him in then were slightly startled when he began gabbling away in german beseeching tab to live wolfie was magnificent he comforted and found cups of tea for his sobbing stepmother and later for a stunned horrified taggie he conjured up a large whisky for rupert and by acting as mediator defused the situation when ruperts explosions of rage looked like antagonizing the hospital staff he also remained icily calm when the specialist listed the terrible alternatives so he could translate the details albeit watered down to the others who were too shocked to take them in tab had been rushed into intensive care where xrays had mercifully ruled out a broken neck or a fractured skull but they would have to watch out she didnt develop a subdural oedema what the fucks that cant you speak english the specialists lips tightened a blood clot inside the cavity of the brain mr campbellblack well keep examining her pupils for signs of bleeding under the skull and if you find them wolfies voice shook only slightly well whizz her straight off to a neurosurgeon and drill straight through the skull helens sobs redoubled shell be all right wolfie put an arm round her shoulders how dyou fucking know snapped rupert and how long before we find out du lieber gott beseeched wolfie for the thousandth time dont extinguish something so vibrant and lovely he had never seen anyone so pale against tabs face the white sheets spattered with blood from another nosebleed seemed warm as ivory nothing could be more inert than her little hand which lay in his as cold and as still as a pebble on the shore helen snivelling gently was holding the other hand in the corner sat a motionless taggie and a silent xavier who had insisted on coming but who looked absolutely frozen with shock rupert pacing up and down outside was the first to see fanshawe and debbie whaddja want hows mrs lovell unconscious fanshawe steeled himself im sorry sir but im afraid were treating her fall as attempted murder then seeing the fury in ruperts face her righthand stirrup leather was cut through probably with a penknife and that happened in a place crawling with cops why the hell should anyone want to kill tab fanshawe refrained from pointing out that tab had achieved an alltime high in bloodiness over the last few days thats what were trying to find out sir can you remember who was near her while she was mounting nicking the leather would have only taken a couple of seconds dizzy my head groom saddled the pony said rupert but shes been with me for ever she adores tab also rupert screwed up his eyes dizzy gave her a leg up so no weight would have been put on the leather grisel brought the saddle over grisels an old softie she wouldnt hurt tab there was that makeup poofter rené and simone shes a duck and rozzy that drip whos bats about tristan isa her bastard of a husband was there baby mikhail everyone really lucy latimer was holding the saddle when tristan sacked her said debbie but shes done a bunk evidently searching for her dog we gather mrs lovell was upset because someone put the wrong saddle on her pony added fanshawe and there was a long delay before lady griselda discovered the right one under the table in wardrobe tabs saddlecloth is a very distinctive blue and black check said rupert everyone on the unit would have recognized it and known tab would be wanting it later so the murderer could have cut the leather much earlier and will strike again hes tried to kill tab before snarled rupert why the hell havent you put a hundred men round this hospital tab was in a twilight of pain black clouds whirled before her eyes then became smoky grey mist but as if they were thick elasticated cobwebs try as she might she couldnt struggle through them ahead shone a blinding light perhaps she was dead and had reached the other side to the right she could make out a shadowy angel with a clipboard who was ticking people off as they disappeared into the light tab was frantic to go through too gertrude she croaked i must say im sorry to gertrude shes not here at the moment the angel consulted the clipboard and were not ready for you either there are people on earth who need you and tab had groaned as the mists came down again but suddenly they were clearing again and she could see wolfie sitting on a chair he looked so sad but try as she might she couldnt call out to him not even when a little white dog with a black patch trotted into the room gertrude gertrude again tab tried to speak but no words came out after licking her hand the little white dog trotted purposefully over to wolfie and nudged his knees until he bent down and picked her up having licked his face which seemed to be glistening with tears gertrude curled up with a contented sigh on his knee once again tab battled to speak but the mists descended blacker than ever then they cleared and gertrude had gone it was the most enormous struggle but finally she managed to whisper wolfie im here next minute her hands were seized and wolfie was gazing down at her trying to stop more tears pouring out of his reddened eyes even more unable to speak than she was oh wolfie she whispered gertrudes ghost came in and jumped on your knee she was so happy to be there i know she was telling me shes forgiven me and youre the one and everythings going to be all right oh wolfie you have got a halo i love you so much her voice faded as she drifted off to sleep again wolfie stumbled into the corridor where he found rupert she came round thank christ did she make sense not at all she was gabbling on about gertrudes ghost then she said she loved me his voice broke she must be delirious next moment he had collapsed on the sofa put his head in his hands and burst into agonizing sobs im so sorry to be a wimp rupert but i thought she was going to die and i love her so much i know you do said rupert in an unsteady voice but shes going to be ok tabs first question when she came round was why did you go to france because you told me to and why have you been crying i was worried then steeling himself because he felt he must level with her tristan backed off from you earlier in the summer because hed been told by my father that there was bad blood in his family and he should never have children lucy and i went to france to prove it wasnt true so now he can marry you if you want him to he took her hands again you and lucy went all that way tabs forehead wrinkled trying to understand so youre not in love with lucy of course not why were you kissing her then theres nothing wrong with your memory said wolfie trying to smile we were comforting each other we thought you loved tristan ive been so jealous mumbled tab this is seriously embarrassing but once youd gone away i realized it was you i loved not tristan hes so ratty and obsessed with his film i feel safe with you ive wanted to kill lucy for the last few days wolfie was struck dumb again as the colour flooded his incredulous bewildered hopeful face your father he mumbled hed never approve im threequarters kraut a quarter italian a rannaldini and a disinherited one at that that doesnt matter a stuff dad really likes you tab stretched up her hand to touch his face youre much more his cup of earl grey than tristan he loathes intellectuals how dyou feel now wolfie trapped her hand covering the palm with kisses my head aches but my heart doesnt any more you mustnt try to talk i dont want to talk i want to kiss you i shouldnt be doing this to tristan thought wolfie but he bent his head and very gently kissed her dry lips which immediately opened stop that at once you must not excite the patient said an outraged nurse whod bustled in with a torch to check tabs pupils yes he must tabs hand clamped round wolfies neck its exactly what she does need outside rupert trying to get through to gerald portland had to cope with another casualty this time it was xavier sobbing his heart out rupert was touched perhaps at last his son was mellowing towards his stepsister its all my fault wailed xav tab was so horrible this morning i prayed shed die for a second rupert had difficulty in keeping a straight face it seems you didnt pray hard enough he said gravely shes getting better by the minute will she be coming back to live with us xav asked gloomily looking through the glass into tabs room rupert could see wolfie taking off tabs wedding ring and throwing it in the bin i rather doubt it he said dyou think her horrible mother could go and live with them both five minutes later walking at speed along the corridor tristan went slap into rupert and steeled himself for more abuse but rupert seemed in an excellent mood shes come round go and say hello as tristan tiptoed in wolfie slid out without a word outside he leant his hot forehead against a cool corridor window raising two sets of crossed fingers to the skies my poor darling ow are you tristan took tabs hand ok she forced herself to look at him after a day in the sun he was going brown again shed forgotten how handsome he was look she muttered i know i threw myself at you wolfie told me why you backed off but you mustnt feel guilty about claudine because im in love with wolfie tristan noticed her ringless finger and her mudsplattered face only the ticking clock broke the long long silence i know you are looking up tab was amazed to see happiness and sweetness in his face darling tab you gave me the most beautiful night of my life i thought i was so in love with you and i with you and i still think wolfie is the luckiest guy in the world you shouldnt look so relieved grumbled tab it isnt very flattering it isnt very flattering that your father looks ecstatic as well im sorry chérie ive been like a bear with a hurt head and you had that orrible fall wolfie thinks youll be cross with him au contraire i come not for wolfies blood but his car keys when he saw ambulance he leave lamborghini across gateway so the unit cannot get in or out his burglar alarm is going off every second so sylvestre is going apesheet worst of all alpheuss suit is locked inside so we cannot film last scene the moment tristan returned to the set an anxious rozzy asked after tab out of danger said tristan happily and absolutely crazy about wolfie which lets me off the hook oh im so pleased for them both sighed rozzy taking alpheuss suit from him i wonder if it needs a press dont bother said tristan oh rozzy i was such a bastard to lucy earlier now im worried stiff someone tried to kill tab they slashed your dress yesterday the murderers on the rampage and lucys not answering her mobile leave a message on her bleeper ive been leaving them all day i need her to make up alpheus we can cover his shirley temple curls with straw hat but only lucy can give those commonplace features an air of nobility and to tell the truth confessed tristan wryly i shouted at her because i miss her so much ill find her rozzy patted his shoulder dont worry rupert managed to catch the five fifty news on a hospital television that pompous ass gerald portland was giving a press conference at rutminster police station he was flaunting a purple spotted tie with a purple striped shirt and kept smoothing his chestnut hair for the cameras we are treating this incident as attempted murder he was telling the rugger scrum of reporters but happily i can confirm that tabitha lovell is no longer in a lifethreatening condition after that portlands emergency meeting of the inner cabinet was most embarrassingly interrupted by an apoplectic telephone call from rupert i merely said she was no longer in a lifethreatening condition mr campbellblack dont be fucking stupid the person whos just tried to kill her for a second time has already killed two people and tried to bump off half a dozen more and is still on the loose if that isnt fucking threatening her life i dont know what is all you overpaid cretins do is waste taxpayers money chasing the wrong people we are about to make an arrest said portland huffily well until the killers behind bars i want a dozen men guarding tab at the hospital and while youre on never never never wear spots with stripes bastard portland slammed down the telephone but nothing could dent his euphoria the dna testing had at last produced a match who is it guv begged dc lightfoot in excitement gerry portland turned to gablecross not without a certain satisfaction im afraid its your girlfriend lucy latimer tim i dont believe it nor do i said karen indignantly she never had a castiron alibi went on portland she was allegedly walking that dog when both rannaldini and beattie copped it and her dna profile showed up in rannaldinis saliva and in the bite on beatties shoulder she was carrying tabithas saddle when tristan fired her that probably pushed her over the top and her fingerprints and fibres from tabs stirrup leather were found all over the penknife on her keyring which kevin and debbie portland grinned at fanshawe and debbie unearthed from a binbag outside wardrobe latimer must have been frantic to get rid of it the murderer must have stolen her keys snapped gablecross who had only recently come off the telephone to wolfie why should lucy want to kill tab when shed just come back from france where shed specially gone to clear tristans name so he could marry tab very subtle said fanshawe nastily after such altruism noone would suspect her of murdering tab then she could have tristan for herself her total total obsession is behind the whole thing you and karen were the first people to suss how crazy she was about him then why did she kill rannaldini demanded karen because he was going to tell the world maxim was tristans father explained gerald portland she killed beattie for the same reason rannaldini had humiliated her by making a pass at her its in his memoirs psychopaths cant stand being belittled and rannaldini was also threatening to tell tristan she was crazy about him she tried to kill tab because she couldnt bear her to have tristan doesnt add up muttered gablecross fraid it does said fanshawe patronizingly everyone tristan favoured got warned off granvilles patchwork quilt floras fox poor rozzys dress cut to ribbons putting petrol in the water cans all the work of a mad person what about the adder in lucys makeup box pleaded karen a plant made her look like a victim same as showing tim the burn from the poisoned champagne on her tablecloth shes diabolically clever like all psychos she failed twice with tab but shell strike again i swear she hasnt done it the dnas conclusive tim its always the quiet ones said portland not unkindly latimer spent so much time making other people beautiful but they got the clapping for the first time in her life shes got a bigger audience than they ever will then he turned briskly to fanshawe and debbie go and pull her in well done both of you where is she asked gablecross dully searching the valhalla woods for her dog but weve got tails on her and she keeps ringing to check if he has been handed in next time well nail her you and karen better go and keep an eye on tabitha at rutminster general tim we dont want any slipups the ultimate putdown thought gablecross savagely the hound demoted to guarddog lucy had been searching for hours shouting herself hoarse running herself into a state of collapse to add to her frustration her mobile wouldnt work in the wood so she had to keep returning to the house or the paradise cheltenham road to ring the police and the local dog sanctuaries purplishblack clouds were massing on the horizon and the wind had risen tangling her hair after yesterdays downpour the woodland floor was impossibly slippery her legs were lacerated by bramble cables and nettles her face and arms scratched her knees bruised and bleeding where she had continually fallen over but she felt no pain except desolation james james her voice echoed mockingly back at her the hot heavy air carried every sound except a joyful bark to the clay shoots banging away in anticipation of august was added a rumble of thunder untranquillized james would bolt halfway to london returning to the road once more she punched out the number of rutminster police station its lucy latimer again ringing about james a big red shaggy lurcher he slipped his collar so he hasnt got a name tag who did you say lucy latimer she could hear a hand thudding over the receiver then a mans voice calm but quivering with excitement where are you lucy to the north of hangmans wood come back to the big house then after a pause weve got good news for you oh my god hes red and shaggy thats the one meet us at your caravan lucy crying with relief her loafers squelching in sympathy lucy ran all the way oh please please please let it be james an extraordinary garish light was gilding the wheatfields turning the valhalla lawns a dayglo emerald silver streams were hurtling down the valley into an everrising lake outside her caravan beside the loveinamist a bowl of food shed left to tempt james was so heaving with maggots she nearly threw up she was about to chuck it out when glancing into her caravan she saw that her suitcase had been opened her drawers upended and her bag emptied on the table tristans papers she thought in horror leaping up the steps unzipping the benchseat cushion she sighed with relief the parcel was still there she must lock it safely in her makeup box but where were her keys normally they hung on a hook beside her nieces photographs lucy latimer yelled a voice james where is he croaked lucy as still clutching tristans parcel she bounded down the steps dc miller had never confronted a murderer before this one certainly looked crazy muddy and bloodstained with scratches on her arms and legs a torn dress hair like an electrocuted birds nest and frantically heaving breasts oh please give me back my dog gasped lucy then police were fanning round her and lucy caught a glimpse of handcuffs or was it a gun in fanshawes hand lucy latimer he said triumphantly we are arresting you for the murders of roberto rannaldini and beatrice johnson and the attempted murder of tabitha lovell whaaat whispered lucy you tricked me you havent got james at all bastards her voice rose to a scream seeing a gap to the left she shot through it terror gave her feet wings she had not run for cumbrian schoolgirls for nothing she also knew valhalla better than any of the police racing across the facilities unit jumping box hedges running towards the car park for a second she left whistles and baying alsatians behind then went slap into rozzy darling whatevers the matter ive been looking for you everywhere the police they think im the murderer sobbed lucy oh rozzy help me i didnt do it of course you didnt how ridiculous i cant let them arrest me until ive found james lucy took off across the grass again you certainly cant funnily enough i keep hearing squeaking i just wonder if the old boys got himself shut in somewhere clives back he might have been poking around and left a door open oh my god clive stole gertrude he might steal james i cant keep up with you gasped rozzy ive got a stitch i know where you can hide she tugged lucy behind a yew peacock as a cursing sweating fanshawe pounded past grabbing lucys hand rozzy led her through iron gates across the east courtyard in through the back door along endless dark passages then up shiny polished dark stairs into rannaldinis study which had a musty neglected smell there were no fan photographs stacked on the big oak desk now noone to encourage don juan astride the lady of the manor in the étienne de montigny on the right of the fireplace rozzy went straight to the left of the painting and started to tap the panelling what are you doing asked lucy through desperately chattering teeth the heavy velvet curtains were drawn but outside she could hear shouting looking for the priesthole ill find it in a second please hurry begged lucy rannaldini showed me rozzy gave an almost coy giggle when we once had a little fling and cecilia his then wife came home unexpectedly but he swore me to secrecy now how does it work purlease beseeched lucy the raised voices and excited barking were getting nearer got it suddenly with an arthritic creak the panel swung back to reveal a big dark cupboard i dont want you to be done for aiding and abetting gibbered lucy oh rozzy you do believe im innocent i adore tab i know you do dropping to her knees rozzy reached inside the cupboard and removed the floorboard get inside quickly whats that youre clutching oh golly half inside the cupboard lucy realized she was still clinging on to tristans parcel and gave a sob the heart that loves you will never be closed to you she stammered here are my important papers oh please guard them with your life and see that tristan and noone else gets them and if im arrested and he comes back lucys voice cracked again please take care of james productions got my wages that should keep him going for a bit dont worry about anything taking the parcel rozzy leaned inside to kiss lucys muddy tearstained quivering cheek good luck pet wriggling down through the hole lucy groaned as she landed on some rubble wrenching her ankle hush someones coming rozzy picked up the floorboard see that stickingout brick no to the right of it if you press that a door swings open to a secret passage down to the lake but dont use it unless you have to ill put the police off the scent then find sergeant gablecross wholl spring you the minute the coasts clear never fear aunt rozzys here in slotted the floorboard above lucys head leaving her in total darkness then she heard the panel in rannaldinis study creaking shut and was overwhelmed with terror how could they think she was the murderer had she been wise to trust rozzy who must have had one hell of an affaire with rannaldini to know all those things would rozzy leave her boarded up for ever like the canterville ghost would aunt hortense ever forgive her if tristans papers fell into police hands at least tristan should soon pick up the note in his pigeonhole oh god she mustnt go to pieces leaning against the wall she regained her breath and steadied herself then pressed the brick and sure enough a door creaked open feeling her way round the walls she found an opening but it was only four feet high and very narrow the air smelt damp and musty she screamed as something wet furry and cold scuttled over her foot she would have stayed put rather than embark on the dark journey if she hadnt heard the faintest whining james she called out not daring to shout in case she could be heard in the study or out in the garden there it was again the faintest whimper oh my poor old boy she crawled along jagging her scratched bleeding hands and knees even more on the rocks giving little screams as icy water dripped on her head and slimy walls grazed her sides she only kept going because of the whining and because as the passage jinked and twisted she would have got stuck if shed tried to turn round just as her eyes were getting accustomed to the dark it lightened ahead a clap of thunder rocked the tunnel like an earthquake followed by another even more deafening the whining grew more frantic oh please she prayed out loud please dont let james have broken anything ill never be able to carry him back to safety im coming my angel she cried she could hear rushing pounding water she must be near the lake the roof was getting higher soon shed be able to walk then as she took another turn her blood froze to a thousand degrees below zero her hair shot on end her heart stopped as like dreadful chloroform she was asphyxiated by the stench of maestro glancing ahead she saw the back of a black figure terrifying in its utter stillness she couldnt move she couldnt cry out then she heard the snakecrawling swish of a cloak on the rocky floor and in the dim light could make out the silvery hair the cruel arrogant profile the burning eyes the evil smile as he turned slowly towards her oh god was rozzy in league with rannaldini james gave another agonizing howl as though someone was torturing him no rannaldini croaked lucy dont come near me dont hurt james oh please no and hit the rocks with a dull thud as she fainted it was the last setup of don carlos flocks of birds and a pink and yellow hotair balloon were drifting up from the bristol channel on the horizon an orange sun striped with black stratus clouds waited like a curledup tiger to erupt over the horizon tristans a cool customer grisel muttered to simone if hed had a suitable standin hed have reshot that rideoff straight away tristan was now calmly briefing alpheus you dont have to look heavily disapproving just a flash of outrage because your son is suddenly attracting the best girls quiet please shouted bernard for the hundredth time as an incredible tension spread through the crowd round camera and actor mark it shouted bernard scene two hundred and fifteen take six shouted the clapperloader and action shouted tristan happily at that moment alpheus caught sight of little cosmo showing some photographs to a giggling jessica and had no difficulty looking outraged cut shouted tristan in delight formidable alpheus just check the gate simone pressed her stopwatch total silence fell two hundred yards away uniformed police could be seen examining the cordonedoff area in front of the far goal posts where tab had had her fall the gate was clear shall we say it now went up the chorus oui said tristan its a wrap yelled everyone whooping and cheering i wanted to say it simones dark montigny eyes filled with tears la fin la fin said griselda blowing her nose noisily solemnly tristan shook hands with bernard oscar valentin sylvestre ogborne followed by the crew then they all posed for a last photograph taken by hypealong already resplendent in a pink seersucker suit for the wrap party have you heard from lucy tristan asked bernard yet again no but im sure shell turn up later over at rutminster police station gerald portland was going ballistic how could twentyfour of you lose lucy latimer what the fuck am i to tell the press theyre all outside after consultation however he decided to put a massive guard on georges house and go ahead with the wrap party try to contain people in the walled garden he told his men if latimers that obsessed with montigny shell roll up to kill again weve got her handbag her passport her car keys she cant get far down the road at rutminster general gablecross was striding up and down the foyer muttering im not a fucking guarddog charlie his old running mate would be turning in his grave the hospital was swarming with press come on tim whos done it asked the mail on sunday not at liberty to say rutminster constabulary and sergeant gablecross in particular cant even catch the clap yelled rupert dummying past the waiting journalists and racing for the front door seeing karen joining in the laughter gablecross turned on her in fury and you can bugger off down to the station and flash your tits at andy he roared in case anything interestings come in with lucys stuff stop putting me down its not my fault im not charlie sobbed karen and sending a nurse and a trayful of medicines flying she ran out into the street anything interesting on lucy latimer she asked five minutes later allowing herself a languorous flutter of the eyelashes andy the exhibits officer had in the past lost a lot of sleep over karen making sure noone was around he muttered so she had to draw close to hear him that a rude letter from a bank manager had been found in lucys handbag shes very overdrawn and the bastard seems relieved funds are coming in at the end of filming weve also got some bank statements whats she been spending her money on karen brushed her breasts in the cream shirt against andys arm sends two hundred and fifty a month home to her parents said andy consulting the statement subscribes to a number of animal charities but most of it seems to have gone to someone called rozzy pringle shes given her nearly three grand in the last two months karen whistled could rozzy be blackmailing lucy parkers department store in the high street was having an afterhours preview of new stock for account customers heading for evening gowns karen tried on a spangled horror in shocking pink that looks gorgeous said the sales girl truthfully who was used to peggy parkers friends who needed a shoehorn to get into a size twenty you part of the don carlos crew karen shook her head but i know a lot of them shop here we had that rozzy pringle in last thursday said the girl wistfully bought a floaty grey belinda belville dress are you sure it was last thursday squeaked karen quite sure it was my afternoon off i always miss the celebs karen was fighting for breath by the time she reached gablecross who was hovering outside tabithas hospital room sarge youll never guess lucys given huge sums of money to rozzy and rozzy bought her wrapparty dress on thursday afternoon the day she claimed to have been going to the doctor she must have slashed her rainbow dress yesterday to avert suspicion for a second gablecross digested this rozzy was such a lovely lady too doesnt make her a murderer he said she neednt have cut up her dress cancer makes people behave strangely but good girl well done blushing with pleasure karen peered into tabs room where she could see a smooth rakishly handsome man shaking wolfie by the hand hes nice james benson the campbellblack and rannaldini family doctor said gablecross charges a fortune for being fazed by nothing james benson was smiling broadly as he came out not much to worry about there he told gablecross although young wolfgang must have had a harrowing afternoon never a dull moment with that family i delivered that little tearaway nineteen years ago glad shes found the right bloke at last wolfies a good lad agreed gablecross very good needs a big family to cosset him and tab needs guyropes could we have a word james benson looked at his watch ive got two patients to see tim and im due out to dinner at nine wont take long this is my colleague detective constable needham james benson smiled in delight oh well then im sure i can spare a few minutes he led them into the consultants office i wonder if we can find some sherry its been a long day how can i help you dyou have a patient called rosalind pringle james benson stopped in his search funny you should ask that rannaldini wanted to know the same thing the friday before he died came to see me about having his vasectomy reversed said hed heard i was treating her take a seat both of you he went on as he perched on the arm of a sofa said i wished i had been always thought rozzy pringle the most dishy lady got all her lps used to hang round the stage door at covent garden when i was a student at the middlesex funnily enough shes exactly the same age as i am rannaldinid heard a rumour shed got throat cancer i said i hoped not tragedy to wreck that heavenly voice but that id never treated her for that or anything else funny id forgotten all about it until you reminded me youve been incredibly helpful sir said gablecross if youll forgive us that means not only was she bleeding lucy white under false pretences bleated karen excitedly as they ran down the stairs but she could have sung hermiones last aria in the wood still circumstantial panted gablecross not going to cancel out a dna profile but popping into the incident room at the station they learnt that rozzys local doctor had confirmed he had no knowledge of her having cancer have they brought lucy in yet asked karen she gave them the slip sighed the custody officer immediately the smile of satisfaction was wiped off gablecrosss face the stupid fuckers i thought youd be pleased knowing shes your pinup you thought bloody wrong shed be safe in custody if shes on the loose shes in terrible danger come on karen gablecross raced towards his car ought we to tell gerry portland certainly not were going to show him and rupert campbellblack we can catch villains but the tale of murder twists and turns wolfie working a sixteenhour day for the past three and a half months was unused to so much happiness he still couldnt believe tab was going to be ok and all his at the same time every sound seemed to threaten the head that he loved so he swore as his mobile rang it was rozzy in tears oh wolfie theyre trying to arrest lucy whatever for killing your father and beattie and trying to kill tab thats ridiculous said wolfie appalled look tabs asleep ill go into another room were not supposed to use mobiles in intensive care it buggers up the equipment get onto rupert hell vouch for lucys innocence so will gablecross hes in the hospital somewhere ill go and find him but as wolfie ran down the poorly lit and deserted corridor isa appeared from the emergency stairs at the other end carrying a bunch of bloodred roses having not been clocked by gablecross and karen as they rushed out of the front door isa had had no difficulty getting past the uniformed policemen guarding the lift after all he was tabs husband and the champion jockey and had given them an excellent tip for goodwood hello my darling said isa softly as he catfooted into his wifes room time you and i had a little talk news either travels faster round a film crew than the fleetest greyhound or it never leaves the starting gates noone even two hours into the wrap party was aware that lucy was now prime suspect and still evading a massive murder hunt but they knew tabs fall had not been accidental and the presence of policemen everywhere frisking still arriving guests taking their cars apart murmuring into radio mikes added to the general edginess guests had spilled out into the walled garden where the scarlet and orange rambler roses clashed less gaudily by night beyond lay shadowy shrubberies but there was no incentive to escape into the bushes with someone who might be the killer the revellers clung close to the house in the light cast by georges big golden windows discussed in lowered voices who might have tried to bump off tab and leapt if someone touched them accidentally maria had excelled herself with a huge cold turkey and salads laid on a side table in georges big drawing room but everyone was too hot and jumpy to eat as to fear of the murder was added fear of tomorrow when they would no longer be a closeknit community how would they cope without lucy to listen to their problems or sylvestre to mend their hairdryers or hermione to bitch about so they all kept busy filling their filofaxes with names and addresses they probably wouldnt be able to put faces to in a week or two do drop in at cherrylands if youre ever in surrey pushy kept telling everyone revellers even fell on the suntanned neck of grannys exboyfriend giuseppe when he had the temerity to roll up with serena westwood who was flashing a large ruby engagement ring what is the french for arsenic and strychnine murmured granny who pointedly ignored them both arsenic and strychnine said oscar waking up to slot another gauloise into his jade cigarette holder malevolence is universal the point of a wrap party announced ogborne who was motoring down his second bottle of moët is to make your number with the director and producer so theyll employ you again then get ratarsed and pull as many women as possible ive pulled them all anyway said sylvestre you never pulled simone taunted valentin unsimple simone sylvestre glanced across the room she looks pretty in that flowered dress maybe tonight is the night im saving myself for my beautiful wife said valentin the only woman approaching her is tabitha and rupert and lucky wolfgang will put the biggest guard round her tonight oscar had fallen asleep again on the sofa his head in jessicas lap tristans boys were very happy they had worked hard and been well paid tomorrow they would go home to even better food august in the country then start work on hercule in a few weeks only bernard was sad after tonight he wouldnt see rozzy he had had an original la scala poster of don carlos with callas singing elisabetta framed for her as a wrap present she was blowdrying her hair when he dropped it off the hot blast swept the tendrils off her face emphasizing the good bones but also the wrinkles on which one could play noughts and crosses i would love her when she grew old he thought despairingly knowing singers love singing george had booked a trio from the rutminster symphony orchestra installed at the end of the big drawing room with a crate of red they were now accompanying alpheus some enchanted evening he sang crinkling his eyes at serena hed missed out on her during the recording but had always thought her very lovely it isnt enchanted at all said pushy fretfully no wolfie no mikhail no rupert or any of his tasty polo friends and george although perfectly gracious would clearly far rather be alone with flora and none of those hunky pcs are allowed to dance with us and where on earth are sexton and tristan theyve got an awful lot of loose finishes to tie up explained simone its called supervising the windingup of production said flora who as the thunder grew more ominous was trying to get a tranquillizer down a panting shuddering trevor which in sextons case is probably a euphemism for pleasuring dame hermione and its no party without lucy said jessica indignantly looking at the mountain of presents piling up for her on the table i got her a little silver lurcher brooch from past times i did want to see her open it i got her a little eighteenthcentury drawing of a greyhound pouted meredith i wanted to see her open it too why the hell did tristan fire her here he is at last said jessica wriggling out from under oscars head im going to give him a piece of my mind you wont have much left then snapped chloe who was feeling utterly miserable she was thirtysix there was no man in her life and she had not merely lonely hotel bedrooms but also a solitary fulham flat to look forward to how could isa have dumped her the only bright spot she told flora was four performances of salome in vienna brilliant casting said flora enthusiastically its so rare to have a salome whose veils people really want to come off chloes an old hand at taking off clothes drawled baby who was missing isa jolted by tabs fall and extremely drunk is there a goat in salome has anyone seen chloes video its called no kidding shut up baby muttered flora look out yelled valentin for chloe had grabbed a carving knife off the table and jumped on baby screaming take that back you little fagfucker the band stopped and a gasp of horror went round the room was that why you killed rannaldini and beattie to shut them up taunted baby and showing surprising strength for someone so languid yanked the hand holding the knife down to thigh level no i did not shrieked chloe for a few seconds they struggled in a deadly embrace eyes filled with loathing six inches apart you fucked up me and isa hissed chloe correcshon you fucked up me and isa you and isa whispered chloe in horror i dont believe it you bloody liar ill kill you tangled in the folds of her mesh dress the knife quivered like a trapped fish george screamed flora but as he raced in through the french windows hermione made her entrance from the hall with her head held high good evening everyone then catching sight of baby and chloe locked in their dance of death good gracious i had no idea you two were an item for a second babys face twitched then chloe corpsed too and they had collapsed in helpless laughter ill have that said george as the carving knife thudded on to the autumnleafpatterned carpet wed better have another bottle and compare black cobra bites said baby ruffling chloes hair ill never understand singers sighed ogborne piling on a second helping of strawberry pavlova gifts for all gifts for all cried hermione beckoning in sexton who was buckling under a log basket of presents how exciting squeaked jessica tearing off the paper thank you dame hermione what have you given us asked grisel calendars smiled hermione how clever of you to get next years so early said pushy after all she might want to work with the old boot again theyre this years said grisel in outrage and its halfway through july noones interested in dates said hermione airily particularly if ones bookings extend beyond the millennium as mine do what matters is the lovely photographs what are they of asked ogborne why me of course next year im hoping to show some of cosmos oeuvre there is nothing like a dime sang sexton as he bopped happily with hermione i love you hermsie dyou feel you can truly care for little cosmo i love im already said sexton truthfully hes so sharp ill be able to veg out in his pram while he goes to the office for me a tranquillized crosseyed trevor was now lying in floras arms like a baby why are you looking so cheerful she asked meredith tomorrow im flying to oz to meet up with hermiones husband bobby but not for much longer meredith nodded at a bopping hermione it looks as though madam is at last going to give bobby a divorce im so pleased flora kissed him on the cheek come on meredith on your feet boomed griselda new trousers halting in midbop hermione looked beadily at grisels dayglo pink harem pants im sure youll find them very useful useful for getting the entire harem in there as well murmured flora to simone who in her pretty flowery dress was leaning against the wall sipping iced water i think griseldas days of promiscuity are over said simone gravely i want you to be the first to know flora that grisel and i are an item flora nearly dropped trevor was that why you got over wolfie so fast she squeaked simone nodded i have never been so in love in my life we are flying down to the tarn to meet mama and papa tomorrow will they approve they will probably feel grisel is a little old for me shes six months older than mama but once they meet her have you told uncle tristan no he doesnt take much on board at the moment having immediately crossed the drawing room to admire georges picasso when he arrived tristan had hardly moved normally at wrap parties he felt elated and disembodied if someone rolled back the stone he wouldnt be there but tonight there was no elation his mind kept slipping into reverse gear as he bitterly castigated himself for being so brutal to lucy he wanted to drive over to valhalla and find her but having just arrived he couldnt abandon his cast and crew who had endured so much normally also at wrap parties he felt like a prince on a walkabout with everyone shaking his hand and thanking him for a wonderful shoot but tonight although noone was openly hostile he could feel their reproach as palpable as the everincreasing mountain of presents for lucy on the polished table beside him whats the matter with you all he snarled at valentin people may not want to work on hercule unless you hire lucy again snapped back valentin she was so good at calming down singers and oscar reckons shes the best hes ever worked with thats because the lazy sod gets more sleep if he doesnt have to spend hours adjusting lights to compensate for the inadequacies of some makeup artist said tristan sourly why dyou have to fire lucy demanded ogborne his mouth full of danish blue oh for christs sake tristan turned away and for the thousandth time punched out lucys number dont bug the guy sylvestre chided the rest of the crew you all seem to forget that while he was losing three crucial days filming he was in prison on a murder charge being put through the mangle by the flics hes entitled to the odd tantrum the vodaphone you have called is not responding the operator was now telling tristan please try later please try later until he wanted to wring her neck and hurl his mobile through georges huge windowpane if only wolfie were here hed have found lucy youll never guess hissed flora to baby grisel and simone are an item good god dyou think she takes her turban off in bed youre lovely to look at delightful to know and heaven to kiss sang alpheus as he foxtrotted past with serena he said that he loved er but oh ow he lie oh ow he lie oh ow he lie sang giuseppe in grannys ear serena is so boring i want to come back i miss you well you cant said granny with decreasing conviction howie get me don giovanni at la scala murmured giuseppe so i can take you on long holiday and pay for all things please granville oh my dear boy excuse me granville hermione was scrabbling like a terrier in lucys pile of presents ive forgotten maria dyou think lucyll mind awfully if she didnt get one of my calendars i expect shell live said granny tristan shivered im not sure she will i am bloody worried granny monsieur de montigny said the editor of classical music whod disguised himself as a waiter about claudine lauzerte who said tristan as though he was dredging up some longabandoned wreckage from the bottom of the sea could we have a word the word is non snapped tristan shoving dancers aside until he reached bernard for christs sake try rozzy again ask her if shes seen lucy wheres mikhail grumbled baby i want to sing the friendship duet with him perhaps hes eloped with rozzy giggled simone it was mikhails last night in the capitalist sweet shop as a goinghome present for lara he had decided to remove the murillo madonna from the chapel but finding valhalla awash with police when he returned home after the final wrap he decided to sleep until things quietened down waking just after eleven he took a considerable swig from his hip flask and set out the house was sculptured grey in the moonlight a sudden chill wind sent the cypresses hissing like snakes sliding through the shadows mikhail passed two nervously patrolling uniformed policemen and wished he had had slightly more to drink he froze at the sound of more footsteps slow lonely then quickening coming relentlessly towards him from the swirling mists emerged a blackcloaked figure gliding down the cloisters then disappearing through the chapel door frantic for company mikhail fled in terror back to the production office but found it totally deserted everyone must have left for the party deciding this was very unposalike behaviour and ghosts couldnt produce footsteps he crept back again the chapel was unlocked noone appeared to be inside feeling his way along the smooth edges of the pews and then the choir stalls guided by the light of the rising moon now spilling like milk then like royal blue ink now like red wine through the stainedglass windows he reached the madonna how beautiful she was more radiant than any moon how she would enjoy an exciting jaunt to moscow mikhail got out his screwdriver and pliers somehow she must come off the wall but as he started to tap and feel round her gilded frame he nearly jumped through the vaulted roof the panel to which she was attached had swung open revealing utter darkness a horrible smell of maestro and footsteps echoing far in the distance climbing inside running a shaking hand round to the left mikhail found a key someone had been stupid or careless enough to leave it in a lock turning it he felt a door open groping inside he found a light switch and nearly fainted he was in a tiny cubbyhole all round the walls were grotesquely graffitid photographs of tabitha flora claudine lauzerte granny beattie hermione and rannaldini ears had been lopped off squints and beards added and everything smeared with blood and excrement but interspersed with these horrors beautiful and immaculate were pictures of tristan at all ages also hanging from hooks were wigs pewter grey blond dark and light brown and hermiones applegreen cloak with the pink roselined hood except bloodstains were now rosepatterning the green as well the table was piled high with bodypaints knives ammunition huge cruel scissors a halffull bottle of maestro videos tapes taperecorders rannaldinis cigars bottles marked poison and cans of petrol on top lay a rippedopen brownpaper parcel marked tristan de montigny private and confidential and against the table a goinghome present for lara for the taking was the montigny snake charmer beside it the floor was littered with fragments of cutup photograph mikhail was nearly gagging on the stench who could do these sick things grabbing the painting he nearly dropped it as a voice snapped what in hell are you doing here i wouldnt do anything silly sir as mikhail lunged forward to grab a knife mikhail had never dreamt hed be pleased to see a policeman karen who was following gablecross thought mikhail looked like a bear raiding a larder then she saw the walls behind him and had to clap her hands over her mouth i find vicars hole full of interest announced mikhail how the fuck did you get in here shoving him out of the way gablecross took in the contents of the table jesus i enter chapel to pray my vife will return said mikhail piously i just examine vork of art when wall open lying bastard thought gablecross look sarge heres a parcel addressed to tristan in lucys handwriting said karen in excitement and theres a wig exactly like rozzys hair and one like hermiones why should anyone want to pass themselves off as rozzy they had been unable to track her down in make up and she wasnt answering her mobile she must be on the way to the party unless the murderers got her too oh god crouching down on the floor karen gathered up fragments of photographs horribly reminiscent of rozzys cutup dress lets go said gablecross put that painting down mr pezcherov outside having alerted two of the uniformed officers to keep an eye on the cache gablecross took the wheel and they set out for the wrap party no wonder he complains about my slow driving thought karen as they hurtled through overgrown tree tunnels down narrow lanes where great banks of elder and wild rose obscured any views of things coming the other way black trees and telegraph poles flew past the window karen was being thrown from one side of the back seat to the other as with the light on and a road map on her knees as a table she tried to piece together the shreds of photograph it still points to lucy she said sadly as they shot past a sign saying four miles to rutminster why snapped gablecross these cutup photographs are all of rozzy perhaps lucy couldnt stand tristan giving rozzy all that money for a new wrapparty dress lucy regained consciousness into darker nightmare she was trapped in a chair her wrists clamped to its arms by what felt like iron manacles padded with velvet her ankles and knees similarly secured to the chair legs so her thighs were forced humiliatingly apart this must be the debtors chair in which rannaldini had once imprisoned tab the room was cold and dreadfully airless it smelled like a slaughterhouse of blood sweat and fear as her eyes grew used to the dark she realized she was in a large steel container she and the debtors chair were on a lower level in a kind of pit up some steps on a higher level stood an imposing carved armchair like a bishops throne a bed and a dressingtable pushed against the wall from the only wall that wasnt mirror dully gleamed a highly sophisticated collection of whips and knives then she heard hoarse unearthly screaming it was several seconds before she realized it was coming from herself shuddering with horror she pieced together earlier events tristan firing her the police arresting her rozzy hiding her in the priesthole then rannaldinis utterly terrifying ghost or had it been rannaldini himself thank god rozzy would seek help and could be trusted to give tristan his important papers then she remembered jamess cries growing more and more piteous someone must have tortured him she started to cry but as her eyes and nose streamed she had nothing on which to wipe them her ankle ached where shed twisted it her legs throbbed with nettle stings and in the mirror opposite her dim reflection showed her face arms and legs cut even more to pieces from stumbling down the stony secret passage she looked like a victim of third world brutality glancing at the whips and knives she knew the churning fear carlos and elisabetta must have felt aware that torture awaited them the light was too faint to read her watch she tried to pray rozzy wouldnt let her down but as the hours crawled by and she grew colder and more dehydrated her legs racked by agonizing cramps hope faded she must have nodded off she was woken by terror beyond imagination instead of her own reflection glaring evilly back from the mirror was rannaldini maybe she had died or her mind was slowly unravelling then he was gone and her blanched bloodstained lacerated reflection gazed back at her again there was a creak jerking her head round as far as it would go she saw a steel panel on the upper level slide back and there was rannaldini a monstrous black vulture poised to swoop down and tear her apart no no please not her screams echoed round the chamber then died on her lips as the steel door clanged shut off came the cloak the pewter wig the mask lucy breathed in a heavenly waft of femme and wept with relief oh you angel thank god then the questions poured out in a hoarse gasping rush are the police still looking for me have you found james did you give tristan the parcel what a brilliant disguise you fooled everyone as rozzy flicked on a side light and arranged her newly washed hair lucy saw she was wearing a beautiful dovegrey chiffon dress and long grey gloves please unlock this horrible chair she begged what time is it where am i nearly midnight youre in rannaldinis torture chamber rozzys voice was strangely high and hard quite the grand inquisitors adventure playground isnt it soundproofed like a recording studio so noone can hear the screams what dyou mean little by little terror was taking over again rannaldini brought the pretty ones down here mocked rozzy i dont understand both of them jumped as the telephone rang in an instant rozzy had grabbed her mobile whipped a gun out of her bag and running down the steps rammed the muzzle against lucys temple dont make a sound she hissed rigid with horror lucy could hear bernards bray so close she could have reached out and stroked his glossy black moustache ive been delayed again bernie darling rozzys voice was caressing lucy i havent seen her as lucy gasped the gun was rammed harder into her head she must have pushed off home to cumbria one more pressie to wrap then ill be over no no dearest youve been drinking at least i hope you have ill make my own way keep the champagne on ice flicking off her mobile rozzy peered at the buttons for a second before pressing one ill turn it off altogether she said chattily we dont want to be disturbed retracing her steps up the stairs she placed the gun and the mobile on the dressingtable that was bernard the silly old fart was looking for you youre the murderer whispered lucy i thought youd never guess said rozzy acidly the whole world is searching but noone has a clue and i gave you tristans papers lucys chattering teeth became a terrible shaking jolting her body like an earthquake please let me have your cloak for a second im so cold poor child said rozzy sympathetically then suddenly burst into maniacal laughter youll be burning hot where youre going where were we oh yes in rannaldinis torture chamber he strapped them just where you are in the debtors chair what had gablecross told her lucy tried to marshal her crazed thoughts with psychopaths you had to be passive respectful admiring i cant believe you killed rannaldini every word had to be forced out youre far too slight and anyway you were in mallowfield since im going to kill you in a minute ill tell you while i do my face now are you sitting comfortably settling down on the bed rozzy calmly took a tube of moisturiser out of her makeup bag i killed rannaldini she said dreamily he put me down so much he deserved it it was so easy to slip away from glyns party i pretended i had a migraine the land slopes up steeply behind our house such a small drop on to the lawn from the spareroom window everyone was too drunk to notice my car had gone i drove to valhalla and parked up a little pebbled track in paradise woods then i climbed over the west gate into hangmans wood so james did see you he wagged his tail and peered into the gloom oh rozzy where is he dont interrupt hissed rozzy then giving a mirthless laugh even more sinister than her mad cackle she went on i saw that tramp tabitha staggering out of rannaldinis watchtower got her comeuppance at last noone heard her screams they were too busy cheering on the finalists i wore hermiones green cloak pretending it was grannys cutup quilt id smuggled it out of wardrobe on saturday with an adoring smile rozzy was smoothing base into her face and neck wandering up one of those rides like the rays of the sun i saw rannaldini wearing alpheuss smart dressinggown he was out looking for tab so i launched into elisabettas last duet the next minute lucy thought her eardrums would rupture as rozzys voice exploded like an atom bomb in the tiny room you can sing she gasped i always could as soon as i recovered from the laryngitis i had at the recording rozzy rocked with obscene laughter once more pretending to have cancer was such an easy way of milking you unfortunately rannaldini bugged your caravan the saturday morning before he died he told me hed seen james benson and was going to expose me as not having cancer at all but i gave you so much money said a shattered lucy then forgetting for a second not to be judgemental this ought to be called the creditors chair dont you cheek me screamed rozzy grabbing one of the knives she ran down the steps eyes rolling teeth clenched and drew the blade along lucys cheek it was you who told tristan i had cancer you meddling bitch because you didnt want him to give me any work shut up she yelled as lucy tried to protest then sauntering back up the stairs rozzy used the knife to sharpen an eye pencil as she continued her story catching sight of hermiones cloak enchanted by how much his mistresss voice had improved rannaldini strode down the ride took me in his arms and kissed me as he broke away my hands closed round his neck rozzys voice trembled with excitement his last words were carloss dear god its not the queen i saw the terror in his eyes and felt his windpipe give god i enjoyed that hell she had snapped her eye pencil and began to pare away the wood again how could you rozzy whispered lucy then hastily forcing herself to sound admiring rannaldini was as strong as an ox i hated him so much and i was wearing tristans signet ring for luck tristan had given it to me as a keepsake my hands are smaller than his it must have fallen off lining the knife up carefully beside her mobile and the gun rozzy drew a dark line along the top of her lashes with an utterly steady hand it was like piccadilly circus in hangmans wood that night having killed rannaldini i was about to whip the memoirs from the watchtower but i only had time to snatch his keys when a helicopter landed and rupert campbellbastard came running into the wood shortly followed by mikhail who stole the montigny then i ran back to the west gate shoved the bloodstained cloak in the boot and called you but you were at glyns party protested lucy i heard everyone singing happy birthday and glyns a jolly good fellow i taped it when glyn cut his cake much earlier said rozzy i only had to slot the cassette into the car stereo i rang you twice the second time to remind you about the cloak and established the perfect alibi i drove home singing my head off i didnt even have to climb back in through the window id put a pillow in my bed and a melon inside the wig you so caringly made for when my hair fell out from the chemo youll look just as beautiful rozzy you patronizing cow the sickening littlegirl voice soared to a scream and exploded into gales of terrible laughter i walked upstairs to the spare room rozzy clutched her shaking sides glyn and sylvia were having a fuck in the master bedroom as the common little slut insists on calling it naturally they didnt notice my return there are pluses in having an unuxorious husband ten minutes later glyn came out on to the landing to check i was asleep and tripped over the carpet gradually the laughter ebbed away more terrifying were the uncharacteristically foul language and the moodswings beth in little women one moment lady macbeth the next clever to murder beattie mumbled lucy she was such a bitch and so shortsighted never once asked me for an interview when ive got the most beautiful voice in the world and wonderful stories of all the greats ive sung with and beattie was gagging for tristan shit rozzys mascara wand had slipped leaving a blob on her cheekbone she bought the memoirs from clive you know who stole them from bussage beattie was going to expose tristan as being maxims incestuous bastard why didnt you tell me about that lucy that wasnt friendly to have secrets the voice was hard and cruel again lucy steeled herself as rozzy picked up the knife but for the moment her venom was concentrated on beattie i didnt want tristan exposed i didnt give a stuff that maxim had fucked his own daughter because tristan and i never want children but i do fancy being madame de montigny rozzy removed the blob of mascara with a cottonbud it has such a charming nineteenthcentury ring like a novel by george sand perhaps i should have asked you to do my eyes meditatively rozzy admired her reflection you look stunning stammered lucy praise her keep her talking she told herself she was racked by cramp in her leg her eyes watering with pain how did you kill beattie with so many people around best thing about my job on carlos was that noone knew where i was supposed to be at any one time earlier in the week id let myself into beatties room and read the filth she intended to publish the night she was killed and you were so busy brownnosing hermione i said id walk james and trevor but i never did that was why james had made a puddle on the caravan floor and i shouted at him thought lucy in anguish instead went on rozzy i shoved a note id typed on the production unit word processor under beatties door then i dressed up as rannaldini i felt so safe disguised as him even that arrogant shit rupert bolted like a frightened hare beattie was so terrified she backed on to the unicorn its horn came up through her belly like a corkscrew rozzys voice quivered with delight again and her blood spurted out like a fountain but i couldnt risk her screaming so i finished her off with the from props i had a key cut back in june i was wearing gloves see i can even make up in them now id no idea tristan had left his prints on the same gun when hed tried it out that afternoon still dressed as rannaldini i raced back through the night to beatties room there i stole memoirs photographs videos and tapes printed out beatties piece to give me all the gen and smashed the computer on the floor rozzy couldnt speak for wild laughter then i went into the chapel to pray for beatties departed soul and hid everything in my little priesthole behind the murillo madonna you did all that in the break you are clever i ought to get the nobel prize for ridding the world of those monsters you ought lucy was casting round frantically for things to ask what about the snake charmer ive so often found things hidden under glyns mattress rozzy became the tragedy queen for a second that out of habit i often checked tristans room the only thing i discovered was the montigny and i knew mikhail had stolen that so i hid it in my priesthole isnt this a nice lipstick revlons fire and ice it exactly matches this feather boa tristan bought me he chose the dress too oh i have had fun rozzys voice dropped to cosy intimacy i devastated that silly old poof granny by slashing his patchwork quilt i got so many brownie points for sewing up foxie after id cut him to pieces and i had so many goes at you lucy who put the adder in your makeup box who poisoned your champagne i knew rannaldini didnt drink before concerts although he lapsed on that occasion if hermione hadnt shattered that glass with her top e hed have died that evening instead and i put slug pellets in jamess bowl i thought you loved james lucy made heroic efforts to keep the hysteria out of her voice oh please where is he ive no idea i had two goes at that arrogant tart tabitha i substituted the can of petrol i put on gloves to cut her stirrup leather today with the little penknife on your keyring then i dumped the keyring in wardrobes dustbin which even those dolts from rutminster cid couldnt miss you tried to kill tab today cried lucy in horror that must be her attempted murder they were arresting me for oh god is she all right tragically rozzy paused dramatically she is the little whore i still dont understand why the police suspect me oh my child said rozzy gently as she drew lipstick outside the lines of her mouth because your dna profiles on rannaldinis dressinggown and in his saliva where i kissed him and on the bite on beatties shoulder i just loved plunging my teeth into her knowing it would incriminate you and its in the blood on hermiones cloak and your fingerprints are all over tabs saddle and the penknife but i never had a dna test no but you lost your passport remember rubbing cream into her hands rozzy clasped them in ecstasy i borrowed it and stuck my passport photograph on top of yours and when the two flatfooted cretins rolled up at make up i said i was lucy latimer showed them your passport and took a saliva test in your name i wasnt on the list of suspects due for a dna test because the police knew i was in mallowfield lucy could take no more thats the most horrible part she sobbed i thought we were friends radiant smiling the great diva making her entrance rozzy glided down the steps and stroked lucys hair you poor darling she said in such a sweet sad voice that lucy knew the whole thing had been a bad dream then rozzy grabbed her hair yanking it back until she screamed you stupid bitch i did love you until you started meddling why did you go to france to free tristan hed have been so much better off in prison safe from all those drooling ravening bitches id have visited him every week why didnt you and wolfie take me with you you deceitful cow sucking up to his family rozzys eyes were glittering foam frothing along her mouth mad laughter echoing horribly off the walls i know youre crazy about tristan rozzy was hissing in her ear spraying it with saliva but having spent his life surrounded by beautiful people how could he settle for someone as plain and common as you seizing lucys face rozzy wrenched it towards the mirror look at yourself you ugly bitch as rozzy slapped her face back and forth lucy felt blood trickling from her nose to join her tears choking her i suppose he was kind to you said rozzy reflectively kindness is such an aphrodisiac to ugly women what would the montignys think of you she added mockingly i got on with aunt hortense gasped lucy she must have been appalled a hairdresser with a broad cumbrian accent ill teach you to have ideas above your station miss my station thought lucy in crazed anguish is carlisle above the town soar the mountains olive green filled with lakes crisscrossed with stone walls shed never see them again and shed never see her darling mum and dad or her sister or her little nieces and theyd be told she was a murderer rozzy was back at the table spraying femme between her breasts and legs what did you do with tristans papers whispered lucy ill burn them when i get a moment i promised hortense hed get them said lucy despairingly at least give him étiennes selfportrait and laurent and delphines letters then hell understand why his mother copped out and why étienne rejected him dont tell me what to do snapped rozzy tristan needs love and understanding he needs roots sobbed lucy hortensell tell him the truth i think not rozzy rose to her feet lady macbeths presence dominating the room i took your passport to the chemist and bought rat poison please no shrieked lucy hortense is dying anyway shes such an old duck old dyke you mean im off said rozzy coolly dont leave me you know it all now sweetie youve got to die its so easy there are two buttons to flood the torture chamber as im leaving ill just press the one outside the door rozzy murmured lasciviously and madame guillotine over there will slide up and the lake will come pouring in how convenient of wolfie to fill it up and weve had so much rain it takes five minutes to flood the pit please not gabbled lucy rozzy posed before the mirror the flamered boa warming her face the grey chiffon giving wondrous curves to her slight body you look beautiful rozzy your eyes are like stars theyre the last stars youll see what time is it gasped lucy trying to cling on to some reality nearly twenty past twelve cinderella shall go to the ball rozzy dropped her wig and mask followed by the gun and her mobile into her bag shame you havent time to read in the memoirs about rannaldinis favourite games lucy either hed fuck them in the pit as the water came over their noses so their cunt muscles in their imagined deaththroes clamped round his cock president kennedy pushed whores under the bathwater for the same buzz rozzy smiled as if she were telling a bedtime story or hed sit up here watching them drown then press a button to release them from the debtors chair so they floated choking upwards but in your case miss goody two shoes i wont press that release button till tomorrow rozzys face contorted with hatred and youll float out into the lake not pretty like ophelia but bloated and smelly with wrinkled fingers the policell know ive been strapped in no they wont those manacles are very soft rannaldini knew about hurting people without marking them and theyll find your sweet little suicide note i tore up your last letter to tristan your loving lucy you presumptuous bitch and retyped it dear twistan it was rozzys obscene baby voice again im sowwy i killed all those people and did all those wicked things but i had to be favori du woi well im favori du roi now added rozzy viciously and im excellent at forging your signature ive done it on enough cheques lucy flipped how dare you write a suicide note on my behalf she yelled id never do that because of james james is dead said rozzy indifferently i didnt tell you because i didnt want you snivelling while i did my makeup he whined so much i let him out on the motorway lucy rolled her head in agony as she remembered james pirouetting with joy or leaning against her or darting off with a biscuit or sitting quietly enjoying the rain after a heatwave pressing the button so the steel door slid back rozzy flung on rannaldinis cloak and escaped quickly in case lucys howl of desolation reached the outside world im doing you a good turn she called back softly according to schiller the peace of death is the only escape from the pangs of unrequited love as one steel door clanged shut the metal guillotine keeping out the lake slid upwards and water started to trickle in back at the wrap party it was ten minutes to twelve people had anaesthetized themselves with drink against the terrors and were now dancing but a shiver went through the room as clive strolled in holding a bunch of white lilies here was rannaldinis hitman who knew far too much about all of them as difficult to ignore as a mamba sliding across the floor wheres gablecross murmured clive to dc lightfoot guarding tabitha lovell at rutminster general he isnt i just called there where the hell have you been anyway demanded dc lightfoot everyone wants to question you thats why i havent been here wheres lucy clives pale lashless eyes flickered round the room i bought these flowers for her always liked lucy noone streaked my hair better and theres tasty tristan tristan was smiling for the first time that evening because hypealong had just presented him with an album of stills through which tristan was flipping with exclamations of delight there was baby looking romantic and mikhail heroic and hermione naked and enormous from behind and oscar asleep and rupert narroweyed and mean in his executive producers chair thank you hypealong its all here to remind me said tristan kissing his press officer on each sideboard on the last page finding two photographs stuck in side by side he gave a gasp of pleasure in the first lucy naked except for a pink towel was stretched on a table with rozzy massaging her shoulders in the second she had reared up in alarm gorgeous breasts flying look at lucys boobs everyone shouted ogborne who was peering over tristans shoulders how dyou get her to do that hypie banged on her caravan window after dark as people crowded round tristan seized the album not wanting everyone to drool then his heart stopped as he noticed the venom on rozzys face as her fingers closed round lucys neck oh my god glancing up in horror he saw gablecross and karen running through the door wheres lucy he yelled i hoped you were going to tell us that said gablecross regardez tristan thrust the photograph album at him for a second gablecross studied the two pictures then he drew tristan into georges study next door where the hell is she asked a grey and shaking tristan she was last seen around seven thirty outside make up said karen then she evaded arrest and ran off into the garden added gablecross arrest snarled tristan whatever for hanging on to my lapels wont do any good just let go said gablecross irritably lucy was arrested for the murder of rannaldini beattie and the attempted murder of tabitha thats crazy lucy couldnt kill an earwig gablecross explained that her dna profile matched up since then she vanished into thin air and james not a sign sighed karen someones either hiding her shes hiding out in the wood or the murderers got her said gablecross it would help if rozzy turned up oh my christ a distraught tristan was pacing up and down thinking and thinking and theyve searched valhalla everywhere next moment griselda rushed in shaking with horror tristan karen sergeant gablecross listen to this horrible message on my machine griselda was followed by flora george bernard and simone her hand was trembling so much they had to endure several seconds of whirring speededup chatter before she found the right place on the tape the voice on the machine was so high and terrified at first noone recognized it please let me have your cloak for a second im so cold lucy gasped tristan looking round with desperate bloodshot eyes poor child at first the second voice was sympathetic then it burst into gales of dreadful crazy laughter then became chillingly hard and cruel youll be burning hot where youre going where were we oh yes in rannaldinis torture chamber he strapped them just where you are in the debtors chair thats rozzys voice said bernard hoarsely george put an arm round floras shoulders tristan jumped to his feet do something for christs sake gablecross raised a shaking hand for silence as lucy in a high terrified voice spoke again i cant believe you killed rannaldini youre far too slight and anyway you were in mallowfield since im going to kill you in a minute it was rozzys voice amused bitchy ill tell you while i do my face now are you sitting comfortably what time was that call made barked gablecross someone called me before that said a trembling griselda it was me playing seely buggers simone had gone scarlet i rang you on the upstairs phone grisel around twelve less ten minutes as if trying to help the police with their inquiries the clock on the mantelpiece chimed midnight so it could have been as little as ten minutes ago said karen making lightning calculations i dont understand why those obscene outpourings are on my machine wailed griselda youre in her memory said bernard whod gone as grey as simone had scarlet rozzys as blind as a bat i called her just after eleven fortyfive to ask if shed seen lucy and check when she was coming over she probably meant to switch her phone off after that not wanting to be interrupted and pressed your number instead weve got to get lucy out tristan was suddenly roused from shock where the fucks the torture chamber i can show you said a soft voice clive was hovering in the doorway never can so many people have been pleased to see him he was still clutching lucys lilies pray god they arent destined for her grave thought tristan in horror if rozzy slams the door and flicks the switch to let the water in lucys got five minutes at best said clive take my plane urged george but as they rushed out of the front door towards the hangar there was a tick tick tick and a judder overhead like a troupe of dancing stars a helicopter landed on the lawn as rupert opened the door his blond hair silver in the moonlight gablecross tristan clive and bernard cursing as he stubbed his toe on a reconstitutedstone cherub raced towards him but karen outstripped them quick she panted its lucy in terrible danger weve got to get to valhalla and rescue her the famous five drawled rupert glancing at the others behind her that lot have as much chance of rescuing anyone as mr blobby oh for christs sake howled tristan rupert came an excited cry as hermione ran out of the house now the party has really begun youre on said rupert shooting faster than light back into the helicopter as long as karen can sit on my knee but im not taking that murderer he glared at clive he stole our gertrude you must pleaded karen hes the only person who can lead us to lucy as she wriggled past rupert to get into the back seat she felt the hard bulge of a gun but decided it wasnt the moment to quibble anyway they might need it gablecross still on the ground and on his mobile was alerting the uniform boys at valhalla whatever you do dont arouse suspicion shes mad and extremely dangerous and shes got lucy latimer in there as they flew over a pale lunar landscape dark grey trees black houses lit by a molten moon clive briefed them in his soft sibilant lisp the torture chambers fifteen feet from the lake and ten feet below the water level the moment rozzy presses the switch the iron door slides up i could swim under the guillotine and free her urged tristan desperate for some action you havent time youd need a blowtorch to saw through the manacles and that wouldnt work under gushing water the switch to unlock the debtors chair is unfortunately inside the torture chamber just to the right of the light switch rozzy must have a key to the chamber weve gotta get it off her to get inside at all and weve only got five minutes there are three underground approaches to the torture chamber he went on one you can go down on hands and knees from rannaldinis study but only if youre a slim build and that takes nearly twenty minutes another passage runs from the chapel and takes ten minutes thats the route rozzyll come back up once shes slammed the door on lucy the third which i dont imagine rozzy knows about because it hasnt been used for years consists of steep steps down from the middle of the maze takes about four minutes the helicopter can drop us on the edge those steps come out through a side door into the passage which goes up to the chapel about twenty yards from the entrance to the torture chamber if someone clive glanced round the helicopter could intercept rozzy as she came out of the torture chamber and lure her past this entrance at least one of us could run down the tunnel and switch off the water then once wed relieved her of the key we could get into the chamber and unlock the debtors chair i can see exactly why you were rannaldinis hired assassin up to every trick snarled rupert ahead he could see the lights of paradise high street well be there in a minute said clive tristans got to lure her out announced gablecross rozzys absolutely nuts about him then turning to tristan you must wait for her to come out tell her you love her and youre frantic to get her away from the murderer tristan whod been going round every circle of hell looked at gablecross aghast i cant tell rozzy i love her with his track record the gods would punish him for lies like that by not saving lucy i couldnt convince her for lucys sake you bloody well can snapped rupert if you hadnt fired her this morning none of this would have happened ruperts right begged karen if you can tempt her out of the way and get her off her guard by indulging in some serious snogging fantasize shes madame lauzerte said rupert sarcastically youve had enough practice at screwing geriatrics shut up howled tristan seizing and violently shaking ruperts shoulders so the helicopter lurched as it started its descent pack it in you two ordered gablecross narrowly missing the floodlit spire of all saints paradise flying over sleeping cottages in the high street and hermiones house with its tall chimneys rupert followed the silver ribbon of the river fleet and swung left at the glimmer of rannaldinis lake tristan gave a groan at the thought of all that water pouring into lucys gasping choking throat there was the black dartboard of the maze with policemen like ants closing in from all sides dyou know the way to the centre asked tristan as he and clive jumped down from the helicopter if i concentrate a minute later they had pounded down a yew corridor slap into a dead end for christs sake yelled tristan doing a uturn for a moment as they backtracked clive lost his nerve then the helicopter was overhead and a hovering rupert was aiming a spotlight and leading them to the left and then to the right backwards forwards sideways across perhaps it was gods hand guiding them as well because tristan never stopped praying then miraculously the honeyed scent of philadelphus swept over them they had reached the centre of the maze this time clives memory didnt fail as he kicked the stone alcove three times it swung sideways and darkness loomed they could smell damp rotting wood and weed the steps are very slippery warned clive it was like a yew corridor without any ceiling clive led the way tristan was as soaked with icy sweat as from the dripping walls of the stairway he kept crashing against often he was too hasty and felt himself falling against the snakelike caress of clives leather suit the steps seemed greased with goose fat i havent got a head for depths he confessed as he battled against an ancient phobia of being trapped underground an irate nanny had locked him once in a dark cellar lucy was what mattered oh please god but it was to hades god of the underworld he should be praying please spare my eurydice he kept imagining the water choking lucy until her generous heart gave out and hed never be able to tell her how much he loved her he was losing his balance about to stumble down into the darkness clive was far too slight to support his weight then suddenly theyd reached level ground and collapsed thankfully against a solid oak door behind them they could faintly hear gablecross on his mobile uniform boys have located the entrance to the torture chamber from the lakeside he was telling karen they cant see any sign yet of water being sucked inside perhaps rozzy hasnt left whispered karen hopefully open the door into the passage now gablecross hissed down the stairs to clive we may be able to preempt her the door was warped by damp and opened inwards after a lot of tugging and kicking turn right muttered clive to tristan the passage kinks sharply to the left lurk behind there until she comes out tristan had never known such darkness the total blindness of the grand inquisitor noone dared shine a torch in case rozzy saw a light ahead as she came out but she must hear the thunderous crashing of his heart as he edged along the wall once she emerged he mustnt betray his fear his mouth tasted as acid as a rotten lemon he was trembling violently he reeked of sweat his knees were jumping frantically as he positioned himself round the rocky bend however could he act well enough to convince lucys murderer that he loved her then he was aware of dim light whipping round he heard a clang of steel a heavy door creaking shut a switch being flicked on followed by arpeggios of crazy laughter he nearly turned and fled now hissed clive rozzy whos there called out a high terrified voice tristan could see the outline of a cloaked figure rozzy its me his voice sounding surprisingly deep and strong seemed to echo round the dripping walls but before he could add tristan he heard a bang and felt an agonizing pain in his right shoulder she had shot him reeling back from the shock he crashed against the side of the tunnel cracking his head me tristan he gasped then righting himself he stumbled forward rozzy are you ok ive been so worried tristan whispered rozzy in horror i thought you were the police as he came towards her she saw blood seeping into his pale grey shirt oh my poor darling she cried im so sorry i must bandage that wound she looked so normal and unusually beautiful her big eyes so full of concern and tenderness that for a fleeting moment tristan thought theyd all been imagining things then through the dimness he saw the switch to the right of the door how could i have hurt you moaned rozzy its nothing tristan moved towards her then taking a deep breath the murderers on the loose i was so scared for you if he rammed her against the torture chamber door and kissed her he could surreptitiously reach up and turn off the switch unfortunately she was bearing down on him let me wrap this round your shoulder she tugged off her red feather boa till we reach the outside world as she coiled it round his neck hanging on to the two ends to contain him he nearly bolted ive come to take you to the wrap party he forced himself to sound lighthearted everyones waiting theres no hurry said rozzy coyly orphée there is because youre in danger he seized her left hand and found it empty the gun must be in her bag or concealed in the folds of rannaldinis cloak i love you tristan crossed his fingers as he led her up the tunnel i always knew you did darling said rozzy adoringly as they passed the entrance where clive and the others were lurking rozzy stopped and so did tristans heart look at me she insisted orpheus wasnt allowed to look at eurydice tristan tried to sound playful take me away begged rozzy to paris and then your house in the tarn i want to meet aunt hortense and see where you grew up if he got his arms round her he could clamp hers down but he didnt know whether his right arm was strong enough it didnt seem to belong to him any more he felt increasingly dizzy and the feather boa was tightening terrifyingly round his neck but as he lured her round to the right he could see clive stealing like a ghost out of the side entrance whats that noise she asked sharply probably a rat oh rozzy she jumped as she heard another footstep but as she spun round tristan grabbed her you look so young he took her face between his hands you dont still love claudine of course not breathed tristan i just never in a million years presumed someone as beautiful as you could love me back utterly repelled he felt her scrawny fingers entrapping his neck like a sea anemone the bumpy ribs the razorsharp collarbones the slack breasts beneath the grey chiffon by contrast her tongue was bone hard as she rammed it between his lips almost down his throat and rubbed her body feverishly against his the sour milk stench of her breath was enough to make him gag make love to me tristan with lucy drowning he thought in fury then he felt her clawing fingers tightening round his neck and her big black bag which was still hanging from her arm pressing against his chest youre in danger he mumbled dickering as to whether to grab the bag lucyll take out anyone i love lucys taken care of rozzy smiled beatifically and tristan found himself looking into the eyes of true madness as rozzy went into hysterical laughter we neednt worry about lucy any more to stop her laughter tristan kissed her again on and on as in frenzied rage he grabbed her arms forcing them behind her back gripping her tighter and tighter until the pain in his shoulder became unbearable let me go darling rozzy was laughing and struggling christ she was strong as she bucked and writhed against him he was going to black out he couldnt hold on any longer then mercifully he was aware of shadowy figures approaching and seizing her but rozzy had wriggled out of their grasp bastard you doublecrossed me she was ranting screaming foaming at the mouth lunging forward to plunge her teeth into tristans chest trying to knee him in the groin and claw his face as rupert and gablecross dragged her off it took all their strength to yank her arms back so karen could clip on the handcuffs gotcha yelled gablecross as rozzys bag fell to the floor karen leapt forward and upended it out fell gun mobile mask and wig karen pounced on a huge set of keys glinting in the torchlight which one belongs to the torture chamber rozzy she asked gently im not telling you giggled rozzy youre too late the randy bitchll be dead by now she went into more crazed laughter which turned into a howl of agony as rupert seized her arm ill break it unless you tell us i can take pain you bastard aaaaaaah screamed rozzy its the purple yale christ let me go and to open the inside door with no compunction rupert applied more pressure ouch oh no rozzys head fell forward its the steel one splashed with blue paint she whispered rupert raced down the passage to where clive and bernard were trying to break down the door uniformed police were pouring down the stairs everyone was yelling instructions tristan stumbled after rupert his shirt totally red now rupert fumbled with the key give me some light for christs sake four torch beams found the keyhole the door swung open and a blast of icy wind from the lake slapped them in the face all they could see in the dim light was churning rising water were too late thought karen in despair reaching past her clive pressed the button as tristan jumped down into the pit turning the water red with his blood the manacles sprang back and he groped and found lucy and with his last ounce of strength dragged her to the surface how white and still and dreadfully cold she was oh please dont die he groaned next moment rupert karen and clive were in the water helping him lift her on to the bed trying to remember his first aid tristan dragged himself up beside her fighting to stop his lips trembling as he put them on her frozen ones oh god that the first kiss he gave her should be the last he tried to breathe in then collapsed covering her torn pink dress with blood ill do it said rupert gently shoving tristan out of the way youve lost too much blood get the fucking paramedics shouted gablecross they all watched frantically willing and praying as rupert breathed in and out come on lucy dont give up on us pleaded karen but after a minute or two rupert stopped and for a moment rested his head on lucys shoulder i think its too late let me have a go tristan lurched forward slumped against lucy his arms round her lucy darling dont leave me i love you suddenly she gave a shudder and a gulp then water gushed out of her mouth as the paramedics stormed in shes going to be ok lad gablecross patted tristans hand as he was lifted on to a stretcher wed better get you both to hospital of the two of you id say you were in the worst shape well done briefly rupert squeezed tristans thigh was sarah bernhardt one of your relations probably said tristan and passed out rosalind pringle said gablecross i am arresting you for the murders of roberto rannaldini and beatrice johnson and the attempted murders of lucy latimer tabitha lovell and tristan de montigny but as he reeled off the names he had an eerie feeling that the murderer had vanished and hed never be able to get a conviction on this discreet gently smiling suddenly old lady who kept nodding and saying wheres tristan i mustnt be late hes taking me to tea with aunt hortense it was six in the morning when gablecross received a summons from on high he had just spent two hours debriefing lucy and steeled himself now for a megabollocking and probably the sack a couple of hounds catching the fox on their own may be very clever but it doesnt endear the master the whips the horses and particularly the rest of the pack to them your behaviour has been utterly reprehensible thundered chief constable swallow timgoingoutonafuckinglimb again shouted gerald portland why didnt you and dc needham keep in touch there wasnt time guvnor and you mustnt blame dc needham i chewed her out for not being as good as charlie but she did brilliantly she discovered rozzy had been taking vast sums off lucy for private treatment for nonexistent cancer then we found rozzys cache that was a piece of work there dc needham discovered some photographs cut to shreds when she pieced them together she found they were three passport photographs of rozzy pringle shed used the fourth on lucy latimers passport so her dna profile on rannaldini and beattie would show up as lucys she confesses most of it on this tape gablecross chucked it down on the table then seeing both portland and swallow still looking bootfaced and knowing their weakness for a title he added it was on lady griseldas machine karens still debriefing lucy we wanted to get in touch sir but at the end we were only playing with minutes hows rozzy pringle dagenham what two stops up from barking you ought to be fired and probably prosecuted said portland after swallow had bustled off importantly into the next room to take a telephone call you left tabitha lovell unprotected at rutminster general you risked the lives of tristan de montigny and rupert campbellblack no bad thing in itself admittedly not to mention that little toad clive he did brilliantly protested gablecross performed like a trooper pity we cant recruit him hows montigny only a flesh wound bullet lodged in the muscle theyre operating now rozzy pringle was so bats about him that he was the only one who could lure her out he did fantastically too and lucy latimer i wanted to talk to you about her said gablecross shes outwardly ok in shock of course she had a terrible experience devastated as well that her dog was killed we dont want the defence to nobble her and if the press get onto her the whole case will collapse shes desperate to get away i said we might be able to arrange a safehouse for her abroad until after the trial in the next room they could hear swallows voice rising all right all right mr campbellblack thats entirely up to the police promotions board i dont care if you do go over my head jesus that bastard gets on my wick said swallow as he returned very red in the face now where were we gablecross was so tired he didnt at first take in that in their roundabout way both swallow and portland were congratulating him you saved our bacon admitted portland not sure how much longer we could have gone on spending taxpayers money youve done well tim better go home and put on a clean shirt before the press conference said swallow and i think dc needhams going to be every bit as good as charlie it must be tiredness and the fact that the chief constable had never called him tim before but for a hideous moment gablecross thought he was going to cry i absolutely agree sir he muttered tristan came round to find his room full of flowers and sunlight his shoulder throbbed but he could move his arm and the diamorphine was keeping any pain at bay sergeant gablecross was his first visitor carrying a bunch of purple chrysanthemums and a brown parcel wheres lucy demanded tristan is she all right i want to see her shes being debriefed said gablecross carefully shes very anxious you should read this he put the packet on the bedside table she handed it over to rozzy for safekeeping when she was arrested rozzy was intending to burn it well need it as evidence later the sister said i mustnt stay long well take a statement when youre feeling stronger how beautiful the boy was he thought enviously even when he was running a temperature the dark hair falling over the white forehead and the flush on the hollowed cheeks reminded you of black trees and snow warmed by a winter sunset tristan slumped back on his pillows was constantly reminded of the horror of lucys inert frozen body are you sure shes ok or as ok as she can be is james really dead we think so ruperts going to advertise so are we i must get her a puppy tristan turned fretfully to the package private and confidential i suppose that means everyone at rutminster police stations had a look as soon as gablecross had left a do not disturb sign on the door tristan opened the package the enclosed letter was headed hôtel de ville st malo dated july and smelt faintly of the disturbing overtly sexy scent lucy had worn the morning hed sacked her tristan shuddered at the memory dear tristan what kind generous handwriting lucy had i hope i bring you tidings of very great joy but the facts are so overwhelming i thought youd prefer to take them in when youre on your own although wolfie and i can answer any questions as best we can later your aunt hortense swore to your dad she would never tell the truth but in the end was persuaded that promises should occasionally be broken you truly are a montigny tristan and étienne was speaking the truth on his deathbed rambling on about your father being your grandfather the problem was rannaldini got the wrong grandad étienne was your grandfather laurent your father tristan slumped back against the pillows reeling from the shock he read on incredulously so in a way étienne was philip ii and laurent posa a soldier of noble lineage who hated staying idle so he stirred up trouble in chad and got blown up for trying to right wrongs on the other hand he was also carlos because he fell madly in love with your mum she was just back froma disastrous honeymoon with étienne where shed found she couldnt bear him near her laurent came home all suntanned and handsome she fell madly in love with him and fell pregnant with you while étienne was away painting in australia the paper was shaking so violently he could hardly read let alone turn the page when laurent died all his things were sent back loveletters from delphine plans for naming the baby tristan if it was a boy plans they would run away together the moment he came out of the army how laurent wanted tobe there when delphine broke the news to étienne because he knew what a temper his father had the extraordinary thing is that don carlos must be in your genes because étiennes humiliation and heartbreak must have been so like philips you can now understand his animosity and harshness towards you how would philip have reacted if hed been left to bring up elisabettas and carloss orphaned son all the letters and photos are here for you and perhapsmost important a selfportrait painted by étienne the year you were born just after he found out about laurent being your father i think it must be the saddest most beautiful and humane painting he ever did hortense said he wanted you to have it after his death so perhaps you could understand and forgive him the words swam before tristans eyes the whole thing was too enormous for him to take in his hands were trembling so much and he was so weak it was a struggle to open the envelope letters and photos cascaded all over the bed there was delphine christ she was sweet not at all like the tawdry temptress of the snake charmer and so pretty despite the ghastly highheeled boots square fringe and pastel lipstick of the sixties there was laurent so dashing in his uniform the ideal monsieur droit and the letters so passionate they burnt the page tristan felt rage welling inside him as he examined the little pencil drawing of himself as a newborn baby there was pride in every centimetre tristan laurent blaize a beautiful boy one hour old étienne had written on the back the selfportrait was in bubble wrap it was small fifteen inches by twelve but an undoubted masterpiece the tears glittered like rutshire streams as they flowed down étiennes wrinkles all the hurt pride and pain was contained in the narrow eyes and the clenched mouth papa papa cried tristan étienne was still his father and at last he understood everything what an absolute shit laurent must have been if only he could ring étienne beyond the grave to tell him how much he loved him he lay for a long time listening to the wood pigeons cooing and the distant rumble of traffic but only when he glanced up at the red plastic bag of blood dripping strength and vitality back into his body did he realize the full implications he was a montigny of the blood if on the wrong side of the blanket he was nothing to do with maxim he could marry and have children with whom he chose giddy with happiness he glanced at the bottom of lucys letter with all my love she had written there was a knock at the door ignoring the do not disturb sign wolfie walked in he was grey with fatigue but it would have been impossible to find anyone looking happier hows tab asked tristan seriously wonderful sighed wolfie oh tristan i am so lucky then with typical lack of ego but how are you feeling i hear you saved lucys life you and lucy give me back mine said tristan pointing to the letters and photographs strewn over the bed wolfie picked up étiennes selfportrait taking it to the window he whistled i didnt see that christ its powerful christlike in a way carrying that weight of suffering in one face i cant take it in tell me what happened lucy did it she put up with a hell of a lot of stick from aunt hortense and eventually won her over we were summoned back as we were leaving and allowed to go into laurents room which reminds me i must find out whats happened to papas gulf lucy did all that for me said tristan in bewilderment she wanted you to find happiness and i fire her because i was furious she let me down and i back off even last night because i didnt think i must find her reaching up he kept his finger on the bell where is lucy latimer he demanded as a fleet of alarmed nurses rushed in when he discovered lucy had been discharged several hours ago he went berserk panicstricken she was dead hed forgotten to salute that single magpie that flew past the window just now he was being punished for pretending to be in love with rozzy he was about to pull out all the drips and leap out of bed when gablecross and rupert came running in where the fucks lucy he snarled you must persuade him to stay said a worried sister hes running a high temperature and hes lost so much blood lucy wanted out tristan gablecross sat down on the bed she had a terrifying ordeal and if the press or defence get hold of her the whole case could collapse weve found her a safehouse how can she be safe without me very easily drawled rupert shut up snapped gablecross shell be quite ok he added prising himself out of the stranglehold of tristans good arm but she was insistent that noone should be given the forwarding address for how long whispered tristan in horror nine months perhaps a year tristan slumped back in bed the picture of desolation this is crazy i need to thank her i need her best thanks you can give her at the moment said rupert who was reading about his heroic exploits in the daily express is to leave her alone but i am in a different position now i thought i was maxims bastard child without any money a maimed being who could not have children youve hardly got a good track record rupert turned to page three smirking over the headline ruperts kiss of life saves lucy but she must feel something for me to have gone to france she was freeing you for tab said rupert bluntly she didnt know anything about claudine lauzerte that knocked her for six if i were you pretty boy id get on with what youre good at editing our film at that moment an excited nurse popped her head round the door i know youre not taking any calls tristan but its claudine lauzerte on the line well leave you to her said rupert and sauntered out in the corridor he turned to gablecross let the young puppy sweat let him find out hes really missing her rupert was extremely happy peppy koala was favourite for the st leger he was convinced he had masterminded lucys rescue and produced what was going to be an incredibly successful film outside the window a sea of press and television cameras filled the car park right up to the door he was delighted that xavier had taken a terrific shine to karen this afternoon they were going off with bianca to choose a puppy for taggies birthday rupert was also enchanted with his future soninlaw all that was needed was to organize a quickie divorce for tab helen didnt seem wildly keen on the idea shed always felt wolfie was her admirer and that it was all too close to home tabs grandfather eddie wasnt wild about it either how can you marry a kraut darling i spent half the war fighting them in the middle east the only cloud on the horizon for rupert was that bluey his first jockey had yesterday announced that he was going to live in america having conveniently fallen in love with a trainers daughter but as one door closes when isa lovell had walked unannounced into his office at penscombe that morning rupert had reached for his gun which was back in his desk drawer but to his amazement isa held out his hand this feuds gone on too long im sorry i fucked up your daughter because i hated you so much but it looks as though shes found the right bloke at last i came to say my fathers been forced for medical reasons to jack in the yard he and mumll need supporting so i wondered if youd like me to come and ride for you it took a lot to silence rupert finally he said coldly were almost entirely flat here now i know said isa but yesterday i tried out a mare who could win the national and the gold cup rupert stared at isas pale impassive gypsy face so like jakes twentyfive years ago it must have taken courage to come here getting to his feet he took isas hand ill have to check with wolfie and tab but ive never turned down a good offer or one that might irritate my first wife and i reckon if you and i joined forces noone in the world could beat us except perhaps little cosmo said isa drily bernard comforted tristan the most by putting things in perspective when étienne sent laurent into his own regiment hoping it would straighten the boy out he asked me to keep an eye on him i tried but laurent was bent on bucking the system they were torturing prisoners in chad laurent hit a senior officer across the mess and there were persistent rumours of antifrench activities of course there was outrage at the time that hed been taken out by his own side but i think it would have happened sooner or later i hate laurent and my mother for what they did to papa tristans face was haggard laurent was the bestlooking lad i ever saw admitted bernard he was your fathers most adored son the true favori du roi which made the betrayal much worse he had all posas charisma and courage and his ruthlessness snapped tristan pretty shabby cuckolding your own father he was terribly young only twenty and she was sixteen i loved laurent confessed bernard i held him in my arms as he lay dying and he said look after my son so you knew said tristan in amazement thats why you came out of the army and went into films and became my first assistant his eyes filled with tears youve been my guardian angel he mumbled grabbing bernards hand guardian angels dont have brickred faces and black moustaches there was a pause tristan longed to pour his heart out about lucy but felt under the circumstances it was tactless im sorry about rozzy bernard shrugged ive got a family at home theyve never seemed more precious the shaven crown was packed out with members of the inner cabinet getting drunk gablecross usually felt sad at the end of a murder even if theyd caught the criminal it didnt bring back the victims beattie had probably had a mother who was fond of her but it was hard to feel upset about a monster like rannaldini well done karen gablecross patted her arm my second charlie karens face lit up but embarrassed because she felt so colossally honoured she immediately changed the subject poor rozzy seemed such a nice lady what made her do it low selfesteem couldnt hack not being loved by everyone kill anyone who slighted her the exposure made her feel important the centre of attention shes a singer after all then she got a taste for it in the end shed have killed tristan because he couldnt have reciprocated her love ill drive you home he went on seeing karen suppress a yawn it was such a beautiful night moths danced in the headlamps shooting stars careered across a drained blue sky the scent of limes drifted through the car windows gablecross had dropped karen off and was turning off the paradise road towards eldercombe he was just congratulating himself on being home early for margaret for once so they could discuss dianes eighteenth birthday party which he could easily pay for now when he heard singing shell be coming round the mountain when she comes shell be coming round the mountain when she comes singing ay yay yippy ay yay yippy some nutter was turning up his stereo at full blast next moment a huge maroon roller roared past shattering the peace of the evening gablecross gave chase but every time the road widened enough for him to catch up the rollers driver put his foot down and the laughter and singing grew more raucous he finally managed to block them in as they swung into river houses drive inside he found hermione and sexton shell be coming round the mountain sergeant gablecross cried hermione in amazement we thought you were our good friend the chief constable going home gablecross got out his notebook and was just pondering whether to book them for speeding drunkdriving not wearing seatbelts or creating a nuisance when sexton said come in and celebrate you both appear to have been celebrating for several hours sir indeed hermione bowed and with cause timothy we want you to be the first to know we are with child a sibling for little cosmo gablecross hoped it would be a little brother or cosmo would certainly put her on the game weve got a smashin bottle of krug in the fridge said sexton cosily bubbly for the bobby bubbly for the bobby chortled hermione as she weaved up the drive gablecross sighed he obviously wasnt going to get home to margaret for a while in a mad frenzy of superstition tristan locked himself away editing twentyfour hours a day only when don carlos was finished and an unqualified triumph would he feel worthy of seeking out lucy it was an agonizing task because every frame with people in it was a testament to her genius how could she have made his cast so beautiful yet so full of character hermione looked not a day over twentyfive flora disturbingly boyish baby so pale wan and fond chloe so languorously seductive mikhail so noble granny so unrelentingly evil alpheus so tortured yet kingly shes actually made that prat look like a gent observed rupert who popped in most days and got frightfully excited over the special effects tristans filming of the grey writhing travellers joy in winter suggested a wonderfully ghostly charles v on each visit tristan begged rupert for information about lucys whereabouts every day he telephoned gablecross but met the same stonewalling refusal too much money was invested in the trial to allow any slipup another reason tristan worked through the night was the bad dreams that racked him if he tried to sleep of lucy drowning in a sea of blood of the painting of cleopatra and the asp in buckingham palace except it was lucys face not cleopatras from which the colour was draining having finished editing tristan had to bite his nails until he showed the final cut to the press on january and went into even deeper despair that the whole thing was junk youre too close to it said wolfie soothingly but will the man in the street like it you couldnt get more philistine than my future fatherinlaw confessed wolfie and hes mad about it admittedly hes convinced he directed the entire film i even heard him singing morte de posa in the bath the other morning but tristan wasnt to be reassured he was always cold always miserable he dreamt of crumpets big log fires and lucy winning the mothers race the only glimmer of cheer was that the lily in the valley had been nominated many times over in the incredibly prestigious academia awards in edinburgh which boded well for the oscars in february it was widely rumoured that claudine lauzerte would be flying up to scotland for the ceremony if so she must have been tipped off shed won best actress she wouldnt put her head on the block otherwise january and were a hellish two days for tristan carrying the coffin at aunt hortenses funeral on the tuesday morning flying to london for the première and press screening of don carlos followed by interviews which would probably go on all night with a breakfast script conference for hercule first thing wednesday morning then off to edinburgh for the academia awards ceremony tristan arrived at the première in leicester square in dark glasses so noone could see his reddened eyes he had been icily in control during hortenses funeral and only given way to helpless weeping when hed reached the sanctuary of his room at the savoy he had grown increasingly close to her in his frequent visits to montvert in the last six months as they had unlocked his past together hortense was also his last link with lucy he arrived at the première alone which fuelled the gossipmongers who knew he was meeting claudine tomorrow leicester square swarming with police keeping back the huge crowds and the paparazzi was also horribly reminiscent of valhalla he longed to bolt into the cinema alas the red carpet had already been appropriated by hermione resplendent in extremely lowcut purple velvet arm in arm with sexton posing for the huge pack of cameras and press photographers determined even the rutminster echo should have the chance of a decent picture hermione hermione to me big smile hermione whos your date hermione why didnt you know its sexton kemp our producer look this way sexton to me sexton sexton sexton was in heaven tristan was going through the roof whenever i feel afraid i hold my cock erect sang a voice in tristans ear and whistle a happy tune cant you give the old cow direction to move on it was baby straight out of an australian summer his bronzed beauty enhanced by a dinner jacket with black satin facings worn with a black silk shirt and a satin bowtie the press were going nuts trying to identify him they wont have to ask after tonight said tristan as they finally fought their way in everyone will know who you are more than can be said for you thought baby tristan had lost so much weight he was almost unrecognizable outside the press was going into further frenzy as a blond couple emerged from an orange lamborghini must be chloe catford said the mirror its tabitha campbellblack said the sun isnt she fucking gorgeous shes tabitha lovell now said the mail about to be rannaldini shes marrying wolfie next month hes the hunk beside her and heres rupert a great cheer went up from the crowd been saving any more lives rupe put your arm round taggie a bit happier to me rupe can we have all four of you for a family group thats quite enough snapped an extremely uptight rupert shoving them all inside after that people arrived in a great rush alpheus and cheryl just on speaking terms chloe ravishing in prussian blue taffeta flora and george flashing wedding rings and walltowall smiles for the photographers mikhail and lara in splendid form until mikhail caught sight of alpheus turned as green as a cooking apple and fled to the gents russians dont have the bigmatch temperament said alpheus dismissively bollocks murmured baby grabbing two glasses of champagne and handing one to chloe mikhails gone to whip off those priceless diamond cufflinks which hes just remembered he nicked from alpheus during the recording hell have pickpocketed another pair by the end of the screening doesnt tristan look appalling probably sick with nerves said chloe i know i am the advance publicitys been so overwhelming theres bound to be a backlash oh heres simone and griselda whos wearing a dinner jacket gosh they look blissful and so do granny and giuseppe although giuseppes just cannoned off that pillar pissed already said baby whos that stunning guy with helen lysanders father david hawkley whispered flora hes a headmaster a classical scholar and rather glam in a geriatric way perfect for helen because hes just got his k boomed griselda she loved being lady rannaldini but lady hawkley sounds even more kosher i must say she looks great naturally im in mourning for my late husband helen was telling the times diary the police are still refusing to let us bury him have you met sir david hawkley hermiones great white breasts meanwhile were nearly popping out of her lowcut dress in indignation helens only wearing black because she knows it suits her she hissed to sexton purple is the colour of mourning and have you seen how dreadful tristan looks everyone was bemoaning the fact that lucy had been spirited away by the police and would miss the fun yet again regards some colossal stars must have arrived little simone was jumping to see over the crowds as a whitehot firework display of flashbulbs exploded up the other end of the room they certainly have griselda lifted her up to have a look its ds gablecross and dc needham she looks stunning raved simone and the pretty woman with them must be madame gablecross and theres abby and viking giggled flora they keep waking their baby up with a torch in the middle of the night to see if its ok must be rather like the nuremberg trials oh look at my george blushing because alexei nemerovskys remembered him from the gala two years ago nemerovskys marcus campbellblacks boyfriend she added to griselda and simone and theres marcus belting across the room flora fell into her old friends arms goodness you look well they cried in unison im so pleased we were asked and not gerry portland and the chief constable muttered karen its detective sergeant timothy gablecross mrs margaret gablecross and detective constable karen needham she happily told the photographer who had produced a notebook nice to see someone rather than us scribbling things down whos it for tatler said the photographer karen glanced at the gablecrosses and went off into peals of laughter portland and the chief really will fire us now any information on rozzy pringles trial sarge asked the sun only that its coming up at the end of april said gablecross firmly it was such a jolly party most people didnt feel nervous until they spilled into the dimly lit cinema hows rozzy simone whispered to karen very very mad now tristan rupert and taggie whod taken refuge in a side room slid into their seats at the last moment im so nervous for uncle tristan muttered simone catching sight of his grey frozen face as the lights dimmed but she neednt have worried from the moment the royal family appeared in the royal box there was cheering and clapping followed by screams of delighted recognition at the shot of granny as gordon dillon glowering across at them from the opposite box then a shiver of excitement as rannaldini swept in god he was attractive thought flora with a shudder as he tossed aside his highwaymans cloak brought down his stick and the orchestra exploded then there was the beautiful shot of the armies meeting on the skyline merging into the hunt streaming down the valley which in turn merged into the hard colours of heatwave and the violence of the polo then back to baby singing in cathedral copse listen to the clapping murmured an amazed rupert to taggie as applause broke out again and again at valhalla in the snow and sunset at merediths red drawing room at the wonderful horses at griseldas inspired costumes and at the end of every aria but not for too long in case something was missed and the music sounded glorious who composed this stuff demanded a bigwig from disney at the end of morte de posa cant we sign him things were also pepped up by the subplot of the murders that was just after tabs leather was cut whispered griselda to anne robinson as tab and baby collided in front of the goal and that was when tristan was arrested she added as baby chloe and mikhail squabbled over pistols in the maze there was an added frisson as rozzy made her solo appearance which tristan had refused to cut do not cry my dearest friend do not cry sang hermione as she stroked a sobbing rozzys face boo hissed baby from the back stalls id watch out hermsie rozzys probably got a flickknife hidden in the folds of that skirt there was a long horrified silence followed by howls of laughter there was laughter too when sharon chewed up alpheuss slippers tristan had been apprehensive about the nude scenes but they were so magically filmed and lit so genuinely erotic and so wonderfully woven into the fantasies of the characters that everyone loved and clapped them roars of applause and endofgame whistling however greeted hermiones bonk with alpheus and at one moment eager fans started singing england england in time to her bobbing bottom one is more popular than the other singers whispered a gratified hermione to sexton but the audience needed these brief moments of laughter to relieve the heartbreak of the story and the horrors of the auto da fe all round the cinema people were hiding their faces as the executioners set fire to the piles of newspaper beneath the heretics tab who loathed classical music and had intended to neck in the back stalls with wolfie except when sharon or the horses came on had watched every second daddy keeps crying she murmured to wolfie normally he only cries in lassie or the incredible journey wolfie was simply dying with pride because despite the feuds the tensions and even the murders tristan had produced the most beautiful and thrilling film he had ever seen the two hours seemed to flash by carlos and elisabetta had bidden their poignant farewells then carlos was led off by charles v leaving elisabetta looking very like princess diana to face the paparazzi lining up with their long lenses like a firing squad until she fell to the ground riddled with bullets then the paparazzi became the inquisition in their black habits with valhallas four massive triangular cypresses echoing them along the skyline cutting briefly to rannaldini on the rostrum handsome head thrown back eyes closed bringing the music to a triumphant close there was total total silence but as the end titles rolled up before the lights went on the cinema exploded hugs were exchanged hands clasped cheeks kissed everyone was embracing jumping up and down cheering their heads off as though a war or lottery had been won it was no longer a question of whether carlos was going to be a hit but how much bigger it was going to be than anything in years i must go and congratulate tristan cried tab as everyone surged into the ballroom next door he looked like one of his own ghosts earlier oh i wish lucy was here noone is to ask questions about the murders its all sub judice hypealong was frantically telling the press as they fell on the bar and the food oscar valentin and sylvestre were already getting plastered well done well done mes amis said dupont the montignys lawyer kissing each of them most uncharacteristically on both cheeks what a film étienne couldnt not be proud of tristan after that i must get hold of a tape to show his brothers but id like to tell tristan personally how much i enjoyed it tristans brothers were livid added dupont lowering his voice because aunt hortense in reverse ratio to étienne had left her entire spare quarter to stray dogs and tristan in his present crazy mood sighed valentin some might say the two were indistinguishable where the hell ees he merde alors leetle cosmo just march in with pushy galore perhaps he make her next lady rannaldini after all the roar of the party and the friendship duet pouring out of the speakers made it difficult to make oneself heard tristans portrayed the press as so irredeemably bloody shouted the independent well have to be nice about his picture to redeem ourselves gordon dillon on the other hand was tickled pink to be portrayed as himself the scorpion was going to do a big feature he told granny immediately inviting him to lunch in the boardroom only if giuseppe can taste the food and drink first said granny drily no chance of your bringing that lucy latimer as well asked gordon dillon foxily there was no doubt that baby had stolen the show what are you doing next asked the guardian fat francos broken a rib falling out of someone elses bed drawled baby so im taking otello over from him at the met wow the tenors everest said opera now in admiration no thought baby wistfully isa lovell was the tenors everest did you enjoy shagging dame hermione asked a a gill alpheus was in ecstasy with so many charming young women journalists to crinkle his eyes at he had even hung his dinner jacket over the back of a chair to show off his manly figure george and wolfie propped up the bar getting pissed together keeping an eye on flora and tab in case any journalist asked awkward questions it was the proudest moment of my life sighed george seeing tebaldo sung by flora hungerford coming up on the credits hello wolfgang hi george called helen i dont know if youve met sir david hawkley hello mummy tab breaking away from her circle of press admirers came rushing over its so cool lynda leepotters coming down to penscombe tomorrow to interview me and sharon dog news are putting her on the cover and celia haddon is going to make her pet of the week in the telegraph then when helen didnt respond tab asked lamely did you enjoy it enormously enthused helen tristan is so clever and the acting was wonderful even hermione was better than usual merediths sets were surprisingly effective so was lucys makeup and valhalla looked stunning wolfies also been a tower of strength she continued warmly i thought your little yellow lab stole the show said david hawkley smiling at tab when is your baby due dame hermione asked the sunday telegraph early april hermione put on a soppy face an aries bairn where are you having it in the hippopotamus house at london zoo baby whispered to flora david attenboroughs on standby where are you staying in new york flora asked him with ruperts younger brother adrian who owns an art gallery and sounds distinctly promising confided baby so tomorrow might be another good day looking down from the balcony hypealong was gratified to see all his stars still ringed six deep with frantically questioning press but they were all waiting to talk to tristan many of them had held their pages and were desperate to telephone their copy where the hell is he asked hugh canning its like hamlet without the prince hypealong tracked down rupert on a windowseat talking to taggie i love you he was saying sorry to interrupt murmured hypealong but youre the only person tristan might listen to as rupert fought his way round the edge of the room he heard alpheus saying now where in hell did i leave my dinner jacket at the bottom of the stairs he passed wolfie in deep conversation with helen as youre going to be my motherinlaw for the rest of your life wolfie was saying icily it would be nice just occasionally if you could tell tabitha how brilliantly shed done thats my boy said rupert patting him on the back rupert found tristan in a small office gazing out on the passersby and the plane trees of leicester square his face was orange from the street lights his shoulders hunched his desolation palpable you must be over la lune said rupert cheerfully youve made a bloody marvellous flick and the press are all downstairs waiting to tell you so what is life to me without her said tristan idly next moment he had grabbed the lapels of ruperts dinner jacket and thrust him against a filing cabinet with the strength of a madman ive made you a fucking fortune you bastard im not speaking to anyone until you tell me where lucy is for a moment rupert gazed at him seeing the depths of his loneliness and despair ok ill lean on gablecross if he tells me ill fax it up to the caledonian tomorrow melanie one of the academia awards publicity team very young pretty and silly met tristan at the airport and made him feel that by catching the right flight he had successfully landed on the moon its so good of you to come all this way may i call you tristan we all love lily in the valley so much were going to give away little bottles of diorissimo by the way its fast becoming a cult movie with my generation madame lauzerte she added reverently has already arrived she asked me to give you this letter she was obviously so dying to know what was in it that tristan had to sit with his back to the taxi window to stop her reading over his shoulder my darling claudine had written i am so longing to see you it has been such a difficult seven months jeanlouis is still adamant he doesnt want a divorce but he has agreed to turn a blind eye to you and me as long as we are incredibly discreet i am staying at one devonshire gardens in glasgow tonight you can join me there this evening without even having to go through reception call me at the caledonian as soon as you get in your loving claudine which of us is happy in this world quoted tristan bitterly which of us has his desire or having it is satisfied seven months ago that letter would have orbited him into the seven hundred and seventyseventh heaven now he felt like a small boy being shunted into care melanie had already seen the ecstatic review alexander walker had given don carlos in the evening standard now she was going on and on reeling off the celebs and incredibly distinguished academics whod jetted in from all over the world we feel the academia is more prestigious than bafta or the césars or even the oscars oh look at those queues for don carlos already going round and round and round the cinema they had reached the outskirts of edinburgh passing square charcoalgrey houses and sooty gardens where the first daffodils were being blown horizontal by the east wind there was the cardboard cutout of the castle against an angry sky of racing clouds tristan gasped at the cold as he jumped out of the taxi but as he scuttled towards the warmth of the caledonian he noticed a beggar slouched on the pavement an empty whisky bottle lay beside him in an upsidedown tweed cap on the pavement gleamed a few coins but what caught tristans already watering eyes was the total despair of the beggars dog a very old lanky lurcher whose opaque rheumy eyes gazed into space and who despite his matted russet coat was shivering uncontrollably thinking how uncomfortable the unrelenting pavement must be for his bony hocks and elbows tristan handed the beggar a tenner and bloody well spend it on dog food he snapped at the sound of tristans voice however the old dog suddenly pricked up his brown velvet ears and staggered to his feet making little whining noises in his throat next moment his long tail was frantically hitting his stickingout ribs as he lumbered unsteadily forward james croaked tristan incredulously oh james and dropping to his knees he hugged the dog until he had red hairs like larch needles all over his smart navy blue overcoat we thought you were dead where did you find this dog he demanded furiously hes not mine said the beggar in a surprisingly educated voice hastily pocketing the tenner i think he came from some gypsies he added defensively he lives in a squat but we all borrow him he looked so thin and pathetic all the passersby used to fork out for him now hes lost heart and doesnt sell himself and people tend to walk by in embarrassment were going to club together and invest in a cute little terrier much better returns tristan rose to his feet somehow controlling the fury gathering force inside him go and drink yourself into an early grave he shoved a wad of notes into the beggars hand and give me that dog oh there you are tristan it was melanie braving the cold again in her twinset short skirt and very high heels youll be late for prelunch drinks so many people want to interview you she went on through the streaked blonde hair that blew across her mouth madame lauzerte rang again and this she handed over a fax with an excited little giggle has just come in from rupert campbellblack hes a cult figure for our generation too tristan tristan but tristan and james had vanished into very thin air lucys safehouse was a rescue kennels outside boston she had begged gablecross to find her a place where she could put her terrors and utter anguish in perspective by looking after those even worse off than herself but nothing had prepared her for the sadness of falling in love with one terrified often dreadfully maltreated dog after another nursing it back to health only to find it had to be put down after a few weeks to make way for a newer younger arrival she was tormented that she had no idea what had really happened to james and as her longing for him and tristan grew more desperate she felt as in need of rescuing as the dogs and wished she could plunge the fatal needle into herself there were moments of happiness when a dog was rehomed and the other kennelmaids who seemed to love their work sensed her misery and were incredibly kind but she always refused their invitations to come out in the evenings in case she broke down she had had little contact with england since she left her family had been told nothing except that she was safe karen and gablecross had been over and were now painstakingly piecing together the prosecutions case but rozzy had become so mad it seemed doubtful she would ever be brought to trial but dont feel sorry for her warned gablecross shes an evil coldblooded psychopath and clever enough to be faking constantly lucy woke screaming from nightmares of drowning in the torture chamber of tristan covered in blood being dragged away from her and worst of all of rozzys crazy laughter as like a tolling bell she listed lucys imperfections too common too dull too ugly too presumptuous as a result lucy had steeled herself not to ask gablecross about tristan by now he must have got it together with claudine or tabitha and moved back to his own world she had no access to english or french newspapers but occasionally came across snippets about don carlos flipping through yesterdays boston globe during her lunch hour on january she stumbled on a photograph of claudine and tristan scent of victory brings lovers together again proclaimed the headline to a story that the french film the lily in the valley was tipped to sweep the boards at the prestigious academia awards that evening which would be broadcast on pbs the following night looking at tristans young happy face as he gazed so proudly down at claudine lucy gave a wail of misery she had been given a new name linda gilham a new passport and a new socialsecurity number why couldnt someone provide her with a new heart as she stumbled out into the yard dogs everywhere started barking their heads off scrabbling against the wire fencing oh shut up screamed lucy then knowing shed been horrible ran forward to stick her fingers through the wire to be nuzzled and frantically licked like a vicious cancer her longing for tristan had grown more unbearable every day there was no morphine to ease the pain but as some compensation she could record tonights awards and play the tape over and over again it was her turn that evening to muck out the kennels afterwards she went straight into the shower scrubbing herself clean and washing her hair which as part of her disguise hung blonde and straight an inch below her collarbone as she put on a nightie which tab had once given her with a picture on the front of peter rabbit eating a carrot she reflected that tristan probably wouldnt recognize her now he met so many people he might not remember her anyway at least she had a lovely warm bedsitter centrally heated against the east coast winter and with views over the kennels and the park where she walked the dogs for their allotted twenty minutes a day she had bought a litre of white and poured herself a large drink to steady her nerves the sweat was already coursing down her ribs over and over she checked the tape was working and that shed got the right channel but in the end the awards passed in a blur as the cameras roved around the tables lucy was conscious of the depressing number of ravishing women then she gave a cry of delight as through a cloud of gauloise smoke emerged oscar valentin bernard sylvestre and ogborne all getting plastered but as she searched in vain among the other flushed selfsatisfied luncheon guests there was no sign of tristan or claudine up and down up and down gush gush gush went the winners thanking everyone from auntie glad to the guineapig oh get on with it implored lucy but at last it was best actress in the clips from the lily in the valley claudine looked so beautiful that lucy groaned it was impossible tristan couldnt still be in love with her and sure enough it was her name stephen fry drew out of the gold envelope from an aerial view the round tables covered in white damask all with their rings of green perrier bottles at the centre floated like waterlilies on the blueygreen carpet as claudine glided between them up onto the stage she was wearing a beautiful suit the colour of bramble fool which brought out the violet in her wideapart eyes lovingly stroking her award which was gold and in the shape of an owl she murmured a few platitudes only redeemed by the sexiness of her french accent although it wouldnt seem so sexy to tristan thought lucy helping herself to another glass of wine because he was french anyway claudine didnt look a bundle of laughs nor did she get tumultuous applause she had lost too many brownie points not coming forward to save tristan in july valentin won the award for best cameraman the prize for director of photography went to oscar who caused huge laughter by being caught fast asleep on camera when his name was read out but he woke up enough to tell the audience tristan was the finest director hed ever worked with hear hear shouted lucy but where is he the best actor award went to anthony hopkins which was an excuse for another glass of wine and at last it was best director tristan was competing with woody allen stanley kubrick and steven spielberg lucys nightgown was drenched in sweat she couldnt stop shaking please make him win she prayed so that at least i see him as more clips were shown of claudine in the lily in the valley lucy hurled a cushion at the television set narrowly missing her fastemptying bottle julie christie just as beautiful as claudine was slowly opening the envelope tantalizing taking her time and the best director is tristan de montigny for the lily in the valley lucys scream of excitement was lost in the roar of applause as the whole audience rose to their feet to pay tribute to the courage with which tristan had faced his terrible problems in the past year but lucys tears of joy turned into wails of despair as after a roll of drums the spotlight once more tracked bloody claudine coming back through the tables up onto the stage and her makeups been redone thought lucy savagely claudine wasnt looking very sunny however particularly when there were groans of disappointment and a flurry of booing and shouts of wheres tristan i am afraid treestan de monteegny ees eendisposed said claudine defensively and cannot accept this award but i know he would thank you all for this wonderful honour i am so appy to accept it on his behalf because he is most wonderful director i ever worked with and the one with the most integrity which is more than can be said for you shouted a drunken ogborne poleaxed with disappointment lucy switched off the television and threw herself on her bed the pain was unendurable hearing his name seeing the others in the crew had brought everything back how could she exist for another second without him she was crying so hysterically at first she didnt hear banging on the door linda linda linda shouted bella the senior kennelmaid what in hells the matter please open the door go away sobbed lucy leave me alone gee im sorry to bother you but you know about lurchers and some guys brought one in i told him to come back tomorrow but he seems desperate i said youd take the dogs particulars and settle it in we dont want any more dogs wept lucy itll mean another one put down to make room for him wiping her face on the counterpane seizing a handful of tissues to blow her nose mumbling that she simply wasnt up to it lucy stumbled downstairs into the freezing cold night to discover it had been snowing the dog pens on either side of the rough track leading up to the checkin office were empty of dogs but blanketed in snow snow lay on the roofs of the kennels behind where she hoped the dogs were sleeping and wouldnt wake up when she installed the lurcher newcomers were often traumatized by the din snow already freezing on the wire fencing and the dogs nameplates on each pen reminded her unaccountably of valhalla and then she saw him tiptoeing tentatively out of the office a big grey shaggy dog and her eyes were full of tears once more because in the moonlight he looked like the ghost of james he was a little rickety on his legs but as she drew nearer he suddenly noticed her stiffened and his tail began sweeping back and forth almost touching his ears as he broke into a lovely loping canter he must be a ghost he must but as she ran forward and he bounded towards her swifter than eagles she could see his dark paw prints stretching out behind him in the snow then he sank down on his ancient legs squeaking and pirouetting four times in the moonlight and sneezing in excitement he collapsed at her feet totally immobile for a few seconds lucy fell to her knees hugging him wailing as she felt the razor sharpness of his ribs and backbone but all the time his tail beat frenziedly as his long tongue shot out to lick away the waterfall of tears oh james darling how come youre in america wiping her eyes on his fur lucy raced up the snowy path in her bare feet with james bounding beside her its a miracle she screamed someones brought in my james tell me im not dreaming then she heard a voice the most heartbreakingly husky voice in the world saying indignantly no i didnt make myself clear i want to keep the dog it is your kennelmaid that i want to rehome tristan croaked lucy oh tristan in the doorway to the waiting room her knees gave way with jamess shaggy body the only thing propping her up as tristan came through the other door from the general office she gave a gasp because snow was melting in his hair as it had been on the first day of filming and because he was even thinner than james and under the fluorescent lighting looked greyer and more ghostly than james had in the moonlight it must be a dream her eyes were so wet and her throat so dry she couldnt cry out and neither it seemed could he they just gazed at each other the only sound was the brisk drumbeat of jamess tail against a metal filing cabinet where did you find him at last she stammered out the words in edinburgh outside my hotel some bastard use him to beg for money he was so thin i didnt recognize him he was the clever one who recognized me as someone closed the door discreetly behind him lucys thanks came tumbling over each other wiping her eyes and nose on the sleeve of her nightie she crouched down beside james clinging to him kissing him over and over as he snaked against her in ecstasy i thought id never see him again her voice broke oh how did you find me gablecross finally admit you are here or i would have arrived seven months earlier lucy gazed down thinking how tearstained and soppy and pollyannaish she must look in her peter rabbit nightie with her yellow hair in bunches but tristan was only aware of her sweet trembling mouth and the way her cheekbones shone like motherofpearl as the tears slid over them then suddenly roused from shock he noticed her bare feet and how little she was wearing you mustnt catch cold whipping off his coat he wrapped it round her breathing in the tang of eau sauvage on the dark blue collar fighting the temptation to fall into his arms lucy collapsed instead on to a leather sofa i didnt wake you asked tristan no i was watching the academias lily in the valley won everything you got best director i did you dont sound very excited its a huge honour other things matter more hows don carlos anyone would think she was at one of helens drinks parties people seem to like it everyone loves your makeup and have bet you get oscar soothed by lucys stroking james had collapsed on the floor but kept one eye open after all his future was at stake all round the walls hung photographs of beautiful happy rehomed dogs cheek to cheek with adoring but often extremely plain owners maybe thought lucy hopefully through a haze of white wine one didnt need to be beautiful to be loved then she made the mistake of asking how tab was blissful said tristan happily ruperts revving up for a massive wedding at penscombe in april how lunatic shed been to hope smoothing the feathers on jamess legs lucy felt the tears starting again thats great desperately she tried to keep the conversation light i can be godmother to your first child id much rather you were its mother muttered tristan but lucy wasnt concentrating only noticing that he seemed to be edging across the room towards her like james trying to get on to her mothers double bed when they stayed in cumbria lucy darling please stop crying begged tristan i cant bear it listen to me hortense die last week oh no im so sorry lucy looked up in horror she was such a darling she love you too and eef you hadnt sought her out i would never have known i was laurents son that parcel was most wonderful present i ever have i can never thank you too much but its me who should thank you you saved my life you brought james back well have to settle abroad said lucy in a worried voice hed never cope with quarantine nor would i tristan was so close now she could again breathe in the familiar heady cocktail of eau sauvage peppermint chewinggum and gauloise and her heart started to hammer as his knees brushed against hers james and i had long conversation on the plane coming over was she imagining it or had his hand just stroked her hair james detest crate i have to put him into continued tristan he didnt believe i was taking him to you he was so depressed and nervous i had to sit in the hold and hold his paw it was very uncomfortable for both of us there were two parrots with us who both learn to say i love lucy by end of flight still unable to take in what he was saying lucy gave a shaky laugh james want to live in france insisted tristan we dont know anyone in france said lucy in a choked voice you know me crouching down beside her tristan put one hand over her mouth taistoi my darling for just one second since you go away nothing in my life has been so dreadful i suffer over claudine but nothing to the purgatory of life without you those months of filming you bring such sunshine into my life with the other hand he was now stroking her forehead fingering her feathery eyelashes wiping away a fresh supply of tears running his finger down her nose in wonder you are really real he whispered i have nightmares every night that you are dead oh so do i breathed lucy appalled to find she couldnt stop kissing his fingers hush i talk first i kid myself you are sweet little sister i never had when you take care of me after rannaldini tell me about maxim i kid myself you are mother i never had but then you come back from france looking so beautiful in that pink dress and i sack you because i am so whitehot jealous youre having affaire with wolfie i suddenly realize you are true grand passion i never have when you nearly died i died with worry but when you went away i died worser tristan removed his hand from her mouth and waited lucy lucy please look at me and say something but she was so stunned by the wonder of his words she could only stare down and ask herself how the hell peter rabbit could stuff his face with carrot at a time like this tristan picked up one of her bunches you look so sexy with blonde hair then a horrible possibility dawned on him there is not someone else someone else squeaked lucy incredulously of course not ive never loved anyone but you since that moment i saw you with snow in your hair the prince with the heavy heart then she remembered the occasion and cried out despairingly but what about tab and the wedding whats she got to do with it asked tristan in amazement tabs marrying wolfie oh my god did you think it was still tab and me oh my poor angel kneeling up he pulled her against him feeling the frantic pounding of her heart as she in turn felt the exquisite pain of being crushed against the hardness of his big gold blazer buttons thats wonderful for wolfie gasped lucy but werent you heartbroken not in the least they will have pretty blond babies and wolfiell look after her so well he adores her so much not as much as i shall adore and look after you for a second tristan sounded almost beady and you and i will have lots of babies with dark curly hair who will be even prettier i know how you love kids he picked up lucys hand and kissed each finger as maxims son i couldnt give them to you so i back off by the time i open parcel and learnt the truth you had gone why did you run away it broke my heart i couldnt bear the pain tentatively lucys hand crept up to the dark stubble along his jaw i thought you were in love with claudine or at least tab thats stiff competition and rozzy her voice trailed off in embarrassment rozzy what demanded tristan forcing her face upwards she well she said i was too plain ugly and common and your family would be furious ouch lucy screamed as tristans hand clenched on her chin then gasped in alarm because his eyes had become black whirlpools of hatred eef that evil monster werent in security prison he spat i break in and tear her to pieces how dare the beetch you have sweetest face in the world and my family will love you whether you will love them is different matter my brothers are very pompous and its me they are furious with at the moment because aunt hortense leave me so much money and tristan smiled suddenly they dont quite know how to handle griselda i adore your face very gently he covered it in kisses and now it will grow as familiar as the paintings on my bedroom wall but lucy wasnt ready for certainty what about claudine i read the mail tristan scrambled to his feet pulling lucy up against him despite his thinness his chest was still broad and his arms incredibly strong as they closed round her i should have level with you he muttered my love for her die the night rannaldini die i drive to wales and find i am chasing dream did you see her in edinburgh no i run away i call her from airport she was furious are you sick she shout no i say i am seeking running his hands deep into lucys hair he gazed down at her you have no need of oscars lighting then breathing in faint traces of bluebell he knew spring had at last returned as he kissed her lucy could feel his wonderful big bruised lower lip crushing hers and his tongue caressing her tongue just for a second her eyes flickered open and saw that his were closed in ecstasy the thick dark brown lashes fanning his beautiful cheekbones as she swivelled her head sideways so he could kiss her even harder she felt as though she was being drawn up to heaven like one of chagalls angels and what her head still couldnt quite take in her heart accepted completely that he truly loved her as they broke for breath she flung her arms round his neck you are the most blissfully gorgeous man who ever walked this earth and im going to love cherish and adore you for ever if you dont i shall be horribly jealous said tristan even of pierre lapin he fingered peter rabbit look at lucky him lying against those wonderful breasts how dyou know theyre wonderful mumbled a blushing lucy i have hypealongs picture in my wallet i show it you later but first you must have this reaching down to his coat which had fallen on the floor he took a little black velvet box from the inside pocket aunt hortense leave me ring which once belong to marie antoinette you give me back my name lucy now i want you to share it with me lucys hands were trembling so violently tristan had to open the box inside like mistletoe berries waiting for kissing lovers gleamed three pearls as a tear splashed on one of them tristan said shakily i would be safest happiest guy in world if you would wear it always they were brought back to earth by a great snore rending the air with his future assured james felt safe to fall asleep epilogue the police had finally allowed rannaldini to be buried in huge pomp unwilling to attend the funeral tristan came alone to valhalla to pay his last respects it was a bitterly cold dark afternoon the east wind howled and lashed the naked trees a for sale sign swung dismally outside the main gates tristan went straight to the graveyard here amid a sea of flowers and higgledypiggledy ivyclad graves soared a splendid white marble headstone on which had already been inscribed the words roberto rannaldini maestro and composer as he stood in the fading light tristan relived the past year remembering baby serenading hermione in the snow tabitha screaming at the hunt granny silencing the rabble with such terrifying authority alpheus singing with such kingly anguish and mikhail as he lay dying reducing everyone to tears tristan thought of simone wolfie and bernard working themselves to the bone of valentin and oscar creating radiance even when they seemed at their most languid and inattentive of dearest lucy always comforting and smiling of sexton giving him full rein and heroically raising the money and the rest of the crew backing him all the way despite their grumbling but without rannaldini it would never have happened without rannaldinis kindness and continual encouragement in the early days he would never have emerged from the shadow of étiennes disdain and become a director and what would rannaldini who had never settled for less than perfection think of his film which was now in a little black oblong box for present and future generations to judge more important than winning any oscars tristan hoped that whatever form or being he was now rannaldini would be proud strange that one narrow grave could contain so much vitality strange that so much tragedy and passion should be contained in one small black videotape which tristan now laid on rannaldinis grave on top he placed a white gardenia but as he stood in silence he could have sworn a pale violet light like a torch beam or a peacock butterfly left over from summer landed on the grave and danced for a second before disappearing into the earth he shook his head it must have been a trick of the light leaving the graveyard he wandered past merediths cuckoo clock lying upside down in the park the patch of yellow grass beneath lucys caravan was green once more the loveinamist in her abandoned windowbox turned to seed pods tristan put a couple in his pocket looking over the valley with the ghosts of the past swirling around him he was overwhelmed by sorrow that don carlos was over and rannaldini gone for ever but as he walked swiftly back to the car park he felt only joy as he switched on his telephone and dialled his future may i speak to lucy de montigny please acknowledgements in robin bairdsmith then of constable the publisher sent me to death valley to write a short book about patrick lichfield photographing three ravishing nude models for the unipart calendar as well as patricks crew there was a second film crew videoing the shoot for television everyone was obsessed with their own agenda with temperatures hitting f the rows were as pyrotechnic as the high jinks returning home a wreck but eternally grateful to everyone involved for such riotous fun i vowed one day to write a novel about a film crew on location the result fourteen years later is score the subject no longer a calendar shoot but the filming of verdis darkest opera don carlos with the resultant tensions leading to murder only when i had embarked on the story did i realize that in addition to filming and recording i would need to research opera and the ways of singers as well as the infinitely complicated police procedure of solving a murder this consequently means a huge number of people to thank for their help singers and those who work with them seem to have particularly large and generous hearts on the filming front i must start by thanking my dear friend adrian rowbotham an independent director who not only talked to me for hours but later nobly ploughed through the manuscript for errors i am also eternally grateful to the charismatic peter maniura of bbc television who was brilliant on directing the film of dido and aeneas and the ebullient mick csaky of antelope films who rolled up to lunch with a complete and marvellously funny brief on how to fund the film of an opera mick also introduced me to the divine soprano susan daniel who over many meetings shared her singing experiences particularly of starring in the film of carmen with placido domingo brilliant filming advice was given me by ray marshall chloë and david hargreaves and alison sterling of fat chance productions alan kaupe clifford haydntovey james swann nick handel bill and susannah franklyn and in particular irving teitelbaum and rob knights who allowed me to range freely on the set of mosley the excellent series they produced and directed for itv during this time i had terrific conversations with actors jonathan cake jemma redgrave and roger may as well as chris odell the director of photography rudi buckle sound charlotte walter wardrobe heather storr continuity shelagh pymm publicity patricia kirkman makeup and an ace caterer called melanie my heroine in score is a makeup girl always the still centre of any shoot so i would therefore especially like to thank all the makeup artists over the years who soothed and transformed me as well as beguiling me with anecdotes they include maggie hunt valerie macdonald jacqui jefferies becky challis rozelle parry sally holden clayton howard juliette mayer sarah bee jenny sharpe and celia hunter several chapters in score are set in france here i am deeply indebted to star journalist suzanne lowry as well as my french publisher valérieanne giscard destaing for thinking up glamorous names jonathan eastwood for being brilliant on french law jill de monpezat for kindly reading the french chapters for accuracy caterina krucker for correcting my french and my brother and sisterinlaw timothy and angela sallitt who lived for ten years in a stunning house in the tarn and who have been a constant source of information and inspiration on the music front i am quite unable to express sufficient gratitude to bill holland head of polygram classics and jazz easily the nicest and most generous man in the record business who not only lent me numerous books and plied me with the relevant cds but also endlessly answered my questions waded through the chapters on recording and finally produced a glorious double cd of the music featured in score bill also invited me to a miraculous production of bergs lulu at glyndebourne again i am extremely grateful to the then general director anthony whitworthjones for letting me wander everywhere and to humphrey burton and sonia lovett and their crew at nvc arts who were filming lulu for channel for allowing me to attend production meetings and sit in the control room and beside the cameramen during the performance going back to the seventies i must thank my friend guelda waller for first taking me to don carlos at the royal opera house thus igniting a passion which has grown with the years it was therefore a colossal thrill to be allowed to sit in on phillips classics recording sessions of don carlos in walthamstow assembly rooms in i would especially like to thank the executive producer clive bennett the legendary christopher raeburn who produced the record the mighty bernard haitink the sublime chorus and orchestra of the royal opera house covent garden the beguiling language coach maria cleva the endearingly laidback orchestra manager clifford corbett and the magnificent cast including richard margison robert lloyd galina gorchakova robin leggate and roderick williams i also had particular help from patricia haitink jan burnett the coordinator james jones in charge of publicity and the pa james ross a rising young conductor who talked to me for hours about the opera and made some excellent suggestions when the book was in synopsis stage my characters sing a lot in the book i am therefore extremely grateful first to theodore lap and hugh graham and secondly to avril bardoni for permission to quote from their excellent english translations of the don carlos libretto which in hughs case was for the emi recording conducted by antonio pappano and in avrils for the programme when don carlos was performed at a promenade concert i must thank ingrid kohlmeyer of english national opera and helen anderson and rita grudzien of the royal opera house who were constantly helpful i am also indebted to katherine fitzherbert who runs english touring opera which brings such joy to music lovers around the country katherine allowed me to sit backstage with the dsm helen bunkall at a production of rigoletto and work the lightning flashes she also invited me to werther followed by a riotous endoftour party here i had the luck to meet the conductor alistair dawes then head of music staff at the royal opera house and his wife lesleyann a singer and teacher who have since become extremely close friends letting me sit in on lessons taking me through the don carlos score and answering endless questions other singers who have given me wonderful advice include susan parry penelope shaw andy busher christine botes joanna colledge and john hudson i must thank my musician friends who sometimes have rather trenchant views on singers they include chris and jacoba gale ian pillow diggory seacome luke strevens jack and linn rothstein lance green who thought up the title score and his wife justine richard hewitt and steena and marat bisengaliev i have also been royally entertained and enlightened on the subject of opera by dear sir ian hunter nicholas kenyon michael volpe george humphreys and paul hughes as don carlos in my book is set in modern dress i spent an utterly magical two hours recceing the state rooms at buckingham palace for ideas this was kindly organized by claire zammitt these rooms are only open to the public from early august to early october my director in score however visits the rooms in early spring which was the only time it could be fitted into the plot i hope her majesty will forgive the poetic licence st peters grange a beautiful fifteenthcentury retreat nestling in the wooded grounds of prinknash abbey gloucestershire is the model for the abbey around which filming and murder take place in score i was very privileged to have father damien of prinknash and peter clarkson to show me repeatedly over the house and garden and to answer endless questions on its dark and romantic history score is my first and almost certainly last whodunit after battling with the complexities of murder i rate the genius of agatha christie and pd james even higher than that of einstein i would have given up altogether had it not been for the kindness and cooperation of gloucester and stroud police no matter what hour i rang no matter how fatuous the query they entered into the spirit and never failed to provide an answer their only disagreement was whether the male member remains erect after the moment of death stroud maintaining it did gloucester it didnt other police officers beguiled me with thrilling tales of murder and later waded through the manuscript for errors they know who they are and the extent of my gratitude gloucester fire and ambulance services were just as helpful particularly their assistant divisional officer graham jewell gloucester reference library kindly checked names for me the british polio fellowship the british film industry and weatherbys were also always ready with answers a writer does not automatically expect kindness from her own profession but few could have been more welcoming and generous with their time than david fingleton mel cooper charles osborne michael coveney malcolm hayes norman lebrecht keith clarke and richard fawkes of classical music and james jolly and christopher pollard of gramophone i must also thank the authors of five books which were invaluable in helping me to understand my subject the colin clark diaries the prince the showgirl and me ring resounding the marvellous account by the late john culshaw of the first recording in stereo of wagners ring the jigsaw man a study of criminal psychology by paul britton john baxters wonderful biography of steven spielberg and the late sir rudolph bings five thousand nights at the opera my friends as usual came up with endless ideas they include teddy chad vanessa calthorpe flavia cooper val hennessey huw humphreys annabel dinsdale richard stilgoe graham ogilvie harriet capaldi godfrey smith and his grandson max cordellsmith louise naylor michael cordy simon craker marjorie and peter hendy jill reay lizzy moyle rowena luard sarah king claire williams james and georgie carter maurice leonard maria prendergast philip jones rob and sharon morgan alistair horne and general sir peter davies were brilliant on french soldiering peter davies the art writer on french painters micky suffolk on helicopters andrew parker bowles charlie mann charlie brooks on racing astrid st aubyn and zahra hanbury on ghosts my doctors graham hall and pat pearson and their staff at frithwood surgery on medical matters and our vet dear john hunter on animals animals play a hugely important part in score particularly the heroines dog james who is based on a shaggy red rescued lurcher of the same name the adored pet of alan little of gardners noone else in the book however is based on anyone unless they are so famous as david mellor and nigel dempster are that they appear as themselves score i must emphasize is a work of fiction and any resemblance to any living person or organization is purely coincidental i wish i had space to thank everyone who helped me those named were usually experts in their own field but i took their advice only as far as it suited my plot which in no way reflects on their expertise i am extremely grateful to transworld for publishing score and to broo doherty for working so hard to edit it to neil gower for drawing such a beautiful map and to my agent desmond elliott and his assistant douglas kean for all their support and kindness id also like to thank jo xuerebbrennan who provided marvellous advice when cuts in the original manuscript were asked for the real heroines of score however are my five friends pippa birch annette xuerebbrennan anna gibbskennett mandy williams and caterina krucker who typed the huge manuscript in all its endless drafts and rewrites i cannot thank them enough for their enthusiasm industry and advice on everything from polo backhands to pregnancy kits i must especially thank my dear pa pippa birch for looking after me so beautifully and my cleaner ann mills to whom score is dedicated who has restored our house to order for the last fifteen years and is simply one of the nicest people i know the lions share of my gratitude as usual goes to my husband leo my children felix and emily and my dogs hero and bessie who have put up with murder literally for the last three years and have been constantly comforting and inspiring
