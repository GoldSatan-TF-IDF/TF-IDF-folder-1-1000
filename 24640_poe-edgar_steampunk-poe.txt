steampunk poe by edgar allan poe illustrated by zdenko basic and manuel sumberac introduction the steampunk genre didnt exist when edgar allan poe was penning his masterful mysteries and nightmarish horror stories so you might be wondering how exactly the two have come together in this book the greatest writers though produce works that transcend their own times allowing each new generation of readers to discover them anew and edgar allan poe is nothing if not one of the greatest american writers in history but to understand exactly how well edgar and steampunk go together it might be helpful to know a little about edgar himselfand what inspired him to write the way he did edgar poe was born on january in boston massachusetts his early life was cloaked in much of the mystery and heartbreak that is woven through the canon of his works not long after edgar was born his father disappeared abandoning the family edgars mother died shortly thereafter young edgar was then taken in by john and frances allan a wealthy family from richmond virginia though they never formally adopted him their surname became his middle creating a name that would earn a place in the annals of great american writers edgar had a tumultuous relationship with his foster father but that did not interfere with johns plans for edgars education including a boarding school in england and enrollment in the newlyformed university of virginia edgar however was soon expelled for debauchery that included drinking and gambling leading to an even greater rift with john frances died in leaving edgar motherless again to honor her deathbed wish edgar and john tried to mend their relationship but the reconciliation was shortlived despite the bad feelings between the two edgar never dropped the allan from his nameeven after john eventually disowned him determined to seek his fortune as a writer from an early age edgar returned to his hometown of boston where his first collection of poems tamerlane was published when he was just years old though these poems were anonymously credited to a bostonian edgar was surely disappointed when his first foray into publication was met with virtually no attention a stint in the army followed by enrollment at the united states military academy in west point new york offered a similar outcome to his time at the university of virginia edgar however was undaunted in pursuit of publication in at the age of he married his yearold cousin virginia clem and moved to fordham new york there edgar made a name for himself not as a writer of original works but as a keen literary critic which earned him many enemies among his contemporaries still with dogged determination edgar continued to write dozens of short stories and poems that explored his fascination with mysteries puzzles death and the macabre especially after the death of virginia in edgars poems were fraught with a recurring theme of the untimely death of a beautiful young womanechoing perhaps edgars own personal tragedies the death of his mother his foster mother and his beloved wife he was wellregarded among his friends and many luminaries of the literary world despite how frequently edgar required financial rescuing from various debts and debacles poes own untimely death at age is shrouded in a mystery that perhaps only his great detective character c auguste dupin could solve on october edgar was found covered in filth ill virtually incoherentand strangely enough wearing clothes that did not belong to him though edgar was immediately hospitalized he never recovered and indeed was unable to explain the bizarre circumstances that had brought him to such a sorry state of affairs after edgars death several theories circulated as to the cause of his demise including cholera tuberculosis alcoholism and even rabies it is now known that one of his most bitter literary enemies rufus wilmot griswold worked tirelessly after edgars death to discredit him by spreading false rumors that edgar died of drug addiction as well as penning a hateful obituary and a biography studded with brazen lies so many years after he left this earth what remains most important is edgars literary legacy poems and stories that still chill and thrill with their horrifying descriptions and shocking twists all wrapped up in evocative word choices that delight generation after generation of readers he originated the detective story beginning with the murders in the rue morgue the mystery of marie rogêt and the purloined letter and entire genres like science fiction benefited from edgars unparalleled talent the steampunk genre which currently enjoys immense popularity was decades away from invention when edgar was writing yet its clear how many of his stories and poems provide an essential framework for it from edgars interest in technological advancements like hotair balloons in the balloon hoax to his elaborate descriptions of ornate architecture and lavish fashion in the fall of the house of usher the spectacles and the masque of the red death the many charms of steampunk also serve as hallmarks of his writing and certainly edgars assorted cast of murderers and madmen offer an opportunity to explore some of the steampunk movements darker more disturbing components whatever silent secrets about his life and death lie buried with him in a grave at westminster hall and burying grounds in maryland edgar allan poes body of work continues to speak for itself i stories the masque of the red death the red death had long devastated the country no pestilence had ever been so fatal or so hideous blood was its avatar and its sealthe redness and the horror of blood there were sharp pains and sudden dizziness and then profuse bleeding at the pores with dissolution the scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellowmen and the whole seizure progress and termination of the disease were the incidents of half an hour but the prince prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious when his dominions were half depopulated he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and lighthearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys this was an extensive and magnificent structure the creation of the princes own eccentric yet august taste a strong and lofty wall girdled it in this wall had gates of iron the courtiers having entered brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts they resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within the abbey was amply provisioned with such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion the external world could take care of itself in the meantime it was folly to grieve or to think the prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure there were buffoons there were improvisatori there were balletdancers there were musicians there was beauty there was wine all these and security were within without was the red death it was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad that the prince prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence it was a voluptuous scene that masquerade but first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held these were sevenan imperial suite in many palaces however such suites form a long and straight vista while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded here the case was very different as might have been expected from the dukes love of the bizarre the apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time there was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards and at each turn a novel effect to the right and left in the middle of each wall a tall and narrow gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite these windows were of stained glass whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened that at the eastern extremity was hung for example in blueand vividly blue were its windows the second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries and here the panes were purple the third was green throughout and so were the casements the fourth was furnished and lighted with orangethe fifth with whitethe sixth with violet the seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue but in this chamber only the color of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations the panes here were scarleta deep blood color now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof there was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers but in the corridors that followed the suite there stood opposite to each window a heavy tripod bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room and thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances but in the western or black chamber the effect of the firelight that streamed upon the dark hangings through the bloodtinted panes was ghastly in the extreme and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all it was in this apartment also that there stood against the western wall a gigantic clock of ebony its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull heavy monotonous clang and when the minutehand made the circuit of the face and the hour was to be stricken there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that at each lapse of an hour the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause momentarily in their performance to hearken to the sound and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company and while the chimes of the clock yet rang it was observed that the giddiest grew pale and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused revery or meditation but when the echoes had fully ceased a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly and made whispering vows each to the other that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion and then after the lapse of sixty minutes which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the time that flies there came yet another chiming of the clock and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before but in spite of these things it was a gay and magnificent revel the tastes of the duke were peculiar he had a fine eye for colors and effects he disregarded the decora of mere fashion his plans were bold and fiery and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre there are some who would have thought him mad his followers felt that he was not it was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not he had directed in great part the movable embellishments of the seven chambers upon occasion of this great fête and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders be sure they were grotesque there were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasmmuch of what has been since seen in hernani there were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments there were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions there were much of the beautiful much of the wanton much of the bizarre something of the terrible and not a little of that which might have excited disgust to and fro in the seven chambers there stalked in fact a multitude of dreams and thesethe dreamswrithed in and about taking hue from the rooms and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps and anon there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet and then for a moment all is still and all is silent save the voice of the clock the dreams are stifffrozen as they stand but the echoes of the chime die awaythey have endured but an instantand a light halfsubdued laughter floats after them as they depart and now again the music swells and the dreams live and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever taking hue from the manytinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods but to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven there are now none of the maskers who venture for the night is waning away and there flows a ruddier light through the bloodcolored panes and the blackness of the sable drapery appals and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments but these other apartments were densely crowded and in them beat feverishly the heart of life and the revel went whirlingly on until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock and then the music ceased as i have told and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before but now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock and thus it happened perhaps that more of thought crept with more of time into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled and thus too it happened perhaps that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before and the rumour of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around there arose at length from the whole company a buzz or murmur expressive of disapprobation and surprisethen finally of terror of horror and of disgust in an assembly of phantasms such as i have painted it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation in truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited but the figure in question had outheroded herod and gone beyond the bounds of even the princes indefinite decorum there are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion even with the utterly lost to whom life and death are equally jests there are matters of which no jest can be made the whole company indeed seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed the figure was tall and gaunt and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave the mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat and yet all this might have been endured if not approved by the mad revellers around but the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the red death his vesture was dabbled in bloodand his broad brow with all the features of the face was besprinkled with the scarlet horror when the eyes of prince prospero fell upon this spectral image which with a slow and solemn movement as if more fully to sustain its rôle stalked to and fro among the waltzers he was seen to be convulsed in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste but in the next his brow reddened with rage who dareshe demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near himwho dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery seize him and unmask himthat we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise from the battlements it was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the prince prospero as he uttered these words they rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly for the prince was a bold and robust man and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand it was in the blue room where stood the prince with a group of pale courtiers by his side at first as he spoke there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder who at the moment was also near at hand and now with deliberate and stately step made closer approach to the speaker but from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party there were found none who put forth hand to seize him so that unimpeded he passed within a yard of the princes person and while the vast assembly as if with one impulse shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls he made his way uninterruptedly but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first through the blue chamber to the purplethrough the purple to the greenthrough the green to the orangethrough this again to the whiteand even thence to the violet ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him it was then however that the prince prospero maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice rushed hurriedly through the six chambers while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all he bore aloft a drawn dagger and had approached in rapid impetuosity to within three or four feet of the retreating figure when the latter having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer there was a sharp cryand the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet upon which instantly afterward fell prostrate in death the prince prospero then summoning the wild courage of despair a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment and seizing the mummer whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and corpselike mask which they handled with so violent a rudeness untenanted by any tangible form and now was acknowledged the presence of the red death he had come like a thief in the night and one by one dropped the revellers in the bloodbedewed halls of their revel and died each in the despairing posture of his fall and the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay and the flames of the tripods expired and darkness and decay and the red death held illimitable dominion over all the telltale heart truenervousvery very dreadfully nervous i had been and am but why will you say that i am mad the disease had sharpened my sensesnot destroyednot dulled them above all was the sense of hearing acute i heard all things in the heaven and in the earth i heard many things in hell how then am i mad hearken and observe how healthilyhow calmly i can tell you the whole story it is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain but once conceived it haunted me day and night object there was none passion there was none i loved the old man he had never wronged me he had never given me insult for his gold i had no desire i think it was his eye yes it was this one of his eyes resembled that of a vulturea pale blue eye with a film over it whenever it fell upon me my blood ran cold and so by degreesvery graduallyi made up my mind to take the life of the old man and thus rid myself of the eye for ever now this is the point you fancy me mad madmen know nothing but you should have seen me you should have seen how wisely i proceededwith what cautionwith what foresightwith what dissimulation i went to work i was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before i killed him and every night about midnight i turned the latch of his door and opened itoh so gently and then when i had made an opening sufficient for my head i put in a dark lantern all closed closed so that no light shone out and then i thrust in my head oh you would have laughed to see how cunningly i thrust it in i moved it slowlyvery very slowly so that i might not disturb the old mans sleep it took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that i could see him as he lay upon his bed hawould a madman have been so wise as this and then when my head was well in the room i undid the lantern cautiouslyoh so cautiouslycautiously for the hinges creakedi undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye and this i did for seven long nightsevery night just at midnightbut i found the eye always closed and so it was impossible to do the work for it was not the old man who vexed me but his evil eye and every morning when the day broke i went boldly into the chamber and spoke courageously to him calling him by name in a hearty tone and inquiring how he had passed the night so you see he would have been a very profound old man indeed to suspect that every night just at twelve i looked in upon him while he slept upon the eighth night i was more than usually cautious in opening the door a watchs minute hand moves more quickly than did mine never before that night had i felt the extent of my own powersof my sagacity i could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph to think that there i was opening the door little by little and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts i fairly chuckled at the idea and perhaps he heard me for he moved on the bed suddenly as if startled now you may think that i drew backbut no his room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness for the shutters were close fastened through fear of robbers and so i knew that he could not see the opening of the door and i kept pushing it on steadily steadily i had my head in and was about to open the lantern when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening and the old man sprang up in the bed crying outwhos there i kept quite still and said nothing for a whole hour i did not move a muscle and in the meantime i did not hear him lie down he was still sitting up in the bed listeningjust as i have done night after night hearkening to the death watches in the wall presently i heard a slight groan and i knew it was the groan of mortal terror it was not a groan of pain or of griefoh noit was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe i knew the sound well many a night just at midnight when all the world slept it has welled up from my own bosom deepening with its dreadful echo the terrors that distracted me i say i knew it well i knew what the old man felt and pitied him although i chuckled at heart i knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise when he had turned in the bed his fears had been ever since growing upon him he had been trying to fancy them causeless but could not he had been saying to himselfit is nothing but the wind in the chimneyit is only a mouse crossing the floor or it is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp yes he had been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions but he had found all in vain all in vain because death in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him and enveloped the victim and it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feelalthough he neither saw nor heardto feel the presence of my head within the room when i had waited a long time very patiently without hearing him lie down i resolved to open a littlea very very little crevice in the lantern so i opened ityou cannot imagine how stealthily stealthilyuntil at length a single dim ray like the thread of the spider shot from out the crevice and full upon the vulture eye it was openwide wide openand i grew furious as i gazed upon it i saw it with perfect distinctnessall a dull blue with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones but i could see nothing else of the old mans face or person for i had directed the ray as if by instinct precisely upon the damned spot and now have i not told you that what you mistake for madness is but overacuteness of the sensesnow i say there came to my ears a low dull quick sound such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton i knew that sound well too it was the beating of the old mans heart it increased my fury as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage but even yet i refrained and kept still i scarcely breathed i held the lantern motionless i tried how steadily i could maintain the ray upon the eye meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased it grew quicker and quicker and louder and louder every instant the old mans terror must have been extreme it grew louder i say louder every momentdo you mark me well i have told you that i am nervous so i am and now at the dead hour of the night amid the dreadful silence of that old house so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror yet for some minutes longer i refrained and stood still but the beating grew louder louder i thought the heart must burst and now a new anxiety seized methe sound would be heard by a neighbor the old mans hour had come with a loud yell i threw open the lantern and leaped into the room he shrieked onceonce only in an instant i dragged him to the floor and pulled the heavy bed over him i then smiled gaily to find the deed so far done but for many minutes the heart beat on with a muffled sound this however did not vex me it would not be heard through the wall at length it ceased the old man was dead i removed the bed and examined the corpse yes he was stone stone dead i placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes there was no pulsation he was stone dead his eye would trouble me no more if still you think me mad you will think so no longer when i describe the wise precautions i took for the concealment of the body the night waned and i worked hastily but in silence first of all i dismembered the corpse i cut off the head and the arms and the legs i then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber and deposited all between the scantlings i then replaced the boards so cleverly so cunningly that no human eyenot even hiscould have detected any thing wrong there was nothing to wash outno stain of any kindno bloodspot whatever i had been too wary for that a tub had caught allha ha when i had made an end of these labors it was four oclockstill dark as midnight as the bell sounded the hour there came a knocking at the street door i went down to open it with a light heartfor what had i now to fear there entered three men who introduced themselves with perfect suavity as officers of the police a shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night suspicion of foul play had been aroused information had been lodged at the police office and they the officers had been deputed to search the premises i smiledfor what had i to fear i bade the gentlemen welcome the shriek i said was my own in a dream the old man i mentioned was absent in the country i took my visitors all over the house i bade them searchsearch well i led them at length to his chamber i showed them his treasures secure undisturbed in the enthusiasm of my confidence i brought chairs into the room and desired them here to rest from their fatigues while i myself in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim the officers were satisfied my manner had convinced them i was singularly at ease they sat and while i answered cheerily they chatted familiar things but ere long i felt myself getting pale and wished them gone my head ached and i fancied a ringing in my ears but still they sat and still chatted the ringing became more distinctit continued and became more distinct i talked more freely to get rid of the feeling but it continued and gained definitivenessuntil at length i found that the noise was not within my ears no doubt i now grew very palebut i talked more fluently and with a heightened voice yet the sound increasedand what could i do it was a low dull quick soundmuch such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton i gasped for breathand yet the officers heard it not i talked more quicklymore vehemently but the noise steadily increased i arose and argued about trifles in a high key and with violent gesticulations but the noise steadily increased why would they not be gone i paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides as if excited to fury by the observation of the menbut the noise steadily increased oh god what could i do i foamedi ravedi swore i swung the chair upon which i had been sitting and grated it upon the boards but the noise arose over all and continually increased it grew louderlouderlouder and still the men chatted pleasantly and smiled was it possible they heard not almighty godno no they heardthey suspectedthey knewthey were making a mockery of my horrorthis i thought and this i think but any thing was better than this agony any thing was more tolerable than this derision i could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer i felt that i must scream or dieand nowagainhark louder louder louder louder villains i shrieked dissemble no more i admit the deedtear up the plankshere hereit is the beating of his hideous heart the fall of the house of usher son cœur est un luth suspendu sitôt quon le touche il résonne de béranger during the whole of a dull dark and soundless day in the autumn of the year when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens i had been passing alone on horseback through a singularly dreary tract of country and at length found myself as the shades of the evening drew on within view of the melancholy house of usher i know not how it wasbut with the first glimpse of the building a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit i say insufferable for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that halfpleasurable because poetic sentiment with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible i looked upon the scene before meupon the mere house and the simple landscape features of the domainupon the bleak wallsupon the vacant eyelike windowsupon a few rank sedgesand upon a few white trunks of decayed treeswith an utter depression of soul which i can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the afterdream of the reveller upon opiumthe bitter lapse into everyday lifethe hideous dropping off of the veil there was an iciness a sinking a sickening of the heartan unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime what was iti paused to thinkwhat was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the house of usher it was a mystery all insoluble nor could i grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as i pondered i was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion that while beyond doubt there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth it was possible i reflected that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene of the details of the picture would be sufficient to modify or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression and acting upon this idea i reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling and gazed downbut with a shudder even more thrilling than beforeupon the remodelled and inverted images of the gray sedge and the ghastly treestems and the vacant and eyelike windows nevertheless in this mansion of gloom i now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks its proprietor roderick usher had been one of my boon companions in boyhood but many years had elapsed since our last meeting a letter however had lately reached me in a distant part of the countrya letter from himwhich in its wildly importunate nature had admitted of no other than a personal reply the ms gave evidence of nervous agitation the writer spoke of acute bodily illnessof a mental disorder which oppressed himand of an earnest desire to see me as his best and indeed his only personal friend with a view of attempting by the cheerfulness of my society some alleviation of his malady it was the manner in which all this and much more was saidit was the apparent heart that went with his requestwhich allowed me no room for hesitation and i accordingly obeyed forthwith what i still considered a very singular summons although as boys we had been even intimate associates yet i really knew little of my friend his reserve had been always excessive and habitual i was aware however that his very ancient family had been noted time out of mind for a peculiar sensibility of temperament displaying itself through long ages in many works of exalted art and manifested of late in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognizable beauties of musical science i had learned too the very remarkable fact that the stem of the usher race all timehonored as it was had put forth at no period any enduring branch in other words that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent and had always with very trifling and very temporary variation so lain it was this deficiency i considered while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one in the long lapse of centuries might have exercised upon the otherit was this deficiency perhaps of collateral issue and the consequent undeviating transmission from sire to son of the patrimony with the name which had at length so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the house of usheran appellation which seemed to include in the minds of the peasantry who used it both the family and the family mansion i have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experimentthat of looking down within the tarnhad been to deepen the first singular impression there can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstitionfor why should i not so term itserved mainly to accelerate the increase itself such i have long known is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis and it might have been for this reason only that when i again uplifted my eyes to the house itself from its image in the pool there grew in my mind a strange fancya fancy so ridiculous indeed that i but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me i had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinityan atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven but which had reeked up from the decayed trees and the gray wall and the silent tarna pestilent and mystic vapor dull sluggish faintly discernible and leadenhued shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream i scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity the discoloration of ages had been great minute fungi overspread the whole exterior hanging in a fine tangled webwork from the eaves yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation no portion of the masonry had fallen and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts and the crumbling condition of the individual stones in this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old woodwork which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault with no disturbance from the breath of the external air beyond this indication of extensive decay however the fabric gave little token of instability perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure which extending from the roof of the building in front made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn noticing these things i rode over a short causeway to the house a servant in waiting took my horse and i entered the gothic archway of the hall a valet of stealthy step thence conducted me in silence through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master much that i encountered on the way contributed i know not how to heighten the vague sentiments of which i have already spoken while the objects around mewhile the carvings of the ceilings the sombre tapestries of the walls the ebon blackness of the floors and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as i strode were but matters to which or to such as which i had been accustomed from my infancywhile i hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all thisi still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up on one of the staircases i met the physician of the family his countenance i thought wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity he accosted me with trepidation and passed on the valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master the room in which i found myself was very large and lofty the windows were long narrow and pointed and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellissed panes and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around the eye however struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling dark draperies hung upon the walls the general furniture was profuse comfortless antique and tattered many books and musical instruments lay scattered about but failed to give any vitality to the scene i felt that i breathed an atmosphere of sorrow an air of stern deep and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all upon my entrance usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it i at first thought of an overdone cordialityof the constrained effort of the ennuyé man of the world a glance however at his countenance convinced me of his perfect sincerity we sat down and for some moments while he spoke not i gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity half of awe surely man had never before so terribly altered in so brief a period as had roderick usher it was with difficulty that i could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable a cadaverousness of complexion an eye large liquid and luminous beyond comparison lips somewhat thin and very pallid but of a surpassingly beautiful curve a nose of a delicate hebrew model but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations a finely moulded chin speaking in its want of prominence of a want of moral energy hair of a more than weblike softness and tenuitythese features with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten and now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features and of the expression they were wont to convey lay so much of change that i doubted to whom i spoke the now ghastly pallor of the skin and the now miraculous lustre of the eye above all things startled and even awed me the silken hair too had been suffered to grow all unheeded and as in its wild gossamer texture it floated rather than fell about the face i could not even with effort connect its arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity in the manner of my friend i was at once struck with an incoherencean inconsistency and i soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancyan excessive nervous agitation for something of this nature i had indeed been prepared no less by his letter than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical confirmation and temperament his action was alternately vivacious and sullen his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance to that species of energetic concisionthat abrupt weighty unhurried and hollowsounding enunciationthat leaden selfbalanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance which may be observed in the lost drunkard or the irreclaimable eater of opium during the periods of his most intense excitement it was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit of his earnest desire to see me and of the solace he expected me to afford him he entered at some length into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady it was he said a constitutional and a family evil and one for which he despaired to find a remedya mere nervous affection he immediately added which would undoubtedly soon pass off it displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations some of these as he detailed them interested and bewildered me although perhaps the terms and the general manner of their narration had their weight he suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses the most insipid food was alone endurable he could wear only garments of certain texture the odors of all flowers were oppressive his eyes were tortured by even a faint light and there were but peculiar sounds and these from stringed instruments which did not inspire him with horror to an anomalous species of terror i found him a bounden slave i shall perish said he i must perish in this deplorable folly thus thus and not otherwise shall i be lost i dread the events of the future not in themselves but in their results i shudder at the thought of any even the most trivial incident which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul i have indeed no abhorrence of danger except in its absolute effectin terror in this unnerved in this pitiable condition i feel that the period will sooner or later arrive when i must abandon life and reason together in some struggle with the grim phantasm fear i learned moreover at intervals and through broken and equivocal hints another singular feature of his mental condition he was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted and whence for many years he had never ventured forthin regard to an influence whose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be restatedan influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion had by dint of long sufferance he said obtained over his spiritan effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down had at length brought about upon the morale of his existence he admitted however although with hesitation that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable originto the severe and longcontinued illnessindeed to the evidently approaching dissolutionof a tenderly beloved sister his sole companion for long years his last and only relative on earth her decease he said with a bitterness which i can never forget would leave him him the hopeless and the frail the last of the ancient race of the ushers while he spoke the lady madeline for so was she called passed through a remote portion of the apartment and without having noticed my presence disappeared i regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread and yet i found it impossible to account for such feelings a sensation of stupor oppressed me as my eyes followed her retreating steps when a door at length closed upon her my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother but he had buried his face in his hands and i could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears the disease of the lady madeline had long baffled the skill of her physicians a settled apathy a gradual wasting away of the person and frequent although transient affections of a partially cataleptical character were the unusual diagnosis hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady and had not betaken herself finally to bed but on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house she succumbed as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation to the prostrating power of the destroyer and i learned that the glimpse i had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last i should obtainthat the lady at least while living would be seen by me no more for several days ensuing her name was unmentioned by either usher or myself and during this period i was busied in earnest endeavors to alleviate the melancholy of my friend we painted and read together or i listened as if in a dream to the wild improvisations of his speaking guitar and thus as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit the more bitterly did i perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness as if an inherent positive quality poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe in one unceasing radiation of gloom i shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours i thus spent alone with the master of the house of usher yet i should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies or of the occupations in which he involved me or led me the way an excited and highly distempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all his long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears among other things i hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of von weber from the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded and which grew touch by touch into vaguenesses at which i shuddered the more thrillingly because i shuddered knowing not whyfrom these paintings vivid as their images now are before me i would in vain endeavor to educe more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words by the utter simplicity by the nakedness of his designs he arrested and overawed attention if ever mortal painted an idea that mortal was roderick usher for me at least in the circumstances then surrounding me there arose out of the pure abstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvas an intensity of intolerable awe no shadow of which felt i ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of fuseli one of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction may be shadowed forth although feebly in words a small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel with low walls smooth white and without interruption or device certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth no outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent and no torch or other artificial source of light was discernible yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor i have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer with the exception of certain effects of stringed instruments it was perhaps the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar which gave birth in great measure to the fantastic character of his performances but the fervid facility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for they must have been and were in the notes as well as in the words of his wild fantasias for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations the result of that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which i have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement the words of one of these rhapsodies i have easily remembered i was perhaps the more forcibly impressed with it as he gave it because in the under or mystic current of its meaning i fancied that i perceived and for the first time a full consciousness on the part of usher of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne the verses which were entitled the haunted palace ran very nearly if not accurately thus i in the greenest of our valleys by good angels tenantedonce a fair and stately palace radiant palacereared its headin the monarch thoughts dominion it stood therenever seraph spread a pinion over fabric half so fairii banners yellow

forms that move fantastically to a discordant melodywhile like a rapid ghastly river through the pale doora hideous throng rush out forever and laughbut smile no morei well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of ushers which i mention not so much on account of its novelty for other men have thought thus as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it this opinion in its general form was that of the sentience of all vegetable things but in his disordered fancy the idea had assumed a more daring character and trespassed under certain conditions upon the kingdom of inorganization i lack words to express the full extent or the earnest abandon of his persuasion the belief however was connected as i have previously hinted with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers the conditions of the sentience had been here he imagined fulfilled in the method of collocation of these stonesin the order of their arrangement as well as in that of the many fungi which overspread them and of the decayed trees which stood aroundabove all in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn its evidencethe evidence of the sentiencewas to be seen he said and i here started as he spoke in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls the result was discoverable he added in that silent yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family and which made him what i now saw himwhat he was such opinions need no comment and i will make none our booksthe books which for years had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalidwere as might be supposed in strict keeping with this character of phantasm we pored together over such works as the ververt et chartreuse of gresset the belphegor of machiavelli the heaven and hell of swedenborg the subterranean voyage of nicholas klimm by holberg the chiromancy of robert flud of jean dindaginé and of dela chambre the journey into the blue distance of tieck and the city of the sun of campanella one favorite volume was a small octavo edition of the directorium inquisitorium by the dominican eymeric de gironne and there were passages in pomponius mela about the old african satyrs and œgipans over which usher would sit dreaming for hours his chief delight however was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto gothicthe manual of a forgotten churchthe vigiliæ mortuorum secundum chorum ecclesiæ maguntinæ i could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac when one evening having informed me abruptly that the lady madeline was no more he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight previously to its final interment in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building the worldly reason however assigned for this singular proceeding was one which i did not feel at liberty to dispute the brother had been led to his resolution so he told me by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men and of the remote and exposed situation of the burialground of the family i will not deny that when i called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom i met upon the staircase on the day of my arrival at the house i had no desire to oppose what i regarded as at best but a harmless and by no means an unnatural precaution at the request of usher i personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary entombment the body having been encoffined we two alone bore it to its rest the vault in which we placed it and which had been so long unopened that our torches half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere gave us little opportunity for investigation was small damp and entirely without means of admission for light lying at great depth immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment it had been used apparently in remote feudal times for the worst purposes of a donjonkeep and in later days as a place of deposit for powder or some other highly combustible substance as a portion of its floor and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it were carefully sheathed with copper the door of massive iron had been also similarly protected its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound as it moved upon its hinges having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this region of horror we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of the coffin and looked upon the face of the tenant a striking similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention and usher divining perhaps my thoughts murmured out some few words from which i learned that the deceased and himself had been twins and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them our glances however rested not long upon the deadfor we could not regard her unawed the disease which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth had left as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death we replaced and screwed down the lid and having secured the door of iron made our way with toil into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house and now some days of bitter grief having elapsed an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend his ordinary manner had vanished his ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten he roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried unequal and objectless step the pallor of his countenance had assumed if possible a more ghastly huebut the luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out the once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard no more and a tremulous quaver as if of extreme terror habitually characterized his utterance there were times indeed when i thought his unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage at times again i was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness for i beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours in an attitude of the profoundest attention as if listening to some imaginary sound it was no wonder that his condition terrifiedthat it infected me i felt creeping upon me by slow yet certain degrees the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions it was especially upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady madeline within the donjon that i experienced the full power of such feelings sleep came not near my couchwhile the hours waned and waned away i struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me i endeavored to believe that much if not all of what i felt was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the roomof the dark and tattered draperies which tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed but my efforts were fruitless an irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame and at length there sat upon my very heart an incubus of utterly causeless alarm shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle i uplifted myself upon the pillows and peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber hearkenedi know not why except that an instinctive spirit prompted meto certain low and indefinite sounds which came through the pauses of the storm at long intervals i knew not whence overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror unaccountable yet unendurable i threw on my clothes with haste for i felt that i should sleep no more during the night and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which i had fallen by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment i had taken but few turns in this manner when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention i presently recognized it as that of usher in an instant afterward he rapped with a gentle touch at my door and entered bearing a lamp his countenance was as usual cadaverously wanbut moreover there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyesan evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanor his air appalled mebut anything was preferable to the solitude which i had so long endured and i even welcomed his presence as a relief and you have not seen it he said abruptly after having stared about him for some moments in silenceyou have not then seen itbut stay you shall thus speaking and having carefully shaded his lamp he hurried to one of the casements and threw it freely open to the storm the impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet it was indeed a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty a whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind and the exceeding density of the clouds which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house did not prevent our perceiving the lifelike velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each other without passing away into the distance i say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving thisyet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning but the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and enshrouded the mansion you must notyou shall not behold this said i shuddering to usher as i led him with a gentle violence from the window to a seat these appearances which bewilder you are merely electrical phenomena not uncommonor it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn let us close this casementthe air is chilling and dangerous to your frame here is one of your favorite romances i will read and you shall listenand so we will pass away this terrible night together the antique volume which i had taken up was the mad trist of sir launcelot canning but i had called it a favorite of ushers more in sad jest than in earnest for in truth there is little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend it was however the only book immediately at hand and i indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac might find relief for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies even in the extremeness of the folly which i should read could i have judged indeed by the wild overstrained air of vivacity with which he hearkened or apparently hearkened to the words of the tale i might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design i had arrived at that wellknown portion of the story where ethelred the hero of the trist having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit proceeds to make good an entrance by force here it will be remembered the words of the narrative run thus and ethelred who was by nature of a doughty heart and who was now mighty withal on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit who in sooth was of an obstinate and maliceful turn but feeling the rain upon his shoulders and fearing the rising of the tempest uplifted his mace outright and with blows made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand and now pulling therewith sturdily he so cracked and ripped and tore all asunder that the noise of the dry and hollowsounding wood alarumed and reverberated throughout the forest at the termination of this sentence i started and for a moment paused for it appeared to me although i at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived meit appeared to me that from some very remote portion of the mansion there came indistinctly to my ears what might have been in its exact similarity of character the echo but a stifled and dull one certainly of the very cracking and ripping sound which sir launcelot had so particularly described it was beyond doubt the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention for amid the rattling of the sashes of the casements and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm the sound in itself had nothing surely which should have interested or disturbed me i continued the story but the good champion ethelred now entering within the door was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit but in the stead thereof a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor and of a fiery tongue which sate in guard before a palace of gold with a floor of silver and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legend enwritten who entereth herein a conqueror hath bin who slayeth the dragon the shield he shall win and ethelred uplifted his mace and struck upon the head of the dragon which fell before him and gave up his pesty breath with a shriek so horrid and harsh and withal so piercing that ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it the like whereof was never before heard here again i paused abruptly and now with a feeling of wild amazementfor there could be no doubt whatever that in this instance i did actually hear although from what direction it proceeded i found it impossible to say a low and apparently distant but harsh protracted and most unusual screaming or grating soundthe exact counterpart of what my fancy had already conjured up for the dragons unnatural shriek as described by the romancer oppressed as i certainly was upon the occurrence of this second and most extraordinary coincidence by a thousand conflicting sensations in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant i still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting by any observation the sensitive nervousness of my companion i was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question although assuredly a strange alteration had during the last few minutes taken place in his demeanor from a position fronting my own he had gradually brought round his chair so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber and thus i could but partially perceive his features although i saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly his head had dropped upon his breastyet i knew that he was not asleep from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as i caught a glance of it in profile the motion of his body too was at variance with this ideafor he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway having rapidly taken notice of all this i resumed the narrative of sir launcelot which thus proceeded and now the champion having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon bethinking himself of the brazen shield and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it removed the carcass from out of the way before him and approached valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall which in sooth tarried not for his full coming but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound no sooner had these syllables passed my lips thanas if a shield of brass had indeed at the moment fallen heavily upon a floor of silveri became aware of a distinct hollow metallic and clangorous yet apparently muffled reverberation completely unnerved i leaped to my feet but the measured rocking movement of usher was undisturbed i rushed to the chair in which he sat his eyes were bent fixedly before him and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity but as i placed my hand upon his shoulder there came a strong shudder over his whole person a sickly smile quivered about his lips and i saw that he spoke in a low hurried and gibbering murmur as if unconscious of my presence bending closely over him i at length drank in the hideous import of his words not hear ityes i hear it and have heard it longlonglongmany minutes many hours many days have i heard ityet i dared notoh pity me miserable wretch that i ami dared noti dared not speak we have put her living in the tomb said i not that my senses were acute i now tell you that i heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin i heard themmany many days agoyet i dared noti dared not speak and nowtonightethelredha hathe breaking of the hermits door and the deathcry of the dragon and the clangor of the shieldsay rather the rending of her coffin and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault oh whither shall i fly will she not be here anon is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste have i not heard her footstep on the stair do i not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart madmanhere he sprang furiously to his feet and shrieked out his syllables as if in the effort he were giving up his soulmadman i tell you that she now stands without the door as if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the potency of a spell the huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed threw slowly back upon the instant their ponderous and ebony jaws it was the work of the rushing gustbut then without those doors there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the lady madeline of usher there was blood upon her white robes and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame for a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the thresholdthen with a low moaning cry fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother and in her violent and now final deathagonies bore him to the floor a corpse and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated from that chamber and from that mansion i fled aghast the storm was still abroad in all its wrath as i found myself crossing the old causeway suddenly there shot along the path a wild light and i turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me the radiance was that of the full setting and bloodred moon which now shone vividly through that once barely discernible fissure of which i have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building in a zigzag direction to the base while i gazed this fissure rapidly widenedthere came a fierce breath of the whirlwindthe entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sightmy brain reeled as i saw the mighty walls rushing asunderthere was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand watersand the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the house of usher the murders in the rue morgue what song the syrens sang or what name achilles assumed when he hid himself among women although puzzling questions are not beyond all conjecture sir thomas browne the mental features discoursed of as the analytical are in themselves but little susceptible of analysis we appreciate them only in their effects we know of them among other things that they are always to their possessor when inordinately possessed a source of the liveliest enjoyment as the strong man exults in his physical ability delighting in such exercises as call his muscles into action so glories the analyst in that moral activity which disentangles he derives pleasure from even the most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play he is fond of enigmas of conundrums hieroglyphics exhibiting in his solutions of each a degree of acumen which appears to the ordinary apprehension præternatural his results brought about by the very soul and essence of method have in truth the whole air of intuition the faculty of resolution is possibly much invigorated by mathematical study and especially by that highest branch of it which unjustly and merely on account of its retrograde operations has been called as if par excellence analysis yet to calculate is not in itself to analyse a chessplayer for example does the one without effort at the other it follows that the game of chess in its effects upon mental character is greatly misunderstood i am not now writing a treatise but simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much at random i will therefore take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by all the elaborate frivolity of chess in this latter where the pieces have different and bizarre motions with various and variable values what is only complex is mistaken a not unusual error for what is profound the attention is here called powerfully into play if it flag for an instant an oversight is committed resulting in injury or defeat the possible moves being not only manifold but involute the chances of such oversights are multiplied and in nine cases out of ten it is the more concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers in draughts on the contrary where the moves are unique and have but little variation the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished and the mere attention being left comparatively unemployed what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen to be less abstract let us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are reduced to four kings and where of course no oversight is to be expected it is obvious that here the victory can be decided the players being at all equal only by some recherché movement the result of some strong exertion of the intellect deprived of ordinary resources the analyst throws himself into the spirit of his opponent identifies himself therewith and not unfrequently sees thus at a glance the sole methods sometime indeed absurdly simple ones by which he may seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation whist has long been known for its influence upon what is termed the calculating power and men of the highest order of intellect have been known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it while eschewing chess as frivolous beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature so greatly tasking the faculty of analysis the best chessplayer in christendom may be little more than the best player of chess but proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all these more important undertakings where mind struggles with mind when i say proficiency i mean that perfection in the game which includes a comprehension of all the sources whence legitimate advantage may be derived these are not only manifold but multiform and lie frequently among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary understanding to observe attentively is to remember distinctly and so far the concentrative chessplayer will do very well at whist while the rules of hoyle themselves based upon the mere mechanism of the game are sufficiently and generally comprehensible thus to have a retentive memory and to proceed by the book are points commonly regarded as the sum total of good playing but it is in matters beyond the limits of mere rule that the skill of the analyst is evinced he makes in silence a host of observations and inferences so perhaps do his companions and the difference in the extent of the information obtained lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation the necessary knowledge is that of what to observe our player confines himself not at all nor because the game is the object does he reject deductions from things external to the game he examines the countenance of his partner comparing it carefully with that of each of his opponents he considers the mode of assorting the cards in each hand often counting trump by trump and honor by honor through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each he notes every variation of face as the play progresses gathering a fund of thought from the differences in the expression of certainty of surprise of triumph or chagrin from the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the person taking it can make another in the suit he recognises what is played through feint by the manner with which it is thrown upon the table a casual or inadvertent word the accidental dropping or turning of a card with the accompanying anxiety or carelessness in regard to its concealment the counting of the tricks with the order of their arrangement embarrassment hesitation eagerness or trepidationall afford to his apparently intuitive perception indications of the true state of affairs the first two or three rounds having been played he is in full possession of the contents of each hand and thenceforward puts down his cards with as absolute a precision of purpose as if the rest of the party had turned outward the faces of their own the analytical power should not be confounded with ample ingenuity for while the analyst is necessarily ingenious the ingenious man is often remarkably incapable of analysis the constructive or combining power by which ingenuity is usually manifested and to which the phrenologists i believe erroneously have assigned a separate organ supposing it a primitive faculty has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect bordered otherwise upon idiocy as to have attracted general observation among writers on morals between ingenuity and the analytic ability there exists a difference far greater indeed than that between the fancy and the imagination but of a character very strictly analogous it will be found in fact that the ingenious are always fanciful and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic the narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat in the light of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced residing in paris during the spring and part of the summer of i there became acquainted with a monsieur c auguste dupin this young gentleman was of an excellent indeed of an illustrious family but by a variety of untoward events had been reduced to such poverty that the energy of his character succumbed beneath it and he ceased to bestir himself in the world or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes by courtesy of his creditors there still remained in his possession a small remnant of his patrimony and upon the income arising from this he managed by means of a rigorous economy to procure the necessaries of life without troubling himself about its superfluities books indeed were his sole luxuries and in paris these are easily obtained our first meeting was at an obscure library in the rue montmartre where the accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and very remarkable volume brought us into closer communion we saw each other again and again i was deeply interested in the little family history which he detailed to me with all that candor which a frenchman indulges whenever mere self is the theme i was astonished too at the vast extent of his reading and above all i felt my soul enkindled within me by the wild fervor and the vivid freshness of his imagination seeking in paris the objects i then sought i felt that the society of such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price and this feeling i frankly confided to him it was at length arranged that we should live together during my stay in the city and as my worldly circumstances were somewhat less embarrassed than his own i was permitted to be at the expense of renting and furnishing in a style which suited the rather fantastic gloom of our common temper a timeeaten and grotesque mansion long deserted through superstitions into which we did not inquire and tottering to its fall in a retired and desolate portion of the faubourg st germain had the routine of our life at this place been known to the world we should have been regarded as madmenalthough perhaps as madmen of a harmless nature our seclusion was perfect we admitted no visitors indeed the locality of our retirement had been carefully kept a secret from my own former associates and it had been many years since dupin had ceased to know or be known in paris we existed within ourselves alone it was a freak of fancy in my friend for what else shall i call it to be enamored of the night for her own sake and into this bizarrerie as into all his others i quietly fell giving myself up to his wild whims with a perfect abandon the sable divinity would not herself dwell with us always but we could counterfeit her presence at the first dawn of the morning we closed all the messy shutters of our old building lighted a couple of tapers which strongly perfumed threw out only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays by the aid of these we then busied our souls in dreamsreading writing or conversing until warned by the clock of the advent of the true darkness then we sallied forth into the streets arm in arm continuing the topics of the day or roaming far and wide until a late hour seeking amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford at such times i could not help remarking and admiring although from his rich ideality i had been prepared to expect it a peculiar analytic ability in dupin he seemed too to take an eager delight in its exerciseif not exactly in its displayand did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus derived he boasted to me with a low chuckling laugh that most men in respect to himself wore windows in their bosoms and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own his manner at these moments was frigid and abstract his eyes were vacant in expression while his voice usually a rich tenor rose into a treble which would have sounded petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the enunciation observing him in these moods i often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the bipart soul and amused myself with the fancy of a double dupinthe creative and the resolvent let it not be supposed from what i have just said that i am detailing any mystery or penning any romance what i have described in the frenchman was merely the result of an excited or perhaps of a diseased intelligence but of the character of his remarks at the periods in question an example will best convey the idea we were strolling one night down a long dirty street in the vicinity of the palais royal being both apparently occupied with thought neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least all at once dupin broke forth with these words he is a very little fellow thats true and would do better for the théâtre des variétés there can be no doubt of that i replied unwittingly and not at first observing so much had i been absorbed in reflection the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations in an instant afterward i recollected myself and my astonishment was profound dupin said i gravely this is beyond my comprehension i do not hesitate to say that i am amazed and can scarcely credit my senses how was it possible you should know i was thinking of here i paused to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom i thought of chantilly said he why do you pause you were remarking to yourself that his diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy this was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections chantilly was a quondam cobbler of the rue st denis who becoming stagemad had attempted the rôle of xerxes in crébillons tragedy so called and been notoriously pasquinaded for his pains tell me for heavens sake i exclaimed the methodif method there isby which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter in fact i was even more startled than i would have been willing to express it was the fruiterer replied my friend who brought you to the conclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient height for xerxes et id genus omne the fruitereryou astonish mei know no fruiterer whomsoever the man who ran up against you as we entered the streetit may have been fifteen minutes ago i now remembered that in fact a fruiterer carrying upon his head a large basket of apples had nearly thrown me down by accident as we passed from the rue cinto the thoroughfare where we stood but what this had to do with chantilly i could not possibly understand there was not a particle of charlatânerie about dupin i will explain he said and that you may comprehend all clearly we will first retrace the course of your meditations from the moment in which i spoke to you until that of the rencontre with the fruiterer in question the larger links of the chain run thuschantilly orion dr nichols epicurus stereotomy the street stones the fruiterer there are few persons who have not at some period of their lives amused themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained the occupation is often full of interest and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between the startingpoint and the goal what then must have been my amazement when i heard the frenchman speak what he had just spoken and when i could not help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth he continued we had been talking of horses if i remember aright just before leaving the rue c this was the last subject we discussed as we crossed into this street a fruiterer with a large basket upon his head brushing quickly past us thrust you upon a pile of pavingstones collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair you stepped upon one of the loose fragments slipped slightly strained your ankle appeared vexed or sulky muttered a few words turned to look at the pile and then proceeded in silence i was not particularly attentive to what you did but observation has become with me of late a species of necessity you kept your eyes upon the groundglancing with a petulant expression at the holes and ruts in the pavement so that i saw you were still thinking of the stones until we reached the little alley called lamartine which has been paved by way of experiment with the overlapping and riveted blocks here your countenance brightened up and perceiving your lips move i could not doubt that you murmured the word stereotomy a term very affectedly applied to this species of pavement i knew that you could not say to yourself stereotomy without being brought to think of atomies and thus of the theories of epicurus and since when we discussed this subject not very long ago i mentioned to you how singularly yet with how little notice the vague guesses of that noble greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony i felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great nebula in orion and i certainly expected that you would do so you did look up and i was now assured that i had correctly followed your steps but in that bitter tirade upon chantilly which appeared in yesterdays musée the satirist making some disgraceful allusions to the cobblers change of name upon assuming the buskin quoted a latin line about which we have often conversed i mean the line perdidit antiquum litera prima sonum i had told you that this was in reference to orion formerly written urion and from certain pungencies connected with this explanation i was aware that you could not have forgotten it it was clear therefore that you would not fail to combine the two ideas of orion and chantilly that you did combine them i saw by the character of the smile which passed over your lips you thought of the poor cobblers immolation so far you had been stooping in your gait but now i saw you draw yourself up to your full height i was then sure that you reflected upon the diminutive figure of chantilly at this point i interrupted your meditations to remark that as in fact he was a very little fellowthat chantillyhe would do better at the théâtre des variétés not long after this we were looking over an evening edition of the gazette des tribunaux when the following paragraphs arrested our attention extraordinary murdersthis morning about three oclock the inhabitants of the quartier st roch were roused from sleep by a succession of terrific shrieks issuing apparently from the fourth story of a house in the rue morgue known to be in the sole occupancy of one madame lespanaye and her daughter mademoiselle camille lespanaye after some delay occasioned by a fruitless attempt to procure admission in the usual manner the gateway was broken in with a crowbar and eight or ten of the neighbors entered accompanied by two gendarmes by this time the cries had ceased but as the party rushed up the first flight of stairs two or more rough voices in angry contention were distinguished and seemed to proceed from the upper part of the house as the second landing was reached these sounds also had ceased and every thing remained perfectly quiet the party spread themselves and hurried from room to room upon arriving at a large back chamber in the fourth story the door of which being found locked with the key inside was forced open a spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not less with horror than with astonishment the apartment was in the wildest disorderthe furniture broken and thrown about in all directions there was only one bedstead and from this the bed had been removed and thrown into the middle of the floor on a chair lay a razor besmeared with blood on the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of gray human hair also dabbled with blood and seeming to have been pulled out by the roots upon the floor were found four napoleons an earring of topaz three large silver spoons three smaller of métal dalger and two bags containing nearly four thousand francs in gold the drawers of a bureau which stood in one corner were open and had been apparently rifled although many articles still remained in them a small iron safe was discovered under the bed not under the bedstead it was open with the key still in the door it had no contents beyond a few old letters and other papers of little consequence of madame lespanaye no traces were here seen but an unusual quantity of soot being observed in the fireplace a search was made in the chimney and horrible to relate the corpse of the daughter head downward was dragged therefrom it having been thus forced up the narrow aperture for a considerable distance the body was quite warm upon examining it many excoriations were perceived no doubt occasioned by the violence with which it had been thrust up and disengaged upon the face were many severe scratches and upon the throat dark bruises and deep indentations of finger nails as if the deceased had been throttled to death after a thorough investigation of every portion of the house without farther discovery the party made its way into a small paved yard in the rear of the building where lay the corpse of the old lady with her throat so entirely cut that upon an attempt to raise her the head fell off the body as well as the head was fearfully mutilatedthe former so much so as scarcely to retain any semblance of humanity to this horrible mystery there is not as yet we believe the slightest clew the next days paper had these additional particulars the tragedy in the rue morguemany individuals have been examined in relation to this most extraordinary and frightful affair the word affaire has not yet in france that levity of import which it conveys with us but nothing whatever has transpired to throw light upon it we give below all the material testimony elicited pauline dubourg laundress deposes that she has known both the deceased for three years having washed for them during that period the old lady and her daughter seemed on good termsvery affectionate toward each other they were excellent pay could not speak in regard to their mode or means of living believed that madame l told fortunes for a living was reputed to have money put by never met any person in the house when she called for the clothes or took them home was sure that they had no servant in employ there appeared to be no furniture in any part of the building except in the fourth story pierre moreau tobacconist deposes that he has been in the habit of selling small quantities of tobacco and snuff to madame lespanaye for nearly four years was born in the neighborhood and has always resided there the deceased and her daughter had occupied the house in which the corpses were found for more than six years it was formerly occupied by a jeweller who underlet the upper rooms to various persons the house was the property of madame l she became dissatisfied with the abuse of the premises by her tenant and moved into them herself refusing to let any portion the old lady was childish witness had seen the daughter some five or six times during the six years the two lived an exceedingly retired lifewere reputed to have money had heard it said among the neighbors that madame l told fortunesdid not believe it had never seen any person enter the door except the old lady and her daughter a porter once or twice and a physician some eight or ten times many other persons neighbors gave evidence to the same effect no one was spoken of as frequenting the house it was not known whether there were any living connections of madame l and her daughter the shutters of the front windows were seldom opened those in the rear were always closed with the exception of the large back room fourth story the house was a good housenot very old isidore musèt gendarme deposes that he was called to the house about three oclock in the morning and found some twenty or thirty persons at the gateway endeavoring to gain admittance forced it open at length with a bayonetnot with a crowbar had but little difficulty in getting it open on account of its being a double or folding gate and bolted neither at bottom nor top the shrieks were continued until the gate was forcedand then suddenly ceased they seemed to be screams of some person or persons in great agonywere loud and drawn out not short and quick witness led the way up stairs upon reaching the first landing heard two voices in loud and angry contentionthe one a gruff voice the other much shrillera very strange voice could distinguish some words of the former which was that of a frenchman was positive that it was not a womans voice could distinguish the words sacré and diable the shrill voice was that of a foreigner could not be sure whether it was the voice of a man or of a woman could not make out what was said but believed the language to be spanish the state of the room and of the bodies was described by this witness as we described them yesterday henri duval a neighbor and by trade a silversmith deposes that he was one of the party who first entered the house corroborates the testimony of musèt in general as soon as they forced an entrance they reclosed the door to keep out the crowd which collected very fast notwithstanding the lateness of the hour the shrill voice this witness thinks was that of an italian was certain it was not french could not be sure that it was a mans voice it might have been a womans was not acquainted with the italian language could not distinguish the words but was convinced by the intonation that the speaker was an italian knew madame l and her daughter had conversed with both frequently was sure that the shrill voice was not that of either of the deceased odenheimer restaurateurthis witness volunteered his testimony not speaking french was examined through an interpreter is a native of amsterdam was passing the house at the time of the shrieks they lasted for several minutesprobably ten they were long and loudvery awful and distressing was one of those who entered the building corroborated the previous evidence in every respect but one was sure that the shrill voice was that of a manof a frenchman could not distinguish the words uttered they were loud and quickunequalspoken apparently in fear as well as in anger the voice was harshnot so much shrill as harsh could not call it a shrill voice the gruff voice said repeatedly sacré diable and once mon dieu jules mignaud banker of the firm of mignaud et fils rue deloraine is the elder mignaud madame lespanaye had some property had opened an account with his banking house in the spring of the yeareight years previously made frequent deposits in small sums had checked for nothing until the third day before her death when she took out in person the sum of francs this sum was paid in gold and a clerk sent home with the money adolphe le bon clerk to mignaud et fils deposes that on the day in question about noon he accompanied madame lespanaye to her residence with the francs put up in two bags upon the door being opened mademoiselle l appeared and took from his hands one of the bags while the old lady relieved him of the other he then bowed and departed did not see any person in the street at the time it is a bystreetvery lonely william bird tailor deposes that he was one of the party who entered the house is an englishman has lived in paris two years was one of the first to ascend the stairs heard the voices in contention the gruff voice was that of a frenchman could make out several words but cannot now remember all heard distinctly sacré and mon dieu there was a sound at the moment as if of several persons strugglinga scraping and scuffling sound the shrill voice was very loudlouder than the gruff one is sure that it was not the voice of an englishman appeared to be that of a german might have been a womans voice does not understand german four of the abovenamed witnesses being recalled deposed that the door of the chamber in which was found the body of mademoiselle l was locked on the inside when the party reached it every thing was perfectly silentno groans or noises of any kind upon forcing the door no person was seen the windows both of the back and front room were down and firmly fastened from within a door between the two rooms was closed but not locked the door leading from the front room into the passage was locked with the key on the inside a small room in the front of the house on the fourth story at the head of the passage was open the door being ajar this room was crowded with old beds boxes and so forth these were carefully removed and searched there was not an inch of any portion of the house which was not carefully searched sweeps were sent up and down the chimneys the house was a fourstory one with garrets mansardes a trapdoor on the roof was nailed down very securelydid not appear to have been opened for years the time elapsing between the hearing of the voices in contention and the breaking open of the room door was variously stated by the witnesses some made it as short as three minutessome as long as five the door was opened with difficulty alfonzo garcio undertaker deposes that he resides in the rue morgue is a native of spain was one of the party who entered the house did not proceed up stairs is nervous and was apprehensive of the consequences of agitation heard the voices in contention the gruff voice was that of a frenchman could not distinguish what was said the shrill voice was that of an englishmanis sure of this does not understand the english language but judges by the intonation alberto montani confectioner deposes that he was among the first to ascend the stairs heard the voices in question the gruff voice was that of a frenchman distinguished several words the speaker appeared to be expostulating could not make out the words of the shrill voice spoke quick and unevenly thinks it the voice of a russian corroborates the general testimony is an italian never conversed with a native of russia several witnesses recalled here testified that the chimneys of all the rooms on the fourth story were too narrow to admit the passage of a human being by sweeps were meant cylindrical sweepingbrushes such as are employed by those who clean chimneys these brushes were passed up and down every flue in the house there is no back passage by which any one could have descended while the party proceeded up stairs the body of mademoiselle lespanaye was so firmly wedged in the chimney that it could not be got down until four or five of the party united their strength paul dumas physician deposes that he was called to view the bodies about daybreak they were both then lying on the sacking of the bedstead in the chamber where mademoiselle l was found the corpse of the young lady was much bruised and excoriated the fact that it had been thrust up the chimney would sufficiently account for these appearances the throat was greatly chafed there were several deep scratches just below the chin together with a series of livid spots which were evidently the impression of fingers the face was fearfully discolored and the eyeballs protruded the tongue had been partially bitten through a large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach produced apparently by the pressure of a knee in the opinion of m dumas mademoiselle lespanaye had been throttled to death by some person or persons unknown the corpse of the mother was horribly mutilated all the bones of the right leg and arm were more or less shattered the left tibia much splintered as well as all the ribs of the left side whole body dreadfully bruised and discolored it was not possible to say how the injuries had been inflicted a heavy club of wood or a broad bar of irona chairany large heavy and obtuse weapon would have produced such results if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man no woman could have inflicted the blows with any weapon the head of the deceased when seen by witness was entirely separated from the body and was also greatly shattered the throat had evidently been cut with some very sharp instrumentprobably with a razor alexandre etienne surgeon was called with m dumas to view the bodies corroborated the testimony and the opinions of m dumas nothing further of importance was elicited although several other persons were examined a murder so mysterious and so perplexing in all its particulars was never before committed in parisif indeed a murder has been committed at all the police are entirely at faultan unusual occurrence in affairs of this nature there is not however the shadow of a clew apparent the evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement still continued in the quartier st rochthat the premises in question had been carefully researched and fresh examinations of witnesses instituted but all to no purpose a postscript however mentioned that adolphe le bon had been arrested and imprisonedalthough nothing appeared to criminate him beyond the facts already detailed dupin seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affairat least so i judged from his manner for he made no comments it was only after the announcement that le bon had been imprisoned that he asked me my opinion respecting the murders i could merely agree with all paris in considering them an insoluble mystery i saw no means by which it would be possible to trace the murderer we must not judge of the means said dupin by this shell of an examination the parisian police so much extolled for acumen are cunning but no more there is no method in their proceedings beyond the method of the moment they make a vast parade of measures but not unfrequently these are so illadapted to the objects proposed as to put us in mind of monsieur jourdains calling for his robedechambrepour mieux entendre la musique the results attained by them are not unfrequently surprising but for the most part are brought about by simple diligence and activity when these qualities are unavailing their schemes fail vidocq for example was a good guesser and a persevering man but without educated thought he erred continually by the very intensity of his investigations he impaired his vision by holding the object too close he might see perhaps one or two points with unusual clearness but in so doing he necessarily lost sight of the matter as a whole thus there is such a thing as being too profound truth is not always in a well in fact as regards the more important knowledge i do believe that she is invariably superficial the depth lies in the valleys where we seek her and not upon the mountaintops where she is found the modes and sources of this kind of error are well typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies to look at a star by glancesto view it in a sidelong way by turning toward it the exterior portions of the retina more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior is to behold the star distinctlyis to have the best appreciation of its lustrea lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision fully upon it a greater number of rays actually fall upon the eye in the latter case but in the former there is the more refined capacity for comprehension by undue profundity we perplex and enfeeble thought and it is possible to make even venus herself vanish from the firmanent by a scrutiny too sustained too concentrated or too direct as for these murders let us enter into some examinations for ourselves before we make up an opinion respecting them an inquiry will afford us amusement i thought this an odd term so applied but said nothing and besides le bon once rendered me a service for which i am not ungrateful we will go and see the premises with our own eyes i know g the prefect of police and shall have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary permission the permission was obtained and we proceeded at once to the rue morgue this is one of those miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the rue richelieu and the rue st roch it was late in the afternoon when we reached it as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we resided the house was readily found for there were still many persons gazing up at the closed shutters with an objectless curiosity from the opposite side of the way it was an ordinary parisian house with a gateway on one side of which was a glazed watchbox with a sliding panel in the window indicating a loge de concierge before going in we walked up the street turned down an alley and then again turning passed in the rear of the buildingdupin meanwhile examining the whole neighborhood as well as the house with a minuteness of attention for which i could see no possible object retracing our steps we came again to the front of the dwelling rang and having shown our credentials were admitted by the agents in charge we went up stairsinto the chamber where the body of mademoiselle lespanaye had been found and where both the deceased still lay the disorders of the room had as usual been suffered to exist i saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the gazette des tribunaux dupin scrutinized every thingnot excepting the bodies of the victims we then went into the other rooms and into the yard a gendarme accompanying us throughout the examination occupied us until dark when we took our departure on our way home my companion stepped in for a moment at the office of one of the daily papers i have said that the whims of my friend were manifold and that je les ménagaisfor this phrase there is no english equivalent it was his humor now to decline all conversation on the subject of the murder until about noon the next day he then asked me suddenly if i had observed any thing peculiar at the scene of the atrocity there was something in his manner of emphasizing the word peculiar which caused me to shudder without knowing why no nothing peculiar i said nothing more at least than we both saw stated in the paper the gazette he replied has not entered i fear into the unusual horror of the thing but dismiss the idle opinions of this print it appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble for the very reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solutioni mean for the outré character of its features the police are confounded by the seeming absence of motivenot for the murder itselfbut for the atrocity of the murder they are puzzled too by the seeming impossibility of reconciling the voices heard in contention with the facts that no one was discovered upstairs but the assassinated mademoiselle lespanaye and that there were no means of egress without the notice of the party ascending the wild disorder of the room the corpse thrust with the head downward up the chimney the frightful mutilation of the body of the old lady these considerations with those just mentioned and others which i need not mention have sufficed to paralyze the powers by putting completely at fault the boasted acumen of the government agents they have fallen into the gross but common error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse but it is by these deviations from the plane of the ordinary that reason feels its way if at all in its search for the true in investigations such as we are now pursuing it should not be so much asked what has occurred as what has occurred that has never occurred before in fact the facility with which i shall arrive or have arrived at the solution of this mystery is in the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the police i stared at the speaker in mute astonishment i am now awaiting continued he looking toward the door of our apartmenti am now awaiting a person who although perhaps not the perpetrator of these butcheries must have been in some measure implicated in their perpetration of the worst portion of the crimes committed it is probable that he is innocent i hope that i am right in this supposition for upon it i build my expectation of reading the entire riddle i look for the man herein this roomevery moment it is true that he may not arrive but the probability is that he will should he come it will be necessary to detain him here are pistols and we both know how to use them when occasion demands their use i took the pistols scarcely knowing what i did or believing what i heard while dupin went on very much as if in a soliloquy i have already spoken of his abstract manner at such times his discourse was addressed to myself but his voice although by no means loud had that intonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great distance his eyes vacant in expression regarded only the wall that the voices heard in contention he said by the party upon the stairs were not the voices of the women themselves was fully proved by the evidence this relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether the old lady could have first destroyed the daughter and afterward have committed suicide i speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method for the strength of madame lespanaye would have been utterly unequal to the task of thrusting her daughters corpse up the chimney as it was found and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely preclude the idea of selfdestruction murder then has been committed by some third party and the voices of this third party were those heard in contention let me now advertnot to the whole testimony respecting these voicesbut to what was peculiar in that testimony did you observe any thing peculiar about it i remarked that while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff voice to be that of a frenchman there was much disagreement in regard to the shrill or as one individual termed it the harsh voice that was the evidence itself said dupin but it was not the peculiarity of the evidence you have observed nothing distinctive yet there was something to be observed the witnesses as you remark agreed about the gruff voice they were here unanimous but in regard to the shrill voice the peculiarity isnot that they disagreedbut that while an italian an englishman a spaniard a hollander and a frenchman attempted to describe it each one spoke of it as that of a foreigner each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own countrymen each likens itnot to the voice of an individual of any nation with whose language he is conversantbut the converse the frenchman supposes it the voice of a spaniard and might have distinguished some words had he been acquainted with the spanish the dutchman maintains it to have been that of a frenchman but we find it stated that not understanding french this witness was examined through an interpreter the englishman thinks it the voice of a german and does not understand german the spaniard is sure that it was that of an englishman but judges by the intonation altogether as he has no knowledge of the english the italian believes it the voice of a russian but has never conversed with a native of russia a second frenchman differs moreover with the first and is positive that the voice was that of an italian but not being cognizant of that tongue is like the spaniard convinced by the intonation now how strangely unusual must that voice have really been about which such testimony as this could have been elicitedin whose tones even denizens of the five great divisions of europe could recognise nothing familiar you will say that it might have been the voice of an asiaticof an african neither asiatics nor africans abound in paris but without denying the inference i will now merely call your attention to three points the voice is termed by one witness harsh rather than shrill it is represented by two others to have been quick and unequal no wordsno sounds resembling wordswere by any witness mentioned as distinguishable i know not continued dupin what impression i may have made so far upon your own understanding but i do not hesitate to say that legitimate deductions even from this portion of the testimonythe portion respecting the gruff and shrill voicesare in themselves sufficient to engender a suspicion which should give direction to all farther progress in the investigation of the mystery i said legitimate deductions but my meaning is not thus fully expressed i designed to imply that the deductions are the sole proper ones and that the suspicion arises inevitably from them as the single result what the suspicion is however i will not say just yet i merely wish you to bear in mind that with myself it was sufficiently forcible to give a definite forma certain tendencyto my inquiries in the chamber let us now transport ourselves in fancy to this chamber what shall we first seek here the means of egress employed by the murderers it is not too much to say that neither of us believe in præternatural events madame and mademoiselle lespanaye were not destroyed by spirits the doers of the deed were material and escaped materially then how fortunately there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point and that mode must lead us to a definite decision let us examine each by each the possible means of egress it is clear that the assassins were in the room where mademoiselle lespanaye was found or at least in the room adjoining when the party ascended the stairs it is then only from these two apartments that we have to seek issues the police have laid bare the floors the ceilings and the masonry of the walls in every direction no secret issues could have escaped their vigilance but not trusting to their eyes i examined with my own there were then no secret issues both doors leading from the rooms into the passage were securely locked with the keys inside let us turn to the chimneys these although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the hearths will not admit throughout their extent the body of a large cat the impossibility of egress by means already stated being thus absolute we are reduced to the windows through those of the front room no one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street the murderers must have passed then through those of the back room now brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are it is not our part as reasoners to reject it on account of apparent impossibilities it is only left for us to prove that these apparent impossibilities are in reality not such there are two windows in the chamber one of them is unobstructed by furniture and is wholly visible the lower portion of the other is hidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust close up against it the former was found securely fastened from within it resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it a large gimlethole had been pierced in its frame to the left and a very stout nail was found fitted therein nearly to the head upon examining the other window a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it and a vigorous attempt to raise this sash failed also the police were now entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions and therefore it was thought a matter of supererogation to withdraw the nails and open the windows my own examination was somewhat more particular and was so for the reason i have just givenbecause here it was i knew that all apparent impossibilities must be proved to be not such in reality i proceeded to think thusa posteriori the murderers did escape from one of these windows this being so they could not have refastened the sashes from the inside as they were found fastenedthe consideration which put a stop through its obviousness to the scrutiny of the police in this quarter yet the sashes were fastened they must then have the power of fastening themselves there was no escape from this conclusion i stepped to the unobstructed casement withdrew the nail with some difficulty and attempted to raise the sash it resisted all my efforts as i had anticipated a concealed spring must i now knew exist and this corroboration of my idea convinced me that my premises at least were correct however mysterious still appeared the circumstances attending the nails a careful search soon brought to light the hidden spring i pressed it and satisfied with the discovery forbore to upraise the sash i now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively a person passing out through this window might have reclosed it and the spring would have caughtbut the nail could not have been replaced the conclusion was plain and again narrowed in the field of my investigations the assassins must have escaped through the other window supposing then the springs upon each sash to be the same as was probable there must be found a difference between the nails or at least between the modes of their fixture getting upon the sacking of the bedstead i looked over the headboard minutely at the second casement passing my hand down behind the board i readily discovered and pressed the spring which was as i had supposed identical in character with its neighbor i now looked at the nail it was as stout as the other and apparently fitted in the same mannerdriven in nearly up to the head you will say that i was puzzled but if you think so you must have misunderstood the nature of the inductions to use a sporting phrase i had not been once at fault the scent had never for an instant been lost there was no flaw in any link of the chain i had traced the secret to its ultimate resultand that result was the nail it had i say in every respect the appearance of its fellow in the other window but this fact was an absolute nullity conclusive as it might seem to be when compared with the consideration that here at this point terminated the clew there must be something wrong i said about the nail i touched it and the head with about a quarter of an inch of the shank came off in my fingers the rest of the shank was in the gimlethole where it had been broken off the fracture was an old one for its edges were incrusted with rust and had apparently been accomplished by the blow of a hammer which had partially imbedded in the top of the bottom sash the head portion of the nail i now carefully replaced this head portion in the indentation whence i had taken it and the resemblance to a perfect nail was completethe fissure was invisible pressing the spring i gently raised the sash for a few inches the head went up with it remaining firm in its bed i closed the window and the semblance of the whole nail was again perfect the riddle so far was now unriddled the assassin had escaped through the window which looked upon the bed dropping of its own accord upon his exit or perhaps purposely closed it had become fastened by the spring and it was the retention of this spring which had been mistaken by the police for that of the nailfarther inquiry being thus considered unnecessary the next question is that of the mode of descent upon this point i had been satisfied in my walk with you around the building about five feet and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightningrod from this rod it would have been impossible for any one to reach the window itself to say nothing of entering it i observed however that the shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by parisian carpenters ferradesa kind rarely employed at the present day but frequently seen upon very old mansions at lyons and bourdeaux they are in the form of an ordinary door a single not a folding door except that the lower half is latticed or worked in open trellisthus affording an excellent hold for hands in the present instance these shutters are fully three feet and a half broad when we saw them from the rear of the house they were both about half openthat is to say they stood off at right angles from the wall it is probable that the police as well as myself examined the back of the tenement but if so in looking at these ferrades in the line of their breadth as they must have done they did not perceive this great breadth itself or at all events failed to take it into due consideration in fact having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this quarter they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination it was clear to me however that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of the bed would if swung fully back to the wall reach to within two feet of the lightningrod it was also evident that by exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage an entrance into the window from the rod might have been thus effected by reaching to the distance of two feet and a half we now suppose the shutter open to its whole extent a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the trelliswork letting go then his hold upon the rod placing his feet securely against the wall and springing boldly from it he might have swung the shutter so as to close it and if we imagine the window open at the time might even have swung himself into the room i wish you to bear especially in mind that i have spoken of a very unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and so difficult a feat it is my design to show you first that the thing might possibly have been accomplishedbut secondly and chiefly i wish to impress upon your understanding the very extraordinarythe almost præternatural character of that agility which could have accomplished it you will say no doubt using the language of the law that to make out my case i should rather undervalue than insist upon a full estimation of the activity required in this matter this may be the practice in law but it is not the usage of reason my ultimate object is only the truth my immediate purpose is to lead you to place in juxtaposition that very unusual activity of which i have just spoken with that very peculiar shrill or harsh and unequal voice about whose nationality no two persons could be found to agree and in whose utterance no syllabification could be detected at these words a vague and halfformed conception of the meaning of dupin flitted over my mind i seemed to be upon the verge of comprehension without power to comprehendas men at times find themselves upon the brink of remembrance without being able in the end to remember my friend went on with his discourse you will see he said that i have shifted the question from the mode of egress to that of ingress it was my design to convey the idea that both were effected in the same manner at the same point let us now revert to the interior of the room let us survey the appearances here the drawers of the bureau it is said had been rifled although many articles of apparel still remained within them the conclusion here is absurd it is a mere guessa very silly oneand no more how are we to know that the articles found in the drawers were not all these drawers had originally contained madame lespanaye and her daughter lived an exceedingly retired lifesaw no companyseldom went outhad little use for numerous changes of habiliment those found were at least of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by these ladies if a thief had taken any why did he not take the bestwhy did he not take all in a word why did he abandon four thousand francs in gold to encumber himself with a bundle of linen the gold was abandoned nearly the whole sum mentioned by monsieur mignaud the banker was discovered in bags upon the floor i wish you therefore to discard from your thoughts the blundering idea of motive engendered in the brains of the police by that portion of the evidence which speaks of money delivered at the door of the house coincidences ten times as remarkable as this the delivery of the money and murder committed within three days upon the party receiving it happen to all of us every hour of our lives without attracting even momentary notice coincidences in general are great stumblingblocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilitiesthat theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustration in the present instance had the gold been gone the fact of its delivery three days before would have formed something more than a coincidence it would have been corroborative of this idea of motive but under the real circumstances of the case if we are to suppose gold the motive of this outrage we must also imagine the perpetrator so vacillating an idiot as to have abandoned his gold and his motive together keeping now steadily in mind the points to which i have drawn your attentionthat peculiar voice that unusual agility and that startling absence of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious as thislet us glance at the butchery itself here is a woman strangled to death by manual strength and thrust up a chimney head downward ordinary assassins employ no such modes of murder as this least of all do they thus dispose of the murdered in the manner of thrusting the corpse up the chimney you will admit that there was something excessively outrésomething altogether irreconcilable with our common notions of human action even when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men think too how great must have been that strength which could have thrust the body up such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor of several persons was found barely sufficient to drag it down turn now to other indications of the employment of a vigor most marvellous on the hearth were thick tressesvery thick tressesof grey human hair these had been torn out by the roots you are aware of the great force necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or thirty hairs together you saw the locks in question as well as myself their roots a hideous sight were clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalpsure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted in uprooting perhaps half a million of hairs at a time the throat of the old lady was not merely cut but the head absolutely severed from the body the instrument was a mere razor i wish you also to look at the brutal ferocity of these deeds of the bruises upon the body of madame lespanaye i do not speak monsieur dumas and his worthy coadjutor monsieur etienne have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse instrument and so far these gentlemen are very correct the obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard upon which the victim had fallen from the window which looked in upon the bed this idea however simple it may now seem escaped the police for the same reason that the breadth of the shutters escaped thembecause by the affair of the nails their perceptions had been hermetically sealed against the possibility of the windows having ever been opened at all if now in addition to all these things you have properly reflected upon the odd disorder of the chamber we have gone so far as to combine the ideas of an agility astounding a strength superhuman a ferocity brutal a butchery without motive a grotesquerie in horror absolutely alien from humanity and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men of many nations and devoid of all distinct or intelligible syllabification what result then has ensued what impression have i made upon your fancy i felt a creeping of the flesh as dupin asked me the question a madman i said has done this deedsome raving maniac escaped from a neighboring maison de santé in some respects he replied your idea is not irrelevant but the voices of madmen even in their wildest paroxysms are never found to tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs madmen are of some nation and their language however incoherent in its words has always the coherence of syllabification besides the hair of a madman is not such as i now hold in my hand i disentangled this little tuft from the rigidly clutched fingers of madame lespanaye tell me what you can make of it dupin i said completely unnerved this hair is most unusualthis is no human hair i have not asserted that it is said he but before we decide this point i wish you to glance at the little sketch i have here traced upon this paper it is a facsimile drawing of what has been described in one portion of the testimony as dark bruises and deep indentations of finger nails upon the throat of mademoiselle lespanaye and in another by messrs dumas and etienne as a series of livid spots evidently the impression of fingers you will perceive continued my friend spreading out the paper upon the table before us that this drawing gives the idea of a firm and fixed hold there is no slipping apparent each finger has retainedpossibly until the death of the victimthe fearful grasp by which it originally imbedded itself attempt now to place all your fingers at the same time in the respective impressions as you see them i made the attempt in vain we are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial he said the paper is spread out upon a plane surface but the human throat is cylindrical here is a billet of wood the circumference of which is about that of the throat wrap the drawing around it and try the experiment again i did so but the difficulty was even more obvious than before this i said is the mark of no human hand read now replied dupin this passage from cuvier it was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the large fulvous ourangoutang of the east indian islands the gigantic stature the prodigious strength and activity the wild ferocity and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known to all i understood the full horrors of the murder at once the description of the digits said i as i made an end of reading is in exact accordance with this drawing i see that no animal but an ourangoutang of the species here mentioned could have impressed the indentations as you have traced them this tuft of tawny hair too is identical in character with that of the beast of cuvier but i cannot possibly comprehend the particulars of this frightful mystery besides there were two voices heard in contention and one of them was unquestionably the voice of a frenchman true and you will remember an expression attributed almost unanimously by the evidence to this voicethe expression mon dieu this under the circumstances has been justly characterized by one of the witnesses montani the confectioner as an expression of remonstrance or expostulation upon these two words therefore i have mainly built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle a frenchman was cognizant of the murder it is possibleindeed it is far more than probablethat he was innocent of all participation in the bloody transactions which took place the ourangoutang may have escaped from him he may have traced it to the chamber but under the agitating circumstances which ensued he could never have recaptured it it is still at large i will not pursue these guessesfor i have no right to call them moresince the shades of reflection upon which they are based are scarcely of sufficient depth to be appreciable by my own intellect and since i could not pretend to make them intelligible to the understanding of another we will call them guesses then and speak of them as such if the frenchman in question is indeed as i suppose innocent of this atrocity this advertisement which i left last night upon our return home at the office of le monde a paper devoted to the shipping interest and much sought by sailors will bring him to our residence he handed me a paper and i read thus caughtin the bois de boulogne early in the morning of theinst the morning of the murder a very large tawny ourangoutang of the bornese species the owner who is ascertained to be a sailor belonging to a maltese vessel may have the animal again upon identifying it satisfactorily and paying a few charges arising from its capture and keeping call at no rue faubourg st germainau troisième how was it possible i asked that you should know the man to be a sailor and belonging to a maltese vessel i do not know it said dupin i am not sure of it here however is a small piece of ribbon which from its form and from its greasy appearance has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those long queues of which sailors are so fond moreover this knot is one which few besides sailors can tie and is peculiar to the maltese i picked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightningrod it could not have belonged to either of the deceased now if after all i am wrong in my induction from this ribbon that the frenchman was a sailor belonging to a maltese vessel still i can have done no harm in saying what i did in the advertisement if i am in error he will merely suppose that i have been misled by some circumstance into which he will not take the trouble to inquire but if i am right a great point is gained cognizant although innocent of the murder the frenchman will naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisementabout demanding the ourangoutang he will reason thusi am innocent i am poor my ourangoutang is of great valueto one in my circumstances a fortune of itselfwhy should i lose it through idle apprehensions of danger here it is within my grasp it was found in the bois de boulogneat a vast distance from the scene of that butchery how can it ever be suspected that a brute beast should have done the deed the police are at faultthey have failed to procure the slightest clew should they even trace the animal it would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder or to implicate me in guilt on account of that cognizance above all i am known the advertiser designates me as the possessor of the beast i am not sure to what limit his knowledge may extend should i avoid claiming a property of so great value which it is known that i possess i will render the animal at least liable to suspicion it is not my policy to attract attention either to myself or to the beast i will answer the advertisement get the ourangoutang and keep it close until this matter has blown over at this moment we heard a step upon the stairs be ready said dupin with your pistols but neither use them nor show them until at a signal from myself the front door of the house had been left open and the visitor had entered without ringing and advanced several steps upon the staircase now however he seemed to hesitate presently we heard him descending dupin was moving quickly to the door when we again heard him coming up he did not turn back a second time but stepped up with decision and rapped at the door of our chamber come in said dupin in a cheerful and hearty tone a man entered he was a sailor evidentlya tall stout and muscularlooking person with a certain dare devil expression of countenance not altogether unprepossessing his face greatly sunburnt was more than half hidden by whisker and mustachio he had with him a huge oaken cudgel but appeared to be otherwise unarmed he bowed awkwardly and bade us good evening in french accents which although somewhat neufchatelish were still sufficiently indicative of a parisian origin sit down my friend said dupin i suppose you have called about the ourangoutang upon my word i almost envy you the possession of him a remarkably fine and no doubt a very valuable animal how old do you suppose him to be the sailor drew a long breath with the air of a man relieved of some intolerable burden and then replied in an assured tone i have no way of tellingbut he cant be more than four or five years old have you got him here oh no we had no conveniences for keeping him here he is at a livery stable in the rue dubourg just by you can get him in the morning of course you are prepared to identify the property to be sure i am sir i shall be sorry to part with him said dupin i dont mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing sir said the man couldnt expect it am very willing to pay a reward for the finding of the animalthat is to say any thing in reason well replied my friend that is all very fair to be sure let me thinkwhat should i have oh i will tell you my reward shall be this you shall give me all the information in your power about these murders in the rue morgue dupin said the last words in a very low tone and very quietly just as quietly too he walked toward the door locked it and put the key in his pocket he then drew a pistol from his bosom and placed it without the least flurry upon the table the sailors face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation he started to his feet and grasped his cudgel but the next moment he fell back into his seat trembling violently and with the countenance of death itself he spoke not a word i pitied him from the bottom of my heart my friend said dupin in a kind tone you are alarming yourself unnecessarilyyou are indeed we mean you no harm whatever i pledge you the honor of a gentleman and of a frenchman that we intend you no injury i perfectly well know that you are innocent of the atrocities in the rue morgue it will not do however to deny that you are in some measure implicated in them from what i have already said you must know that i have had means of information about this mattermeans of which you could never have dreamed now the thing stands thus you have done nothing which you could have avoidednothing certainly which renders you culpable you were not even guilty of robbery when you might have robbed with impunity you have nothing to conceal you have no reason for concealment on the other hand you are bound by every principle of honor to confess all you know an innocent man is now imprisoned charged with that crime of which you can point out the perpetrator the sailor had recovered his presence of mind in a great measure while dupin uttered these words but his original boldness of bearing was all gone so help me god said he after a brief pause i will tell you all i know about this affairbut i do not expect you to believe one half i sayi would be a fool indeed if i did still i am innocent and i will make a clean breast if i die for it what he stated was in substance this he had lately made a voyage to the indian archipelago a party of which he formed one landed at borneo and passed into the interior on an excursion of pleasure himself and a companion had captured the ourangoutang this companion dying the animal fell into his own exclusive possession after great trouble occasioned by the intractable ferocity of his captive during the home voyage he at length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in paris where not to attract toward himself the unpleasant curiosity of his neighbors he kept it carefully secluded until such time as it should recover from a wound in the foot received from a splinter on board ship his ultimate design was to sell it returning home from some sailors frolic the night or rather in the morning of the murder he found the beast occupying his own bedroom into which it had broken from a closet adjoining where it had been as was thought securely confined razor in hand and fully lathered it was sitting before a lookingglass attempting the operation of shaving in which it had no doubt previously watched its master through the keyhole of the closet terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the possession of an animal so ferocious and so well able to use it the man for some moments was at a loss what to do he had been accustomed however to quiet the creature even in its fiercest moods by the use of a whip and to this he now resorted upon sight of it the ourangoutang sprang at once through the door of the chamber down the stairs and thence through a window unfortunately open into the street the frenchman followed in despair the ape razor still in hand occasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at his pursuer until the latter had nearly come up with it it then again made off in this manner the chase continued for a long time the streets were profoundly quiet as it was nearly three oclock in the morning in passing down an alley in the rear of the rue morgue the fugitives attention was arrested by a light gleaming from the open window of madame lespanayes chamber in the fourth story of her house rushing to the building it perceived the lightningrod clambered up with inconceivable agility grasped the shutter which was thrown fully back against the wall and by its means swung itself directly upon the headboard of the bed the whole feat did not occupy a minute the shutter was kicked open again by the ourangoutang as it entered the room the sailor in the meantime was both rejoiced and perplexed he had strong hopes of now recapturing the brute as it could scarcely escape from the trap into which it had ventured except by the rod where it might be intercepted as it came down on the other hand there was much cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house this latter reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive a lightningrod is ascended without difficulty especially by a sailor but when he had arrived as high as the window which lay far to his left his career was stopped the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room at this glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of horror now it was that those hideous shrieks arose upon the night which had startled from slumber the inmates of the rue morgue madame lespanaye and her daughter habited in their night clothes had apparently been occupied in arranging some papers in the iron chest already mentioned which had been wheeled into the middle of the room it was open and its contents lay beside it on the floor the victims must have been sitting with their backs toward the window and from the time elapsing between the ingress of the beast and the screams it seems probable that it was not immediately perceived the flappingto of the shutter would naturally have been attributed to the wind as the sailor looked in the gigantic animal had seized madame lespanaye by the hair which was loose as she had been combing it and was flourishing the razor about her face in imitation of the motions of a barber the daughter lay prostrate and motionless she had swooned the screams and struggles of the old lady during which the hair was torn from her head had the effect of changing the probably pacific purposes of the ourangoutang into those of wrath with one determined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body the sight of blood inflamed its anger into phrenzy gnashing its teeth and flashing fire from its eyes it flew upon the body of the girl and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat retaining its grasp until she expired its wandering and wild glances fell at this moment upon the head of the bed over which the face of its master rigid with horror was just discernible the fury of the beast who no doubt bore still in mind the dreaded whip was instantly converted into fear conscious of having deserved punishment it seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds and skipped about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation throwing down and breaking the furniture as it moved and dragging the bed from the bedstead in conclusion it seized first the corpse of the daughter and thrust it up the chimney as it was found then that of the old lady which it immediately hurled through the window headlong as the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden the sailor shrank aghast to the rod and rather gliding than clambering down it hurried at once homedreading the consequences of the butchery and gladly abandoning in his terror all solicitude about the fate of the ourangoutang the words heard by the party upon the staircase were the frenchmans exclamations of horror and affright commingled with the fiendish jabberings of the brute i have scarcely any thing to add the ourangoutang must have escaped from the chamber by the rod just before the break of the door it must have closed the window as it passed through it it was subsequently caught by the owner himself who obtained for it a very large sum at the jardin des plantes le bon was instantly released upon our narration of the circumstances with some comments from dupin at the bureau of the prefect of police this functionary however well disposed to my friend could not altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had taken and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two about the propriety of every person minding his own business let him talk said dupin who had not thought it necessary to reply let him discourse it will ease his conscience i am satisfied with having defeated him in his own castle nevertheless that he failed in the solution of this mystery is by no means that matter for wonder which he supposes it for in truth our friend the prefect is somewhat too cunning to be profound in his wisdom is no stamen it is all head and no body like the pictures of the goddess lavernaor at best all head and shoulders like a codfish but he is a good creature after all i like him especially for one master stroke of cant by which he has attained his reputation for ingenuity i mean the way he has de nier ce qui est et dexpliquer ce qui nest pas the balloonhoax astounding news by express via norfolkthe atlantic crossed in three days signal triumph of mr monck masons flying machinearrival at sullivans island near charlestown sc of mr mason mr robert holland mr henson mr harrison ainsworth and four others in the steering balloon victoria after a passage of seventyfive hours from land to land full particulars of the voyage the subjoined jeu desprit with the preceding heading in magnificent capitals well interspersed with notes of admiration was originally published as matter of fact in the newyork sun a daily newspaper and therein fully subserved the purpose of creating indigestible aliment for the quidnuncs during the few hours intervening between a couple of the charleston mails the rush for the sole paper which had the news was something beyond even the prodigious and in fact if as some assert the victoria did not absolutely accomplish the voyage recorded it will be difficult to assign a reason why she should not have accomplished it the great problem is at length solved the air as well as the earth and the ocean has been subdued by science and will become a common and convenient highway for mankind the atlantic has been actually crossed in a balloon and this too without difficultywithout any great apparent dangerwith thorough control of the machineand in the inconceivably brief period of seventyfive hours from shore to shore by the energy of an agent at charleston sc we are enabled to be the first to furnish the public with a detailed account of this most extraordinary voyage which was performed between saturday the th instant at am and pm on tuesday the th instant by sir everard bringhurst mr osborne a nephew of lord bentincks mr monck mason and mr robert holland the wellknown aëronauts mr harrison ainsworth author of jack sheppard etc and mr henson the projector of the late unsuccessful flying machinewith two seamen from woolwichin all eight persons the particulars furnished below may be relied on as authentic and accurate in every respect as with a slight exception they are copied verbatim from the joint diaries of mr monck mason and mr harrison ainsworth to whose politeness our agent is also indebted for much verbal information respecting the balloon itself its construction and other matters of interest the only alteration in the ms received has been made for the purpose of throwing the hurried account of our agent mr forsyth into a connected and intelligible form the balloon two very decided failures of latethose of mr henson and sir george cayleyhad much weakened the public interest in the subject of aërial navigation mr hensons scheme which at first was considered very feasible even by men of science was founded upon the principle of an inclined plane started from an eminence by an extrinsic force applied and continued by the revolution of impinging vanes in form and number resembling the vanes of a windmill but in all the experiments made with models at the adelaide gallery it was found that the operation of these fans not only did not propel the machine but actually impeded its flight the only propelling force it ever exhibited was the mere impetus acquired from the descent of the inclined plane and this impetus carried the machine farther when the vanes were at rest than when they were in motiona fact which sufficiently demonstrates their inutility and in the absence of the propelling which was also the sustaining power the whole fabric would necessarily descend this consideration led sir george cayley to think only of adapting a propeller to some machine having of itself an independent power of supportin a word to a balloon the idea however being novel or original with sir george only so far as regards the mode of its application to practice he exhibited a model of his invention at the polytechnic institution the propelling principle or power was here also applied to interrupted surfaces or vanes put in revolution these vanes were four in number but were found entirely ineffectual in moving the balloon or in aiding its ascending power the whole project was thus a complete failure it was at this juncture that mr monck mason whose voyage from dover to weilburg in the balloon nassau occasioned so much excitement in conceived the idea of employing the principle of the archimedean screw for the purpose of propulsion through the airrightly attributing the failure of mr hensons scheme and of sir george cayleys to the interruption of surface in the independent vanes he made the first public experiment at williss rooms but afterward removed his model to the adelaide gallery like sir george cayleys balloon his own was an ellipsoid its length was thirteen feet six inchesheight six feet eight inches it contained about three hundred and twenty cubic feet of gas which if pure hydrogen would support twentyone pounds upon its first inflation before the gas has time to deteriorate or escape the weight of the whole machine and apparatus was seventeen poundsleaving about four pounds to spare beneath the centre of the balloon was a frame of light wood about nine feet long and rigged on to the balloon itself with a network in the customary manner from this framework was suspended a wicker basket or car the screw consists of an axis of hollow brass tube eighteen inches in length through which upon a semispiral inclined at fifteen degrees pass a series of steelwire radii two feet long and thus projecting a foot on either side these radii are connected at the outer extremities by two bands of flattened wirethe whole in this manner forming the framework of the screw which is completed by a covering of oiled silk cut into gores and tightened so as to present a tolerably uniform surface at each end of its axis this screw is supported by pillars of hollow brass tube descending from the hoop in the lower ends of these tubes are holes in which the pivots of the axis revolve from the end of the axis which is next the car proceeds a shaft of steel connecting the screw with the pinion of a piece of spring machinery fixed in the car by the operation of this spring the screw is made to revolve with great rapidity communicating a progressive motion to the whole by means of the rudder the machine was readily turned in any direction the spring was of great power compared with its dimensions being capable of raising fortyfive pounds upon a barrel of four inches diameter after the first turn and gradually increasing as it was wound up it weighed altogether eight pounds six ounces the rudder was a light frame of cane covered with silk shaped somewhat like a battledoor and was about three feet long and at the widest one foot its weight was about two ounces it could be turned flat and directed upward or downward as well as to the right or left and thus enabled the aëronaut to transfer the resistance of the air which in an inclined position it must generate in its passage to any side upon which he might desire to act thus determining the balloon in the opposite direction this model which through want of time we have necessarily described in an imperfect manner was put in action at the adelaide gallery where it accomplished a velocity of five miles per hour although strange to say it excited very little interest in comparison with the previous complex machine of mr hensonso resolute is the world to despise any thing which carries with it an air of simplicity to accomplish the great desideratum of aërial navigation it was very generally supposed that some exceedingly complicated application must be made of some unusually profound principle in dynamics so well satisfied however was mr mason of the ultimate success of his invention that he determined to construct immediately if possible a balloon of sufficient capacity to test the question by a voyage of some extentthe original design being to cross the british channel as before in the nassau balloon to carry out his views he solicited and obtained the patronage of sir everard bringhurst and mr osborne two gentlemen well known for scientific acquirement and especially for the interest they have exhibited in the progress of aërostation the project at the desire of mr osborne was kept a profound secret from the publicthe only persons entrusted with the design being those actually engaged in the construction of the machine which was built under the superintendence of mr mason mr holland sir everard bringhurst and mr osborne at the seat of the latter gentleman near penstruthal in wales mr henson accompanied by his friend mr ainsworth was admitted to a private view of the balloon on saturday lastwhen the two gentlemen made final arrangements to be included in the adventure we are not informed for what reason the two seamen were also included in the partybut in the course of a day or two we shall put our readers in possession of the minutest particulars respecting this extraordinary voyage the balloon is composed of silk varnished with the liquid gum caoutchouc it is of vast dimensions containing more than cubic feet of gas but as coalgas was employed in place of the more expensive and inconvenient hydrogen the supporting power of the machine when fully inflated and immediately after inflation is not more than about pounds the coalgas is not only much less costly but is easily procured and managed for its introduction into common use for purposes of aërostation we are indebted to mr charles green up to his discovery the process of inflation was not only exceedingly expensive but uncertain two and even three days have frequently been wasted in futile attempts to procure a sufficiency of hydrogen to fill a balloon from which it had great tendency to escape owing to its extreme subtlety and its affinity for the surrounding atmosphere in a balloon sufficiently perfect to retain its contents of coalgas unaltered in quantity or amount for six months an equal quantity of hydrogen could not be maintained in equal purity for six weeks the supporting power being estimated at pounds and the united weights of the party amounting only to about there was left a surplus of of which again was exhausted by ballast arranged in bags of different sizes with their respective weights marked upon themby cordage barometers telescopes barrels containing provision for a fortnight watercasks cloaks carpetbags and various other indispensable matters including a coffeewarmer contrived for warming coffee by means of slacklime so as to dispense altogether with fire if it should be judged prudent to do so all these articles with the exception of the ballast and a few trifles were suspended from the hoop overhead the car is much smaller and lighter in proportion than the one appended to the model it is formed of a light wicker and is wonderfully strong for so fraillooking a machine its rim is about four feet deep the rudder is also very much larger in proportion than that of the model and the screw is considerably smaller the balloon is furnished besides with a grapnel and a guiderope which latter is of the most indispensable importance a few words in explanation will here be necessary for such of our readers as are not conversant with the details of aërostation as soon as the balloon quits the earth it is subjected to the influence of many circumstances tending to create a difference in its weight augmenting or diminishing its ascending power for example there may be a deposition of dew upon the silk to the extent even of several hundred pounds ballast has then to be thrown out or the machine may descend this ballast being discarded and a clear sunshine evaporating the dew and at the same time expanding the gas in the silk the whole will again rapidly ascend to check this ascent the only recourse is or rather was until mr greens invention of the guiderope the permission of the escape of gas from the valve but in the loss of gas is a proportionate general loss of ascending power so that in a comparatively brief period the bestconstructed balloon must necessarily exhaust all its resources and come to the earth this was the great obstacle to voyages of length the guiderope remedies the difficulty in the simplest manner conceivable it is merely a very long rope which is suffered to trail from the car and the effect of which is to prevent the balloon from changing its level in any material degree if for example there should be a deposition of moisture upon the silk and the machine begins to descend in consequence there will be no necessity for discharging ballast to remedy the increase of weight for it is remedied or counteracted in an exactly just proportion by the deposit on the ground of just so much of the end of the rope as is necessary if on the other hand any circumstances should cause undue levity and consequent ascent this levity is immediately counteracted by the additional weight of rope upraised from the earth thus the balloon can neither ascend or descend except within very narrow limits and its resources either in gas or ballast remain comparatively unimpaired when passing over an expanse of water it becomes necessary to employ small kegs of copper or wood filled with liquid ballast of a lighter nature than water these float and serve all the purposes of a mere rope on land another most important office of the guiderope is to point out the direction of the balloon the rope drags either on land or sea while the balloon is free the latter consequently is always in advance when any progress whatever is made a comparison therefore by means of the compass of the relative positions of the two objects will always indicate the course in the same way the angle formed by the rope with the vertical axis of the machine indicates the velocity when there is no anglein other words when the rope hangs perpendicularly the whole apparatus is stationary but the larger the angle that is to say the farther the balloon precedes the end of the rope the greater the velocity and the converse as the original design was to cross the british channel and alight as near paris as possible the voyagers had taken the precaution to prepare themselves with passports directed to all parts of the continent specifying the nature of the expedition as in the case of the nassau voyage and entitling the adventurers to exemption from the usual formalities of office unexpected events however rendered these passports superfluous the inflation was commenced very quietly at daybreak on saturday morning the th instant in the courtyard of whealvor house mr osbornes seat about a mile from penstruthal in north wales and at seven minutes past eleven every thing being ready for departure the balloon was set free rising gently but steadily in a direction nearly south no use being made for the first half hour of either the screw or the rudder we proceed now with the journal as transcribed by mr forsyth from the joint mss of mr monck mason and mr ainsworth the body of the journal as given is in the handwriting of mr mason and a p s is appended each day by mr ainsworth who has in preparation and will shortly give the public a more minute and no doubt a thrillingly interesting account of the voyage the journal saturday april the thevery preparation likely to embarrass us having been made overnight we commenced the inflation this morning at daybreak but owing to a thick fog which encumbered the folds of the silk and rendered it unmanageable we did not get through before nearly eleven oclock cut loose then in high spirits and rose gently but steadily with a light breeze at north which bore us in the direction of the british channel found the ascending force greater than we had expected and as we arose higher and so got clear of the cliffs and more in the suns rays our ascent became very rapid i did not wish however to lose gas at so early a period of the adventure and so concluded to ascend for the present we soon ran out our guiderope but even when we had raised it clear of the earth we still went up very rapidly the balloon was unusually steady and looked beautifully in about ten minutes after starting the barometer indicated an altitude of feet the weather was remarkably fine and the view of the subjacent countrya most romantic one when seen from any pointwas now especially sublime the numerous deep gorges presented the appearance of lakes on account of the dense vapors with which they were filled and the pinnacles and crags to the south east piled in inextricable confusion resembling nothing so much as the giant cities of eastern fable we were rapidly approaching the mountains in the south but our elevation was more than sufficient to enable us to pass them in safety in a few minutes we soared over them in fine style and mr ainsworth with the seamen was surprised at their apparent want of altitude when viewed from the car the tendency of great elevation in a balloon being to reduce inequalities of the surface below to nearly a dead level at halfpast eleven still proceeding nearly south we obtained our first view of the bristol channel and in fifteen minutes afterward the line of breakers on the coast appeared immediately beneath us and we were fairly out at sea we now resolved to let off enough gas to bring our guiderope with the buoys affixed into the water this was immediately done and we commenced a gradual descent in about twenty minutes our first buoy dipped and at the touch of the second soon afterward we remained stationary as to elevation we were all now anxious to test the efficiency of the rudder and screw and we put them both into requisition forthwith for the purpose of altering our direction more to the eastward and in a line for paris by means of the rudder we instantly effected the necessary change of direction and our course was brought nearly at right angles to that of the wind when we set in motion the spring of the screw and were rejoiced to find it propel us readily as desired upon this we gave nine hearty cheers and dropped in the sea a bottle enclosing a slip of parchment with a brief account of the principle of the invention hardly however had we done with our rejoicings when an unforeseen accident occurred which discouraged us in no little degree the steel rod connecting the spring with the propeller was suddenly jerked out of place at the car end by a swaying of the car through some movement of one of the two seamen we had taken up and in an instant hung dangling out of reach from the pivot of the axis of the screw while we were endeavoring to regain it our attention being completely absorbed we became involved in a strong current of wind from the east which bore us with rapidly increasing force toward the atlantic we soon found ourselves driving out to sea at the rate of not less certainly than fifty or sixty miles an hour so that we came up with cape clear at some forty miles to our north before we had secured the rod and had time to think what we were about it was now that mr ainsworth made an extraordinary but to my fancy a by no means unreasonable orchimerical proposition in which he was instantly seconded by mr hollandviz that we should take advantage of the strong gale which bore us on and in place of beating back to paris make an attempt to reach the coast of north america after slight reflection i gave a willing assent to this bold proposition which strange to say met with objection from the two seamen only as the stronger party however we overruled their fears and kept resolutely upon our course we steered due west but as the trailing of the buoys materially impeded our progress and we had the balloon abundantly at command either for ascent or descent we first threw out fifty pounds of ballast and then wound up by means of a windlass so much of the rope as brought it quite clear of the sea we perceived the effect of this manœuvre immediately in a vastly increased rate of progress and as the gale freshened we flew with a velocity nearly inconceivable the guiderope flying out behind the car like a streamer from a vessel it is needless to say that a very short time sufficed us to lose sight of the coast we passed over innumerable vessels of all kinds a few of which were endeavoring to beat up but the most of them lying to we occasioned the greatest excitement on board allan excitement greatly relished by ourselves and especially by our two men who now under the influence of a dram of geneva seemed resolved to give all scruple or fear to the wind many of the vessels fired signal guns and in all we were saluted with loud cheers which we heard with surprising distinctness and the waving of caps and handkerchiefs we kept on in this manner throughout the day with no material incident and as the shades of night closed around us we made a rough estimate of the distance traversed it could not have been less than five hundred miles and was probably much more the propeller was kept in constant operation and no doubt aided our progress materially as the sun went down the gale freshened into an absolute hurricane and the ocean beneath was clearly visible on account of its phosphorescence the wind was from the east all night and gave us the brightest omen of success we suffered no little from cold and the dampness of the atmosphere was most unpleasant but the ample space in the car enabled us to lie down and by means of cloaks and a few blankets we did sufficiently well ps by mr ainsworth the last nine hours have been unquestionably the most exciting of my life i can conceive nothing more sublimating than the strange peril and novelty of an adventure such as this may god grant that we succeed i ask not success for mere safety to my insignificant person but for the sake of human knowledge andfor the vastness of the triumph and yet the feat is only so evidently feasible that the sole wonder is why men have scrupled to attempt it before one single gale such as now befriends uslet such a tempest whirl forward a balloon for four or five days these gales often last longer and the voyager will be easily borne in that period from coast to coast in view of such a gale the broad atlantic becomes a mere lake i am more struck just now with the supreme silence which reigns in the sea beneath us notwithstanding its agitation than with any other phenomenon presenting itself the waters give up no voice to the heavens the immense flaming ocean writhes and is tortured uncomplainingly the mountainous surges suggest the idea of innumerable dumb gigantic fiends struggling in impotent agony in a night such as is this to me a man liveslives a whole century of ordinary lifenor would i forego this rapturous delight for that of a whole century of ordinary existence sunday the th mr masons ms this morning the gale by ten had subsided to an eight or nineknot breeze for a vessel at sea and bears us perhaps thirty miles per hour or more it has veered however very considerably to the north and now at sundown we are holding our course due west principally by the screw and rudder which answer their purposes to admiration i regard the project as thoroughly successful and the easy navigation of the air in any direction not exactly in the teeth of a gale as no longer problematical we could not have made head against the strong wind of yesterday but by ascending we might have got out of its influence if requisite against a pretty stiff breeze i feel convinced we can make our way with the propeller at noon today ascended to an elevation of nearly feet by discharging ballast did this to search for a more direct current but found none so favorable as the one we are now in we have an abundance of gas to take us across this small pond even should the voyage last three weeks i have not the slightest fear for the result the difficulty has been strangely exaggerated and misapprehended i can choose my current and should i find all currents against me i can make very tolerable headway with the propeller we have had no incidents worth recording the night promises fair ps by mr ainsworth i have little to record except the fact to me quite a surprising one that at an elevation equal to that of cotopaxi i experienced neither very intense cold nor headache nor difficulty of breathing neither i find did mr mason nor mr holland nor sir everard mr osborne complained of constriction of the chestbut this soon wore off we have flown at a great rate during the day and we must be more than half way across the atlantic we have passed over some twenty or thirty vessels of various kinds and all seem to be delightfully astonished crossing the ocean in a balloon is not so difficult a feat after all omne ignotum pro magnifico mem at feet elevation the sky appears nearly black and the stars are distinctly visible while the sea does not seem convex as one might suppose but absolutely and most unequivocally concave monday the th mr masons ms this morning we had again some little trouble with the rod of the propeller which must be entirely remodelled for fear of serious accidenti mean the steel rod not the vanes the latter could not be improved the wind has been blowing steadily and strongly from the northeast all day and so far fortune seems bent upon favoring us just before day we were all somewhat alarmed at some odd noises and concussions in the balloon accompanied with the apparent rapid subsidence of the whole machine these phenomena were occasioned by the expansion of the gas through increase of heat in the atmosphere and the consequent disruption of the minute particles of ice with which the network had become encrusted during the night threw down several bottles to the vessels below saw one of them picked up by a large shipseemingly one of the new york line packets endeavored to make out her name but could not be sure of it mr osbornes telescope made it out something like atalanta it is now twelve at night and we are still going nearly west at a rapid pace the sea is peculiarly phosphorescent ps by mr ainsworth it is now two am and nearly calm as well as i can judgebut it is very difficult to determine this point since we move with the air so completely i have not slept since quitting whealvor but can stand it no longer and must take a nap we cannot be far from the american coast tuesday the th mr ainsworths ms one pm we are in full view of the low coast of south carolina the great problem is accomplished we have crossed the atlanticfairly and easily crossed it in a balloon god be praised who shall say that any thing is impossible hereafter the journal here ceases some particulars of the descent were communicated however by mr ainsworth to mr forsyth it was nearly dead calm when the voyagers first came in view of the coast which was immediately recognized by both the seamen and by mr osborne the latter gentleman having acquaintances at fort moultrie it was immediately resolved to descend in its vicinity the balloon was brought over the beach the tide being out and the sand hard smooth and admirably adapted for a descent and the grapnel let go which took firm hold at once the inhabitants of the island and of the fort thronged out of course to see the balloon but it was with the greatest difficulty that any one could be made to credit the actual voyagethe crossing of the atlantic the grapnel caught at two pm precisely and thus the whole voyage was completed in seventyfive hours or rather less counting from shore to shore no serious accident occurred no real danger was at any time apprehended the balloon was exhausted and secured without trouble and when the ms from which this narrative is compiled was despatched from charleston the party were still at fort moultrie their further intentions were not ascertained but we can safely promise our readers some additional information either on monday or in the course of the next day at furthest this is unquestionably the most stupendous the most interesting and the most important undertaking ever accomplished or even attempted by man what magnificent events may ensue it would be useless now to think of determining the spectacles many years ago it was the fashion to ridicule the idea of love at first sight but those who think not less than those who feel deeply have always advocated its existence modern discoveries indeed in what may be termed ethical magnetism or magnetæsthetics render it probable that the most natural and consequently the truest and most intense of the human affections are those which arise in the heart as if by electric sympathyin a word that the brightest and most enduring of the psychal fetters are those which are riveted by a glance the confession i am about to make will add another to the already almost innumerable instances of the truth of the position my story requires that i should be somewhat minute i am still a very young mannot yet twentytwo years of age my name at present is a very usual and rather plebeian onesimpson i say at present for it is only lately that i have been so calledhaving legislatively adopted this surname within the last year in order to receive a large inheritance left me by a distant male relative adolphus simpson esq the bequest was conditioned upon my taking the name of the testatorthe family not the christian name my christian name is napoleon buonaparteor more properly these are my first and middle appellations i assumed the name simpson with some reluctance as in my true patronym froissart i felt a very pardonable pridebelieving that i could trace a descent from the immortal author of the chronicles while on the subject of names by the bye i may mention a singular coincidence of sound attending the names of some of my immediate predecessors my father was a monsieur froissart of paris his wifemy mother whom he married at fifteenwas a mademoiselle croissart eldest daughter of croissart the banker whose wife again being only sixteen when married was the eldest daughter of one victor voissart monsieur voissart very singularly had married a lady of similar namea mademoiselle moissart she too was quite a child when married and her mother also madame moissart was only fourteen when led to the altar these early marriages are usual in france here however are moissart voissart croissart and froissart all in the direct line of descent my own name though as i say became simpson by act of legislature and with so much repugnance on my part that at one period i actually hesitated about accepting the legacy with the useless and annoying proviso attached as to personal endowments i am by no means deficient on the contrary i believe that i am well made and possess what nine tenths of the world would call a handsome face in height i am five feet eleven my hair is black and curling my nose is sufficiently good my eyes are large and gray and although in fact they are weak to a very inconvenient degree still no defect in this regard would be suspected from their appearance the weakness itself however has always much annoyed me and i have resorted to every remedyshort of wearing glasses being youthful and goodlooking i naturally dislike these and have resolutely refused to employ them i know nothing indeed which so disfigures the countenance of a young person or so impresses every feature with an air of demureness if not altogether of sanctimoniousness and of age an eyeglass on the other hand has a savor of downright foppery and affectation i have hitherto managed as well as i could without either but something too much of these merely personal details which after all are of little importance i will content myself with saying in addition that my temperament is sanguine rash ardent enthusiasticand that all my life i have been a devoted admirer of the women one night last winter i entered a box at the ptheatre in company with a friend mr talbot it was an opera night and the bills presented a very rare attraction so that the house was excessively crowded we were in time however to obtain the front seats which had been reserved for us and into which with some little difficulty we elbowed our way for two hours my companion who was a musical fanatico gave his undivided attention to the stage and in the meantime i amused myself by observing the audience which consisted in chief part of the very élite of the city having satisfied myself upon this point i was about turning my eyes to the prima donna when they were arrested and riveted by a figure in one of the private boxes which had escaped my observation if i live a thousand years i can never forget the intense emotion with which i regarded this figure it was that of a female the most exquisite i had ever beheld the face was so far turned toward the stage that for some minutes i could not obtain a view of itbut the form was divine no other word can sufficiently express its magnificent proportionand even the term divine seems ridiculously feeble as i write it the magic of a lovely form in womanthe necromancy of female gracefulnesswas always a power which i had found it impossible to resist but here was grace personified incarnate the beau idéal of my wildest and most enthusiastic visions the figure almost all of which the construction of the box permitted to be seen was somewhat above the medium height and nearly approached without positively reaching the majestic its perfect fullness and tournure were delicious the head of which only the back was visible rivalled in outline that of the greek psyche and was rather displayed than concealed by an elegant cap of gaze äérienne which put me in mind of the ventum textilem of apuleius the right arm hung over the balustrade of the box and thrilled every nerve of my frame with its exquisite symmetry its upper portion was draperied by one of the loose open sleeves now in fashion this extended but little below the elbow beneath it was worn an under one of some frail material closefitting and terminated by a cuff of rich lace which fell gracefully over the top of the hand revealing only the delicate fingers upon one of which sparkled a diamond ring which i at once saw was of extraordinary value the admirable roundness of the wrist was well set off by a bracelet which encircled it and which also was ornamented and clasped by a magnificent aigrette of jewelstelling in words that could not be mistaken at once of the wealth and fastidious taste of the wearer i gazed at this queenly apparition for at least half an hour as if i had been suddenly converted to stone and during this period i felt the full force and truth of all that has been said or sung concerning love at first sight my feelings were totally different from any which i had hitherto experienced in the presence of even the most celebrated specimens of female loveliness an unaccountable and what i am compelled to consider a magnetic sympathy of soul for soul seemed to rivet not only my vision but my whole powers of thought and feeling upon the admirable object before me i sawi felti knew that i was deeply madly irrevocably in loveand this even before seeing the face of the person beloved so intense indeed was the passion that consumed me that i really believe it would have received little if any abatement had the features yet unseen proved of merely ordinary character so anomalous is the nature of the only true loveof the love at first sightand so little really dependent is it upon the external conditions which only seem to create and control it while i was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely vision a sudden disturbance among the audience caused her to turn her head partially toward me so that i beheld the entire profile of the face its beauty even exceeded my anticipationsand yet there was something about it which disappointed me without my being able to tell exactly what it was i said disappointed but this is not altogether the word my sentiments were at once quieted and exalted they partook less of transport and more of calm enthusiasmof enthusiastic repose this state of feeling arose perhaps from the madonnalike and matronly air of the face and yet i at once understood that it could not have arisen entirely from this there was something elsesome mystery which i could not developsome expression about the countenance which slightly disturbed me while it greatly heightened my interest in fact i was just in that condition of mind which prepares a young and susceptible man for any act of extravagance had the lady been alone i should undoubtedly have entered her box and accosted her at all hazards but fortunately she was attended by two companionsa gentleman and a strikingly beautiful woman to all appearance a few years younger than herself i revolved in my mind a thousand schemes by which i might obtain hereafter an introduction to the elder lady or for the present at all events a more distinct view of her beauty i would have removed my position to one nearer her own but the crowded state of the theatre rendered this impossible and the stern decrees of fashion had of late imperatively prohibited the use of the operaglass in a case such as this even had i been so fortunate as to have one with mebut i had notand was thus in despair at length i bethought me of applying to my companion talbot i said you have an operaglass let me have it an operaglassnowhat do you suppose i would be doing with an operaglass here he turned impatiently toward the stage but talbot i continued pulling him by the shoulder listen to me will you do you see the stageboxthereno the nextdid you ever behold as lovely a woman she is very beautiful no doubt he said i wonder who she can be why in the name of all that is angelic dont you know who she is not to know her argues yourself unknown she is the celebrated madame lalandethe beauty of the day par excellence and the talk of the whole town immensely wealthy tooa widowand a great matchhas just arrived from paris do you know her yesi have the honor will you introduce me assuredlywith the greatest pleasure when shall it be tomorrow at one i will call upon you at bs very good and now do hold your tongue if you can in this latter respect i was forced to take talbots advice for he remained obstinately deaf to every further question or suggestion and occupied himself exclusively for the rest of the evening with what was transacting upon the stage in the meantime i kept my eyes riveted on madame lalande and at length had the good fortune to obtain a full front view of her face it was exquisitely lovely this of course my heart had told me before even had not talbot fully satisfied me upon the pointbut still the unintelligible something disturbed me i finally concluded that my senses were impressed by a certain air of gravity sadness or still more properly of weariness which took something from the youth and freshness of the countenance only to endow it with a seraphic tenderness and majesty and thus of course to my enthusiastic and romantic temperament with an interest tenfold while i thus feasted my eyes i perceived at last to my great trepidation by an almost imperceptible start on the part of the lady that she had become suddenly aware of the intensity of my gaze still i was absolutely fascinated and could not withdraw it even for an instant she turned aside her face and again i saw only the chiselled contour of the back portion of the head after some minutes as if urged by curiosity to see if i was still looking she gradually brought her face again around and again encountered my burning gaze her large dark eyes fell instantly and a deep blush mantled her cheek but what was my astonishment at perceiving that she not only did not a second time avert her head but that she actually took from her girdle a double eyeglasselevated itadjusted itand then regarded me through it intently and deliberately for the space of several minutes had a thunderbolt fallen at my feet i could not have been more thoroughly astoundedastounded onlynot offended or disgusted in the slightest degree although an action so bold in any other woman would have been likely to offend or disgust but the whole thing was done with so much quietudeso much nonchalanceso much reposewith so evident an air of the highest breeding in shortthat nothing of mere effrontery was perceptible and my sole sentiments were those of admiration and surprise i observed that upon her first elevation of the glass she had seemed satisfied with a momentary inspection of my person and was withdrawing the instrument when as if struck by a second thought she resumed it and so continued to regard me with fixed attention for the space of several minutesfor five minutes at the very least i am sure this action so remarkable in an american theatre attracted very general observation and gave rise to an indefinite movement or buzz among the audience which for a moment filled me with confusion but produced no visible effect upon the countenance of madame lalande having satisfied her curiosityif such it wasshe dropped the glass and quietly gave her attention again to the stage her profile now being turned toward myself as before i continued to watch her unremittingly although i was fully conscious of my rudeness in so doing presently i saw the head slowly and slightly change its position and soon i became convinced that the lady while pretending to look at the stage was in fact attentively regarding myself it is needless to say what effect this conduct on the part of so fascinating a woman had upon my excitable mind having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an hour the fair object of my passion addressed the gentleman who attended her and while she spoke i saw distinctly by the glances of both that the conversation had reference to myself upon its conclusion madame lalande again turned toward the stage and for a few minutes seemed absorbed in the performances at the expiration of this period however i was thrown into an extremity of agitation by seeing her unfold for the second time the eyeglass which hung at her side fully confront me as before and disregarding the renewed buzz of the audience survey me from head to foot with the same miraculous composure which had previously so delighted and confounded my soul this extraordinary behavior by throwing me into a perfect fever of excitementinto an absolute delirium of loveserved rather to embolden than to disconcert me in the mad intensity of my devotion i forgot everything but the presence and the majestic loveliness of the vision which confronted my gaze watching my opportunity when i thought the audience were fully engaged with the opera i at length caught the eyes of madame lalande and upon the instant made a slight but unmistakable bow she blushed very deeplythen averted her eyesthen slowly and cautiously looked around apparently to see if my rash action had been noticedthen leaned over toward the gentleman who sat by her side i now felt a burning sense of the impropriety i had committed and expected nothing less than instant exposure while a vision of pistols upon the morrow floated rapidly and uncomfortably through my brain i was greatly and immediately relieved however when i saw the lady merely hand the gentleman a playbill without speaking but the reader may form some feeble conception of my astonishmentof my profound amazementmy delirious bewilderment of heart and soulwhen instantly afterward having again glanced furtively around she allowed her bright eyes to set fully and steadily upon my own and then with a faint smile disclosing a bright line of her pearly teeth made two distinct pointed and unequivocal affirmative inclinations of the head it is useless of course to dwell upon my joyupon my transportupon my illimitable ecstasy of heart if ever man was mad with excess of happiness it was myself at that moment i loved this was my first loveso i felt it to be it was love supremeindescribable it was love at first sight and at first sight too it had been appreciated and returned yes returned how and why should i doubt it for an instant what other construction could i possibly put upon such conduct on the part of a lady so beautifulso wealthyevidently so accomplishedof so high breedingof so lofty a position in societyin every regard so entirely respectable as i felt assured was madame lalande yes she loved meshe returned the enthusiasm of my love with an enthusiasm as blindas uncompromisingas uncalculatingas abandonedand as utterly unbounded as my own these delicious fancies and reflections however were now interrupted by the falling of the dropcurtain the audience arose and the usual tumult immediately supervened quitting talbot abruptly i made every effort to force my way into closer proximity with madame lalande having failed in this on account of the crowd i at length gave up the chase and bent my steps homeward consoling myself for my disappointment in not having been able to touch even the hem of her robe by the reflection that i should be introduced by talbot in due form upon the morrow this morrow at last came that is to say a day finally dawned upon a long and weary night of impatience and then the hours until one were snailpaced dreary and innumerable but even stamboul it is said shall have an end and there came an end to this long delay the clock struck as the last echo ceased i stepped into bs and inquired for talbot out said the footmantalbots own out i replied staggering back half a dozen paceslet me tell you my fine fellow that this thing is thoroughly impossible and impracticable mr talbot is not out what do you mean nothing sir only mr talbot is not in thats all he rode over to s immediately after breakfast and left word that he would not be in town again for a week i stood petrified with horror and rage i endeavored to reply but my tongue refused its office at length i turned on my heel livid with wrath and inwardly consigning the whole tribe of the talbots to the innermost regions of erebus it was evident that my considerate friend il fanatico had quite forgotten his appointment with myselfhad forgotten it as soon as it was made at no time was he a very scrupulous man of his word there was no help for it so smothering my vexation as well as i could i strolled moodily up the street propounding futile inquiries about madame lalande to every male acquaintance i met by report she was known i found to allto many by sightbut she had been in town only a few weeks and there were very few therefore who claimed her personal acquaintance these few being still comparatively strangers could not or would not take the liberty of introducing me through the formality of a morning call while i stood thus in despair conversing with a trio of friends upon the allabsorbing subject of my heart it so happened that the subject itself passed by as i live there she is cried one surprisingly beautiful exclaimed a second an angel upon earth ejaculated a third i looked and in an open carriage which approached us passing slowly down the street sat the enchanting vision of the opera accompanied by the younger lady who had occupied a portion of her box her companion also wears remarkably well said the one of my trio who had spoken first astonishingly said the second still quite a brilliant air but art will do wonders upon my word she looks better than she did at paris five years ago a beautiful woman stilldont you think so froissartsimpson i mean still said i and why shouldnt she be but compared with her friend she is as a rushlight to the evening stara glowworm to antares ha ha hawhy simpson you have an astonishing tact at making discoveriesoriginal ones i mean and here we separated while one of the trio began humming a gay vaudeville of which i caught only the lines ninon ninon ninon à bas à bas ninon de lenclos during this little scene however one thing had served greatly to console me although it fed the passion by which i was consumed as the carriage of madame lalande rolled by our group i had observed that she recognized me and more than this she had blessed me by the most seraphic of all imaginable smiles with no equivocal mark of the recognition as for an introduction i was obliged to abandon all hope of it until such time as talbot should think proper to return from the country in the meantime i perseveringly frequented every reputable place of public amusement and at length at the theatre where i first saw her i had the supreme bliss of meeting her and of exchanging glances with her once again this did not occur however until the lapse of a fortnight every day in the interim i had inquired for talbot at his hotel and every day had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the everlasting not come home yet of his footman upon the evening in question therefore i was in a condition little short of madness madame lalande i had been told was a parisianhad lately arrived from parismight she not suddenly returnreturn before talbot came backand might she not be thus lost to me forever the thought was too terrible to bear since my future happiness was at issue i resolved to act with a manly decision in a word upon the breaking up of the play i traced the lady to her residence noted the address and the next morning sent her a full and elaborate letter in which i poured out my whole heart i spoke boldly freelyin a word i spoke with passion i concealed nothingnothing even of my weakness i alluded to the romantic circumstances of our first meetingeven to the glances which had passed between us i went so far as to say that i felt assured of her love while i offered this assurance and my own intensity of devotion as two excuses for my otherwise unpardonable conduct as a third i spoke of my fear that she might quit the city before i could have the opportunity of a formal introduction i concluded the most wildly enthusiastic epistle ever penned with a frank declaration of my worldly circumstancesof my affluenceand with an offer of my heart and of my hand in an agony of expectation i awaited the reply after what seemed the lapse of a century it came yes actually came romantic as all this may appear i really received a letter from madame lalandethe beautiful the wealthy the idolized madame lalande her eyesher magnificent eyes had not belied her noble heart like a true frenchwoman as she was she had obeyed the frank dictates of her reasonthe generous impulses of her naturedespising the conventional pruderies of the world she had not scorned my proposals she had not sheltered herself in silence she had not returned my letter unopened she had even sent me in reply one penned by her own exquisite fingers it ran thus monsieur simpson vill pardonne me for not compose de butefulle tong of his contrée so vell as might it is only de late dat i am arrive and not yet ave do opportunité for tolétudier vid dis apologie for the manière i vill now say dat hélasmonsieur simpson ave guess but de too true need i say de more hélas am i not ready speak de too moshe eugénie laland this noblespirited note i kissed a million times and committed no doubt on its account a thousand other extravagances that have now escaped my memory still talbot would not return alas could he have formed even the vaguest idea of the suffering his absence had occasioned his friend would not his sympathizing nature have flown immediately to my relief still however he came not i wrote he replied he was detained by urgent businessbut would shortly return he begged me not to be impatientto moderate my transportsto read soothing booksto drink nothing stronger than hockand to bring the consolations of philosophy to my aid the fool if he could not come himself why in the name of every thing rational could he not have enclosed me a letter of presentation i wrote him again entreating him to forward one forthwith my letter was returned by that footman with the following endorsement in pencil the scoundrel had joined his master in the country left syesterday for parts unknowndid not say whereor when be backso thought best to return letter knowing your handwriting and as how you is always more or less in a hurry yours sincerely stubbs after this it is needless to say that i devoted to the infernal deities both master and valetbut there was little use in anger and no consolation at all in complaint but i had yet a resource left in my constitutional audacity hitherto it had served me well and i now resolved to make it avail me to the end besides after the correspondence which had passed between us what act of mere informality could i commit within bounds that ought to be regarded as indecorous by madame lalande since the affair of the letter i had been in the habit of watching her house and thus discovered that about twilight it was her custom to promenade attended only by a negro in livery in a public square overlooked by her windows here amid the luxuriant and shadowing groves in the gray gloom of a sweet midsummer evening i observed my opportunity and accosted her the better to deceive the servant in attendance i did this with the assured air of an old and familiar acquaintance with a presence of mind truly parisian she took the cue at once and to greet me held out the most bewitchingly little of hands the valet at once fell into the rear and now with hearts full to overflowing we discoursed long and unreservedly of our love as madame lalande spoke english even less fluently than she wrote it our conversation was necessarily in french in this sweet tongue so adapted to passion i gave loose to the impetuous enthusiasm of my nature and with all the eloquence i could command besought her to consent to an immediate marriage at this impatience she smiled she urged the old story of decorumthat bugbear which deters so many from bliss until the opportunity for bliss has forever gone by i had most imprudently made it known among my friends she observed that i desired her acquaintancethus that i did not possess itthus again there was no possibility of concealing the date of our first knowledge of each other and then she adverted with a blush to the extreme recency of this date to wed immediately would be improperwould be indecorouswould be outré all this she said with a charming air of naïveté which enraptured while it grieved and convinced me she went even so far as to accuse me laughingly of rashnessof imprudence she bade me remember that i really even knew not who she waswhat were her prospects her connections her standing in society she begged me but with a sigh to reconsider my proposal and termed my love an infatuationa will o the wispa fancy or fantasy of the momenta baseless and unstable creation rather of the imagination than of the heart these things she uttered as the shadows of the sweet twilight gathered darkly and more darkly around usand then with a gentle pressure of her fairylike hand overthrew in a single sweet instant all the argumentative fabric she had reared i replied as best i couldas only a true lover can i spoke at length and perseveringly of my devotion of my passionof her exceeding beauty and of my own enthusiastic admiration in conclusion i dwelt with a convincing energy upon the perils that encompass the course of lovethat course of true love that never did run smoothand thus deduced the manifest danger of rendering that course unnecessarily long this latter argument seemed finally to soften the rigor of her determination she relented but there was yet an obstacle she said which she felt assured i had not properly considered this was a delicate pointfor a woman to urge especially so in mentioning it she saw that she must make a sacrifice of her feelings still for me every sacrifice should be made she alluded to the topic of age was i awarewas i fully aware of the discrepancy between us that the age of the husband should surpass by a few yearseven by fifteen or twentythe age of the wife was regarded by the world as admissible and indeed as even proper but she had always entertained the belief that the years of the wife should never exceed in number those of the husband a discrepancy of this unnatural kind gave rise too frequently alas to a life of unhappiness now she was aware that my own age did not exceed two and twenty and i on the contrary perhaps was not aware that the years of my eugénie extended very considerably beyond that sum about all this there was a nobility of soula dignity of candorwhich delightedwhich enchanted mewhich eternally riveted my chains i could scarcely restrain the excessive transport which possessed me my sweetest eugénie i cried what is all this about which you are discoursing your years surpass in some measure my own but what then the customs of the world are so many conventional follies to those who love as ourselves in what respect differs a year from an hour i am twentytwo you say granted indeed you may as well call me at once twentythree now you yourself my dearest eugénie can have numbered no more thancan have numbered no more thanno more thanthanthanthan here i paused for an instant in the expectation that madame lalande would interrupt me by supplying her true age but a frenchwoman is seldom direct and has always by way of answer to an embarrassing query some little practical reply of her own in the present instance eugénie who for a few moments past had seemed to be searching for something in her bosom at length let fall upon the grass a miniature which i immediately picked up and presented to her keep it she said with one of her most ravishing smiles keep it for my sakefor the sake of her whom it too flatteringly represents besides upon the back of the trinket you may discover perhaps the very information you seem to desire it is now to be sure growing rather darkbut you can examine it at your leisure in the morning in the meantime you shall be my escort home tonight my friends are about holding a little musical levée i can promise you too some good singing we french are not nearly so punctilious as you americans and i shall have no difficulty in smuggling you in in the character of an old acquaintance with this she took my arm and i attended her home the mansion was quite a fine one and i believe furnished in good taste of this latter point however i am scarcely qualified to judge for it was just dark as we arrived and in american mansions of the better sort lights seldom during the heat of summer make their appearance at this the most pleasant period of the day in about an hour after my arrival to be sure a single shaded solar lamp was lit in the principal drawingroom and this apartment i could thus see was arranged with unusual good taste and even splendor but two other rooms of the suite and in which the company chiefly assembled remained during the whole evening in a very agreeable shadow this is a wellconceived custom giving the party at least a choice of light or shade and one which our friends over the water could not do better than immediately adopt the evening thus spent was unquestionably the most delicious of my life madame lalande had not overrated the musical abilities of her friends and the singing i here heard i had never heard excelled in any private circle out of vienna the instrumental performers were many and of superior talents the vocalists were chiefly ladies and no individual sang less than well at length upon a peremptory call for madame lalande she arose at once without affectation or demur from the chaise longue upon which she had sat by my side and accompanied by one or two gentlemen and her female friend of the opera repaired to the piano in the main drawingroom i would have escorted her myself but felt that under the circumstances of my introduction to the house i had better remain unobserved where i was i was thus deprived of the pleasure of seeing although not of hearing her sing the impression she produced upon the company seemed electricalbut the effect upon myself was something even more i know not how adequately to describe it it arose in part no doubt from the sentiment of love with which i was imbued but chiefly from my conviction of the extreme sensibility of the singer it is beyond the reach of art to endow either air or recitative with more impassioned expression than was hers her utterance of the romance in otellothe tone with which she gave the words sul mio sasso in the capulettiis ringing in my memory yet her lower tones were absolutely miraculous her voice embraced three complete octaves extending from the contralto d to the d upper soprano and though sufficiently powerful to have filled the san carlos executed with the minutest precision every difficulty of vocal compositionascending and descending scales cadences or fiorituri in the finale of the sonnambula she brought about a most remarkable effect at the words ah non guinge uman pensiero al contento ondio son piena here in imitation of malibran she modified the original phrase of bellini so as to let her voice descend to the tenor g when by a rapid transition she struck the g above the treble stave springing over an interval of two octaves upon rising from the piano after these miracles of vocal execution she resumed her seat by my side when i expressed to her in terms of the deepest enthusiasm my delight at her performance of my surprise i said nothing and yet was i most unfeignedly surprised for a certain feebleness or rather a certain tremulous indecision of voice in ordinary conversation had prepared me to anticipate that in singing she would not acquit herself with any remarkable ability our conversation was now long earnest uninterrupted and totally unreserved she made me relate many of the earlier passages of my life and listened with breathless attention to every word of the narrative i concealed nothingfelt that i had a right to conceal nothingfrom her confiding affection encouraged by her candor upon the delicate point of her age i entered with perfect frankness not only into a detail of my many minor vices but made full confession of those moral and even of those physical infirmities the disclosure of which in demanding so much higher a degree of courage is so much surer an evidence of love i touched upon my college indiscretionsupon my extravagancesupon my carousalsupon my debtsupon my flirtations i even went so far as to speak of a slightly hectic cough with which at one time i had been troubledof a chronic rheumatismof a twinge of hereditary goutand in conclusion of the disagreeable and inconvenient but hitherto carefully concealed weakness of my eyes upon this latter point said madame lalande laughingly you have been surely injudicious in coming to confession for without the confession i take it for granted that no one would have accused you of the crime by the by she continued have you any recollection and here i fancied that a blush even through the gloom of the apartment became distinctly visible upon her cheekhave you any recollection mon cher ami of this little ocular assistant which now depends from my neck as she spoke she twirled in her fingers the identical double eyeglass which had so overwhelmed me with confusion at the opera full wellalas do i remember it i exclaimed pressing passionately the delicate hand which offered the glasses for my inspection they formed a complex and magnificent toy richly chased and filigreed and gleaming with jewels which even in the deficient light i could not help perceiving were of high value eh bien mon ami she resumed with a certain empressment of manner that rather surprised meeh bien mon ami you have earnestly besought of me a favor which you have been pleased to denominate priceless you have demanded of me my hand upon the morrow should i yield to your entreatiesand i may add to the pleadings of my own bosomwould i not be entitled to demand of you a verya very little boon in return name it i exclaimed with an energy that had nearly drawn upon us the observation of the company and restrained by their presence alone from throwing myself impetuously at her feet name it my beloved my eugénie my ownname itbut alas it is already yielded ere named you shall conquer then mon ami said she for the sake of the eugénie whom you love this little weakness which you have at last confessedthis weakness more moral than physicaland which let me assure you is so unbecoming the nobility of your real natureso inconsistent with the candor of your usual characterand which if permitted further control will assuredly involve you sooner or later in some very disagreeable scrape you shall conquer for my sake this affectation which leads you as you yourself acknowledge to the tacit or implied denial of your infirmity of vision for this infirmity you virtually deny in refusing to employ the customary means for its relief you will understand me to say then that i wish you to wear spectaclesah hushyou have already consented to wear them for my sake you shall accept the little toy which i now hold in my hand and which though admirable as an aid to vision is really of no very immense value as a gem you perceive that by a trifling modification thusor thusit can be adapted to the eyes in the form of spectacles or worn in the waistcoat pocket as an eyeglass it is in the former mode however and habitually that you have already consented to wear it for my sake this requestmust i confess itconfused me in no little degree but the condition with which it was coupled rendered hesitation of course a matter altogether out of the question it is done i cried with all the enthusiasm that i could muster at the moment it is doneit is most cheerfully agreed i sacrifice every feeling for your sake tonight i wear this dear eyeglass as an eyeglass and upon my heart but with the earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the pleasure of calling you wife i will place it upon myupon my noseand there wear it ever afterward in the less romantic and less fashionable but certainly in the more serviceable form which you desire our conversation now turned upon the details of our arrangements for the morrow talbot i learned from my betrothed had just arrived in town i was to see him at once and procure a carriage the soirée would scarcely break up before two and by this hour the vehicle was to be at the door when in the confusion occasioned by the departure of the company madame l could easily enter it unobserved we were then to call at the house of a clergyman who would be in waiting there be married drop talbot and proceed on a short tour to the east leaving the fashionable world at home to make whatever comments upon the matter it thought best having planned all this i immediately took leave and went in search of talbot but on the way i could not refrain from stepping into a hotel for the purpose of inspecting the miniature and this i did by the powerful aid of the glasses the countenance was a surpassingly beautiful one those large luminous eyesthat proud grecian nosethose dark luxuriant curlsah said i exultingly to myself this is indeed the speaking image of my beloved i turned the reverse and discovered the wordseugénie lalandeaged twentyseven years and seven months i found talbot at home and proceeded at once to acquaint him with my good fortune he professed excessive astonishment of course but congratulated me most cordially and proffered every assistance in his power in a word we carried out our arrangement to the letter and at two in the morning just ten minutes after the ceremony i found myself in a close carriage with madame lalandewith mrs simpson i should sayand driving at a great rate out of town in a direction northeast by north halfnorth it had been determined for us by talbot that as we were to be up all night we should make our first stop at c a village about twenty miles from the city and there get an early breakfast and some repose before proceeding upon our route at four precisely therefore the carriage drew up at the door of the principal inn i handed my adored wife out and ordered breakfast forthwith in the meantime we were shown into a small parlor and sat down it was now nearly if not altogether daylight and as i gazed enraptured at the angel by my side the singular idea came all at once into my head that this was really the very first moment since my acquaintance with the celebrated loveliness of madame lalande that i had enjoyed a near inspection of that loveliness by daylight at all and now mon ami said she taking my hand and so interrupting this train of reflection and now mon cher ami since we are indissolubly onesince i have yielded to your passionate entreaties and performed my portion of our agreementi presume you have not forgotten that you also have a little favor to bestowa little promise which it is your intention to keep ah let me see let me remember yes full easily do i call to mind the precise words of the dear promise you made to eugénie last night listen you spoke thus it is doneit is most cheerfully agreed i sacrifice every feeling for your sake tonight i wear this dear eyeglass as an eyeglass and upon my heart but with the earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the privilege of calling you wife i will place it upon myupon my noseand there wear it ever afterward in the less romantic and less fashionable but certainly in the more serviceable form which you desire these were the exact words my beloved husband were they not they were i said you have an excellent memory and assuredly my beautiful eugénie there is no disposition on my part to evade the performance of the trivial promise they imply see behold they are becomingratherare they not and here having arranged the glasses in the ordinary form of spectacles i applied them gingerly in their proper position while madame simpson adjusting her cap and folding her arms sat bolt upright in her chair in a somewhat stiff and prim and indeed in a somewhat undignified position goodness gracious me i exclaimed almost at the very instant that the rim of the spectacles had settled upon my nosemy goodness gracious mewhy what can be the matter with these glasses and taking them quickly off i wiped them carefully with a silk handkerchief and adjusted them again but if in the first instance there had occurred something which occasioned me surprise in the second this surprise became elevated into astonishment and this astonishment was profoundwas extremeindeed i may say it was horrific what in the name of everything hideous did this mean could i believe my eyescould ithat was the question was thatwas thatwas that rouge and were thoseand were thosewere those wrinkles upon the visage of eugénie lalande and oh jupiter and every one of the gods and goddesses little and big whatwhatwhatwhat had become of her teeth i dashed the spectacles violently to the ground and leaping to my feet stood erect in the middle of the floor confronting mrs simpson with my arms set akimbo and grinning and foaming but at the same time utterly speechless with terror and with rage now i have already said that madame eugénie lalandethat is to say simpsonspoke the english language but very little better than she wrote it and for this reason she very properly never attempted to speak it upon ordinary occasions but rage will carry a lady to any extreme and in the present case it carried mrs simpson to the very extraordinary extreme of attempting to hold a conversation in a tongue that she did not altogether understand vell monsieur said she after surveying me in great apparent astonishment for some momentsvell monsieurand vat denvat de matter

say dat dat too is not von ver respectable name either the length or the nature of this speech had the effect of working up mrs simpson into a very extraordinary passion indeed and as she made an end of it with great labor she jumped up from her chair like somebody bewitched dropping upon the floor an entire universe of bustle as she jumped once upon her feet she gnashed her gums brandished her arms rolled up her sleeves shook her fist in my face and concluded the performance by tearing the cap from her head and with it an immense wig of the most valuable and beautiful black hair the whole of which she dashed upon the ground with a yell and there trampled and danced a fandango upon it in an absolute ecstasy and agony of rage meantime i sank aghast into the chair which she had vacated moissart and voissart i repeated thoughtfully as she cut one of her pigeonwings and croissart and froissart as she completed anothermoissart and voissart and croissart and napoleon bonaparte froissartwhy you ineffable old serpent thats methats medye hear thats mehere i screamed at the top of my voicethats meee i am napoleon bonaparte froissart and if i havent married my great great grandmother i wish i may be everlastingly confounded madame eugénie lalande quasi simpsonformerly moissartwas in sober fact my great great grandmother in her youth she had been beautiful and even at eightytwo retained the majestic height the sculptural contour of head the fine eyes and the grecian nose of her girlhood by the aid of these of pearlpowder of rouge of false hair false teeth and false tournure as well as of the most skilful modistes of paris she contrived to hold a respectable footing among the beauties en peu passées of the french metropolis in this respect indeed she might have been regarded as little less than the equal of the celebrated ninon de lenclos she was immensely wealthy and being left for the second time a widow without children she bethought herself of my existence in america and for the purpose of making me her heir paid a visit to the united states in company with a distant and exceedingly lovely relative of her second husbandsa madame stephanie lalande at the opera my great great grandmothers attention was arrested by my notice and upon surveying me through her eyeglass she was struck with a certain family resemblance to herself thus interested and knowing that the heir she sought was actually in the city she made inquiries of her party respecting me the gentleman who attended her knew my person and told her who i was the information thus obtained induced her to renew her scrutiny and this scrutiny it was which so emboldened me that i behaved in the absurd manner already detailed she returned my bow however under the impression that by some odd accident i had discovered her identity when deceived by my weakness of vision and the arts of the toilet in respect to the age and charms of the strange lady i demanded so enthusiastically of talbot who she was he concluded that i meant the younger beauty as a matter of course and so informed me with perfect truth that she was the celebrated widow madame lalande in the street next morning my great great grandmother encountered talbot an old parisian acquaintance and the conversation very naturally turned upon myself my deficiencies of vision were then explained for these were notorious although i was entirely ignorant of their notoriety and my good old relative discovered much to her chagrin that she had been deceived in supposing me aware of her identity and that i had been merely making a fool of myself in making open love in a theatre to an old woman unknown by way of punishing me for this imprudence she concocted with talbot a plot he purposely kept out of my way to avoid giving me the introduction my street inquiries about the lovely widow madame lalande were supposed to refer to the younger lady of course and thus the conversation with the three gentlemen whom i encountered shortly after leaving talbots hotel will be easily explained as also their allusion to ninon de lenclos i had no opportunity of seeing madame lalande closely during daylight and at her musical soirée my silly weakness in refusing the aid of glasses effectually prevented me from making a discovery of her age when madame lalande was called upon to sing the younger lady was intended and it was she who arose to obey the call my great great grandmother to further the deception arising at the same moment and accompanying her to the piano in the main drawingroom had i decided upon escorting her thither it had been her design to suggest the propriety of my remaining where i was but my own prudential views rendered this unnecessary the songs which i so much admired and which so confirmed my impression of the youth of my mistress were executed by madame stephanie lalande the eyeglass was presented by way of adding a reproof to the hoaxa sting to the epigram of the deception its presentation afforded an opportunity for the lecture upon affectation with which i was so especially edified it is almost superfluous to add that the glasses of the instrument as worn by the old lady had been exchanged by her for a pair better adapted to my years they suited me in fact to a t the clergyman who merely pretended to tie the fatal knot was a boon companion of talbots and no priest he was an excellent whip however and having doffed his cassock to put on a greatcoat he drove the hack which conveyed the happy couple out of town talbot took a seat at his side the two scoundrels were thus in at the death and through a halfopen window of the back parlor of the inn amused themselves in grinning at the dénouement of the drama i believe i shall be forced to call them both out nevertheless i am not the husband of my great great grandmother and this is a reflection which affords me infinite reliefbut i am the husband of madame lalandeof madame stephanie lalandewith whom my good old relative besides making me her sole heir when she diesif she ever doeshas been at the trouble of concocting me a match in conclusion i am done forever with billets doux and am never to be met without spectacles the system of doctor tarr and professor fether during the autumn of while on a tour through the extreme southern provinces of france my route led me within a few miles of a certain maison de santé or private madhouse about which i had heard much in paris from my medical friends as i had never visited a place of the kind i thought the opportunity too good to be lost and so proposed to my travelling companion a gentleman with whom i had made casual acquaintance a few days before that we should turn aside for an hour or so and look through the establishment to this he objectedpleading haste in the first place and in the second a very usual horror at the sight of a lunatic he begged of me however not to let any mere courtesy toward himself interfere with the gratification of my curiosity and said that he would ride on leisurely so that i might overtake him during the day or at all events during the next as he bade me goodbye i bethought me that there might be some difficulty in obtaining access to the premises and mentioned my fears on this point he replied that in fact unless i had personal knowledge of the superintendent monsieur maillard or some credential in the way of a letter a difficulty might be found to exist as the regulations of these private madhouses were more rigid than the public hospital laws for himself he added he had some years since made the acquaintance of maillard and would so far assist me as to ride up to the door and introduce me although his feelings on the subject of lunacy would not permit of his entering the house i thanked him and turning from the main road we entered a grassgrown bypath which in half an hour nearly lost itself in a dense forest clothing the base of a mountain through this dank and gloomy wood we rode some two miles when the maison de santé came in view it was a fantastic château much dilapidated and indeed scarcely tenantable through age and neglect its aspect inspired me with absolute dread and checking my horse i half resolved to turn back i soon however grew ashamed of my weakness and proceeded as we rode up to the gateway i perceived it slightly open and the visage of a man peering through in an instant afterward this man came forth accosted my companion by name shook him cordially by the hand and begged him to alight it was monsieur maillard himself he was a portly finelooking gentleman of the old school with a polished manner and a certain air of gravity dignity and authority which was very impressive my friend having presented me mentioned my desire to inspect the establishment and received monsieur maillards assurance that he would show me all attention now took leave and i saw him no more when he had gone the superintendent ushered me into a small and exceedingly neat parlor containing among other indications of refined taste many books drawings pots of flowers and musical instruments a cheerful fire blazed upon the hearth at a piano singing an aria from bellini sat a young and very beautiful woman who at my entrance paused in her song and received me with graceful courtesy her voice was low and her whole manner subdued i thought too that i perceived the traces of sorrow in her countenance which was excessively although to my taste not unpleasingly pale she was attired in deep mourning and excited in my bosom a feeling of mingled respect interest and admiration i had heard at paris that the institution of monsieur maillard was managed upon what is vulgarly termed the system of soothingthat all punishments were avoidedthat even confinement was seldom resorted tothat the patients while secretly watched were left much apparent liberty and that most of them were permitted to roam about the house and grounds in the ordinary apparel of persons in right mind keeping these impressions in view i was cautious in what i said before the young lady for i could not be sure that she was sane and in fact there was a certain restless brilliancy about her eyes which half led me to imagine she was not i confined my remarks therefore to general topics and to such as i thought would not be displeasing or exciting even to a lunatic she replied in a perfectly rational manner to all that i said and even her original observations were marked with the soundest good sense but a long acquaintance with the metaphysics of mania had taught me to put no faith in such evidence of sanity and i continued to practise throughout the interview the caution with which i commenced it presently a smart footman in livery brought in a tray with fruit wine and other refreshments of which i partook the lady soon afterward leaving the room as she departed i turned my eyes in an inquiring manner toward my host no he said oh noa member of my familymy niece and a most accomplished woman i beg a thousand pardons for the suspicion i replied but of course you will know how to excuse me the excellent administration of your affairs here is well understood in paris and i thought it just possible you know yes yessay no moreor rather it is myself who should thank you for the commendable prudence you have displayed we seldom find so much of forethought in young men and more than once some unhappy contretemps has occurred in consequence of thoughtlessness on the part of our visitors while my former system was in operation and my patients were permitted the privilege of roaming to and fro at will they were often aroused to a dangerous frenzy by injudicious persons who called to inspect the house hence i was obliged to enforce a rigid system of exclusion and none obtained access to the premises upon whose discretion i could not rely while your former system was in operation i said repeating his wordsdo i understand you then to say that the soothing system of which i have heard so much is no longer in force it is now he replied several weeks since we have concluded to renounce it forever indeed you astonish me we found it sir he said with a sigh absolutely necessary to return to the old usages the danger of the soothing system was at all times appalling and its advantages have been much overrated i believe sir that in this house it has been given a fair trial if ever in any we did every thing that rational humanity could suggest i am sorry that you could not have paid us a visit at an earlier period that you might have judged for yourself but i presume you are conversant with the soothing practicewith its details not altogether what i have heard has been at third or fourth hand i may state the system then in general terms as one in which the patients were menagéshumored we contradicted no fancies which entered the brains of the mad on the contrary we not only indulged but encouraged them and many of our most permanent cures have been thus effected there is no argument which so touches the feeble reason of the madman as the reductio ad absurdum we have had men for example who fancied themselves chickens the cure was to insist upon the thing as a factto accuse the patient of stupidity in not sufficiently perceiving it to be a factand thus to refuse him any other diet for a week than that which properly appertains to a chicken in this manner a little corn and gravel were made to perform wonders but was this species of acquiescence all by no means we put much faith in amusements of a simple kind such as music dancing gymnastic exercises generally cards certain classes of books and so forth we affected to treat each individual as if for some ordinary physical disorder and the word lunacy was never employed a great point was to set each lunatic to guard the actions of all the others to repose confidence in the understanding or discretion of a madman is to gain him body and soul in this way we were enabled to dispense with an expensive body of keepers and you had no punishments of any kind none and you never confined your patients very rarely now and then the malady of some individual growing to a crisis or taking a sudden turn of fury we conveyed him to a secret cell lest his disorder should infect the rest and there kept him until we could dismiss him to his friendsfor with the raging maniac we have nothing to do he is usually removed to the public hospitals and you have now changed all thisand you think for the better decidedly the system had its disadvantages and even its dangers it is now happily exploded throughout all the maisons de santé of france i am very much surprised i said at what you tell me for i made sure that at this moment no other method of treatment for mania existed in any portion of the country you are young yet my friend replied my host but the time will arrive when you will learn to judge for yourself of what is going on in the world without trusting to the gossip of others believe nothing you hear and only onehalf that you see now about our maisons de santé it is clear that some ignoramus has misled you after dinner however when you have sufficiently recovered from the fatigue of your ride i will be happy to take you over the house and introduce to you a system which in my opinion and in that of every one who has witnessed its operation is incomparably the most effectual as yet devised your own i inquiredone of your own invention i am proud he replied to acknowledge that it isat least in some measure in this manner i conversed with monsieur maillard for an hour or two during which he showed me the gardens and conservatories of the place i cannot let you see my patients he said just at present to a sensitive mind there is always more or less of the shocking in such exhibitions and i do not wish to spoil your appetite for dinner we will dine i can give you some veal à la menehoult with cauliflowers in velouté sauceafter that a glass of clos de vougeôtthen your nerves will be sufficiently steadied at six dinner was announced and my host conducted me into a large salle à manger where a very numerous company were assembledtwentyfive or thirty in all they were apparently people of rankcertainly of high breedingalthough their habiliments i thought were extravagantly rich partaking somewhat too much of the ostentatious finery of the vielle cour i noticed that at least two thirds of these guests were ladies and some of the latter were by no means accoutred in what a parisian would consider good taste at the present day many females for example whose age could not have been less than seventy were bedecked with a profusion of jewelry such as rings bracelets and earrings and wore their bosoms and arms shamefully bare i observed too that very few of the dresses were well madeor at least that very few of them fitted the wearers in looking about i discovered the interesting girl to whom monsieur maillard had presented me in the little parlor but my surprise was great to see her wearing a hoop and farthingale with highheeled shoes and a dirty cap of brussels lace so much too large for her that it gave her face a ridiculously diminutive expression when i had first seen her she was attired most becomingly in deep mourning there was an air of oddity in short about the dress of the whole party which at first caused me to recur to my original idea of the soothing system and to fancy that monsieur maillard had been willing to deceive me until after dinner that i might experience no uncomfortable feelings during the repast at finding myself dining with lunatics but i remembered having been informed in paris that the southern provincialists were a peculiarly eccentric people with a vast number of antiquated notions and then too upon conversing with several members of the company my apprehensions were immediately and fully dispelled the diningroom itself although perhaps sufficiently comfortable and of good dimensions had nothing too much of elegance about it for example the floor was uncarpeted in france however a carpet is frequently dispensed with the windows too were without curtains the shutters being shut were securely fastened with iron bars applied diagonally after the fashion of our ordinary shopshutters the apartment i observed formed in itself a wing of the château and thus the windows were on three sides of the parallelogram the door being at the other there were no less than ten windows in all the table was superbly set out it was loaded with plate and more than loaded with delicacies the profusion was absolutely barbaric there were meats enough to have feasted the anakim never in all my life had i witnessed so lavish so wasteful an expenditure of the good things of life there seemed very little taste however in the arrangements and my eyes accustomed to quiet lights were sadly offended by the prodigious glare of a multitude of wax candles which in silver candelabra were deposited upon the table and all about the room wherever it was possible to find a place there were several active servants in attendance and upon a large table at the farther end of the apartment were seated seven or eight people with fiddles fifes trombones and a drum these fellows annoyed me very much at intervals during the repast by an infinite variety of noises which were intended for music and which appeared to afford much entertainment to all present with the exception of myself upon the whole i could not help thinking that there was much of the bizarre about every thing i sawbut then the world is made up of all kinds of persons with all modes of thought and all sorts of conventional customs i had travelled too so much as to be quite an adept at the nil admirari so i took my seat very coolly at the right hand of my host and having an excellent appetite did justice to the good cheer set before me the conversation in the meantime was spirited and general the ladies as usual talked a great deal i soon found that nearly all the company were well educated and my host was a world of goodhumored anecdote in himself he seemed quite willing to speak of his position as superintendent of a maison de santé and indeed the topic of lunacy was much to my surprise a favorite one with all present a great many amusing stories were told having reference to the whims of the patients we had a fellow here once said a fat little gentleman who sat at my righta fellow that fancied himself a teapot and by the way is it not especially singular how often this particular crotchet has entered the brain of the lunatic there is scarcely an insane asylum in france which cannot supply a human teapot our gentleman was a britanniaware teapot and was careful to polish himself every morning with buckskin and whiting and then said a tall man just opposite we had here not long ago a person who had taken it into his head that he was a donkeywhich allegorically speaking you will say was quite true he was a troublesome patient and we had much ado to keep him within bounds for a long time he would eat nothing but thistles but of this idea we soon cured him by insisting upon his eating nothing else then he was perpetually kicking out his heelssoso mr de kock i will thank you to behave yourself here interrupted an old lady who sat next to the speaker please keep your feet to yourself you have spoiled my brocade is it necessary pray to illustrate a remark in so practical a style our friend here can surely comprehend you without all this upon my word you are nearly as great a donkey as the poor unfortunate imagined himself your acting is very natural as i live mille pardons mamselle replied monsieur de kock thus addresseda thousand pardons i had no intention of offending mamselle laplacemonsieur de kock will do himself the honor of taking wine with you here monsieur de kock bowed low kissed his hand with much ceremony and took wine with mamselle laplace allow me mon ami now said monsieur maillard addressing myself allow me to send you a morsel of this veal à la st menhoultyou will find it particularly fine at this instant three sturdy waiters had just succeeded in depositing safely upon the table an enormous dish or trencher containing what i supposed to be the monstrum horrendum informe ingens cui lumen ademptum a closer scrutiny assured me however that it was only a small calf roasted whole and set upon its knees with an apple in its mouth as is the english fashion of dressing a hare thank you no i replied to say the truth i am not particularly partial to veal à la stwhat is itfor i do not find that it altogether agrees with me i will change my plate however and try some of the rabbit there were several sidedishes on the table containing what appeared to be the ordinary french rabbita very delicious morceau which i can recommend pierre cried the host change this gentlemans plate and give him a sidepiece of this rabbit auchat this what said i this rabbit auchat why thank youupon second thoughts no i will just help myself to some of the ham there is no knowing what one eats thought i to myself at the tables of these people of the province i will have none of their rabbit auchatand for the matter of that none of their cataurabbit either and then said a cadaverous looking personage near the foot of the table taking up the thread of the conversation where it had been broken offand then among other oddities we had a patient once upon a time who very pertinaciously maintained himself to be a cordova cheese and went about with a knife in his hand soliciting his friends to try a small slice from the middle of his leg he was a great fool beyond doubt interposed some one but not to be compared with a certain individual whom we all know with the exception of this strange gentleman i mean the man who took himself for a bottle of champagne and always went off with a pop and a fizz in this fashion here the speaker very rudely as i thought put his right thumb in his left cheek withdrew it with a sound resembling the popping of a cork and then by a dexterous movement of the tongue upon the teeth created a sharp hissing and fizzing which lasted for several minutes in imitation of the frothing of champagne this behavior i saw plainly was not very pleasing to monsieur maillard but that gentleman said nothing and the conversation was resumed by a very lean little man in a big wig and then there was an ignoramus said he who mistook himself for a frog which by the way he resembled in no little degree i wish you could have seen him sirhere the speaker addressed myselfit would have done your heart good to see the natural airs that he put on sir if that man was not a frog i can only observe that it is a pity he was not his croak thusooooghoooogh was the finest note in the worldb flat and when he put his elbows upon the table thusafter taking a glass or two of wineand distended his mouth thus and rolled up his eyes thus and winked them with excessive rapidity thus why then sir i take it upon myself to say positively that you would have been lost in admiration of the genius of the man i have no doubt of it i said and then said somebody else then there was petit gaillard who thought himself a pinch of snuff and was truly distressed because he could not take himself between his own finger and thumb and then there was jules desoulières who was a very singular genius indeed and went mad with the idea that he was a pumpkin he persecuted the cook to make him up into piesa thing which the cook indignantly refused to do for my part i am by no means sure that a pumpkin pie à la desoulières would not have been very capital eating indeed you astonish me said i and i looked inquisitively at monsieur maillard ha ha ha said that gentlemanhe he hehi hi hiho ho hohu hu hu huvery good indeed you must not be astonished mon ami our friend here is a wita drôleyou must not understand him to the letter and then said some other one of the partythen there was bouffon le grandanother extraordinary personage in his way he grew deranged through love and fancied himself possessed of two heads one of these he maintained to be the head of cicero the other he imagined a composite one being demosthenes from the top of the forehead to the mouth and lord broughams from the mouth to the chin it is not impossible that he was wrong but he would have convinced you of his being in the right for he was a man of great eloquence he had an absolute passion for oratory and could not refrain from display for example he used to leap upon the dinnertable thus andand here a friend at the side of the speaker put a hand upon his shoulder and whispered a few words in his ear upon which he ceased talking with great suddenness and sank back within his chair and then said the friend who had whispered there was boullard the teetotum i call him the teetotum because in fact he was seized with the droll but not altogether irrational crotchet that he had been converted into a teetotum you would have roared with laughter to see him spin he would turn round upon one heel by the hour in this mannerso here the friend whom he had just interrupted by a whisper performed an exactly similar office for himself but then cried the old lady at the top of her voice your monsieur boullard was a madman and a very silly madman at best for who allow me to ask you ever heard of a human teetotum the thing is absurd madame joyeuse was a more sensible person as you know she had a crotchet but it was instinct with common sense and gave pleasure to all who had the honor of her acquaintance she found upon mature deliberation that by some accident she had been turned into a chickencock but as such she behaved with propriety she flapped her wings with prodigious effectsosoand as for her crow it was delicious cockadoodledoocockadoodledoocockadoodlededoo dooodooooooo madame joyeuse i will thank you to behave yourself here interrupted our host very angrily you can either conduct yourself as a lady should do or you can quit the table forthwithtake your choice the lady whom i was much astonished to hear addressed as madame joyeuse after the description of madame joyeuse she had just given blushed up to the eyebrows and seemed exceedingly abashed at the reproof she hung down her head and said not a syllable in reply but another and younger lady resumed the theme it was my beautiful girl of the little parlor oh madame joyeuse was a fool she exclaimed but there was really much sound sense after all in the opinion of eugénie salsafette she was a very beautiful and painfully modest young lady who thought the ordinary mode of habiliment indecent and wished to dress herself always by getting outside instead of inside of her clothes it is a thing very easily done after all you have only to do soand then sososoand then sososoand then mon dieu mamselle salsafette here cried a dozen voices at once what are you aboutforbearthat is sufficientwe see very plainly how it is donehold hold and several persons were already leaping from their seats to withhold mamselle salsafette from putting herself upon a par with the medicean venus when the point was very effectually and suddenly accomplished by a series of loud screams or yells from some portion of the main body of the château my nerves were very much affected indeed by these yells but the rest of the company i really pitied i never saw any set of reasonable people so thoroughly frightened in my life they all grew as pale as so many corpses and shrinking within their seats sat quivering and gibbering with terror and listening for a repetition of the sound it came againlouder and seemingly nearerand then a third time very loud and then a fourth time with a vigor evidently diminished at this apparent dying away of the noise the spirits of the company were immediately regained and all was life and anecdote as before i now ventured to inquire the cause of the disturbance a mere bagtelle said monsieur maillard we are used to these things and care really very little about them the lunatics every now and then get up a howl in concert one starting another as is sometimes the case with a bevy of dogs at night it occasionally happens however that the concerto yells are succeeded by a simultaneous effort at breaking loose when of course some little danger is to be apprehended and how many have you in charge at present we have not more than ten altogether principally females i presume oh noevery one of them men and stout fellows too i can tell you indeed i have always understood that the majority of lunatics were of the gentler sex it is generally so but not always some time ago there were about twentyseven patients here and of that number no less than eighteen were women but lately matters have changed very much as you see yeshave changed very much as you see here interrupted the gentleman who had broken the shins of mamselle laplace yeshave changed very much as you see chimed in the whole company at once hold your tongues every one of you said my host in a great rage whereupon the whole company maintained a dead silence for nearly a minute as for one lady she obeyed monsieur maillard to the letter and thrusting out her tongue which was an excessively long one held it very resignedly with both hands until the end of the entertainment and this gentlewoman said i to monsieur maillard bending over and addressing him in a whisperthis good lady who has just spoken and who gives us the cockadoodlededooshe i presume is harmlessquite harmless eh harmless ejaculated he in unfeigned surprise whywhy what can you mean only slightly touched said i touching my head i take it for granted that she is not particularlynot dangerously affected eh mon dieu what is it you imagine this lady my particular old friend madame joyeuse is as absolutely sane as myself she has her little eccentricities to be surebut then you know all old womenall very old womenare more or less eccentric to be sure said ito be sureand then the rest of these ladies and gentlemen are my friends and keepers interrupted monsieur maillard drawing himself up with hauteurmy very good friends and assistants what all of them i askedthe women and all assuredly he saidwe could not do at all without the women they are the best lunatic nurses in the world they have a way of their own you know their bright eyes have a marvellous effectsomething like the fascination of the snake you know to be sure said ito be sure they behave a little odd ehthey are a little queer ehdont you think so oddqueerwhy do you really think so we are not very prudish to be sure here in the southdo pretty much as we pleaseenjoy life and all that sort of thing you know to be sure said ito be sure and then perhaps this clos de vougeôt is a little heady you knowa little strongyou understand eh to be sure said ito be sure by the by monsieur did i understand you to say that the system you have adopted in place of the celebrated soothing system was one of very rigorous severity by no means our confinement is necessarily close but the treatmentthe medical treatment i meanis rather agreeable to the patients than otherwise and the new system is one of your own invention not altogether some portions of it are referable to professor tarr of whom you have necessarily heard and again there are modifications in my plan which i am happy to acknowledge as belonging of right to the celebrated fether with whom if i mistake not you have the honor of an intimate acquaintance i am quite ashamed to confess i replied that i have never even heard the names of either gentleman before good heavens ejaculated my host drawing back his chair abruptly and uplifting his hands i surely do not hear you aright you did not intend to say eh that you had never heard either of the learned doctor tarr or of the celebrated professor fether i am forced to acknowledge my ignorance i replied but the truth should be held inviolate above all things nevertheless i feel humbled to the dust not to be acquainted with the works of these no doubt extraordinary men i will seek out their writings forthwith and peruse them with deliberate care monsieur maillard you have reallyi must confess ityou have reallymade me ashamed of myself and this was the fact say no more my good young friend he said kindly pressing my handjoin me now in a glass of sauterne we drank the company followed our example without stint they chattedthey jestedthey laughedthey perpetrated a thousand absurditiesthe fiddles shriekedthe drum rowdedowedthe trombones bellowed like so many brazen bulls of phalarisand the whole scene growing gradually worse and worse as the wines gained the ascendancy became at length a sort of pandemonium in petto in the meantime monsieur maillard and myself with some bottles of sauterne and vougeôt between us continued our conversation at the top of the voice a word spoken in an ordinary key stood no more chance of being heard than the voice of a fish from the bottom of niagara falls and sir said i screaming in his ear you mentioned something before dinner about the danger incurred in the old system of soothing how is that yes he replied there was occasionally very great danger indeed there is no accounting for the caprices of madmen and in my opinion as well as in that of dr tarr and professor fether it is never safe to permit them to run at large unattended a lunatic may be soothed as it is called for a time but in the end he is very apt to become obstreperous his cunning too is proverbial and great if he has a project in view he conceals his design with a marvellous wisdom and the dexterity with which he counterfeits sanity presents to the metaphysician one of the most singular problems in the study of mind when a madman appears thoroughly sane indeed it is high time to put him in a straitjacket but the danger my dear sir of which you were speakingin your own experienceduring your control of this househave you had practical reason to think liberty hazardous in the case of a lunatic herein my own experiencewhy i may say yes for exampleno very long while ago a singular circumstance occurred in this very house the soothing system you know was then in operation and the patients were at large they behaved remarkably wellespecially soany one of sense might have known that some devilish scheme was brewing from that particular fact that the fellows behaved so remarkably well and sure enough one fine morning the keepers found themselves pinioned hand and foot and thrown into the cells where they were attended as if they were the lunatics by the lunatics themselves who had usurped the offices of the keepers you dont tell me so i never heard of any thing so absurd in my life factit all came to pass by means of a stupid fellowa lunaticwho by some means had taken it into his head that he had invented a better system of government than any ever heard of beforeof lunatic government i mean he wished to give his invention a trial i suppose and so he persuaded the rest of the patients to join him in a conspiracy for the overthrow of the reigning powers and he really succeeded no doubt of it the keepers and kept were soon made to exchange places not that exactly either for the madmen had been free but the keepers were shut up in cells forthwith and treated i am sorry to say in a very cavalier manner but i presume a counterrevolution was soon effected this condition of things could not have long existed the country people in the neighborhoodvisitors coming to see the establishmentwould have given the alarm there you are out the head rebel was too cunning for that he admitted no visitors at allwith the exception one day of a very stupidlooking young gentleman of whom he had no reason to be afraid he let him in to see the placejust by way of varietyto have a little fun with him as soon as he had gammoned him sufficiently he let him out and sent him about his business and how long then did the madmen reign oh a very long time indeeda month certainlyhow much longer i cant precisely say in the meantime the lunatics had a jolly season of itthat you may swear they doffed their own shabby clothes and made free with the family wardrobe and jewels the cellars of the château were well stocked with wine and these madmen are just the devils that know how to drink it they lived well i can tell you and the treatmentwhat was the particular species of treatment which the leader of the rebels put into operation why as for that a madman is not necessarily a fool as i have already observed and it is my honest opinion that his treatment was a much better treatment than that which it superseded it was a very capital system indeedsimpleneatno trouble at allin fact it was deliciousit was here my hosts observations were cut short by another series of yells of the same character as those which had previously disconcerted us this time however they seemed to proceed from persons rapidly approaching gracious heavens i ejaculatedthe lunatics have most undoubtedly broken loose i very much fear it is so replied monsieur maillard now becoming excessively pale he had scarcely finished the sentence before loud shouts and imprecations were heard beneath the windows and immediately afterward it became evident that some persons outside were endeavoring to gain entrance into the room the door was beaten with what appeared to be a sledgehammer and the shutters were wrenched and shaken with prodigious violence a scene of the most terrible confusion ensued monsieur maillard to my excessive astonishment threw himself under the sideboard i had expected more resolution at his hands the members of the orchestra who for the last fifteen minutes had been seemingly too much intoxicated to do duty now sprang all at once to their feet and to their instruments and scrambling upon their table broke out with one accord into yankee doodle which they performed if not exactly in tune at least with an energy superhuman during the whole of the uproar meantime upon the main diningtable among the bottles and glasses leaped the gentleman who with such difficulty had been restrained from leaping there before as soon as he fairly settled himself he commenced an oration which no doubt was a very capital one if it could only have been heard at the same moment the man with the teetotum predilection set himself to spinning around the apartment with immense energy and with arms outstretched at right angles with his body so that he had all the air of a teetotum in fact and knocked everybody down that happened to get in his way and now too hearing an incredible popping and fizzing of champagne i discovered at length that it proceeded from the person who performed the bottle of that delicate drink during dinner and then again the frogman croaked away as if the salvation of his soul depended upon every note that he uttered and in the midst of all this the continuous braying of a donkey arose over all as for my old friend madame joyeuse i really could have wept for the poor lady she appeared so terribly perplexed all she did however was to stand up in a corner by the fireplace and sing out incessantly at the top of her voice cockadoodlededooooooh and now came the climaxthe catastrophe of the drama as no resistance beyond whooping and yelling and cockadoodling was offered to the encroachments of the party without the ten windows were very speedily and almost simultaneously broken in but i shall never forget the emotions of wonder and horror with which i gazed when leaping through these windows and down among us pêlemêle fighting stamping scratching and howling there rushed a perfect army of what i took to be chimpanzees ourangoutangs or big black baboons of the cape of good hope i received a terrible beatingafter which i rolled under a sofa and lay still after lying there some fifteen minutes however during which time i listened with all my ears to what was going on in the room i came to some satisfactory dénouement of this tragedy monsieur maillard it appeared in giving me the account of the lunatic who had excited his fellows to rebellion had been merely relating his own exploits this gentleman had indeed some two or three years before been the superintendent of the establishment but grew crazy himself and so became a patient this fact was unknown to the travelling companion who introduced me the keepers ten in number having been suddenly overpowered were first well tarred then carefully feathered and then shut up in underground cells they had been so imprisoned for more than a month during which period monsieur maillard had generously allowed them not only the tar and feathers which constituted his system but some bread and abundance of water the latter was pumped on them daily at length one escaping through a sewer gave freedom to all the rest the soothing system with important modifications has been resumed at the château yet i cannot help agreeing with monsieur maillard that his own treatment was a very capital one of its kind as he justly observed it was simpleneatand gave no trouble at allnot the least i have only to add that although i have searched every library in europe for the works of doctor tarr and professor fether i have up to the present day utterly failed in my endeavors to procure a copy ii poems the raven once upon a midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping as of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door tis some visitor i muttered tapping at my chamber door only this and nothing moreah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor eagerly i wished the morrowvainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost lenore for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore nameless here for evermoreand the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door this it is and nothing more presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer sir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping and so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door that i scarce was sure i heard youhere i opened wide the door darkness there and nothing moredeep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering fearing doubting dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before but the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore merely this and nothing moreback into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning soon again i heard a tapping something louder than before surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore tis the wind and nothing moreopen here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore not the least obeisance made he not an instant stopped or stayed he but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door perched and sat and nothing morethen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no craven ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore quoth the raven nevermoremuch i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door with such name as nevermorebut the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only that one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour nothing farther then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown before on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before then the bird said nevermorestartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore of nevernevermore but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore meant in croaking nevermorethis i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining on the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer she shall press ah nevermorethen methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor wretch i cried thy god hath lent theeby these angels he hath sent thee respiterespite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore quoth the raven nevermoreprophet said i thing of evilprophet still if bird or devil whether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted on this home by horror hauntedtell me truly i implore is thereis there balm in gileadtell metell me i implore quoth the raven nevermore prophet said i thing of evilprophet still if bird or devil by that heaven that bends above usby that god we both adore tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant aidenn it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore quoth the raven nevermorebe that word our sign of parting bird or fiend i shrieked upstarting get thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken leave my loneliness unbrokenquit the bust above my door take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door quoth the raven nevermoreand the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be liftednevermore to helen i saw thee onceonce onlyyears ago i must not say how manybut not many it was a july midnight and from out a fullorbed moon that like thine own soul soaring sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven there fell a silverysilken veil of light with quietude and sultriness and slumber upon the upturned faces of a thousand roses that grew in an enchanted garden where no wind dared to stir unless on tiptoe fell on the upturnd faces of these roses that gave out in return for the lovelight their odorous souls in an ecstatic death fell on the upturnd faces of these roses that smiled and died in this parterre enchanted by thee and by the poetry of thy presenceclad all in white upon a violet bank i saw thee half reclining while the moon fell on the upturnd faces of the roses and on thine own upturndalas in sorrow was it not fate that on this july midnight was it not fate whose name is also sorrow that bade me pause before that gardengate to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses no footstep stirred the hated world all slept save only thee and me oh heavenoh god how my heart beats in coupling those two words save only thee and me i pausedi looked and in an instant all things disappeared ah bear in mind this garden was enchantedthe pearly lustre of the moon went out the mossy banks and the meandering paths the happy flowers and the repining trees were seen no more the very roses odors died in the arms of the adoring airs allall expired save theesave less than thou save only the divine light in thine eyes save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes i saw but themthey were the world to me i saw but themsaw only them for hours saw only them until the moon went down what wild hearthistories seemed to lie enwritten upon those crystalline celestial spheres how dark a woe yet how sublime a hope how silently serene a sea of pride how daring an ambition yet how deep how fathomless a capacity for love but now at length dear dian sank from sight into a western couch of thundercloud and thou a ghost amid the entombing trees didst glide away only thine eyes remained they would not gothey never yet have gone lighting my lonely pathway home that night they have not left me as my hopes have sincethey follow methey lead me through the years they are my ministersyet i their slave their office is to illumine and enkindle my duty to be saved by their bright light and purified in their electric fire and sanctified in their elysian fire they fill my soul with beauty which is hope and are far up in heaventhe stars i kneel to in the sad silent watches of my night while even in the meridian glare of day i see them stilltwo sweetly scintillant venuses unextinguished by the sun the city in the sea lo death has reared himself a throne in a strange city lying alone far down within the dim west where the good and the bad and the worst and the best have gone to their eternal rest there shrines and palaces and towers timeeaten towers that tremble not resemble nothing that is ours around by lifting winds forgot resignedly beneath the sky the melancholy waters lieno rays from the holy heaven come down on the long nighttime of that town but light from out the lurid sea streams up the turrets silently gleams up the pinnacles far and free up domesup spiresup kingly halls up fanesup babylonlike walls up shadowy longforgotten bowers of sculptured ivy and stone flowers up many and many a marvellous shrine whose wreathèd friezes intertwine the viol the violet and the vine resignedly beneath the sky the melancholy waters lie so blend the turrets and shadows there that all seem pendulous in air while from a proud tower in the town death looks gigantically downthere open fanes and gaping graves yawn level with the luminous waves but not the riches there that lie in each idols diamond eye not the gailyjewelled dead tempt the waters from their bed for no ripples curl alas along that wilderness of glass no swellings tell that winds may be upon some faroff happier sea no heavings hint that winds have been on seas less hideously serenebut lo a stir is in the air the wavethere is a movement there as if the towers had thrown aside in slightly sinking the dull tide as if their tops had feebly given a void within the filmy heaven the waves have now a redder glow the hours are breathing faint and low and when amid no earthly moans down down that town shall settle hence hell rising from a thousand thrones shall do it reverence a dream within a dream take this kiss upon the brow and in parting from you now thus much let me avow you are not wrong who deem that my days have been a dream yet if hope has flown away in a night or in a day in a vision or in none is it therefore the less gone all that we see or seem is but a dream within a dreami stand amid the roar of a surftormented shore and i hold within my hand grains of the golden sand how few yet how they creep through my fingers to the deep while i weepwhile i weep o god can i not grasp them with a tighter clasp o god can i not save one from the pitiless wave is all that we see or seem but a dream within a dream the conqueror worm lo tis a gala night within the lonesome latter yearsan angel throng bewinged bedight in veils and drowned in tearssit in a theatre to see a play of hopes and fearswhile the orchestra breathes fitfully the music of the spheresmimes in the form of god on high mutter and mumble lowand hither and thither fly mere puppets they who come and goat bidding of vast formless things that shift the scenery to and froflapping from out their condor wings invisible woethat motley dramaoh be sure it shall not be forgotwith its phantom chased for evermore by a
