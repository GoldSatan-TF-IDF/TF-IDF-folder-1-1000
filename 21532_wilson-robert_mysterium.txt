mysterium by robert charles wilson for jo parallel worlds before the republic of turkey on a dry inland plain under a sky the color of agate a handful of americans scuffed at a rubble of ancient clay masonry the americans mainly graduate students doing fieldwork toward their degrees and a few tutelary spirits in the form of faculty members had arrived three weeks ago they had driven from ankara by land rover away from the kizil irmak and into the heart of the dry central plateau where a neolithic anatolian townsite had lain dormant for almost nine thousand years they had erected their tents and porta potties in the shade of a rocky hill and in the cool of the morning they worried the soil with wire brushes and whisk brooms the site was ancient but small and not very productive a graduate student named william delmonico was nibbling his way through a string grid that had produced only a few flaked stones the prehistoric equivalent of the cigarette butt when he uncovered what looked like a shard of polished jadean anomalous substance and immensely more interesting than the flints he had already cataloged the jade fragment was deeply embedded in the stony earth however and no amount of toothbrushing would free it delmonico alerted his adviser a tenured professor of archaeology who welcomed this respite from what had begun to seem like a wasted summer of fruitless and repetitive fieldwork delmonicos nubbin of glass not jade certainly though the resemblance was marked represented at least an intellectual challenge he assigned two experienced diggers to the grid but allowed delmonico his proprietary excitement delmonico a lanky twentyoneyearold with a shine of sweat on his face hovered over the site three days later a jagged spar of dull green material the size of a tabletop had been uncovered and still it remained embedded in the earth that was odd even more peculiar it looked as if they would have to call in a materials expert to identify this substance it was not jade not glass not pottery of any kind it retained its warmth long after sunsetand nights were often brutally cold on this high arid plain and it looked strange deceptive to the eye slippery from a distance it seemed almost to shrinkto disappear if you stood a few yards outside the dig in a stitch of air and sand on the fourth day after his discovery delmonico was confined to his tent vomiting every twenty or thirty minutes into a halfgallon mason jar while a wind storm battered the canvas and turned the air to chalk he had come down with the flu everyone said or common dysenteryhe wouldnt be the first delmonico accepted this diagnosis and resigned himself to it then the sores appeared on his hands the skin blackened and peeled away from his fingers and the bandages he applied turned yellow with suppuration blood appeared in his stools his faculty supervisor drove him to ankara where an emergency room physician named celal diagnosed radiation sickness celal filed a report with his chief of staff the chief of staff notified an official of the ministry of public health the doctor was not surprised given all this when the delirious young american was taken from the ward by a military escort and driven into the night it was a mystery celal thought but there were always mysteries the world was a mystery delmonico died in a closed ward of a us air force medical complex a week later his companions from the dig were quarantined separately the two postgrads who had labored over the jade fragment lived another day and a half before dying within an hour of each other the rest of the expedition were treated and released each was asked to sign a paper acknowledging that the events they had witnessed were classified and that divulging those events to anyone for any reason would be punishable pursuant to the official secrets act shaken and at a loss to make any sense of what had happened all fourteen surviving americans agreed to sign only one of them broke his oath seven years after the death of william delmonico werner holden formerly an archaeology major and now an auto parts dealer in portland oregon confessed to a professional ufo researcher that he had witnessed the recovery of a portion of the hull of a flying saucer from an archaeological site in central turkey the ufo researcher listened patiently to holdens story and promised to look into it what he did not tell holden was that the whole crashfragment approach had grown unfashionable his audience expected something more intimate abductions metaphysics a year later holdens account appeared in the researchers book as a footnote no legal action was taken as a consequence holden died of a runaway lymphoma in january of the jade anomaly as delmonico had thought of it before his death was retrieved from the soil of the abandoned archaeological site by a platoon of military men equipped with spades and protective clothing they worked at night under floodlights so the sun wouldnt cook them inside their leadlined suits over the course of three nights they succeeded in unearthing a gently curved piece of apparently homogeneous material cm thick and irregular in shape one observer said it looked like a piece of an egg shell if you can imagine an egg big enough to hatch a stretch limo the fragment was highly radioactive in the wavelengths around nm but the intensity of the radiation fell away to undetectability at distances greater than a meter or so an apparent violation of the inversesquare law that no one attempted to explain arrangements were made with the turkish government to have the material quietly removed from the country blanketed in lead and packed in an unmarked shipping flat it left a nato airbase in a hercules transport bound for an undisclosed destination in the united states alan stern a professor of theoretical physics and recent recipient of the nobel prize was approached at a conference on inflationary theory at a hotel outside cambridge massachusetts by a young man in a threepiece suitquite an anomaly stern thought among this rabble of thesiswriters academic hacks bearded astrophysicists and balding cosmologists stern both bearded and balding was intrigued by the younger mans air of quiet authority and the two of them adjourned to the bar where the younger man disappointed stern by offering him a job i dont do classified work he said if i cant publish it its not science in any case defense research is a dead end the cold war is over or hasnt that news reached your appropriations committee the younger man displayed an impenetrable patience this isnt strictly speaking a defense project and he explained further my god stern said softly when the young man had finished can this be true that evening stern sat in the audience as a lucasian professor of mathematics read a paper defending the anthropic principle in the language of set theory bored by the lecture and still excited by what the young man had told him stern took a notebook from his pocket and opened it across his knee god is the root of the all he wrote the ineffable one who dwells in the monad he dwells alone in silence the two rivers physical research laboratory was constructed over the course of six months on a parcel of uninhabited land in northern michigan deeded to the government by an impoverished ojibway band the nearby town of two rivers accepted the facility without complaint two rivers had begun life as a mill town survived as a hunting and fishing town and had recently become an alternative to the suburbs for whitecollar workers who commuted by fax and modem the main street had been refurbished with imitation brickwork and gas lights and a gourmet coffee shop had opened up next to the baskinrobbins lately there had been complaints about waterskiers chasing the ducks out of lake merced sports fishermen complained and hired charter planes to carry them farther from the encroachments of civilization but the town was prospering for the first time in thirty years the construction of the research facility provoked little comment from the town council construction crews and equipment came up the highway and approached the site from the west along a corduroy logging road often at night there had been some expectation that the project would create employment among the townspeople but that hope soon flickered and dimmed staff were trucked in as quietly as the concrete and cinder blocks the only local work was temporary and involved the laying of highcapacity water and power lines even when the facility was up and runningdoing whatever clandestine work it didits employees stayed away from town they lived in barracks on federal property they shopped at a px they came into two rivers to arrange fishing trips occasionally and one or two strangers might stop by the bars or take in a movie at the cineplex in the highway mall but as a rule they didnt mingle one of the few townspeople who expressed any curiosity about the facility was dexter graham a history teacher at john f kennedy high school graham told his fiancee evelyn woodward that the installation made no sense defense spending is passe according to the papers all the research budgets have been slashed but there they are our own little manhattan project evelyn operated a bedandbreakfast by the lakeside the view particularly from the upper bay windows was pure postcard dex had ducked out of a friday staff meeting for a session of what evelyn called afternoon delight and they were savoring the aftermathcool sheets curtains twining in long sighs of pinescented air it was evelyn who had turned the conversation to the two rivers physical research laboratory she had a new boarder who worked at the plant a young man named howard poole amazing dex said turning his long body lazily under the cotton sheets dont they have their own quarters out there i never heard of one of these guys boarding in town dont be so cynical evelyn scolded him howard says theres a housing problemtoo much staff short accommodation musical chairs i guess and he was left standing hes only here for a week anyway he says he wanted to see the town admirable curiosity evelyn sat up and reached for her panties vaguely annoyed dex possessed a deep automatic cynicism she had begun to find unattractive he was forty years old and sometimes he sounded a little too much like the toothless janitor at his school the one who was always mumbling about the government the question was would dex give howard poole a hard time over dinner evelyn hoped not she liked howard well enough he was young shy bespectacled vulnerablelooking she was charmed by his accent bronx perhaps or queensplaces evelyn knew mainly from her reading she had never been east of detroit she dressed and left dex in bed went downstairs to the kitchen and began to prepare a coq au vin and salad for herself dex and her two boarders howard and a woman named friedel from california she hummed to herself as she worked a tuneless little song that seemed to arise from the memory of what she and dex had done in the bedroom sunlight tracked across the linoleum floor the wooden chopping board dinner went better than she had expected mrs friedel a widow did most of the talking a gentle monologue about her trip across the country and how much her husband would have enjoyed it the coq au vin put everyone in a benevolent mood or maybe it was just the weather a fine spring evening the first warm evening of the year howard poole smiled often but spoke seldom he sat opposite evelyn he ate sparingly but paid attention to the food the vivid sunset through the dining room window was reflected in his oval glasses disguising his eyes over dessert a cinnamon cake dex raised the forbidden topic i understand you work out at the defense plant howard evelyn tensed but howard seemed to take it in stride he shrugged his bony shoulders if you can call it thata defense plant i never thought of it that way government installation is what they call it in the paper yes what exactly do you do out there im new to the place myself mr graham i cant answer the question meaning its classified meaning i wish i knew evelyn kicked dex under the table and said brightly coffee anyone sounds wonderful howard said and dex just smiled and nodded curiously mrs friedel had packed her bags and announced her intention to leave as soon as dinner was over evelyn settled the account but was worried youre driving after dark i wouldnt ordinarily the widow confided and i dont believe in dreamsi really dont but this one was so vivid i was taking a nap this morning and in the dream i was talking to ben your husband yes and he told me to pack and leave he was not upset just a little concerned mrs friedel was blushing i know how this sounds im not such a lunatic miss woodwardyou dont have to stare like that now evelyn blushed oh no its all right mrs friedel go with a hunch thats what i always say but it was strange she took her evening walk with dex after the dishes had been washed they crossed beacon and headed for the lakeside gnats hovered under the streetlights but the mosquitoes werent a menace yet the breeze was gentle and the air was only beginning to cool she said when were married you have to promise not to harass the guestsmore in reference to what might have happened than what had happened and dex looked apologetic and said of course i didnt mean to badger him she admitted that he hadnt it was only her apprehension of his unyielding nature of the grief he carried deep inside him i saw you biting your tongue howard seems like a nice enough kid bright university grad probably drafted by some headhunter maybe he really doesnt know whats going on out there maybe nothing is going on out there nothing bad at least its possible whatever they do im sure its perfectly safe so was chernobyl until it blew up god youre so paranoid he laughed at her consternation then she laughed too and they walked a silent distance along the shore of lake merced water lapped at wooden docks the stars were bright on the way back evelyn shivered and buttoned her sweater she said are you staying over tonight if you still want me to of course i do and he put his arm around her waist later dex would wonder about the remark he had made about chernobyl did it represent a premonition like mrs friedels dream had his body sensed something some subliminal input his conscious mind failed to grasp and then there was evelyns tabby cat roadblock roadblock spent the evening in a kind of frenzy tearing around the bedroom in tight circles until evelyn lost patience and put her out had the cat sensed some tenuous radiation coming across the dark water of the lake perhaps perhaps he woke a little after midnight he hovered a moment on the fragile edge of awareness dimly conscious of evelyn beside him of the way she breathed in her sleep long delicate sighs what had woken him a sound a motion then it came again an irregular metallic tappinga tapping at the window he turned and saw the moonlit silhouette of the cat roadblock out for the night had climbed onto the garage roof and up the shingled slope to the bedroom window now she wanted back in claws on the plate glass tackscratch go way dex mumbled wishful thinking tack tack he stood up and pulled on his underwear the warmth of the day had evaporated the bedroom was chilly the cat stood on her hind legs arched against the windowpane in an eerie stretch moonlight fell on dex and he turned and saw his reflection in the vanity mirror he saw the thatch of dark hair across his chest his large hands loose at his sides his gaunt face lay half in shadow eyes wide and bewildered by sleep he would be fortyone years old in august old man he unlatched the window roadblock leaped inside and raced across the carpet more frantic than ever the cat jumped on the bed and evelyn stirred in her sleep dex she murmured what and rolled over sighing he leaned out into the cool night air the town was silent two rivers closed down after midnight even on a warm friday the sound of traffic had faded he heard the warble of a loon out on the deeps of lake merced trees flush with new leaves moved in tides of night air somewhere down beacon road a dog barked then suddenly inexplicably a beam of light flashed across the sky it came from the east across the lake far away in the abandoned ojibway reservefrom the defense plant dex realized the light cast sudden shadows like lightning it flickered on the lake the bedroom was aglow with it a spotlight a flare he couldnt make sense of it evelyn sat up in alarm all the way awake now dex whats going on there was no time to answer he saw a second beam of light cut the meridian of the sky and a third so sharply defined he thought they must be laser beams maybe some kind of weapon being tested out there and then the light expanded like a bubble seemed to include everything around it the lake the town evelyns bedroom dex himself the room bathed in light began abruptly to spin to tilt on an invisible axis and slide away until his awareness dwindled to a point a pulsating singularity in a wilderness of light the town of two rivers michigan and the federally funded research project on its outskirts vanished from the earth some hours before dawn on a saturday morning late in may the fires began not long after the fires were useful when it was time to explain what had happened the obliteration of a town the size of two rivers requires a great deal of explanation and the existence of the military facility on the abandoned indian lands had not been a secret though its purpose had never been revealed it was the desire of the defense department that these awkward truths not be connected both the town and the research project were lost in the fire officials announced it had not been one fire but several unseasonal unexpected the product perhaps of freakish heat lightning the fires had surrounded the town and grown with unprecedented speed there was no defense against such a holocaust most of bayard county was simply incinerated more lives had been lost than in any natural disaster in american history tens of thousands of lives commissions of inquiry were established and carefully staffed questions were inevitable of course an american town the size of two rivers represents a substantial deposit of stone asphalt concrete and steelit cant simply burn to the ground where were the foundations the chimneys the stonework the bricks where in fact were the roads barricades had been thrown up before the fire was extinguished and they stayed in place long after battalions of federal bulldozers had moved in immediatelyto clear the highway officials said but one retired civil engineer who lived east of the fireline said it looked to him like they were rebuilding that road and there were other mysteries the sighting of curious lights the interruption of phone service to and from two rivers long before the fire could have grown to threatening size the fifteen civilian witnesses who claimed they had approached the town from the east or west and found the highway cut cleanly as if by some enormous knife and nothing on the other side but trees and wilderness power lines had been severed just as neatly and it was the loose lines some said that were the real cause of the fire but these were clues that defied interpretation and they were soon forgotten except by the fringe element who collected stories of ghosts rains of stones and the spontaneous combustion of human bodies never officially connected with the two rivers disaster was the case of wim pender who was found wandering in a dazed condition along the grassy verge of highway pender claimed he had been on a fishingcamping expedition in the north of the province of mille lacs with two companions from whom he had been separated when there was a blast of light and flames to the south of us late one night pender gave as his home address a number on a nonexistent boston street his wallet and identification had been lost in his flight from the fire his pack contained only an empty canteen two cans of something labeled thon pale en morceaux tuna fish it turned out and an apocryphal testament of the bible entitled the secret booke of james in the english tongue printed on rice paper and bound in imitation leather when penders claims grew even more fantasticincluding the accusation that both the forest service and the michigan department of welfare were mohammedans or servants of samael or worsehe was remanded for psychiatric evaluation to a facility in lansing mr pender was deemed not to be a danger to himself or others and was released on june he made his way to detroit where he spent the summer in a shelter for the homeless november was cold that year and during an early snowfall pender left his bed and spent his last money on a city bus because the buses were heated the bus carried him downriver to southgate where he got off in front of a bankrupt and abandoned retail lumber outlet in the upper story of that building he tied his belt into a crude loop and hanged himself from a rafter pinned to his shirt was a note the kyngdom of death belongs to those who put them selves to death james the apostle i am not insane signed wim pender of boston part one the void that precedes the creation of the universe is an imponderable unknowing emptinesslacking matter vacuum time motion number or logic and yet the universe derives from it according to some law not yet understooda law which governing nothingness yields everything call it nous perfect mind call it the protennoia the uncreated god from the secret journal of alan stern chapter one dex graham woke with the sun in his eyes and the weave of evelyn woodwards bedroom carpet printed on the side of his face he was cold and his body was stiff and knotted with aches he sat up wondering what had caused him to spend the night on the floor he hadnt slept on a floor since college the morning after some nightmarish frat party blowout drunk on the floor of a dorm room and wondering what happened to the strawberry blond grad student who had offered him a ride in her mustang vanished in the haze like so much else a breath of cool air made him shiver the bay window was wide open had he done that the curtains tossed fitfully and the sky was as blue as china glaze it was a quiet morning there was no sound louder than the honking of canada geese in the shallow water under the docks he stood up a slow operation and looked at evelyn she was awkwardly asleep under a tangle of cotton sheets one arm was flung out and roadblock lay stretched at her feet had he been drunk was that possible he felt the way he remembered feeling after a drunkthe same sensation of bad news hovering just out of reach the nights ill omens about to unreel in his head and he turned to the window and thought ah god yesthe defense plant he remembered the beams of light stabbing the sky the way the bedroom had begun to pinwheel around him beyond the window lake merced was calm the docks shimmered under a gloss of hazy sunlight the masts of pleasure boats bobbed randomly listlessly and due eastbeyond the pines that crowded the far margin of the lakea plume of smoke rose from the old ojibway reservation he stared for a time trying to sort out the implications the memory of chernobyl came again obviously there had been an accident at the two rivers plant he had no way of knowing what kind of accident what he had seen had not looked like a nuclear explosion but might have been something just as catastrophic a meltdown say he watched the smoke make a lazy spindle in the cool air the breeze was brisk and from the west if there was fallout it wouldnt travel into townat least not today but what happened last night had been more than an explosion something had rendered him unconscious for most of six or seven hours and he wasnt the only one look at beacon road empty except for a scatter of starlings the docks and boat ramps were naked in the sunlight no boaters or dawn fishermen had taken to lake merced he turned to the bed suddenly frightened evelyn ev are you awake to his enormous relief she stirred and sighed her eyes opened and she winced at the light dex she said ohum she yawned pull the drapes time to get up evie um she raised herself on an elbow and squinted at the alarm clock oh my god breakfast she stood up a little unsteady on her feet and pulled on a housecoat i know i set that alarm people must be starving the alarm was an ancient windup model maybe she had set it dex thought maybe it went off smack at seven and maybe it rang until it ran down he thought we might already be dying of radiation poisoning how would we know do we start to vomit but he felt all right he felt like hed slept on the floor not like hed been poisoned evelyn hurried into the en suite bathroom and came back looking puzzled the lights out in there he tried the wall switch the bedroom light didnt work either house fuse she pondered or it might be a power failure dex why do you look so funny her frown deepened you were at the window last night werent you i remember now you let roadblock in he nodded and there was lightning an electric storm maybe thats why the power is out lightning could have hit the transformer over by city hall last time that happened we were in the dark for six hours by way of an answer he took her hand and led her to the window she shaded her eyes and looked across the lake that smoke is the defense plant he said something must have happened there last night it wasnt lightning ev some kind of explosion i think is that why theres no electricity now her voice took on a timorous note and he felt her grip tighten on his hand he said i dont know maybe the smoke is blowing away from us anyway i think thats good i dont hear any sirens if theres a fire shouldnt there be sirens fire company may be there already i didnt hear any sirens during the night the fire halls just down on armory it always wakes me up when they run the sirens at night did you hear anything he admitted he hadnt dex its way too quiet its a little scary he said lets do something about breakfast maybe we can run that little battery radio in the kitchen find out whats going on it seemed as if she weighed the suggestion and found it weak but adequate everybody needs to eat i guess all right let me finish dressing it was the offseason of course and with mrs friedel gone howard poole was the sole remaining guestand howard hadnt come down to breakfast the stove was electric evelyn rummaged in the warming refrigerator i think were reduced to cereal she said until the milk spoils anyway dex opened the utility cupboard and found evelyns panasonic radio the batteries werent fresh but they might still hold a charge he put the radio on the kitchen table pulled its antenna to full length and switched it on there was a crackle of static where wqbx used to be so the batteries were good dex thought but there was no broadcast coming out of coby some fifty miles west where the relay tower was the nearest actual radio station was in port auburn and neither dex nor evelyn cared for its roundtheclock countryandwestern music but it would do he thought and he turned the dial clockwise nothing evelyn said there must be something wrong with it maybe it seemed unlikely to dex but what other explanation made sense ten years ago he might have guessed thered been some kind of nuclear war the doomsday scenario everybody used to dread that it had wiped out everything beyond the horizon but that possibility was slim even if some russian had pushed some antiquated red button it wouldnt have destroyed the entire civilized world surely it wouldnt have wiped out port auburn or even closed down the radio station there an explosion at the two rivers plant and a radio with a dead transistor he wanted to make a logical connection between the two but could not he was still turning the dial when howard poole came into the kitchen howard was wearing a white tshirt saturday jeans with a rip starting at the left knee and an expression of sleepy bewilderment must have missed breakfast he said nope cold cereal evelyn said briskly and we havent really started yet the powers off you may have noticed trouble at the defense plant dex put in howards attention perked up instantly what kind of trouble some kind of explosion during the night from what i could see upstairs theres smoke coming off it now the towns pretty much still asleep and i cant find anything on the radio howard sat down at the table he seemed to have trouble absorbing the information jesus he said fire at the research facility i believe so jesus now dex caught something on the radio it was a voice a masculine rumble distorted by static too faint to decipher he turned up the volume but the intelligibility didnt improve put the radio on top of the refrigerator evelyn said it always works better up there he did so the reception was marginally better but the station faded in and out nevertheless the three of them strained to hear what they could and for a time the broadcast was quite clear moments later it faded altogether dex took the radio down and switched it off evelyn said did anyone understand any of that it sounded like a newscast howard said cautiously or a radio play evelyn said thats what i thought of dex shook his head there hasnt been a radio play on the air since howards right it was a news broadcast but i thought evelyn gave a small puzzled laugh i thought the announcer said something about the spaniards a war with the spaniards he did dex said for a few moments the announcers bored voice had risen from the rattle of noise and distance into rough intelligibility issued was the first word dex had understood issued reports of great successes along the jalisco front in the war with the spaniards casualties were light and the cities of colima and manzanillo are under allied control in the bahia amphibian landings then the swell of electronic noise buried the voice pardon me howard said but what the hell kind of accent was that guy sounds like a norwegian funeral director on quaaludes and excuse me but spaniards its like the news from it has to be a joke or evelyns right some kind of radio drama like last halloween evelyn put in when they played a tape of the old orson welles war of the worlds its not halloween dex said she gave him an angry glare so what are you saying that its legitimate were suddenly at war with spain i dont know i dont understand it i dont know what the hell its about evie but lets not make up an explanation when we dont have one is that what you think im doing she raised her voice and it might have become an argumentnot a real argument dex thought but one of those peevish debates with more of fear than hostility in it but she was interrupted by the keening of the two rivers volunteer fire department both trucks rolling out of the armory street fire hall and speeding past on beacon road well thank god she said somebodys doing something at last wait a minute howard said and there was an expression of sick foreboding on his face its the fire department evelyn told him they must be headed for the indian reserve god no howard said and dex watched in perplexity as the younger man stood and ran for the door dick haldane struggled out of a confused sleep at eight am and from the front window of his house with the view overlooking the brickworks and the west end of lake merced he saw smoke rising from the old ojibway reserve haldane had the misfortune of being the acting chief of the two rivers volunteer fire department the chief and most of the fire board trustees were in detroit until monday for a conference on iso grading policy and it looked as if an emergency had fallen into his lap in the meantime the electricity didnt work and neither did the phones perhaps worse there was no water pressure in the bathroom the toilet gave a sad last gasp when he flushed it two rivers took its water pressure from a reservoir in the highlands north of the bayard county line so this might be a local problem but it might not and the idea of a major fire without the means to fight it was one of haldanes personal bad dreams lacking alternatives he hopped into his aging pontiac lemans and drove like hell to the beacon road fire hall the two rivers physical research laboratoryobvious source of the smokewas supposed to have its own fire control team and certainly no one had told haldane the facility was inside his response area quite the opposite the department of defense had had a long talk with the municipal fire service they didnt want volunteer brigades on the property unless they were specifically called for and according to the dods man in a suit that was about as likely as a call from god almighty still that smoke kept on curling into a lazy sky haldane kept the night shift on duty and waited for the morning crew to arrive a couple of honda generators in the basement provided ac for the dispatchers radio but there was nobody talking back he made a couple of attempts to reach city hall and the mayor at home but it was no go this whole mess was squarely on his back there had been a fire in the national forest land north of town in when haldane was twenty years old and he had been among the men cutting the firebreak he had witnessed many fires since but none as terrifying he imagined the ojibway reserve as it had been before the feds moved in weedy meadowland and tall wild pine a few shacks where the traditionals still persisted in their old ways those shacks had been razed and a perimeter drawn on the county maps dod enter at your own risk here there be tygers but a fire as haldane told his troops observes no limits a fire goes where it feels like this fire didnt look all that serious at least not yet not from here but stillhe didnt want anybody saying a forest burned down because dick haldane was waiting on a telephone call he kept the engine company at home but dispatched a ladder company to survey the scene he followed behind in the chiefs car a red station wagon with a roof light the siren cut the saturday quiet like a hot sharp knife not that there was much traffic to get in the way two rivers was slow to wake this peculiar morning he saw a few people on their porches out to stare at the ladder truck a few kids in their pjs no doubt they were wondering whether the tv would begin to work pretty soonor the telephones haldane was troubled by the same question there was no sign of an emergency except that smoke from the federal project but how could a fire out there even a bad fire shut down so much of two rivers some kind of power surge he supposed or maybe a dead short across those kilovolt lines that had gone in last year but he had never seen anything like it in his career that was for sure they were quickly out of the crowded part of town three miles down the highway and then east along the wide dirt road all the federal money pouring in couldnt they have paved the access haldanes kidneys protested this rattling the woods were dense here and although he saw the plume of smoke now and again there was no clear line of sight to the plant itself until the road crossed a ridgeline overlooking the site he topped the rise and stood on the brake too hard even so he only just managed to avoid ramming the rear end of the ladder unit who was driving tom stubbs as he recalled stubbs too was probably transfixed by what he was suddenly able to see the two rivers physical research laboratory was a nucleus of low concrete bunkers in an asphaltpaved flatland where the old social hall used to be at the extreme north of this paved space stood a tall administration building at the south a residence that looked like a stucco apartment complex misplaced from some la suburb two of the bunkerlike buildings had been damaged in some kind of explosion the walls were blackened and the roofs were in a state of partial collapse from the most central and badly damaged structure that pall of oily smoke curled into the sky no open flame was visible but that wasnt the astonishing thing the astonishing thing chief haldane thought was the way all of this property was enclosed in a veil of diaphanous blue light a few years ago haldane had taken his vacation time in northern ontario along with two guys from the fire hall and a realtor from the west side of town they went fly fishing in the lake country north of superior and for a solid week they had achieved a nearly ideal balance of sport intoxication and masculine bullshit but what haldane remembered best was a chilly clear night when he looked up into a sky jammed with stars and saw the aurora borealis dancing on the horizon it was this same kind of light same elusive haze of color now here now there he had never expected to see it in daylight certainly he had never expected to see it enfolding this collection of bunkers and brickwork like some kind of science fiction force field it was a smoky uncertain light mostly you could see through it but it obscured a detail here and there and haldane noticed another peculiarity the longer you stared at something inside that glow the less you seemed to see of it he fixed his eyes on the burning building perhaps a thousand yards down this hill and across the asphalt it wavered in his sight after ten seconds he might have been staring at a blank scrim of color he shook his head to clear it the radio crackled it was stubbs calling from the truck ahead haldane picked up the microphone and said you scared the piss out of me i hope youre aware of that stubbss voice came crackling out of a deep well of static he sounded like he was miles away not a couple of yards chief what the hell is that what do we do turn back i dont see anybody fighting the fire maybe we should wait for the state cops or somebody grow some balls tom take your foot off the brake the ladder company inched forward clifford stockton twelve years old spotted the smoke about the same time chief haldane did clifford who was still called cliffy by his mother and a mob of aunts saw the smoke from his bedroom window he stood in his pajamas watching it for a while not sure whether it was important he wanted it to be some dire omen as in the disaster movies he loved like the flaky pressure gauge nobody notices in the last voyage or the snowstorm that just wont quit in the first airport movie it was a great beginning for cliffords saturday cue for any number of cliffordscripts he began orchestrating the movie in his head little did anyone suspect he said out loud little did anyone suspect what but he hadnt figured that out yet his mother always slept late saturday clifford pulled on yesterdays jeans and the first tshirt in his tshirt drawer cleaned his foggy glasses with a kleenex and went downstairs to watch tv whereupon he discovered the electricity didnt work not just in the living room either but in the kitchen the hallway the bathroom and for the first time clifford paused and wondered if it was possible not in the world of wouldntitbecoolif but in the real dailiness of his life if something really weird might actually be happening he remembered being awakened by lightning a diffuse lightning without thunder remembered drifting in and out of a confused sleep with light all around him he decided to check on his mother he padded back to the dim upstairs of their rented house and eased open her bedroom door cliffords mother was a thin and not very beautiful woman of thirtyseven years but he had never looked at her critically and he didnt do so now she was only his mother dangerous if awakened too soon from her saturday morning sleepin saturday morning drill was that she was allowed to sleep till ten oclock and if clifford was up early he could do whatever he wanted get his own breakfast watch tv play outside the house if he left a note and was back by noon for lunch today was different obviously but he guessed the rules still applied he wrote her a messagei have gone to ride my hikeand stuck it to the refrigerator with a strawberryshaped magnet then he hurried outside locked the door grabbed his bike and pedaled south toward the bridge over powell creek he was looking for clues there was a fire on the old ojibway reserve and the lights didnt work a mystery two rivers seemed too quiet to yield any answers then as he crossed the creek and rolled toward downtown clifford wondered if the very quietness was itself a clue no one was mowing his lawn or washing the car houses brooded with their drapes still drawn the sun shimmered on an empty road he heard the sirens when the fire engines went screaming along beacon and out of town it was he thought almost too much like a movie he stopped at ryans a corner grocery that had been taken over last year by a korean family named sung mrs sung was behind the countera small round woman with her eyes buried in nets of wrinkles clifford bought a candy bar and a comic book with the money from yesterdays allowance mrs sung took his money and made change from a shoebox machine not working she said meaning the cash register how come clifford said do you know she only shrugged and frowned clifford rode away he stopped at the public park overlooking powell creek to eat the candy bar breakfast he chose a sunny patch of grass where he could see the north end of town the town was waking up but in a slow lazy way a few more cars were prowling the streets more shops had opened their doors the distant plume of smoke continued to rise but it was unhurried and unchanged clifford crumpled the paper candy bar wrapper and stuffed it into his shirt pocket he took the cardboard liner down to the creek and let it float away it tumbled over a rock and capsized it was the titanic in a night to remember the unsinkable ship he climbed the embankment and looked again at two riversthe town where nothing much ever happened the unsinkable town he checked his watch twenty after eleven he rode home wondering whether his mother was up and had found the note she might be worried he thought he dropped the bike in the driveway and hurried inside but she was only just awake tanglehaired in her pink bathrobe and fumbling over the coffee maker damn thing doesnt work she said oh hello cliffy between breakfast and lunch dex graham formulated the same idea as clifford stockton he would go out and survey the town he left evelyn in the kitchen and promised hed be back by noon he drove west on beacon to his own apartment one bedroom in a thirtyyearold building sparsely furnished he owned a sofa bed a fourteeninch tv set and a desk where last weeks history papers waited to be graded yesterdays breakfast dishes were stacked in the drainer it was a collation of postponed chores not a home he checked to see whether his lights were working they werent so the problem wasnt confined to evelyns house or streetit wasnt only local somehow he had doubted that it would be he picked up the phone thought about calling somebody from the schoolbut his phone was as dead as evelyns had been back to reconnaissance he thought he locked the door behind him he drove downtown the streets were still too empty the town sluggish for a saturday morning but at least a few people were moving around he supposed the blackout had kept a lot of people home the big stores were closed by the power outage but some of the smaller businesses had managed to opentilsons grocery was open illuminated by daylight through the broad glass front windows and a couple of batterypowered lanterns in the dim corner where the freezer was dex stopped to pick up some groceries evelyn had asked for canned goods anything nonperishable and he thought that was a good idea there was no way to predict how long this crisis might last or what its nature might turn out to be he filled a handbasket with canned vegetables and was about to pick up a bottle of distilled water when a man shoved in front of him and took two jugs hey dex said the stranger was a big man in a hunting jacket and a john deere cap he gave dex a blank look and took the bottled water to the checkout counter where he added it to a formidable stack of canned goodsthe same sort of thing dex had come for but more of it the girl behind the counter was meg tilson who had graduated from dexs history class last year she said are you sure you want all this the man was sweating and a little breathless all of it how much the register was down of course so meg began to total everything on a pocket calculator dex lined up behind the man you seem to be in a hurry another blank look the man was dazed dex thought he persisted so you know something we dont know the man in the john deere cap turned away as if the question frightened him but then seemed to relent shit he said im sorry if i got in your way im just stocking up you bet any particular reason a hundred seventysix eighty meg announced at least i think so the man pulled two hundreddollar bills out of his pocket while meg stunned rummaged in a shoebox for change was supposed to drive to detroit this morning the man said for my sisters wedding i wake up late so i throw the tux in the back seat and i drive out beacon and turn south on the highway right but i only get about a mile and a quarter past the city limits the roads blocked the man laughed the roads not blocked the road just aint there it stops its like somebody cut it with a knife it ends in trees i mean old growth theres not even a trail through there he looked at dex how the hell could that happen dex shook his head meg put the groceries in two boxes and gave the man his change her eyes were wide and frightened i think were in for a long siege said the man in the john deere cap i think thats pretty fucking obvious meg toted up dexs bill all the while casting nervous glances at the man as he loaded his boxes into the back of an old chevy van mr graham is what he said true i dont know meg it doesnt seem likely but the electricity doesnt work or the phones so maybe anythings possible but lets not jump to conclusions she looked at his collection of canned goods and bottled water not too different from the previous order should we all beyou know stocking up i dont honestly know is your father around upstairs maybe you should tell him what happened if any of this is true or even if rumors start flying there might be a crowd in here by this afternoon ill do that meg said heres your change mr graham he put the groceries in the trunk of the car it might have been wiser to go straight back to evelyns but he couldnt let the matter rest he drove past the house on beacon connected with the highway and turned south he passed a couple of cars headed in the opposite direction through traffic dex wondered or had they hit the mysterious barrier and turned back he decided he didnt believe the john deere mans story it was simply too implausible but something might have turned the man around perhaps something connected with the power failure and the explosion on the old reserve the state highway wound through low pine punctuated with back roads where tar paper shacks and ancient cabins crumbled in the noon heat he saw the city limits sign leaving two rivers a billboard ad for a stuckeys ahead where the state road met the interstate leaving bayard county then he rounded a tight curve and almost rammed the back end of a honda civic parked with one wheel in the breakdown lane he stomped the brake and steered hard left when the car came to a stop he let it idle a few minutes then when it occurred to him to do so he put it in park and switched off the muttering engine everything the man had said was true three vehicles had arrived here before him the civic a blue pinto with a roof rack and a tall diesel cab without a trailer all three were motionless their owners stood at the end of the road huddled in confusion a woman with a toddler a man in a business suit and the truck driver they looked at dex as he climbed out of his car dex went to the place where the road ended he wanted to make a careful observation wanted to be able to describe this with scientific accuracy to howard poole the graduate physics student back at evelyns it seemed important in this senseless moment to register every detail the highway simply stopped it was as if someone had drawn a surveyors line across it on this side twolane blacktop on that side oldgrowth forest the road seemed to have been cut by something much finer than a knife only a few particles of asphalt had crumbled the graded road was lower than the forest floor on the other side a hump of loamy soil rose above the road surface and had dropped crumbs of moss and composted pine needles onto it the smell of the soil was rich and strong dex picked up a handful it was moist and compacted easily in his fist it had been here a long long time an earthworm crawled across the white divider by his knee sublimely indifferent the truck driver ground a cigarette under the heel of his boot and said its real all right nobodys driving south today beyond this line of demarcation there was no road and had never been any road that much was obvious the forest was deep and trackless not so much as a deer trail passed through here dex thought it doesnt seem possible said the woman from the pinto she was hugging herself and kept glancing at the forest furtively as if it might disappear between peeks the toddler pressed at her thigh it isnt possible said the man in the business suit i mean there it is but its not i mean possible i dont think possible has anything to do with it still cataloging details dex went to the side of the road where a string of telephone poles followed the rightofway the phone lines had been sliced as neatly as the road the wires dangled limply from the poles thats not all the truck driver said even the trees dont match this sides been burned off a couple of times i think over there its all old growth go a little ways in that direction theres an old pine sliced right up the middle all the heartwood exposed and the sap leakin out the bugs arent at it yet so it must have happened just recently like last night dex said you come from out of town yeah but i spent the night in two rivers had the alternator replaced i sure as hell wish i could leave but its the same at the other end of the highway about three miles beyond the quarry dead end i think were locked in unless theres some side road they missed they whoever did this or whatever you know what i mean maybe theres still a way out of town but i doubt it the woman repeated how is that possible by the expression on the truck drivers face dex guessed she had been saying it for a while now he couldnt blame her it was the right question he thought in a way it was the only question but he couldnt answer it and he felt his own great fear treading on the heels of the mystery howard poole chased the ladder company as far as the old ojibway reserve as he came over the rise where chief haldane and his crew had recently been and as he saw the research installation in its veil of blue light a memory came to him unbidden it was a memory of something alan stern had said to him one night stern the physicist who might have perished in the trouble last night stern his uncle howard had been sixteen years old a math prodigy with a keen interest in highenergy physics about to be launched into an academic fast track that both excited and frightened him stern had come to visit for a week that summer he was a celebrity alan stern had appeared in time magazine preeminent among a new generation of american scientists photographed against a line of radio telescopes somewhere out west he had been interviewed on public television and had published journal articles so dense with mathematics that they looked like untranslated greek papyruses at sixteen howard had worshiped his uncle without reservation stern had come to the house in queens bald and extravagantly bearded infinitely patient with family gossip courteous at the dinner table and modest about his career howard had learned to cultivate his own patience sooner or later he knew he would be left alone with his uncle and the conversation would begin as it always began stern smiling his strange conspirators smile and asking so what have you learned about the world they sat on the back porch watching fireflies a saturday night in august and stern dazed him with starry sweeps of science the ideas of hawking guth linde himself howard liked the way such talk made him feel both small and largedwarfed by the night sky and at the same time a part of it then when the talk had begun to lull his uncle turned to him and said do you ever wonder howard about the questions we cant ask cant answer you mean no cant ask i dont understand stern leaned back in his deck chair and folded his hands over his gaunt ascetic frame his glasses were opaque in the porch light the crickets seemed suddenly loud think about a dog he said think about your dogwhats his name albert yes think about albert hes a healthy dog is he not yes intelligent sure he functions in every way normally then within the parameters of dogness hes an exemplar of his species and he has the ability to learn yes he can do tricks learn from his experience and hes aware of his surroundings he can distinguish between you and your mother for instance hes not unconscious or impaired right but despite all that theres a limit on his understanding obviously so if we talk about gravitons or fourier transforms he cant follow the conversation were speaking a language he doesnt know and cannot know the concepts cant be translated his mental universe simply wont contain them granted howard said am i missing the point were sitting here stern said asking spectacular questions you and i about the universe and how it began about everything that exists and if we can ask a question probably sooner or later we can answer it so we assume theres no limit to knowledge but maybe your dog makes the same mistake he doesnt know what lies beyond the neighborhood but if he found himself in a strange place he would approach it with the tools of comprehension available to him and soon he would understand itdogfashion by sight and smell and so on there are no limits to his comprehension howard except the limits he does not and cannot ever experience so how different are we were mammals within the same broad compass of evolution after all our forebrains are bigger but the difference amounts to a few ounces we can ask many many more questions than your dog and we can answer them but if there are real limits on our comprehension they would be as invisible to us as they are to albert so is there anything in the universe we simply cannot know is there a question we cant ask and would we ever encounter some hint of it some intimation of the mystery or is it permanently beyond our grasp his uncle stood and stretched peered over the porch railing at the dark street and yawned its a question for philosophers not physicists but i confess it interests me it interested howard too it haunted him all that night he lay in bed pondering the limits of human knowledge while the stars burned in his window and a slow breeze cooled his forehead he never forgot the conversation neither did his uncle stern mentioned it when he invited howard to join him at the two rivers research facility its nepotism howard said besidesdo i want this job everyone talks about you you know alan stern disappeared into some government program what a waste you want this job his uncle told him howard you remember a conversation we once had and he had recalled it almost word for word howard gave his uncle a long look you mean to say youre pursuing this question more weve touched it the mystery stern was grinninga little wildly howard thought weve put our hands on it thats all i can say for now think about it call me if youre interested fascinated despite himselfand lacking a better offerhoward had called he had been investigated approved entered onto the dod payroll he had shown up three days ago and toured a part of the facility but no one had explained its essential purpose the fundamental reason for these endless rooms computers concrete bunkers and steel doors even his uncle had remained aloof had smiled distantly it will all be clear in time he came over the rise and saw the buildings gilded with blue light saw the smoke rising from the central bunker worse he saw a fire department ladder truck and chase car inching down the access road the image fluid and indistinct he could not imagine what this veil of light might mean he knew only that it represented some disaster some tragedy of a bizarre and peculiar kind no one was moving in the complex at least no one out in the open the facility had its own fire control team but it wasnt anywhere near the smoldering central bunkerat least as far as howard could tell the blue light made his head swim maybe they were all dead including his uncle he thought alan stern had been at the center of this project that much had been obvious stern had been its lord its shaman its guiding presence if the accident was lethal it would have taken stern first of all all this fluorescence suggested some kind of radiation though nothing howard could pin downsomething powerful enough to kick photons out of the air he knew there was radioactive material at the facility he had seen the warning labels on the closed bunkers they had given him a film badge as soon as he passed the gate that was why hed chased the two rivers vfd all the way out here he didnt think smalltown volunteer firemen were trained or equipped to fight radioactive fires most likely they werent even aware of the danger they might blunder into an event more deadly than they could guess so howard had jumped into his car and rushed after meaning to warn themstill meaning to but he saw the trucks hesitate and stop then reverse wobble retreat he drove down the hillside to meet them assistant chief haldane saw the civilian automobile come over the rise but he was too dazed to worry about it he had climbed out of his car vomited once into the young weeds by the side of the road then sat on a wedge of natural granite with his head in his hands and his stomach still churning he didnt want to see anyone didnt want to speak to anyone what mattered was that he was beyond the border of blue light that he had found his way back into the world of sanity his relief was immense he took deep cleansing gulps of air pretty soon he would be back in his sane house in the sane town of two rivers and this nightmare would be over all these buildings could burn to the ground as far as he was concernedthe better if they did chief he spat on the ground to clear the taste of puke from his mouth then he looked up standing before him in blue jeans and a pressed cotton shirt was a civilian presumably the man from the automobile more like a boy though haldane thought with his pink skin and his bugeye glasses haldane didnt speak only waited for this apparition to justify its presence im howard poole the civilian said i work at the facility or i was supposed toi would be if this hadnt happened i came because i thought if you were fighting the fire you might not knowthere might be some radioactivity in there some particulate matter in the smoke poole seemed exquisitely uneasy particulate matter haldane said well thank you mr poole but i dont believe particulate matter is our problem right now i saw you turn back yessir haldane said that we did may i ask why some of the firefighters had shaken off their queasiness and gathered behind poole chris shank was there and tom stubbs both looking demoralized and numb under their helmets and scuffed turnout coats haldane said you work here you know more about it than me poole said noi dont understand any of this its like we crossed a line chris shank volunteered good old chris haldane thought never failed to open his mouth when he could just as well keep it shut we were heading down to size up the hazard and it was weird you know with all this light and everything but then we crossed some kind of line and suddenly it wasi mean you couldnt tell where you were going or coming from he shook his head there are things in there tom stubbs added haldane frowned that had been his own perception true enough things in there but he hadnt wanted to come out and say it from here the space between himself and the defense plant looked empty odd in some shimmery way but clearly deserted so he had seen what a hallucination but chris shank was nodding vigorously thats it he said i saw tell the man haldane said if they were going to talk about this they might as well speak plainly shank lowered his head awe and shame played over his face like light and shadow angels he said finally thats what i saw in there all kinds of angels haldane stared at him tom stubbs was shaking his head vigorously not angels nossir mister it was jesus christ himself in there poole glanced between the two men without comprehension and the saturday silence seemed louder now a crow screeched in the still air youre both fucked up chief haldane said he looked back into the nomansland of the research facility so thick with light that it seemed as if a piece of the sky had fallen onto it he knew what hed seen it was quite clear in his mind despite the nausea the sense of nodirection that had overtaken him he remembered it he remembered it vividly he would remember it forever he said theres no angels in there and there sure as hell aint jesus christ the only thing in there is monsters monsters poole said haldane spat into the dry earth a second time weary of all this you heard me what spread through the town that day was not panic but a deep abiding unease rumors passed from backyard to main street to gatepost by sunset everyone had heard about the miraculous barricades of virgin forest north and south on the highway several had also heard about chris shanks assertion that there were angels flying around the two rivers physical research laboratory some few even gave credence to tom stubbss claim that it was the second coming that jesus christ two hundred fifty feet tall and dressed in resurrection white was about to come striding into towna point of view condemned sunday morning at nearly every church service in town that sunday all the churches were full the weekend rolled on without electrical power phone service or adequate explanation most people stayed near their families and told each other it would all come clear soon that the lights would flicker back and the tv would make sense of things food stocks began to run low at the few grocery stores open for business the big supermarket at the riverview mall remained closed and without power for refrigeration some said it was just as wellafter two days of warm spring weather it must stink like sin in there saturday night dex graham and howard poole exchanged accounts of what they had seen they were careful at first not to strain each others credulity less cautious when they realized they had each witnessed miracles in the morning they set out to map the perimeters of the town dex drove while howard sat in the passenger seat with a recent survey map a pencil and a pair of calipers howard marveled at the southern interruption of the highway then marked it with careful precision on his chart similarly the northern limit then they followed private roads logging roads and the eastwest axis of the farm roads each ended abruptly in humid pine forest at the western margin of county route howard creased the map with his pencil and said we might as well quit it does get a little monotonous more than that howard held the map against the dashboard he had marked every dead end and joined them together a perfect circle dex observed with the town of two rivers in the southeastern quadrant howard used his calipers to mark the center of the circle but dex had already seen what it must be the old ojibway reserve the two rivers physical research laboratory where howard had seen veils of blue light and where the fire chief had seen monsters sunday a charter pilot named calvin shepperd took off from the air docks at the western end of lake merced and flew southeast toward detroitor the place on the map where detroit used to be from the air it was easy to see the circle dex graham and howard poole had mapped it was as clear as a cartographers line two rivers much of bayard countyhad been transplanted that was the word that occurred to him like his wifes droopy ficus transplanted into the kind of white pine forest that must have covered michigan when jolliet and la salle first crossed it shepperd a calm man understood none of this but refused to be frightened by it only observed took note and filed the information for later reference another troubling piece of information was that his vor receiver wasnt registering a signal which was okayshepperd was oldfashioned enough to have calculated his course with a vfr chart and a yardstick and his deadreckoning skills were quite intact thank you very much he was not one of these modern pilots rnav junkies lost without a computer but it was peculiar this radio silence he flew south by compass along the coast of the lower peninsula coming within sight of saginaw bay he should have passed bay city and he adjusted his course to take him over saginaw but neither town seemed to exist he did see a few settlementsfarms mineheads and some obvious forestry so there were people here but not until he was within sight of the detroit river did shepperd encounter anything he would call a town detroit was a town hell it was a genuine city but it was not detroit as shepperd had known it it was like no city he had ever seen there was air traffic here large but fraillooking planes he could not identify mainly to the south but no tower chatter or beacons he could pick up only hiss in the headphoneswhich made his presence here a danger he flew a broad circle low over the citys outskirts over long tinroofed buildings like warehouses hugging the rivers edge there were taller buildings of some dark stone narrow streets crowded with traffic vehicles he didnt recognize some of them horsedrawn afternoon sun stitched the city with shadows from shepperds vantage point it might have been a diorama something in a museum case not real surely to god he thought not real he had seen enough to make him nervous he flew home with the sun at his wingtip trying not to think about any of this it seemed too fragile to bear the weight of thought during the long trip back he fretted that he had made some error in his reckoning or that two rivers might have vanished in his absence that he would be forced to land in the wilderness but he knew this terrain even without its manmade landmarks as well as he knew his wife sarah the land was family it didnt betray him he was back on the calm surface of lake merced before nightfall he told no one what he had seen not even sarah she might have called him crazy and that would have been unbearable he thought about talking to someone in authoritythe police chief the mayor but even if they believed him what could they do with this kind of information nothing he thought nothing at all he decided to repeat the journey if only to convince himself that it had been real monday morning he refueled at the dock pumps and took off he charted the same course to the south but two rivers was barely beyond the green line of the horizon when shepperd turned back his heart pumping madly and his shirt drenched with sweat something out there had frightened him something in the combination of white pine wilderness and dark angular city had scared him off he didnt want to see it again he had seen too much already monday afternoon a formation of three strange aircraft flew over the town of two rivers the noise drew people into the streets where they shaded their eyes and stared up into the cloudless june sky superficially the aircraft were conventional enough certainly they were oldfashioned singleengine propellerdriven their quiltedmetal bodies brilliant in the sunlight the insignia on their wings were too distant to recognize but most people assumed the planes were military craft of some kind calvin shepperd thought they looked like world war iivintage ps and he wondered what had drawn them here maybe it was his fault maybe he showed up on some radar screen no telling what alarm he might have triggered but he didnt like that idea and like most of his ideas since the accident last saturday shepperd kept it to himself he watched the three strange aircraft circle once more and then wheel away to the south pale dots on a pale horizon evelyn woodward had spent the last of her household money on groceries and a set of fresh batteries for her radio the batteries were a dangerous luxurymoney was scarce and who knew when the bank might open againbut she still believed in the radio it was a lifeline once or twice in every long winter a snowstorm would send pine boughs plummeting onto the power lines and the house would grow cold and dark while the linemen battled the weather during those times evelyn would listen to her radio the blackout would be announced on wgst the affected counties would be named the calm of the announcer was contagious listening you knew the problem was temporary that there were people out there working on it mending things in the windy dark despite what dex and howard poole had said despite the length of the crisis so peculiar in this lovely june weather evelyn still nurtured her hope that the radio would revive perhaps wgst was unavailable but there had been that other station that curious fragment of it surely not as sinister as dex had made it seem she replaced the batteries and turned up the volume until the kitchen filled with the spit of static but no voice came through no matter she thought soon the radio was a private thing she turned it off when anyone came into the kitchen especially dex or howard she was afraid of seeming stupid or naive it was too easy to see herself as stupid or naive she didnt need anyones help anyway time to herself wasnt hard to find evenings dex and howard got together in the front room where dex had put the old hurricane lamp and they talked about the emergency as if by talking they could make it sensible as if they could bury it under the sheer weight of their words evelyn went to the kitchen and sat in the gathering dark with her radio sunday night monday night monday was the day the planes had flown over an event that had cheered her considerably dex of course put some paranoid interpretation on it to evelyn the meaning of the planes was much simpler the problemwhatever the problem washad come to someones attention it was being worked on it was being fixed that was the evening the radio began to talk again when evelyn heard the voices faint and laced with static she smiled to herself dex was wrong normality was not far off she sat at the kitchen table with sunset fading outside her dusty window and the radio close to her ear she listened to fifteen minutes of a radio play there were radio plays on this station about policemen who were religious or priests who were policemenshe couldnt tell the actors all had thick accents their accents sounded sometimes french sometimes english sometimes just unfamiliar they used curious words from time to time it must be a european play evelyn thought something avantgarde then there was an ad for muellers stonepressed white flour our purity is never questioned in a similar voice then a time check and the news according to the news there had been a naval battle in the yucatan channel with tremendous losses on all sides the logos was damaged and limping back to galveston but the spanish narvaez had sunk with all hands and the land campaign was meeting stiff resistance in the hills around cuernavaca at home the announcer went on ascension day had been marked by fireworks and public celebrations from coast to coast on an unhappy note incendiary displays in new york harbor had inadvertently set fire to a pitch and tar warehouse on the jersey shore and caused the death of three night watchmen a pacifist demonstration in montmagny had been broken up by police though it was claimed to be a student demonstration proctors said the majority of those arrested were either apostates trade unionists or jews more news at the turn of the hour but first dont mark another ascension without a new hat millinery to order at roberge hats and yardgoods a hat for every budget evelyn snapped off the radio resisting by a hair her urge to throw it across the room in the absence of television clifford stockton had spent much of the past three days in the company of his bicycle the bicycle was more than transportation it was his key to the mystery clifford was as curious about the events that had overtaken two rivers as any adultmaybe more so since there was no explanation he rejected out of hand aliens monsters miracles all fair game as far as clifford was concerned he had no theory of his own he had heard his mother laughing out loud but nervously at the idea that angels had been seen flying over the defense plant clifford wasnt keen on the idea of angels himself he wouldnt know what to expect from an angel but he didnt rule it out he had tried to get close to the research building on his bike but the two rivers police had posted a car at the access road to turn away the curious so he couldnt confirm any of this personally he didnt really care the defense plant was a long ride by bike there were mysteries closer to home for instance the mystery of coldwater road coldwater road ran for a couple of miles northeast past the cement factory it had been zoned for housing and water and power lines had been installed there were fireplugs planted like tropical shrubs in the raw earth of empty lots but no houses had been built hardly anyone went out coldwater road except teenagers at night he had heard and that was fine with clifford he had few friends and quite a few enemies among the kids his age clifford was nearsighted and thin a reader of books and watcher of television he liked his own company out on coldwater road he could spend an afternoon in the scrubby fields and patches of woods without much fear of interruption and that was good but since saturday coldwater road had changed the grid of vacant lots had been cut in half by what looked to clifford like an old old forest it was a mystery of enormous proportions the forest was deep and cool its floor was loamy and it smelled moist and pungent it was both inviting and frightening clifford didnt venture far into that dimness instead he was fascinated by its perimeter a straight line bisecting the blank lots maybe curving a little if you stood at the far end of the cleared land and sighted northeast along the treelinebut only maybe not every tree was intact where the white pines crossed the border they were neatly cut the cut trees were eerie clifford thought the heartwood was pale green and bled a sticky yellow sap on one side green branches thick with needles on the other nothing he tried to imagine some force that could have enclosed two rivers could have drawn it up from the world like the dough in a cookie cutter and deposited it here wherever here was a wilderness he had heard the phrase pathless wilderness and he guessed that was what this wasexcept clifford discovered it was not entirely pathless if you turned left where coldwater road ended if you followed the line of woods past the vacant lots over scrubland and a small hill from which he could see the cement factory and far beyond it the tangle of culsdesac that contained his own house and if you left your bike behind and persisted through berry canes and wildflowers and high weeds then you came to a trail a trail in the new forest which approached two rivers but ended there as all the towns roads ended at the forest it was a wide trail where the trees had been cleared and the undergrowth trampled down as if by trucks a logging road clifford would have called it but maybe it was not that he made no assumptions he walked a few yards down this path listening to the sway of the pines around him and smelling the moist pungency of moss it was like stepping into another world he didnt go far he worried that the connection between this forest and two rivers might close behind him that he would turn back and not be able to find his bike his house the town only more trees and more of this primitive road its source or destination monday riding home along coldwater road he saw three airplanes pass overhead another clue he thought he didnt know much about airplanes but it was obvious to clifford that these were oldfashioned they circled circled circled then veered away somebodys seen us he thought somebody knows were here he spent a day at home with his mother who was frightened but trying not to show it they opened cans of texasstyle chili and heated them over wax candles his mother played the portable radio that night and for a while there was music but not anything clifford or his mother recognized sad trilling songs then a mans voice that faded into static i dont know this station his mother said absently i dont know where its from in the morning clifford cycled back to the forest road he was there when more planes passed over the town bigger planes this time huge planes wings bristling with engines the planes dropped black dots into the june sky bombs clifford thought breathlessly but the dots grew billowing circles parachutes men dangling beneath a rain of them and he heard a rumbling from the earth under his feet and he ducked into the shadow of the trees and watched terrified from the margin of the road as a column of armored vehicles roared past in choking shrouds of dust and diesel smoke the men at their helms in black uniform bearing rifles with bayonets none of them aware of clifford watching as they broke from the forest into scrub waste and daylight and rumbled over sunlit empty lots to the gray ribbon of coldwater road chapter two autumn was wet in boston that year the rain began in midseptember and continued for three weeks without surceaseor so it seemed to linneth stone who had spent most of that time cloistered in the humanities wing of sethian college correcting page proofs and doublechecking footnotes pausing at odd moments to watch the rain sluice down the high windows and cascade from the rain gutters and over the casements of the library across the square pagan cults of mesoamerica was the first tangible fruit of her long struggle for tenure it both consolidated and justified her career she was proud of the book she loved the solid look of the typeset words invested with an authority the manuscript had lacked but she had been struggling with the book for half a decade and what she didnt like to admit was that the workher lifehad begun to border on tedium hours of minutiae days of solitary pageturning relieved by nothing much and the rain went on and on it was in its way not a bad kind of tedium her chamber was cosy enough she was warm against the weather and there was coffee from the hallway urn and the periodic clanking of the radiator like the complaining of some gruff but dependable old friend the time passed in neat packets of hours and days but it was repetitious time and it was often lonely few of the senior academics in her department knew what to make of a woman with tenure especially a relatively young woman she had turned thirtyfour in august young at least compared to those bearded venerables who had been haunting the stacks and carrels since the titans walked the earth they stared at her the way they might stare at a talking dung beetle or a chimp that had been trained to smoke cigars and each night she hurried home to her tiny apartment on theodotus street through the leaftumble and autumn air past rattling motorcarriages and bored dray horses from warmth to warmth the warmth of her hot plate and her quilted blankets this is success she told herself this is my career this is how i mean to spend the rest of my life but each night the memory came of her field expedition three summers ago in the sierra mazateca with her guides and two graduate students a time when she had often been frightened for her life when she had been dirty uncomfortable and too often helpless in the arms of fate now she would lie in bed reliving those months and as terrifying as that time had often been linneth thought it had not been tedious certainly she didnt want to go back to new spain that part of her research was finished in any case the entire area was a war zone but she wondered if the trip had not changed something inside her had not ignited an unsuspected appetite forwhat adventure surely not but for something to happen another milestone something that would matter in her life some nights it was almost a prayer she remembered her mother murmuring prayers at night ostensibly to apollo since daddy was a paidonomos in that cult but more likely to the land around their house in rural new york away from city lights where the stars were vivid on summer nights and the forest hummed with life a prayer to the local gods who went nameless in the new world at least since the aboriginals had been exterminated or driven west whose sybils had fallen silent or never spoken from their meadows we live in a breathless place linneths mother had once told her without pneuma no inspiration no wonder the hierarchs are so powerful here more powerful than she had guessed linneth thought for her mother the bad times had come all too soon still she allowed herself a small heretical prayer deliver me from this lonely sameness she thought and this damned rain but the gods her mother would have reminded her are capricious linneths deliverance came in an abrupt and unpleasant form and the rain went on for days she shook her raincoat off in the chipped tile lobby of her walkup building carried it dripping upstairs past two landings decorated with circular framed mirrors the bane of her life always giving back reflections at the least flattering hours dawn or dusk her hair was wet despite the rain cap and she looked small in the glare of the incandescent lamps small nose small round face compressed pale lips reluctant to offer a smile when she first moved in she had always smiled at herself in these mirrors she no longer bothered wet mouse she whispered linneth you are a wet mouse her wardrobe was conventionally black a black blouse and black floorsweeper buttonhooks tarnished with wear underneath she wore a modest bustle and corset that contorted her into the shape of she supposed an acceptable female don though there were not many guiding examples linneth took a longer look at herself in the mirror at the secondfloor landing women with careers were supposed to be hard she didnt look hard only weary there were smudges under her eyes she had stayed up late last night listening to the radio a program of war songs lonesome songs about separated lovers she tried to imagine what it must be like to have a lover at the frontin cuernavaca say where all those lovely white adobe buildings were being shelled she thought it must be terrible she walked down the hallway to her door which was ajar she stopped and looked at it had she left it open impossible she was compulsive about locking her door there had been robberies in the neighborhood perhaps she had been robbed the thought of it made her sick with apprehension she pushed on the door and it glided open there was a light on inside she was suddenly aware of the sound of her breathing and the rattle of rain on the frame of this old building she stepped through the tiny entranceway past the coat closet and into the sitting room there was a man inside he at calmly in her large chair with one long leg cocked over the other he seemed to expect her he wore the brown uniform of a senior proctor he was a middleaged man but trim his hair was thick and black his eyes were pale and patient he smiled at her linneth was numb with fright he said come in miss stone though you hardly need an invitation into your own home i know this is unexpected i apologize she didnt want to come in she wanted to bolt she wanted to run back out into the rainy dark but she drew a ragged breath and put her raincoat in the closet and stepped into the light of her floor lamp a sculptured wooden electric lamp which was the nicest of her meager furnishings but which she hated now because this man had touched it dont be afraid the proctor said she almost laughed he said you are linneth stoneare you not yes then sit down i havent come to arrest you she sat on the edge of her reading chair as far from the proctor as possible her racing heart had begun to recover its pace but her body was on full alert she felt keenly attentive the room seemed terribly bright wholly electric my name is demarch she looked at his pips he added lieutenant pronouncing it the european way as proctors did please relax miss stone im here for a consultation your department head said you were the person to speak to so the bureau had already talked to faculty this was serious demarch wasnt here to arrest her he claimed but who could believe a proctor she remembered the last time the proctors had come to her door her mother had answered linneth had not seen her mother again and there were other stories always new stories the knock at the door the disappeared colleague academics had been under scrutiny ever since the alien and sedition laws were enacted with her family background she could hardly be an exception demarch hadnt paid her the courtesy of knocking he could have come to see her at her office if it was a consultation he wanted but she supposed a proctor wouldnt do that they were too accustomed to intimidation it was their way of life so familiar as to be invisible she said is this about my book pagan cults of middle america meso she said mesoamerica not middle the proctor smiled again youve spent too much time proofreading mesoamerica ive read the manuscript your publishers have been cooperative its a fine scholarly work insofar as i can judge the ideological branch gave it careful attention of course disseminating falsehoods antireligio is still a felony but we do try to be reasonable science is science you dont strike me as a subversive thank you comparative ethnology isnt advocative there have been court cases i know this isnt about your book in any case though the book is what qualifies you we want you to do some work for the bureau de la convenance religieuse i have my own work nothing that cant wait weve arranged a sabbaticalif you choose to take it my book you must be nearly finished with the proofs she didnt deny it demarch would know all this there was a saying god sees the sparrow fall the bureau takes notes he said well need you for six monthspossibly as much as a year she was aghast it was too big an idea to swallow the bureau wanted her to work for them to go away for six months interrupt her life such as it was for what to practice the science of ethnology demarch said the thing youre good at i dont understand it isnt simple to explain im not sure i want an explanation you said i had a choice i dont want anything to do with it i understand i sympathize miss stone believe it or not if it were up to me i would leave it at that but i dont think the bureau as a whole would be happy with your decision but if i have a choice you do so do my superiors they have the choice of putting in a word with your publishers say or talking to the chancellor about your academic qualifications in light of your family history he saw her expression and held up his hands i wont say any of this is inevitable only that you run a risk if you refuse to cooperate she didnt answer couldnt find words to answer he added were not talking about manual labor on some penal farm this is the work youre trained to do after all and only six months out of a long career its much less than some people have been asked to give up for their country please linneth thought dont start talking about the war the noble dead it would be too much but demarch seemed to sense her reaction he fell silent his eyes fixed on her she said what would the bureau want with an ethnologist a woman at that she did not add it seemed out of character basically we want you to write an analysis of a foreign villageits mores and taboos something of its history in six months a sketch not a thesis isnt that the kind of thing you can look up in a book not in this case no i would be working from the field yes where it was something to do with the war she guessed new spain almost certainly demarch said you agree to cooperate rather than losing tenure facing a felony charge or some secret trial you know better than that under the circumstances what can i say demarch had stopped smiling you can say i agree the words he actually wanted the words linneth gave him a long defiant look demarch didnt acknowledge it only gazed passively back his uniform was crisp and neat and somehow more intimidating because of it her own rainwet clothing smelled of damp wool and defeat she lowered her head i agree she whispered pardon me his voice was neutral i agree yes he reached for his attache case then let me show you some extraordinary photographs she was allowed three days to finish her corrections to the page proofs linneth paid scrupulous attention to the work using it to blot out of her mind the story lieutenant demarch had told her even after she had seen the photos the strange town so seemingly real the shopfronts displaying impossible goods the signs in a language only approximately english she still halfbelieved that it was a hoax some elaborate ruse the bureau had devised to trick her into confessing well something anything that she would end up in prison after all in the hallway she passed the department head abraham valcour who returned her cold stare with an aloof little smile there were rumors that valcour had contacts in the war department that some of his field expeditions had carried commissariat spies as part of their luggage linneth had reserved judgment but not any longer it was valcour she was certain who had sent the proctors to her door she imagined the conversation speak to this one shes intelligent and malleable wrote a decent book he could be maddeningly plausible when he wanted to lie he had never cared for the idea of a woman in his department though her academic bona fides had been inarguable certainly he had never passed up an opportunity to slight her this was merely the logical next step giving her to the proctors like a choice bone to a kennel full of dogs no doubt he hoped she wouldnt be back linneth vowed that she would be back if only to erase his maddening smile two rivers she thought the name of the town that had appeared in the deep forest of northern mille lacs was two rivers the page proofs went to her publisher bound in brown waxed paper and tied with string home she packed her heaviest clothes autumn came early in the northern near west winters she had heard could be very cruel she said goodbye to her secretary and to a few graduate students there was no one else chapter three classes at john f kennedy high school started late that year it was a miracle dex thought that they had started at all he gave credit to the principal bob hoskins and a feisty committee of local parents they had negotiated an agreement with the proctors who probably decided it would be safer keeping restless teenagers penned up during the day than to let them run loose the problem well one problem in a sea of trouble was texts like every library in two rivers the school library had been sacked indexed the proctors said the books had gone out in truckloads last augustnot to be burned it was claimed but into storage no doubt into some monkish secret archive some classified dungeon the military consul had even offered new texts and perhaps that was inevitable if school went on but dex had been appalled by the example hed been shown a giltedged volume that might have passed for a mcguffeys reader of the s full of crude cautionary verses about the dangers of syphilis and distilled liquor and fragments of history that seemed dubious even in the context of this weirdly twisted rabbit hole into which the town had fallen hews and heresiarchs daniel at ravensbreuck what was won and lost at the fields of flanders handing out such documents to a class raised on super mario and the ninja turtles was more than dex liked to imagine so he taught his classes informally as he had always taught them american history from the revolution to the first world war he wrote chapters and printed them on an ancient spirit duplicator someone had dragged up from the basement history of course was not what it used to be not here but despite the formidable evidence of the last four months he could not convince himself that this was meaningless work that he was communicating to his dwindling classes the folk tales of some lost and impossible dreamland these events had happened they were formative they had consequences the town of two rivers for instance and everyone in it he was teaching real history or so he believed but his students tended to be listless and today was no exception he taught without books electric lights a heated classroom or much enthusiasm and he was relieved like everyone else when the day was over he walked home through long shadows curfew began at six but the streets were already deserted except for military traffic over the last three months dex had trained himself not to look at the boxy patrol cars they were always the same a driver in a black beret and a man with a rifle and fixed bayonet riding next to him both wearing an expression of bland bored hostility it was a kind of face you probably saw a lot of in honduras or beijing it was not a face dex had ever expected to see in two rivers but as dorothy gale might have observed he wasnt in michigan anymore he had given up trying to guess what the nature of this place truly was the only words that applied were words he had learned from the twilight zone another dimension whatever that meant he climbed the stairs to his apartment the front room was as dim and cold as it had been all this autumn the military were supposed to be running in a highvoltage line from the south but hed believe that when he saw it in the meantime it was cold and the winter would be much colder deadly unless arrangements were made his sofa bed was open and tangled with blanketsevery blanket he owned in that brief impossible time last june between the accident and the military occupation he had been clever enough to buy a hurricane lantern and a supply of lamp oil the lamp gave him an extra half hour or so of light each evening enough to read by the proctors hadnt confiscated every book in town there were still personal libraries including his own seven shelves of paperbacks he was rereading mark twain a bracing exercise under the circumstances he ate cold soup out of the can the proctors had distributed ration coupons mimeographed on rag paper you redeemed them for food at the dispensary in the iga parking lot dex had used up his coupons early in the week but was sparing with the nonperishable items water came from a truck in front of city hall you lined up with your old milk jug or a camping thermos or whatever container was handy the wait was generally about an hour and the water tasted of gasoline he had not had a hot shower since june it was possible dex had established to keep himself clean with a cloth rag and a little soap and a jug of water at room temperature but there was no pleasure in it he had begun to dream about showers he read by the fading daylight until it was too dark then put the book aside and watched nightfall through his narrow window a rack of cloud had moved in and the wind was gusting the street was full of tumbling leaves nobody had raked or burned their leaves this year the town seemed tatty seemed gone to seed tonight he didnt light the hurricane lamp when the room was dark when the streets were dark he changed into a black tshirt blue jeans and a navy blue overcoat he put a can of soup in one pocket two cans of orange soda in the other after a moments thought he added a bottle of aspirin in dexs experience everybody obeyed the curfew there had been a few exceptions in july a twentysevenyearold man named seagram had been shot when he tried to cross town after dark to visit his girlfriend the body had been on display in the city hall courtyard for three ghastly days the patrols had eased somewhat since then but dex was still careful stepping out the front door of his building into the windy street the wind was an asset the tossing of the trees the rattle of all these dry leaves disguised any sound he was likely to make there were no streetlights only the occasional flicker of candlelight from curtained windows that was good too he followed a line of hedges to beacon road and took a good long look before jogging across the intersection to the corner of powell creek park the park was fine cover but hazardous in the cloudy dark he followed the faint shine of a footpath he ducked behind a willow tree as a military patrol rounded the corner from oak behind the lightless brick primary school tires crackling on dry leaf the soldier in the shotgun seat scanned the sidewalks with a highintensity lamp dex crouched motionless taking shallow breaths until the engine sound and the flickering light faded then he crossed the street to a small woodframe house over a lawn grown wild to the back down a short span of concrete steps to a basement door he had memorized the route in the dark he could see almost nothing a tree hissed in the black space of the yard drops of rain spattered his coat and the air on his lips was cold and moist he opened the door without knocking when it was firmly closed behind him he struck a match and touched it to the wick of a candle this basement room was windowless the floor was concrete there were stacks of blankets food cans most empty a few books a primus stove there was a mattress on the floor and on the mattress howard poole his eyes were closed his forehead beaded with sweat dex sighed and emptied cans from the pockets of his coat at the sound howard turned his head and looked up just me dex said the younger man nodded thirsty he said dex popped a can of soda and pressed two aspirin into howards hand the hand was hot but maybe not as hot as it had been yesterday howard was suffering from a flu that had been threatening to turn into pneumonia dex believed the crisis had passed but nothing was certain anymore howard turned his wristwatch to catch the candlelight then sat up in a slow pained motion its after curfew uhhuh kind of risky coming here i didnt want to be followed you thought you might be a couple of proctors came to the door this morning they know your name they know you worked at the plant and they know you were rooming at evelyns they were civilized no pushing but a guy followed me to work i thought it would be better to come here in the dark jesus howard rolled to one side its not as bad as it sounds i didnt get the feeling they were hunting you downjust putting some hooks in the water howard sighed he looked tired of it all dex thought worn out by the sickness the cold the hiding it was not more than ten days after the tanks rolled into two rivers that the military had announced their desire to interview employees of the two rivers physical research lab howard had refrained from volunteering then a lieutenant of the bureau de la convenance religieuse a man named symeon demarch took over evelyns bedandbreakfast and turned it into his headquarters and howard had gone into hiding the house they were in was ostensibly empty it had belonged to paul cantwell a cpa who had been in florida with his family when the accident happened howard had lifted an expired michigan drivers license from a desk upstairs and used it to pass as paul cantwell at the ration lineups when he came down with the flu some variant germ that rode in with the tanks half the people in town had caught it dex used the id to pick up double rationsa risky business since hoarding was a punishable offense and id fraud a capital crime under military law howard said vaguely i was having a dream when you came in something about stern he was in a building a building all covered with jewels but i dont remember the words trailed off stern again dex thought since the fever set in howard had often talked about his uncle alan sternwho had been the moving force behind the two rivers physical research lab who had died presumably in the accident the fever seemed to have revived him in howards mind a woman howard said faintly deliriously a woman answered the phone dex opened a can of soup and put a spoon into the younger mans hand howards fingers closed on it in a spasm that was almost reflexive when i phoned him in two rivers howard was saying a woman is this important the question seemed to clear a shadow he gave dex a guilty odd smile i dont know maybe he put the spoon in his mouth cold soup its good for you how do you feel by the way a little better ive been awake more often at least i think so its kind of timeless down here and he took another spoonful not so many trips to the shitter ive even been a little bit hungry good he ate in silence for a time it seemed to dex that the soup and the aspirin were working a slow transformation in him it was heartening to see they listened as the rain picked up its pace rattling on a tin awning out back howard put down the empty can and licked the spoon a last time i was talking about my uncle this isnt just raving dex i know i havent been too coherent but he was the key to this whole event maybe our key to understanding it you think we have a chance of understanding it i dont know yes maybe maybe howard could figure out what had happened at the research lab dex surely couldnt he had a hard time understanding the bohr model of the atom much less a physical process so catastrophic that it could somehow rewrite history what had happened here was not physics ait wasnt on any curriculum dex had ever heard of he shook his head youre talking to a humanities major bucko maybe we have to understand it do we i thought about it a lot you lie here in the dark you do a lot of thinking its our only choice dex we understand it and do something about it or we just what go on like this get killed or imprisoned or best case get assimilated dex had had these thoughts too and so probably had most of the citizens of two rivers but no one ever talked about it it was the great unspoken truce we will not discuss the future howard had broken the rule you are feverish dont brush me off okay dont humor me either im not that sick im sorry if i knew where to begin i keep thinking about stern i dreamed about him with the fever there were times i thought he was here i mean here in the room very real howard shook his head and sank back into the mattress it all seemed so logical it made more sense in dreams dex went home after midnight the weather sheltered him from view and kept military patrols to a minimum but his clothes were heavy with cold rain and he was shivering helplessly by the time he came within sight of his walkup apartment building maybe howard was right he thought maybe it all made more sense in dreams maybe dreaming was the only way to approach something so incomprehensible dex had coped better than most because his own life had passed into the territory of dreams long ago he had been sleepwalking since the fire took abigail and david away from him his life since then had been a kind of shadowy anticlimax in which even the events of the last few months had been hardly more than a recapitulation his own bereavement somehow woven into the fabric of the larger world he supposed evelyn had sensed this about him that even the tenderness that had passed between themand it had been a real tendernesswas nevertheless eclipsed by something darker he supposed that was why she had elected to stay in the boarding house with the proctor demarch she had been afraid of course but not only afraid she had known about dex what he had been what he had lost he stood in the darkness under the lintel of the old apartment building and fumbled his wet key into the lock he thought about evelyn woodward and what she had meant to him for a time she had seemed to be a doorway back into a world from which he had been exilednot a replacement for abigail but a way out of this blind canyon his life had become into the highlands the sunwashed places in which he had almost ceased to believe she hadnt been equal to that aroused need and who could be it was better not to want such things he had arrived at a sort of modus vivendi with his grief and such deals were best not broken you wore your grief and if necessary you ate it and you drank it until it became your substance until you looked in the mirror one day and there was nothing looking back but grief itself a man made entirely of sorrow but still standing somehow still alive surviving he left his wet clothes hanging over the curtain rod in the shower stall and went to bed craving these few hours of oblivion before another dawn the knock at the door startled him awake the knock was peremptory and fierce a proctors knock he woke blinking at daylight his heart pounding hard he went directly to the door and opened it apprehensive but not afraid he was too tired of all this to be afraid the only light in the dim hallway was a patch of pale october morning through the eastfacing window two junior proctors pinkcheeked youngsters only just beginning to master the routine arrogance of the professional religious policeman looked at dex and past him into the room then they moved to opposite sides of the door a woman stepped forward bewildered dex could only stare she was wearing what he supposed his greatgrandmother might have worn in her youth a black highcollared longsleeved floorlength dress fixed with buttonhooks over the kind of corset that rendered the female figure as an sshape all bosom and buttocks definitely not a uniform there was too much lace at the collar and cuffs her dark hair was parted in the middle and swept back to frame her face she was about as tall as his collarbone she looked at dex with a fierce determination but she was blushing at the same time maybe because hed come to the door in nothing but briefs and a sleeveless tshirt she said im sorry to disturb you are you mr dexter graham she spoke with that odd accent he had heard from some of the soldiers the inflections were european the vowel sounds almost irish she made dexter graham into something exotic the name of a north country highwayman in a walter scott epic he overcame his speechlessness and said yes i am my name is linneth stone lieutenant demarch sent me to speak to you she paused i can wait if you need to dress the blush deepened a little okay dex said thank you and went to look for his pants chapter four evelyn had been willing to stand in line for water like everyone else she had stood in line before there were special deliveries to the house every tuesday and thursday and the proctors were generous with it but she liked having her own ration it permitted small luxuries a private cup of coffee when there was coffee or tea or just a quick extra wash on a hot day the water line was a small nuisance and she didnt begrudge the time she spent there her new dress changed all that the dress was a wonderful gift and she had accepted it in the spirit in which it was given but not without reservations it made the growing gulf between herself and the townspeople too obvious the dress was of some faintly iridescent dark green material bombazine twilled with silk the lieutenant had said it came with a complement of underclothing so baroque that she had needed an instruction manual which the lieutenant also supplied a tiny hardbound volume called appearance its perfection for women by mrs will once evelyn had deciphered mrs wills peculiar spelling sorted out a stay from a buttonhook and understood that in this place a pin was called a pince she managed all right she even liked sort of the way she looked in the dress the effect was victorian of course prim but it did interesting things for her figure to be so thoroughly covered and at the same time so completely advertisedit was odd and oddly interesting in boston and new york the lieutenant said all the finer women dressed like this but two rivers wasnt boston or new york it hadnt been even in the old days and that was the problem she had already been accused of taking favors from the proctors who were lodged in her house eleanor camby the undertakers wife had stood behind her in a ration line and whispered the word quisling over and over again evelyn didnt know the word but understood immediately what it meant collaborator traitor to stand in a similar line wearing green bombazine and lace collars no not possible she could have just worn her old clothes when she went into the street but evelyn sensed that this was precisely what the lieutenant did not want the purpose of the dress or one of its purposes was to make her different to make her unique so when she wanted her water ration she begged a ride from one of the junior officers evelyn thought of them all as baby proctors their ranks were too complex to remember in this case a young man named malthus feliks feliks drove her downtown in one of those boxy care that looked like antique jeeps feliks wasnt talkative but he was courteous to herand that was refreshing she had learned to expect contempt or at best indifference from the junior officers they were trained that way she supposed too they must be intimidated by the strangeness of two rivers the town had become a terrifyingly strange place no matter which end of the glass you peered through today feliks drove along the leafchoked streets at a less than bonebruising clip and even smiled once an acrid proctors smile but genuine when she commented on the particular blue of the sky last nights rain had cleared the air october skies evelyn thought were the bluest of all it was the dress she thought that made feliks more courteous if not the dress itself then what it represented his commanding officers imprimatur a mark of possession if not rank no she scolded herself no dont think about it that way even if feliks does she was dismayed to discover that the water truck had been moved today it was parked in the lot behind jfk high school of all places she considered telling feliks to turn around it wasnt worth the risk of being seennot here but feliks might tell the lieutenant which would leave the wrong impression and what fundamentally was she ashamed of nothing she had nothing to hide water was dispensed to ration card holders between the hours of noon and six the truck had only just arrived feliks exchanged words with the militiamen lounging in the cab of the tanker the bureau de la convenance religieuse wasnt a branch of the armed forces feliks didnt officially outrank these men but evelyn had noticed the way the military deferred to the religious police the powers of the bureau were vague hence enormous the lieutenant had told her it was easy he said perhaps too easy all things considered for a censeur or a senior proctor to make trouble for an enlisted man so naturally the soldiers were wary of them a surly militiaman unlocked the spigot at the back of the truck evelyn took her camping thermos from the car feliks wouldnt fill it for her and she knew better than to ask it was her water her chore she stooped to fit the thermos under the steel faucet and swept her dress out of the way with one hand the water gushed out and spattered her shoes it looked clean but smelled faintly of oil it always did she filled the thermos to the very top and capped it as she walked to the car she risked a glance back at the school specifically at the secondfloor room where dex taught history to his dwindling classes was there a shadow there was he watching her had he seen the dress she turned away and walked with her head high she didnt care whether he had seen her she told herself so there was no reason anymore to care what dex graham thought the military forces had occupied a days inn on the highway east of town all the civilian automobiles had been bulldozed out of the parking lot and replaced with military machinestanks troop carriers jeeps the flag of the consolidated republic flew from a newly installed wooden staff snapping in the brisk october breeze and evelyn gazed at it while feliks performed his own chore delivering a dossier to one of the military commanders the flag was blue with white bars and a red star in the middle it might have been any countrys flag evelyn thought it was not the american flag but it was not threateningly strange she had gradually grown accustomed to the idea that two rivers had somehow traveled by standing still that it had arrived in a place where things were substantially foreign as an idea it was incomprehensible as a fact of lifeone adjusted or at least one ought to she had adjusted to other changes evelyn had been married for three years to a man in traverse city a notary public named patrick cotter she had believed that would last forever too and it hadnt her connection to patrick had been as fragile as the connection between two rivers and the united states of america and her engagement to dex that had foundered just as quickly when the lieutenant moved in the lesson there was no reliable glue to bind the parts of the world nothing was certain except change the trick was to land on your feet dex had not adjusted that was his problem he was still chewing some old bone of selfloathing it had made him eccentric and stern feliks drove her home in contrast to the military the proctors were relatively few and had chosen a headquarters by the lakeshore most of them were bivouacked in the blue view motel civilian employees of the bureau de la convenance had a wing to themselves the highestranking proctors including the lieutenant and his pions had lodged at evelyns b b she still liked the way the house looked three stories of victorian gingerbread with a view of lake merced she had paid for a great deal of restoration when she bought the building and it was still clean despite a summer of neglect the white paint hadnt faded from the siding or the robins egg blue from the trim she left feliks to tend his car and hurried inside it was almost time for lunch she didnt serve lunch there was a kitchen at the blue view with a gasolinepowered generator and provisions shipped in daily most noons she had the house to herself she opened a ration can one of the military rations the lieutenant had brought her contents nameless but not bad if you were hungry enough and she heated a kettle of her new water over a coleman stove on the back porch tea bags her last two went into the china pot she added hot water and inhaled the earthy fragrance would there ever be more tea yes she thought there would things would be normalized she would adjust there was always a reward for adjusting small pleasures tea she took a careful precious sip and gazed across the water lake merced was choppy in the autumn wind empty under a blue sky as empty as evelyn wished she could be utterly empty of all thought the lieutenant came home at dusk she still thought of him as the lieutenant though she knew his full name symeon philip demarch born in columbia a town on the chesapeake river to an englishspeaking family with longstanding bureau connections fortyfive years old symeon evelyn thought it sounded almost like simon like the flag of the republic his name was strange but not completely foreign she had adjusted to it he came to the kitchen and asked her to brew coffee he gave her a bag of militaryissue ground coffee almost half a pound evelyn guessed and whispered to her save some for later he finished business with two of his adjutants and sent them out of the room the house was dark now and evelyn began rummaging for lamp oil dont the lieutenant said symeon she put the bottle back on its high shelf and waited for him to explain he smiled and went to the dining room table where there was a military radiotelephone in a scuffed black case he took up the receiver cranked the handle and said a single word now symeon she was bewildered what and then a remarkable thing happened the lights came on clifford stockton was in his room when the electricity came back he had gone to bed early he went to bed early most nights what else was there to do under the blankets he was at least warm but now the ceiling light winked ontentatively at first as if distant turbines were struggling with the load then brightly steadily and clifford winced at the sudden glare and wondered whether everything had changed again he climbed out of bed and went to the window most of the town of two rivers was hidden behind the near wall of the carrasco house next door but the glow in the sky meant that all the lights were on including the downtown signs and the big spotlights in the mall parking lot all reflecting from a shelf of low cloud that had rolled in with sunset the corner of town clifford was able to see looked like a constellation of new stars a handful of fire scattered over the earth beyond powell creek park he had forgotten the way it looked it looked like christmas clifford thought cliffy that was his mothers voice as she hurried up the stairs choked with excitement she opened the door of his room and stared wideeyed at him cliffy isnt it wonderful she looked feverish he thought her eyes too bright skin flushed redor maybe it was just the sudden light she waved her hand and he followed her downstairs he was wearing his pajamas he hadnt been downstairs in his pajamas in a long time it hadnt seemed safe she danced through the kitchen opened the microwave oven to see the light come on ran a finger along the gleaming white enamel of the refrigerator coffee she said i think we have some left stale but who cares cliffy im making a pot of coffee great he said can i watch tv tv yes yes turn it on then a soberer thought it probably wont get any stations though i dont think were really back home i think they just hooked up the electricity we could watch a tape clifford said god yes play a tape turn it up loud what should i play anything anything he took a dusty tape from the top of the stack by the tv untouched for months no label he plugged it in it was the last thing his mother had recorded and it was nothing special a friday installment of the tonight show she had meant to watch saturday morning back in june the theme music startled him it sounded amazingly realistic he was afraid someone outside the house might hear itbut that was stupid all over town people must be playing videotapes or records or cds or whatever noisy thing they felt like the colors on tv were supernaturally vivid clifford sat mesmerized by the screen he didnt listen to the talk just relished the sound of the voices it was all so boisterous so carelessly happy the sound of the tv was like christmas in a box and clifford didnt understand why it made his mother cry evelyn wore her new dress upstairs and looked at herself in the standing mirror she liked the way the new light reflected from the peaks and shadowy valleys of the cloth it looks very well symeon said not good or nice but well she liked the way he talked he was very courteous very oldworld thank you she tried to sound demure not too brazen i feel like i havent thanked you enough the dress symeon said his smile was enigmatic his eyes obscure she said the dress take it off youll have to help me with the stays of course his hands were large but deft chapter five linneth stone followed dex to the high school and sat at the back of his morning classes flanked by the sullen proctors in their brown woolen uniforms she called them pions according to dexs frenchenglish dictionary a checker or pawn but she used the word respectfully for two days dex discussed the civil war while this petite woman in victorian dress took notes and methodically filed them in a calfskin binder each day attention in the classroom migrated away from dex and toward these apparitions seated at the rear dex had hoped the situation would improve now that electrical power had been restored but it didnt the fluorescent ceiling lights only made her presence seem more exotic today at lunch he told her so they sat in the staff cafeteria there was no hot food but the artificial light dispelled some of the gloom of the cavernous space dex had brought a bag lunch linneth flanked by her guards sat without eating and listened to his complaints i understand the problem she said i didnt mean to create a distraction you have though and that isnt the only problem its not clear to me what youre hoping to achieve here obviously a nod at the proctors i cant stop you from sitting in on classes but id like to know what the purpose of it is she paused a moment her expression angelic and distracted collecting her thoughts only to learn from you nothing more sinister to study two rivers andi dont know what to call itthe place two rivers came from your plenum all right but to what end if i cooperate who am i helping youre helping me but i see what you mean mr graham its really very simple i was asked to write a social study of the town asked by whom the bureau de la convenance religieuse the proctors but please remember im a contract employee i work for the bureau but i dont represent the bureau not directly there are several of us in town civilian workers i mean mainly academics for instance there is a surveyor an electrical engineer a documentary photographer a medical doctor each one writing a report you pose the question with too much malice if the circumstances were reversed mr graham if one of our villages had appeared in your world wouldnt your government do the same thing compile records try to understand the miracle that had happened people have died here in good conscience i dont know if i can cooperate i cant speak for your conscience i can only say that my work isnt harmful in your eyes its certainly a nuisance to my workweve already established that lieutenant demarch sent me to you because he thought a teacher of history would have a broader grasp of cultural issues did he my guess is that he was hoping to piss me off she blinked but forged ahead i wont attribute motive the point is that i can go elsewhere if im interfering with the school i really dont care to cause trouble her meekness was maddening also deceptive she was relentless dex thought he looked at her over the trestle table searching for something in the composition of her features a glimpse under the porcelain exterior she came from the world outside two rivers but she wasnt a proctor or a soldierand that made her nearly unique potentially interesting too her curiosity seemed genuine she might or might not be a tool of the bureau but there were obviously questions she wanted to ask fair enough he had a few questions of his own he said maybe we can compromise in what way well first of allyoud be a lot less conspicuous if you lost your bookends im sorry the gentlemen attached to your elbows both guards gave dex a stony glare meant to intimidate him he smiled back he was tired of the proctors they dressed like boy scouts and swaggered like hall monitors pions a good word he thought i will have to talk to lieutenant demarch she said i cant promise anything but the idea seemed to appeal to her you might consider changing the way you dress too it draws attention i have considered that but im new here mr graham im not sure what would be appropriate or appropriately modest youre staying at the woodward bedandbreakfast nearby the motor hotel youve met evelyn woodward briefly shes about your size maybe she can lend you something she seems to have a new wardrobe these days yes well perhaps do you have any other requirements certainly a quid pro quo i want something for my time and what would that be a map of the world an atlas if possible and a good basic history your history for mine right she surprised him by smiling ill see what i can do his fever broke the night the lights came back to two rivers and howard poole emerged from his sickness feeling fragile but immensely clearheaded it was as if the disease had starved all confusion from the bone of logic he waited a day for dex to show up but the schoolteacher didnt come that was all right howard thought it wasnt always easy for dex to get away he might have been followed it didnt matter it was time to take some initiative on his own at noon when the ration lines opened and the streets were most crowded howard packed some food and bottled water and a camp knife into the ample pockets of a big navy jacket and stepped out into the biting october air maybe he had been in hiding too long or maybe it was the autumn weather but everything he looked at seemed to have been cut from a luminous glass sidewalks windows the tumbled leaves of the trees were all thin as ice under a cellophaneblue sky he wanted to take it all in at once to hoard these colors against another dark season he forced himself to walk with his head down he didnt dare attract attention he was carrying identification actually paul cantwells id lucky paul howard thought on vacation when the roof of the world fell in it was good documentation but there was obviously no photo id and the cards if you looked closely were all out of dateexcept for the ration card he might pass muster if the military questioned him but he might not he didnt want to run that risk it was better not to arouse suspicion he crossed the intersection of oak and beacon and walked east past lifeless businesses shop windows shadowy and haunted by ghosts by cameras computers fashionable clothes bigscreen tv sets no one had stolen these things even in the chaotic first days of the military occupation nobody wanted them they were useless to the natives and frighteningly foreign to the soldiers the trinkets and ornaments of a lost race the town had been in a kind of trance howard thought ever since the tanks rolled down coldwater road last june there had been some gestures of resistance all futile a couple of nra types had taken some ineffectual shots from their upperstory windows both men were apprehended and executed publicly and without trial two rivers was a huntingfishing town and howard supposed there were a great many people with their remingtons still primed and hidden but what could one rural county do against the weight of a nation declare independence in a way they were lucky as occupations go this one had not been exceptionally brutalat least not yet he remembered reading about phnom penh under the khmer rouge where civilians had been shot to death for wearing european eyeglasses or for no reason at all there had been no such slaughter here maybe because the battle had been so onesided and the prize so peculiar so the town had capitulated to its occupation with a dazed shrug howard was no exception he had gone into hiding almost gratefully hiding was something he was good at he had grown up fragile and chronically thin beaten for his awkwardness he had learned to take his beatings and go home he had never complained or even plotted revenge there had always been the solace of a book the name of this behavior howard thought was cowardice he had stopped denying it long ago had even acknowledged it as a fundamental component of his character he knew two essential facts about himself that he was smart and that he was a coward it wasnt the worst draw in lifes lottery a memory came wafting up from his childhood often during his illness he had been surprised by these gusts of memory and maybe he was still sick because here came another he was ten years old on the porch of the house in queens listening to the rumble of his parents voices to one of their winding pleasantly silly marathons of talk some people believe his father had said in reincarnationthat we live again and again and in each life we have a task a thing to do or a thing to learn he had reached out absently to ruffle his sons hair what about you howie what is it your business to learn this time around howard had been young enough to take the idea seriously the question plagued him for days what was he supposed to learn something difficult he guessed or else why dedicate a life to it something he had resisted in all his other lives some everest of knowledge or virtue let it be anything he thoughtthe names of all the stars the origin of the universe the secrets of time and space let it be anything but courage past midtown the streets were mostly empty it was harder to be inconspicuous here he shuffled with his hands in his pockets where possible he took suburban roads winding his way through the newer and bleaker housing projects that marked the western extremity of two rivers the military patrols would not likely come this way there was nothing here to draw them still he had to be careful the soldiers had made a barracks out of a days inn on the highway midway between two rivers and the ruins of the physical research laboratory not far from here howard had pored over a map of the town in the days before the tanks came and he had a good memory for maps but these curving roads and culsdesac confused him by the time he found an obscure and plausible way eastfollowing a line of electrical towers where the trees and scrub had been cut backit was nearly curfew he had planned for that he crossed the highway where it met boundary road and followed it a quarter mile north staying close to the drainage ditch on the left the shadows were already very long there were no houses out here nothing but junk maples and the occasional crumbling gas station he reached his first objective before dark a tiny bait and camping gear shop close to the border of the old ojibway reserve he had stopped here with dex graham last june dex had bought a map and a compass both long since lost the store was a tar paper shack with a shingle out front uninhabited as howard had supposed it would be he took a long look up and down the highway he listened for a time there was no sound but the rattle of a solitary cricket in the chilly dusk a fat rustred padlock protected the front door howard picked his way through a scatter of bald tires past the rusting hulk of a mercury cougar to the rear door this door was also padlocked but one brisk tug separated the latch from the rotting wood of the frame a powerful stench wafted out of the dark interior howard hesitated repulsed then he thought the bait jesus there had been two big freezers full of herring roe and dew worms in here over the summer the contents must have fermented he stepped inside breathing through his mouth the only light was the last blue of the sky through a dusty window howard moved cautiously down an aisle of bulk goods he selected three items a frame backpack a doubleinsulated sleeping bag and a oneman tent he carried them outside and paused to take three cleansing gasps of air then he stuffed the folded tent into the backpack and tied the sleeping roll underneath he shouldered the pack and adjusted its straps on his shoulders then he walked north along the highway until he found a trail into the woods the trail was mossy and overgrown but seemed to take him in approximately the right direction he walked for twenty minutes into the wooded ojibway land then it was too dark to go any farther he pitched his tent on stony soil and managed to cover it with a nylon fly as the last light faded finally he tossed his bedroll inside and climbed in after it it would be cold tonight maybe cold enough to snow if the clouds thickened october snow he thought he remembered early snowfalls in new york those brittle small flakes groundwater frozen into crusts of ice old leaves crisp as dry paper he had chosen the sleeping bag blindly but it was a good one a winter bag he was warm inside it he had walked a long way and he fell asleep before the last light was gone from the sky the dream came as it had come every night for weeks less a dream than a recurring image that had insinuated itself into his sleep it was an image of his uncle of alan stern but not as howard remembered him this alan stern was emaciated and translucent naked his back to howard and his spine cruelly visible under the faint taut flesh in the dream he knew that his uncle was bound or connected to an egg of light larger than himself howard thought it looked like a nuclear explosion captured by a still camera as the shock wave began to expand a static moment between nanoseconds of destruction and stern was either held by it or holding it or somehow both he turned his head to look at howard his thin face seemed unutterably ancient wizened under a wild rabbinical beard his expression was a combination of agonizing pain and a fierce preoccupation stern howard tried to say im here but no sound came and nothing registered on his uncles tortured face maya stern used to tell him a hindu word it meant the world as illusion reality as a veil of deception you have to look behind the may a thats your duty as a scientist it came naturally to stern for howard it was much more difficult one summer on a beach in atlantic city family vacation stern picked up a stone and gave it to howard and said look at it it was an ancient pebble polished by the sea smooth as glass green as the shadows under water shot through with veins of rusty red the pebble was warm where the sun had been on it underneath it was cool in his hand its pretty howard had said idiotically stern shook his head forget pretty thats this stone you have to abstract its essence learn to hate the particular howard love the general dont say pretty look harder gypsum calcite quartz those are the questions you have to ask pretty is may a pretty is the stupid mans answer yes but he didnt have stems razor intellect he put the stone in his pocket he liked it its particular color its coolness its warmth howard woke in the deep of the night he knew at once it was latewell past midnight still a long time before morning he felt breathless and weak in the grip of the sleeping bag he had slept with his left arm bent under his body and the arm was numb a useless weight of tissue but he didnt move something had woken him howard had gone camping once before a weeklong expedition in the smoky mountains with his parents he knew there were noises in the forest and that any odd sound was liable to wake a sleeper in the dark he told himself there was nothing to be afraid of the only real danger was from the soldiers and they were hardly likely to be out in the woods at this hour still he was afraid of what he might have heard or sensed the fear like a door that had opened in some deep chamber of his body he gazed into the darkness of the tent there was nothing to see nothing to hear either except the rattle of wind inthe trees branches groaning in the cold it was cold outside the air was cold in his nostrils there was nothing out there howard told himself except maybe a raccoon or a skunk wandering through the brush he shifted onto his back and let the blood pump into his dead arm the pain was at least a distraction he closed his eyes opened them closed them again sleep was suddenly closer than he would have guessed possible cutting through his anxiety like a narcotic he took a deep shuddering breath that was almost a yawn then he opened his eyes one last blink of reassurance and saw the light it was a diffuse light that threw the shadows of trees onto the skin of the tent the light was dim at first then brighter the sun howard thought dazedly it must be dawn but the light was moving too quickly to be the sun tree shadows glided over the fabric above him like marching figures the light or its source was traveling through the forest he reached for his eyeglasses and couldnt find them he was blind without his glasses he remembered folding them and laying them down somewhere on the floor of the tentbut which side he had been sleepy the memory was dim he swept his hand in panicky circles maybe he had rolled over on them maybe god help him his glasses were broken the frames when he touched them felt as cold and fragile as bone china he hurried them onto his face the light was brighter now a lantern howard thought someone was out in the woods with a lantern the tent and fly were a vivid orange and impossible to miss he would be seen might already have been seen he tugged the zipper on the sleeping bag all the way down wanting to be free of it when they came for himwhoever they were the zipper growled into the silence howard shucked off the bag and huddled in the coiner of the tent where the flap opened into the cold air outside ready to bolt but the shadows on the tent reached a noon angle and then grew longer the light dimmed moment by moment until it was gone howard waited for what seemed an eternity but might have been four or five minutes now the darkness was absolute once more he couldnt see his hand in front of his face glasses or no he took a deep breath opened the tent flap and crawled outside his legs were weak but he managed to stand he was able to see the dim silhouettes of the trees against an overcast sky faintly alight with the dim glow of two rivers there was nothing threatening out hereat least nothing obvious no sign of what had passed except a strange acrid odor quickly gone the air was cold and hazy with ground fog he staggered ten steps from the tent suddenly aware of the pressure of his bladder and relieved himself against a tree so what the fuck had happened here what exactly had he seen a lantern flashlight headlights on some car but there had been no sound not even footsteps well he thought people see weird things in the woods swamp gas ball lightning who could say the important thing was that it was gone that he hadnt been seen probably hadnt been seen he amended but even if he had there was nothing to do about it sleep he thought if that was possible and move on in the morning he had reached a state of tentative calm when a second light began to flicker on the pinetops he felt marginally less threatened this time this time he could see what was going on he crouched in the cover of a young maple and watched the sourceless glimmer rising through a foggy thicket some tens of yards away what made it eerie howard thought was its noiselessness how could something as bright as a spotlight move through these woods without rattling the underbrush and the smoothness of the motion a glide shadows tall as houses wove among the trees howard squatted in the dark with one hand buried in the loam to brace himself he felt aloof now in a state of fine concentration only a little frightened the light moved steadily closer now he thought now it will come around that hillside and ill see it and it didand he gasped in spite of himself cut by a breathless helpless awe the light had no source it was somehow its own source the light was a thing the light had dimension the light was a nebulous shape ten or fifteen feet tall almost too bright to look at but not quite not quite it was not a sphere it had a shape that was tenuous but seemed to suggest a human formhead arms trunk legs but the features werent solid they twined like smoke were lost to the air flickered alive veins of color pulsed in the brightness it came closer closer it wasnt easier to see the edges blurred it was diffuse it moved like a flame howard was suddenly afraid it might come close enough to burn him now it paused a few yards away the apparition possessed no visible eyes nevertheless howard was convinced that it looked directly at himthat it regarded him with some complex chill intelligence that flowed toward him and into him like a slow current and then it simply moved on glided past him and away beyond a scrim of trees howard kept still there were more lights now none so close but all nearby each casting its own grid of shadows into and around the weaving trees the woods were populated with these things each one marching on some stately orbit my god howard thought the urge to pray was powerfully strong my god my god he watched until each source of this nebulous light had passed and a genuine darkness descended again thenbone by bone tendons creakinghe lifted himself and stood erect the cold wind was brisk but the sky seemed less weighty now it was inkblue beyond the eastern margin of the forest dawn howard thought that bright star might be venus he stumbled back to the tent bereft of every emotion but a wordless gratitude for the fact of his own survival he woke hours later in cool sunlight filtered through orange nylon his body felt raw and his thoughts were quick and fragile time to start thinking like a scientist howard scolded himself find the center of this problem or just keep walking that was the other option walk past the ruined research buildings walk deeper into this forest south toward detroit or whatever mutation of detroit existed here walk until he found a population to lose himself in or until he died whichever came first the fundamental question almost too sweeping to ask was simply why so many things had happened to two rivers so many enormous numbing events all linked he supposed all connected in some causal chain if only he could begin to unravel it obviously the town had moved through an unimaginable latitude of time but why had arrived in a world full of archaic technology and perverse religious wars but why why here of all places and the night shapes in the forest what were they what single line could possibly connect all these things he rolled his tent fielded his pack and followed the trail eastward sunlight chased cloud into the hazy east howard crossed a brook at its shallowest point where the water streamed in cool transparency over granite rubble he wished his thoughts were as lucid he was out of food he felt hungry and lightheaded it seemed appropriate that he was moving toward the heart of the crisis through the undeveloped lands of the old ojibway reserve toward the ruined two rivers physical research laboratory through mystery toward revelation at least perhaps eventually last night these woods had been haunted today in flickering sunlight the memory seemed ludicrous and yet there was a presence here never seen but often felt a private visitation he felt his uncle with him as he walked stern as a presiding spirit he guessed that wasnt scientific but that was how it seemed the woods thinned howard moved more cautiously here he came to the logging road that connected the lab with the highway the road had been widened by military traffic he waited until a truck rumbled past its primitive engine loud in the silence then he crossed the rutted wet road and walked parallel to it behind a screen of low pines he reached the hill from which long ago he had watched chief haldanes ladder company move beyond a border of blue light another trail crossed the road here it seemed to lead to higher ground along this ridge and howard followed it through berry thickets and white pine sweating under his navy coat it was afternoon now and the sunlight was warm he came to the peak of the ridge the two rivers physical research laboratory lay in the flatland beyond howard felt conspicuous in this elevated place he shrugged off his pack and left it under a tree the ridge sloped steeply here and howard lay on his belly at the edge of it looking down an incline of rock and wild grasses the ruined buildings were still enclosed in their dome of iridescent light they looked much the way howard remembered them looking in the spring the central bunker had stopped smoking but nothing else had changedthe grounds were embalmed in this glaze of illumination the single elm outside the staff housing had kept all its leaves there was a breeze at least here on this escarpment but the tree was not moving human activity was restricted to the outside of this perimeter obviously the military had taken an interest in the two rivers physical research laboratory it would have been easy enough to deduce that the lab was at the center of what had happened at two rivers and this persistent skein of light would have captured anyones attention the soldiers had put up a wire fence around the circumference of the property tents and a pair of tin sheds had been erected the contrast was striking howard thought inside the dome everything was pristine outside the grass had been trampled into mud ditches had been turned into latrines garbage had been heaped in enormous mounds his attention was focused so closely on the lab that he didnt hear the footsteps behind him until they were too close he rolled onto his back and sat up ready to bolt for the trees clifford stockton regarded him through magnifyinglens eyeglasses the boy blinked twice then he held out a wrinkled paper bag my lunch he said you can have some if you want howard said how did you know i wasnt a soldier they sat in the shade some yards away from the edge of the escarpment you dont look like a soldier the boy said how can you tell the way youre dressed i might be out of uniform i might be in disguise the boy inspected him more closely he shook his head its not just your clothes okay stillyou should be careful clifford nodded the boy had left his bicycle inclined against a tree he offered howard half a sandwich wrapped in brown paper and a drink from a thermos of cold water howard had brought his own water on this expedition two coke bottles tucked into the deep pockets of his jacket but most of that was gone he drank from the thermos and said thanks my name is clifford thank you clifford im howard the boy offered his hand and howard shook it then briefly they worked at the food it wasnt much of a sandwich howard thought but it was better than most of what hed been eating lately some kind of coarseground bread some meat probably military rations not bad if you were hungry he discovered he was very hungry indeed he finished the sandwich and licked the pale grease from his fingers have you been here before clifford a few times long ride out from town isnt it yes howard felt at ease with the boy maybe it was his obvious myopia or his solemn style but he felt an echo of his own childhood here one look at clifford and you knew he was the kind of kid who kept a collection of coins or bugs or comics that he watched too much tv read too many books his eyes were pinched and cautious but howard supposed that was natural everyone was cautious nowadays he said how safe is it up here its a long hike up from the valley ive never seen a soldier here mostly they stay near the trucks how often do you come here maybe once a week or so like you saidits a long ride so why come at all find out whats happening the boy gave howard a thoughtful stare why are you here same reason you walked from town howard nodded long walk yup first time yes howard said at least since the tanks came its quiet today isnt it always no the boy said sometimes there are more soldiers or more proctors howard was instantly curious but he didnt want to intimidate the boy he ordered his thoughts clifford can you tell me what they do here this might be important clifford frowned he balled up his sandwich wrapper and tossed it into the dark of the woods its hard to tell you cant see much without binoculars sometimes they take pictures a couple of times i saw them sending soldiers in whatinto the lab into one of the buildings show me which one they crept to the edge of the escarpment the boy pointed to a tall structure at the near perimeter of the parking lot the administration building howard remembered chief haldane and his firefighters on the first saturday after the transition they had ventured a few yards into that radius and had come out babbling about monsters and angels and sick howard remembered perhaps sicker than they knew haldane had died this september of symptoms that sounded like a runaway leukemia im surprised they can go in there they wore special clothes clifford said like diving suits with helmets they went in and they came out carrying anything boxes filing cabinets books sometimes bodies bodies howard thought the installation wasnt as empty as it seemed of course not people had died here died in their beds most of them neatly out of sight theyre really well preserved the boy added what the bodies cliffordfrom this distance how can you tell the boy was silent for a time some nerve had been touched some delicate truth the boy avoided howards eyes when he finally spoke my mom has a friend a soldier who comes over thats how we get bread for sandwiches chocolate bars sometimes clifford shrugged uncomfortably hes not a bad guy i see howard kept his voice carefully neutral but he talks sometimes the boy nodded at breakfast mostly he brags hes been here he was on duty when they brought out a body he said it was like it only just died it hadnt decomposed another shrug if hes telling the truth clifford this could be the most important part yet do you remember anything else he said anything about what theyre looking for here or what they found the boy settled on a granite shelf away from the lip of the escarpment he didnt say too much i dont think hes supposed to he said people come out of there even the ones in suits talking about the weird things theyve seen they cant stay inside too long or go too far it makes them sick some of the first people who went in died howard thought again of chief haldanes leukemia and at night the boy continued everybody leaves nobody stays out here at night it gets strange strange how the boy shrugged thats all i remember luke doesnt really talk that much mostly he complains about the proctors he hates them most of the soldiers do its the proctors who keep bringing people out here the soldiers just follow orders luke says the soldiers have to take all these risks because the proctors decided this place is important the boy paused seemed to hold the thought a moment but it is important isnt it thats why youre here yes howard said thats why im here the boy turned away he looked small against the blue sweep of the sky a wind came up the escarpment the boy said so much has happened no one knows where we really arewhere the whole town is it just seems like such a long way back home he turned to howard frowning fiercely dont know what happened out here but its hard to believe anybody could fix something like that howard looked at the forest beyond the ruined buildings at the ojibway land blending seamlessly into ancient white pine wilderness the hills rolled to a horizon lost in autumn haze it would be so easy to walk into that vastness die or find a new life leave maybe it can be fixed he said i mean to try he learned what he could from clifford and when the boy took his bike and cycled away howard sketched a crude map of the compound estimating distances and the rough circumference of the dome of light he crossed the highway before dark and spent another night in the woods nearer to town nothing disturbed his sleep he left his camping gear wrapped in the tent fly and buried under a mound of leaveshe might find his way back here somedayand hiked home through town he stank of his own sweat and he was desperately thirsty but he made it back to his basement before curfew without arousing suspicion howard had brought very few possessions into this new world they were all contained in his single canvas shoulder bag stashed behind the water heater in the cantwell house he brought the bag out and opened it there was not much inside some notebooks journal extracts he had planned to read his birth certificate his lab credentials and this howard took it out of the bag and examined it under a light a single sheet of canaryyellow paper torn from a note pad on the paper was written stern and a telephone number chapter six milos fabrikant was the eldest of the battalion of scientists assigned to the work of constructing a nucleic bomb each day weather permitting he bicycled from his homea dreary bunker full of dreary male physiciststo his place of work an office in one of five enormous buildings occupying a bleak flat hinterland of northern laurentia each day he was drawn to the same observation everything here was too large the landscape the sky the works of man indeed here was the largest structure the human race had ever created a huge boxshaped building full of airevacuated calutronshe cycled past it on a plain of smooth black asphalt under a sky threatening rain in the year since the work began in earnest fabrikant had ceased to be impressed by this hubris of man and nature he would be seventy years old before the next ascension day and what pleased himone of his few private pleasureswas something much simpler his continuing ability to make this daily twomile bicycle trip riding he felt like an athlete he had colleagues as young as forty that pig moberly the materials engineer for instance who would be exhausted by half the journey rattling through a grim dream of war on his old blue bicycle fabrikant felt as if he might live forever he was a physicist but the great physicists the legend went do all their best work in their twenties maybe so fabrikant thought his real work here was in administration not theory he was an administrator nevertheless who understood the project in every detail who grasped the work in all its splendid terrible beauty he had been involved in nucleic science for years he remembered the primitive laboratories at the universite de terrebonne before the war made everything urgent where he and the physicist pariseau had packed an aluminum sphere with powdered uranium metal and heavy water and lowered it into a swimming poolthe pool at the old gymnasium a new one had lately been built to replace it what they had created was a primitive nucleic pile neutron multiplication above unity for the first time in a laboratory but the aluminum sphere had leaked and when the pool was drained the uranium caught fire there was an explosionchemical thank god not nucleic the old gymnasium burned to the ground fabrikant had feared he would lose his tenure but the paper he wrote won him a scholastic prize and the university collected handsomely he was told from the insurance but such fruitful imprecision was no longer allowed now fabrikant spent his days negotiating with the war economy balancing its amazing largesse against its even more amazing stinginess for instance ten thousand pounds of copper for the calutrons no problem but paper clips had been on back order for six months purified silver but no toilet paper and the endless requisitions were all routed through fabrikants office which also conducted goodwill tours for military procurement officers and endless informal accountings to bureau officials skeptical of any expenditure on mere science even a weapons project he left his bicycle in a broom closet climbed two floors and said good morning to cile his secretary she smiled without conviction fabrikants office faced west where much of the view was occluded by the separation buildings vast gray strongboxes streaked with rain beyond them tundra chimneys vented steam into the foggy air he looked at the schedule cile had prepared all morning was devoted to a single meeting with a proctor who had flown in from the capital a censeur named bisonette subject of meeting not stated another command performance fabrikant thought wearily a fit agenda for a bleak morning parading some hobblefooted bald monolingual bureaucrat past the diffusion chambers he sighed and began to rehearse his own dubious french le reacteur atomique une bombe nucleaire une plus grande bombe was it evil fabrikant sometimes wondered even to consider constructing such a weapon the military misunderstood the project one told them soandso thousand tons of tnt and they would think ah a big bomb but it was not that fabrikant had glimpsed the potential saw it perhaps more clearly than his colleagues to liberate the energy locked into matter was to tamper with nature at the most fundamental level nucleic division was the prerogative of the stars after all and what were the stars but the provinces of god if he flees westward he finds the fire if he turns southward he finds the fire if he turns northward the seething fire meets him again nor does he find a way to the east to be saved for he did not find it in his days of incarnation nor will he find it in the day of judgment the book of thomas the contenderthomas the humorless fabrikant had thought when he was forced to memorize the verses in secondary school doom at every compass point fabrikant wondered if he had become the hands of thomas manufacturing the vehicle of that ultimate flame but the spaniards were pressing at the western border and the news was not as rosy as the radio made it seem and the republic was worth preservingfor all its faults fabrikant thought it was at least a place where the two races the french and the english had achieved a modus vivendi it was more liberal than the european monarchies with their nationalist heresies or romish paganisms so yes a bigger bomb a seething fire to devastate seville perhaps or some military port such as malaga or cartagena and then the war would be over he looked up from these musings and a cold cup of coffee as cile introduced the censeur m bisonette tall a stubble of white hair eyes sheathed in wrinkled flesh longfingered hands aristocratic fabrikant thought damn the french at consolidation there had been no official decision that the english would control the civilian government and the french would dominate the religious hierarchy but that was how it had turned out a permanent standoff rendered as constitutional tradition miraculously for years the truce had held bonjour fabrikant said bonjour monsieur bisonette quy atil pour votre service my english is adequate the censeur said implying better than your french well that was true enough fabrikant was secretly relieved more than adequate obviously i apologize censeur please sit down and tell me what i can do for you this morning the censeur who carried a leather case directed at fabrikant a smile that provoked his deep suspicion oh many things the censeur said cile brought more coffee your work here is the separation of uranium m bisonette said consulting a sheaf of papers he had drawn from his case specifically the isolation of the isotope uranium from the raw ore exactly fabrikant said ciles coffee was hot and thick almost turkish tonic against the northern chill taken in excess it gave him palpitations what we ultimately hope to achieve is a cascading nucleic division of the atom through the release of neutrons to accomplish this he looked at bisonette and faltered the censeur was regarding him with a bored contempt im sorry please go on this might be serious youre pursuing three routes to purification bisonette intoned gaseous diffusion separation by electromagnetism and centrifugation thats what these buildings are for censeur if you would like to see the work the electromagnetic and centrifugal projects are to be discontinued and abandoned the diffusion will be pursued with certain refinements youll be sent blueprints and instructions fabrikant was aghast he could not speak bisonette said mildly do you have any objections my god objections whose decision is this the office of military affairs with the consent and approval of the bureau de la convenance fabrikant couldnt disguise his outrage i should have been consulted censeur i dont mean to offend but this is absurd the purpose of running three processes simultaneously is to determine which is most effective or efficient we dont know that yet diffusion is promising i admit but there are still problemsenormous problems the diffusion barriers to take an obvious example weve looked at nickel mesh but the difficulty the barrier tubes are already in production you should have them by december the details are explained in the documents fabrikant opened his mouth and closed it already in production where could such knowledge have come from then it struck him the obvious implication theres another project thats it isnt it theyre ahead of us theyve achieved a usable enrichment something like that m bisonette said but we need your cooperation of course the bureau must have sponsored its own research program the hypocrites wartime redundancy my god fabrikant thought the waste andadmit ithe was ashamed that he had been beaten to the finish line that somewhere else all his problems had been solved he looked at his coffee cup all appetite fled the bomb itself bisonette was saying you have a preliminary design fabrikant worked to recover his composure why was it the proctors must always strip a man of his dignity a sort of nucleic gun he told bisonette although this is premature but in essence a conventional explosive to compact the purified uranium look here bisonette said and handed him a technical cutaway drawing of what fabrikant mistook at first for a soccer ball the casing contains these cells of explosives the core is a hollow sphere of plutonium im not a theorist monsieur fabrikant but the documents will explain it fabrikant gazed at the drawing the tolerances will have to be precise to say the least you can achieve that no you can this is untested it will work bisonette said how can you know that the censeur displayed once more his secretive sly smile assume that we do he said fabrikant believed him he sat alone in his office after the censeur left he felt stunned immobilized he had been rendered useless in the space ofwhat had it been an hour worse it all seemed too real to him now these blueprints were evidence that the project would go ahead the censeurs certainty was undeniable the atom would be divided the fire would seethe fabrikant who was not conventionally religious nevertheless shivered at the thought they would sunder the heart of matter he thought and the result would necessarily be destruction theologians spoke of the mysterium coniunctionis the mystery of union in sophia achamoth of man and woman perfect androgyny in nature of particle and wave the uncollapsed wave function the balance of forces in the atom a balance which fabrikant like some noxious demiurge was about to disturb and cities would be destroyed if not worlds he felt like adam imprisoned by the archons in a mortal body and here on this desk was his tree its branches are the shadow of death its sap is the unction of evil and its fruit is the wish for death his last question to the censeur had been how far has this gone has the bomb itself been tested there is no bomb until you build it bisonette told him the testing you may leave to us chapter seven until the spring censeur bisonette said pacify the town until the spring can we trust you to do that there was an insult lurking in the question symeon demarch looked at the telephone with a sour expression it was evelyn woodwards telephone finally connected to the external world through some sort of impedance transformer the military engineers had installed no more radiotelephones but the handset pink and lightweight and obscenely curved felt peculiar in his hand it was made of a substance like bakelite but less substantial an oilbased synthetic the engineers said the town is already pacified demarch said the town has been pacified for months i dont anticipate a problem as long as the militia cooperates it will said bisonettes distant metallic voice corporal trebach is not in a position to argue with the bureau he seems disposed to hell be tamed the weight of the bureau is about to fall on his shoulders the corporal has not led an impeccable life if you threaten him hell blame me im the one on the scene no doubt but well also tell him youve been ordered to report any obstruction that should rein him in he doesnt have to like you lieutenant all right what about the ideological branch ive had complaints from the ordinal attache delafleur a pompous idiot une puce pay no attention the ideological branch the ideological branch is under control the censeur said im giving them what they want what delafleur wants is to destroy the town he cant not now not until spring precisely is there a schedule do you need to know more there should be a packet from the oversight committee in a week or two all i want is your guarantee that the situation is stable for a few more months it is demarch said understanding that his head had just been inserted in a noose if anything went wrong now the blame would fall on him but he was trapped in his own momentum he heard himself say i guarantee it thats all then the censeur broke the connection demarch hung up the telephone and sighed then he turned and saw evelyn woodward standing in the doorway how much had she heard it was impossible to know or to guess what she would make of it briefly he reran the conversation in his mind sorting his own words from the censeurs how much could she guess she seemed to look at him oddly but that could have been his imagination she was an alien after all mistakes were easy to make with these people especially in matters of body language she said i came to see if you wanted coffee yes please evelyn i would like a cup of coffee he gestured at the desk which had once been her desk in a room in which she had once kept accounts for her auberge a little more work to do tonight i see well ill be back in a minute she closed the door behind her demarch picked up the most immediate paper on the desk it was the first of linneth stones reports essentially her working notes he had intended to read it tonight but he wasnt enthusiastic at the prospect linneth stone was a career academic and wrote like one tedious pensees in the passive voice on the evidence of subjects accounts and numerous contemporary published works cf time magazine newsweek etc the institution of marriage in the united states was undergoing a process of rapid change from predominantly traditional religiously sanctioned monogamie with a minority of exceptions to a commonplace of divorce and remarriage and unorthodox arrangements including unmarried parenting and even a certain sanctioning of likegender relations venery bastardy and sodomy in other words demarch thought of his own wife and child in the capital dorothea had been instrumental in his rise through the ranks of the bureau she was a francophone of good family an essential career asset for someone like demarch born an anglophone in a rural town the bureau de la convenance was a vast incestuous bureaucracya labyrinth of old families demarchs connection had been tenuous through his mother celestine who was cousin to a retired superieur ancien named foucault that and his university degree had been enough to get him in the door of the academie at belle he dorothea opened doors more arcane and significant her father a censeur had shepherded demarch through a long stint as an ideological branch operative he had earned his bona fides there had put in years and fought for promotion still even today aging censeurs like bisonette spoke to him with the disdain of a pureblood for a halfbreed dorothea had been essential tohim and he could not imagine leaving her divorce was not altogether uncommon among valentinians in the upper echelons of the civil service but demarch disapproved according to linneth american literature spoke often of love well so did every popular literature but the educated classes were supposed to know better marriage had very little to do with love it was an institution like the bureau or the federal bank you dont cease banking simply because you no longer love the bank love fades wasnt that inevitable and the demands of the body were fickle one made arrangements to deal with the physical aspect one did not demarch thought indulge in melodrama or attempt to rewrite history or maybe that was only the voice of his own buried conscience his father had been a sethian of the order of luther a deacon of the church and a moral pacifist hedrick michael demarch the fierce saxon consonants always made him think of the sound of a dog gnawing a bone the name still echoed in the lieutenants mind though his father had died ten years ago sometimes too the voice itself the tides and swells of its disapproval he thought of bisonettes nucleic bomb project dramatically hastened by documents the bureau had culled from the libraries of two rivers apparently there was enough in the generally distributed literature to advance the research by months once the censeurs had given this strange documentation their imprimatur of authenticity it had gone to the engineers and scientists who had turned it into blueprints this was work demarch had helped along it had been his idea to archive the libraries first of all theologians in the ideological branch had still been debating the metaphysical status of two rivers while demarch was shipping east its books that was something else his father had taught him the value of a book but what kind of a world had he hastened into being his son christof was eight years old now christof would grow up under the shadow of this transcendent weapon just as the inhabitants of two rivers had maybe it was the bomb that would unleash the other horrors the anarchy the drug addiction the rampant immodesty an october wind rattled the window demarch looked up from his thoughts evelyn had come back with coffee on a wooden tray she stood at the doorway waiting to be noticed he waved her into the room she glanced at the window and shivered cold out there all the leaves are off the trees it could be a cold winter ahead he stood and drew the blinds winters are often cold here but you must know that reminding himself of the fact we shared the weather if nothing else he had seen evelyns map of the united states and the contours of the landscape were identical the fingers of the great lakes the coastlines and the rivers her map had been more crowded with roads and cities and all the names had been ludicrously strange but he supposed the weather in the near west must have been the same snow before too long she said will that complicate everything i mean supplies and so forth the road from fort leduc has been reinforced we have mechanical ploughs i see she seemed to want to linger maybe it was the sound of the wind in the eaves the house was empty but for the two of them it had become demarchs private headquarters it was comfortable but large enough to be lonely he glanced back at the desk at linneth stones typed pages subject maintains that american morality has always been a battleground between contending ideas of liberty and virtue in the last century but the last century could wait until morning he was tired he turned off the desk lamp come to bed evelyn said evelyn was passive in bed demarch preferred it that way he was not a passionate or athletic lover he never lost sight of the fundamental incongruity of the actone of the several jokes god had played on man evelyns motion under his weight was as delicate as a breath and she sighed at the climax he was as fond of her as he had been of any of his occasional women he liked her silences as much as her words she knew when not to speak she was quiet now looking at him with sleepy eyes he kissed her and drew away he had worn a fishskinwhat evelyn called a condom a singularly ugly word he peeled it off and took it to the bathroom and flushed it away and came back to bed chilled by a tide of cool air evelyn was already asleep or seemed to be he adjusted the blanket over her shoulders and admired the terrain it made of waist and hips so unlike dorotheas he closed his eyes the northcountry wind rattled the window she had been right about the snow snow soon he thought his mind drifted back to bisonettes telephone call and linneth stones ethnological notes he thought of the town of two rivers dropped from the sky by an unknown magic itemized dissected cataloged ultimately to be destroyed the ideological branch an avantgarde of christian probity could not abide the prolonged existence of the town it posed too many questions it argued for a world even stranger and more complex than their celestial troupeau of angels and archons they hated especially the towns mutant christianity a christianity almost judaic in its insistence on one creator one risen christ one book and yet here was evelyn a heretic by anyones standard though she claimed she had never taken religion too seriously she was human spoke english was clothed in flesh not different from his flesh he had felt her heart beating under the bump of her ribs she was not a criminal or a succubus merely a bystander one could not offer such arguments to the ib they were more fascinated more frightened by the dome of blue light in the woodlands it partook of the miraculous and was therefore they reasoned their property give credit where due demarch thought some of the ib men were brave some of them had walked into that light and walked out sickened or insane some had died of what the doctors eventually called an irradiation disease but the metaphysical puzzle was finally too much to endure the town and all its inhabitants were malum in se and must be erased from the earth and how better than with bisonettes nucleic bomb which in any case would need to be tested but evelyn evelyn was human evelyn would have to be taken care of he would have to look into that he had scheduled an interview the next day with linneth stones subject the history teacher dexter graham the sitting room of evelyns hostel made an odd reception for a lieutenant of the bureau leafless tree branches tapped the high windows the furniture was large and padded a persian carpet decorated the floor and a mantel clock ticked into the afternoon silence a moat of stagnant time graham arrived between two pions in blue winter vestons escorted in from a cloudy cold day there was frost on the schoolteachers shoes he wore a gray windbreaker tattered at the seams and was more gaunt than demarch remembered he looked at demarch without visible emotion the lieutenant waved at a chair sit down graham sat the pions left the clock ticked demarch poured coffee from a carafe he had interviewed dozens of the towns preeminent men in this room the mayor the city councillors the police chief clergymen their eyes always widened at the sight of a hot cup of coffee demarch was always scrupulously polite but there was never a cup for the guest of such humble stones the fortress of authority was built he said i gather your work with linneth stone is going well its her work dexter graham said i work at the school the insolence was amazing refreshing in a way the lieutenant had grown accustomed to the automatic deference of civilians to the uniform as much as to himself dexter graham like many of the citizens of two rivers had never learned the reflex since the executions last june many had acquired it but not this one miss stone arranged some liberties through my offices she wont be escorted by guards for instance are you cognizant of the fact that this is a considerable generosity on my part im aware that its a little out of character i dont want you to trespass on that generosity i dont intend to in the course of the last several months weve had notable cooperation from the towns responsible leaders mr grahameveryone from the mayor to your principal bob hoskins which was all true only the churchmen had been truly problematic and demarch had promised them they would be allowed to carry on their odd species of worship clement delafleur had protested all the way to the capital but it was only a temporary arrangement after all youre something of a pillar of this community yourself mr graham i need your cooperation too im not a pillar of anything dont be modest though i admit the record tends to support you there transferred five times in fifteen years for violations of school board protocol maybe you chose the wrong profession maybe i did you admit it dexter graham shrugged demarch said there is an aphorism one of our writers defined a scoundrel as a brave man without loyalty to his prince there arent any princes here i was speaking figuratively so was i the clock rationed a few more seconds into the still air weve done a great deal for the village demarch said weve restored water weve laid electrical lines all the way from fort leduc fifty miles south those werent easy decisions they were opposed no one understands what happened in this patch of woods mr graham its very strange and very frightening good will has been shown graham was silent demarch said acknowledge that the water is running the lights are on but despite that generosity we still have reports of curfew violations a man about your size and age was seen crossing beacon street after dark its a common size and age the curfew isnt a joke youve seen what happens to criminals i saw billy seagrams body on a cart outside city hall his niece walked past the body on the way to school she cried for three hours in the classroom i saw that he leaned over to tie a ragged shoelace and demarch was fascinated in spite of himself by the casual gesture is that why you brought me here to put the fear of god into me demarch had never heard the expression he blinked i dont think thats in my power mr graham but it sounds like a prudent fear he was insolent but was he dangerous demarch pondered the question after graham was dismissed he pondered it that night as he climbed into bed with evelyn she had been nervous about the interview demarch supposed she thought he was petty enough to hate graham because graham had been her lover dont get angry with him she said imagining that anger had anything to do with it demarch said i only want to understand him hes not dangerous youre defending him thats a noble impulse but its misplaced i dont want to kill him evelyn my job is to keep the peace if he breaks the law if he violates the curfew thats what i mean to prevent you cant frighten him are you saying hes stupid she turned out the light the temperature outside had dropped and there were fingers of frost on the windowpane dim radiance from a streetlight traced a filigree of shadow on the opposite wall hes not that kind of man evelyn ventured he told me a story once about himself yes but he told it like a story about someone else he said suppose there was a man and this man had a wife and a son and suppose he was always careful about what he said or did because he might lose his job or something bad might happen to his family and he cared about his family more than anything and then suppose the man was out of town and there was a fire and his house burned down with his wife and child in it he lost his wife and son in a fire yes but thats not the point he said it was the worst thing that could happen to this mana complete loss of everything at the center of his life and he survived it somehow he went on living and then dex said the man noticed a strange thing he noticed that there was nothing left to hurt him what could be worse than this death he would have welcomed death losing a job trivial so he stopped hiding his opinions he told the truth he got in trouble but there was no threat that meant anything to him no more terrors for instance he used to hate riding in airplanes he was a whiteknuckle flierbut not anymore if the plane fell out of the sky and he was killed well that was territory his wife and child had already visited maybe hed find them there waiting for him she shivered you understand he was brave almost by accident it got to be a habit is this a true story is that how he seemed to you some of the edges have worn off this was all a long while ago but yes thats how dex seemed brave demarch thought but probably not dangerous a man with nothing to lose has nothing to defend later on the verge of sleep evelyn said there are more soldiers around town another truckfull came past today demarch nodded not far from sleep himself he was thinking of dorothea he was thinking of christofs small face his eyes bright as porcelain china symeon is something bad going to happen to the town when you were talking on the phone hush it was nothing i dont want anything bad to happen nothing bad will happen to you the lieutenant said i promise now sleep in the morning there was half an inch of snow on the ground demarchs boots crunched on the frozen paving stones as he walked to his car wet snow tumbled from the branches of the trees as he drove to the heart of the town where the dismantling of two rivers had already begun chapter eight the last of autumn was an unsettled time in two rivers mornings were often achingly cold afternoon skies were cloudy or a stark brittle blue woodsmoke drifted through the commons women in the food lines wore down jackets or bulky cloth coats men shuffled forward with parka hoods drawn or caps pulled over their ears no one lingered in the streets things were changing people whispered for instance every day now between the hours of seven and eight in the morning two or three militia trucks would come into town popping blue smoke from rustcaked tailpipes the trucks were drab green and always manned by six or eight soldiers a truck would park outside a buildingmost often a store or warehouseand the soldiers would stretch and climb shivering down from the tailgate and file inside inside they would box items and tag them and stack them for loading into the truck they took not everything but each of a kind one toaster one television set one of every variety of home and office computer nothing was spared this inventory of the town not chairs or shoe polish or window shades but special attention was devoted to technical devices especially anything with a microchip or a memory it seemed to calvin shepperd excharter pilot and watchful citizen who made the trip to the food depot every three days because sarah refused to suffer the indignitythat the soldiers must be taking all these objects to some gargantuan museum a museum of notions and appliances a kind of noahs ark of dry goods it was systematic looting he thought and it would take a while to complete but eventually this work would be finished the town would be cataloged and all its treasures itemized and locked away and then well he couldnt guess he didnt know what would happen then he knew only that the idea of it filled him with dread on a cold morning late in the year linneth stone gave dex graham a map packed in a cardboard tube he unrolled the document across the chipped formica top of a table at tuckers tuckers restaurant had reopened in midoctober with the permission of the bureau the menu was limited to eggs cheese bread coffee milk reconstituted from powder and a kind of chopped steak everyone had learned to avoid still the opening had been a morale booster dex supposed it was meant to be last nights wet snow kept the breakfast trade at home dex and linneth were alone in the diner linneth had disguised herself in a casual blouse and modest skirt but she still looked odd here dex thought misplaced in a vinyl booth he tried to imagine what her natural setting would be someplace more dignified someplace with a carpet not this peeling linoleum tablecloths not formica he used the salt pepper and sugar dispensers to peg down three corners of the map then he drew a breath and took his first comprehensive look at the new world the map shocked him although he had anticipated much of what he saw the shock came not from the novelty but the blunt declaration of it the miraculous in blue ink and fine print linneth was patient while he stared she said tell me what strikes you he put together his impressions the east is more crowded than the west she nodded the east was settled first of course english and french colonies all the old cities boston montmagny montreal manhattan during the war of brittany the colonies declared their independence the republic was a consolidation of the fifteen eastern provinces it expanded west as the aboriginals were killed or resettled obviously a great deal of the far west is still virgin land he traced the blue snake of the mississippi river from the province of mille lacs to the city of new orleans to the west was a grid of prairie and mountain provinces athabasca beausejour sioux colorado nahanni kootenay platte sierra blanca from the beaufort sea to the border of new spain new spain was approximately mexico with a panhandle up the western coast as far as what would have been southern oregon there was no canada the republic ruled everything north of the fortieth parallel the spanish lands are disputed of course the war the whole map is less crowded cities were sparse even as far east as the great lakes whats the population of the world she frowned i remember reading the estimate two billion where i come from it was nearer six oh i wonder why i dont know the two histories must be fairly similar we speak the same language more or less and i recognize some of these names if our histories are like a treeone branched left one branched right it might be useful to know where they divided linneth seemed to concentrate on the idea it was new to her dex supposed she hadnt been raised on star trek the parallel world as a place where mr spock wears a beard if the histories branched as you say it must have happened a long time ago the religions are different but there are still parallels we both have a prominent christianity even though theyre different in detail considerably before calvary then or not long after first century second century say before the romans adopted christianity before constantine linneth blinked but they didnt the romans i mean there were no christian emperors charlie tucker brought two plates of bread and cheese for which dc exchanged a handful of food coupons charlie gave linneth a long look he had heard her accent he looked worried she nibbled a wedge of cheese and waited for charlie to wander back behind the cash desk some of the apologia are addressed to the antonine emperors ecumenicists are always pointing to clement who gives a good impression of an erudite pagan but no roman emperor explicitly embraced the cross its an odd idea so perhaps thats the point of divisionyour christian emperors maybe dex thought about it and then he reminded himself why she was here is this for your dossier history isnt my subject in any case the proctors emptied your libraries they can ferret this out for themselves she added i would hardly dare counsel them on religious matters this would all be very blasphemous if it werent a matter of record im sorry he said im still not sure when im talking to you and when im talking to the bureau perhaps i should wear two hats one when im myself and one when im an agent of the state which one are you wearing now oh my own my own particular hat in either hat you have me at a disadvantage you know my history very little to be truthful only what ive learned from you or the public material the books were all locked away months ago still you know more about my history than i know about yours she opened her calfskin case i brought this for you i borrowed it from one of the militiamen he said it was for his daughter but he was reading it himself a childrens book im afraid but it was the only history i was able to locate on brief notice the book was a tattered duodecimo in hard covers the title etched in gold leaf the events of history from creation to the present day with illustrations it gave off a pungent reek of wet canvas dex took it from her you can form an approximate notion linneth said though i do not vouch for the details he looked at her again he wondered what the book represented was it a promise kept a strategic offering simple kindness her face was unclouded in some ways as perfect a face as dex had ever seen round and generous and serene but reserved for every ounce given an ounce was withheld and maybe that was not surprising under the circumstances but still she said i would like a book in return which book one of yours i peeked into your room when the proctors brought me to your door the first time you own books youre a reader but not history something literary something you like i think that would be instructive for which hat briefly she looked offended my hat he had been carrying the dogeared paperback of huckleberry finn in his jacket pocket for a month and he was reluctant to part with it he took it out and handed it to her the text is more than a century old but i think youll get the drift the drift the essence the meaning i see and the book is a favorite of yours you could say that she accepted it reverently thank you mr graham call me dex yes thank you tell me what you think of it i will he rolled up the map and volunteered to walk her back to the civilian housing at the blue view motel outside she frowned at the weathersunny today but cold enough that an early snow hadnt melted from the road in her white jacket she might have been anyone dex thought any goodlooking woman on a windy sidewalk the wind reddened her cheeks and earlobes and carried away her breath in foggy wisps he wondered when he would see her again but he couldnt think of a plausible reason to ask she stopped and faced him at the corner of beacon and oak thank you for escorting me youre welcome she hesitated probably i shouldnt say this but ive heard rumors rumors about curfew violations the proctors are looking into it dex he shook his head ive already had this warning demarch threatened me personally her voice was nearly a whisper im sure he did that is he would its in his nature but i dont mean to threaten you all i mean to say is be careful she turned and hurried away and he stood on the windy sidewalk looking after her the two rivers crier a weekly newspaper had not seen an issue since the crisis in june that autumn it published a new edition the crier had been edited from an office on grange street but the presses were in kirkland sixty miles away since june much farther than that where the town of kirkland had been today there was pine forest and an icy creek the new crier a single folded sheet of rag pulp was a collaboration between a past editor and a committee of bureau surveillants the text consisted of announcements from the military and the proctors power failures in the east end were sporadic and would be repaired before the end of the month a new food depot had been opened at the corner of pritchard and knight there was also a ringing editorial in which the reappearance of the paper was said to augur better times for two rivers carried as if by stormy gusts into a strange ocean and sailing under the calm winds of cooperation toward safe harbor prominent on the back page was a column announcing a program under which single men between the ages of seventeen and thirtyfive were permitted to request relocation and job training elsewhere in the republic a living wage to be paid until such time as the men were established in their new lives it was open to white men jews apostates negros mulattos and othersall welcome it attracted considerable attention in town there were only a few volunteers many were transients who had been passing through when the accident happened and saw no reason to stay some were young men chafing at the friction of martial law all were accepted for relocation the first convoy left town november with a cargo of twentyfive civilians some had families some waved at sisters or parents as the transport truck banged south from the a p parking lot in a gusty cold rain some were smiling some were weeping all of them promised to write no letters were ever received clifford stockton often thought about his father especially when the soldier was visiting his mom his father was a commodities broker living in chicago or who had lived in chicago before everything changed and he never visited a good thing too his mother used to say when clifford pressed her on the subject he has his own family there his own children he never visited and he never wrote but twice a yearat christmas and on his birthdayclifford would get a package in the mail there was always a card with cliffords name on it and the appropriate sentiment merry christmas happy birthday nothing unusual there but the presentthe present itselfwas always great one year his father sent him a nintendo game machine and an armload of cartridges another time ups delivered a radiocontrolled scale model p mustang the least exciting gift had been a fully equipped chemistry set confiscated after two weeks when clifford dropped a test tube and stained the living room shag beyond repair the most exciting present had come last may a twohundredchannel programmable scanner that could eavesdrop on police fire and emergency frequenciesas well as on cellular telephones though hardly anyone in two rivers had possessed one clifford had not thought much about the scanner since june since the invasion there had been no power to plug it into it languished in the closet in his room on the shelf above the coat hangers ignored but not entirely forgotten tonight luke was visiting which meant clifford was confined to his room after nine oclock which left him with not much to do he could read the library was closed permanently a fact clifford still had trouble grasping but the cashier at the silverwood mall brentanos a friend of his mother had gone to the store with her key last summer and borrowed a bag full of science fiction paperbacks for him clifford was working his way through dune and he spent an hour or so on the intrigues of that desert planet but he wasnt in a reading mood and when the downstairs television fell silent his mother had been showing luke her videotape of on golden pond clifford rummaged in the closet for his game boy he found it but the ac adapter was lost and the batteries he discovered were long dead the scanner neglected on the upper shelf caught his eye clifford decided he ought to brush the dust off if nothing else he stood on a chair and lifted the metal case down he put it on his desk he liked the way it looked there the liquid crystal display glittering in the lamplight he extended the antenna and plugged the cord into the wall he hit the scan button and let the internal logic search the airwaves he didnt expect much one of the two rivers police department patrol cars was still allowed to roam around town so there might be a little police chatter or something from the fire department under new management since chief haldane died but both channels were silent idly he tuned to what should have been the marine bandand suddenly the room was full of voices voices announcing street corners voices acknowledging the announcements clifford was instantly fascinated it had to be the militia he thought patrol cars making their rounds calling out checkpoints oak and beacon all silent camden and pine all quiet here clifford punched the monitor button and settled down to listen the talk went on mostly the militiamen sounded bored periodically they complained about the cold checkpoint third and duke were almost frozen out here noted beware ice james the streets are slick in babylon tonight babylon was what the soldiers called two rivers luke had told him that no signs of life along the highway nico is it true theyre serving pot roast in the commissary tomorrow night thats the rumor supply truck hasnt been in today though samaels pants i was looking forward to a hot meal youll be looking forward to an obscenity demerit if youre not careful philip your callout is late but now his mothers voice came down the hallway and through the door of his room cliffy have you got the tv on shit clifford said startling himself a little he reached for the volume control on the scanner in his panic he jerked it the wrong way the speaker screamed fourth and main fourth and main all quiet at fourth and main clifford hit the off switch and yanked the power cord out of the wall socket the scanner was important he understood that without thinking about it the scanner was important and he had to hide it or it would be taken away from him he heard his mothers bedroom door swing open cliffy he looked at the high shelf of his closet too far away he lifted the scanner and bent to slip the heavy case into the dusty darkness under his bed it fit but only just the cord trailed behind he kicked it under the hem of the bedspread the door to his room sprang open his mother stood in the doorway clutching a pink nightgown at her neck and frowning hugely cliffy what the hell is all that noise playing with the game boy he saidlamely but his mother wouldnt understand the limitations of a handheld game machine she had a name for every electronic device clifford owned they were all fucking noisy boxes yeah she glanced at the bed suspiciously the game boy was lying there the battery cover was off and the battery well was empty but his mother wouldnt notice clifford thought probably well keep it down okay you could have woke up the whole neighborhood he said im sorry it was an accident its after ten spare a thought for somebody else for once in your life okay all right she turned away luke was behind her he wore his uniform the shirt was unbuttoned to the waist his chest was a mass of dark curly hair his eyes were bright and curious he took a step inside cliffords room and said who is the game boy its not a who its an it a machine a game machine like nintendo yeah like nintendo please clifford thought dont ask to see it cliffy luke said you must show it to me sometime sure it sounds like a radio you know clifford shrugged the soldier looked hard at him youre not playing tricks on me are you no estque vous etes un petit criminel un terroriste eh cliffy i dont understand clifford said quite truthfully see that you dont luke his mother from down the hall come on the soldier winked at clifford and left the room since september classes at john f kennedy had been reduced to two days a week dex supposed the futility of it had become obvious nobody at jfk high would be going to harvard or mit not this year or next year or ever the only thing he was giving these kids was an illusion of normalcy and maybe that wasnt a good or useful commodity anymore maybe it was even dangerous his afternoons were free he had spent the last two afternoons reading linneths history book and today he decided to discuss the contents with howard poole the pressure on howard had relented over the last few weeks the proctors seemed suddenly less anxious to pursue the mystery of the research lab a daylight visit was possible still dex took precautions on his way to the cantwell house he walked past oak street to powell creek park then doubled back and approached the house from the south howard had been bolder about his cantwell identity lately the neighbors seemed to accept the masquerade or at least none of them had reported him to the militia but the neighbors were aware of him they watched howard said people living on the military dole confined to their houses by fear and bewilderment had little to do but stare out the window dex felt their eyes as he crossed the brown front yard between scabs of ice he walked quickly between the hedge and the side wall to the back door he knocked and waited shivering under the bulk of his jacket the day had started cold and never warmed up the last thing this town needed he thought was a hard winter but it felt like a hard one rolling in howard opened the door howard wore a threadbare blue sweater the tail of a white shirt peeking out under the hem his blue jeans were grimy and he wore gloves on his hands he waved dex in and led him to the kitchen the cantwell house had been equipped for oil heat of which there was none but howard kept the interior doors closed and the electric oven running so the kitchen at least was passably warm howard offered coffee you can get coffee on the ration card now but im still using up what was in the cupboard its a little stale but theres plenty of sugar dex nodded and sat at the small table while howard measured water into a carafe and fed it into the coffee machine now that the power was back everyone had these toys to use coffeemakers blenders microwave ovens the appliances seemed newly frivolousalmost sinful after months of privation i think he might still be alive howard said ive been thinking it over and i believe thats a real possibility slow down whos alive my uncle howard said impatiently stem and dex sighed every time he came here howard talked about his uncle his uncle the genius loci of the two rivers physical research lab the mysterious alan stern and who the hell knows dex thought maybe the guy was an important part of what had happened out there but it had begun to look like an obsession and howard himself gaunt and longhaired had begun to look obsessed last week he had told dex about his trip to the ojibway reserve there had been apparitions in the woods howard said which was far from impossible dex had ceased passing judgment on the operating rules of the universe plainly the universe was a stranger place than he had imagined he could accept the possibility of luminous beings out in that scrubby old pine forest but it seemed equally plausible that howard had hallucinated the whole episode howard had been through a lot hiding from the proctors in a basement all summer enduring a long bout with fever maybe howards window on reality had clouded a little and if so who could blame him howard said something about a telephone dex impatient took the history book out of the pocket of his coat and dropped it on the kitchen table howard stopped talking and stared at it whats that and dex explained all right howard said okay that could be important have you read it uhhuh learned anything well its not exactly the oxford history of the world you want a summary it starts with the garden of eden adam gets a human body from the archons the which archons minor gods adam is psyche and eve is spirit and the serpent isnt necessarily the bad guy but after that its fairly straight genesis all the way to moses and the pharaohs egypt greece and rome are presented as fairy talesromulus and remus and the genius of plato and so on but at least its recognizable he accepted a cup of coffee howard sat opposite him wideeyed listening intently it starts to go wrong around the second century valentinus is the great christian irenaeus is the persecutor of the faithful the conversion of constantine never happened rome was a seat of classical paganism until at least the s and there are hints that hellenic paganism is a vital religion even todayat least in certain unenlightened foreign countries christianity didnt dominate europe until the age of the heresiarchs approximately the thirteenth century when a number of hostile churches were unified after europe was conquered by a gallic king by this time of course its not what you or i would call christianity its wildly syncretic and it has a huge library of apocryphal books all holy writ more or less howard took the volume from the table and leafed through it still the similarities are so broad the movements of peoples the evolution of language its as if history wants to flow in certain channels broad ethnic groupings persist and there are roughly analogous wars at least up until the tenth or eleventh century there are plagues though they follow different patterns the black death depopulated europe and asia no less than five times the colonization of the new world was delayed technologically theyre maybe fifty or sixty years behind us in terms of population a century or even two talk about the religion howard said theres nothing very explicit in the book but it hints at some very strange things you said archons uhhuh and somebody called sophia achamoth and the serpent as a kind of benevolent teacher smuggling out secrets from heaven it sounds like christian gnosticism i dont know a lot about that howard took his cup in both hands and rocked back on the legs of his chair before christianity was unified in the hellenic world there were various schools of christian doctrine all kinds of books claiming to be narratives of the life of jesus or secret keys to genesis the new testamentour new testamentis what was left after orthodox bishops like irenaeus purged the texts they disapproved of some of these christian mystery cults were pretty strange from our point of view they believed in scripture as a kind of coded message you were enlightened when you penetrated the mystery so they were called gnosticsthe ones who know valentinus was a major gnostic figure he sipped the coffee made a face spooned in more sugar i suppose in this world the gnostic churches were never suppressed they became the dominant strain of christianity okay dex stared across the table so how does a graduate physics student know so much about gnosticism from stern howard said he talked about gnosticism all the time he was obsessed with it and they were silent for a while they drank howards thick stale coffee until curfew was less than an hour away daylight began to fade from the window the sky was a gray turmoil despite the oven the kitchen grew colder at last dex pushed his cup away and said we have to stop dicking around howard four five months weve all been in a walking daze begging for scraps of water and electricity its time to wake up this isnt a good place weve come to the town isnt safe and every day the fences get higher and trucks take away some more people we need a way out howard shook his head we need a way home you know how unlikely that is we dont know anything dex not until we understand what happened at the lab is it really important even if we do figure it out is that a reprieve im not a physicist but id bet what happened at the defense plant was a kind of explosionsome kind of really weird explosion that blew half of bayard county into the next universe but still an explosionand even if you understand an explosion you cant put it back in the bottle some things are irreversible i would guess this is one it may be but whats the alternative the fences are already up dex the best fence is the forest and the weather theres only the one road out from what ive heard and it leads straight to fort leduc which is a military town sixty miles away its not practical to hike that far it could be done dex said maybe with the right gear and supplies then you have the problem of arriving without money or id or useful skills and evading the proctors while youre at it and who are we talking about here you me a few ablebodied men it would still leave most of two rivers under martial law i know im not happy about it if you have a better idea tell me we find stern jesus howard dex sighed what makes you think hes alive his telephone number he gave me a private number where i could reach him mostly evenings he said i wrote it down i dont see no listen the thing is its a fouronesix exchange everything at the lab including the dorms was a sevenohsix number here in town most numbers are fouronefive fouronesix fouroneseven the one time i called his private line a woman answered not a switchboard just hello yes so the obvious implication is that he had a town residence an apartment or a room or maybe a woman he was seeing he might have been there when the accident happened more likely he wasnt if something was going on at the lab wouldnt he have been involved well i dont know not necessarily but you dont have any real evidence hes alive you havent seen him no its a small town howard he would be hiding like me maybe somebody picking up rations for him so he doesnt have to go out in the street but no i have no direct evidence just what a feeling pardon me but thats not too scientific a hunch no its not scientific but dex doesnt it seem like theres something happening here i wont say supernatural thats a stupid word but something out of the ordinary thats a safe bet not just the obvious i mean subtler things dreams my dreams are different now visions maybe what i saw in the woods was a vision i never believed in socalled psychic phenomena but since the accident at the lab he shrugged i dont know what i believe maybe a hunch is not something to ignore that was logical dex thought but it was a suspicious kind of logic he pinched the bridge of his nose all you have is the number no address stern didnt like people knowing too much about him even a favorite nephew the proctors hooked up their own phone lines but they havent fixed the exchanges dont know what the hell good a number is well it might be in the phone book what under stern obviously not but i keep thinking about the woman who answered the way she answered her tone of voice casual proprietary it was her phone probably the number is in the book but under another name great there must be twentyfive thousand names in the bayard county phone book what do you do leaf through it a page at a time no nor is there any way to get the information from the phone company or whoever used to be the phone company that stumped me for a long time but the man who owned this house paul cantwell he was a cpa you know what he has in the bedroom upstairs a pc with every kind of accounting and databasing software known to man quite capable of sorting the phone book for a number you cant type in the text of the phone book or does he have that on disk too no but look we dont have to type it in you know what an optical reader is takes text from a printed page right sowe can scan the phone book feed it to the computer a page at a time howard was dangerously enthusiastic about this dex thought you have an optical reader in the house too no thats the tricky part we need to get one theres a store on beacon howard all those stores are roped off the proctors are shipping out the contents howard leaned forward rattling his empty cup i walk down beacon every time i go to the food depot theres a store called desktop solutions on beacon between oak and grace the bureau inventory is working south from oak and west from the lakeshore they havent been there yet still its behind a rope i can cross a rope there are militiamen on every corner theyre sparser at night howard said oh dex said oh no theyre on a hair trigger out there howard they shoot people out the back gate of this house theres an alleyway that runs to oak across oak theres a similar alley in back of the beacon street shops the alleys arent well lit and they arent patrolled like the main streets purely insane and what are you taking this risk for a telephone number to find out what happened howard was visibly trembling to know dex even if we cant go home and anywaychrist its my uncle he looked down dont know anybody in this town except you i never really lived here my family was all in new york state except stern howard no matter what the odds are hes dead i cant leave it at that the light in the window had faded the clouds were heavy dex looked at his watch it was past curfew he was stuck here for the night he looked at howard painfully young a kid in ducttaped glasses a damn fool maybe you ought to make some more coffee dex said we cant leave until the moon is down chapter nine even at the raw end of autumn even in the brittle hour after midnight two rivers owned a tenuous warmth from its highest point the hill above powell creek park the town fell in dark terraces of woodframe houses small lawns and neat brick storefronts to the hidden shore of lake merced streetlights cut irregular circles into the windy night the town faded to black at its border it was isolated in the hilly northern peninsula of the province of mille lacs a territory of trading posts lumber towns iron mines copper mines here the darkness had a weight there were wolves in the forest and periodically that autumn they had come loping into the outskirts of town their curiosity aroused by the powerful and unfamiliar mixture of human scents but the wolves after a cautious investigation almost always chose to avoid the paved streets there was something in this mingled air they didnt like beyond the westernmost arc of the lake on what had once been ojibway treaty land the ruins of the two rivers physical research laboratory cast a delicate light across the belly of a cloud other lights moved unseen among the trees in the town itself along the gridwork of empty streets the only moving lights were the headlights of the patrol cars the only sound was the sound of their motors of their tires gritting on the frostwhite asphalt luke was not visiting tonight and cliffords mother had gone to bed at ten oclock when she didnt have company she went to bed early and slept almost till noon which was okay with clifford he stayed up much later he was allowed to sleep in as long as he wanted and he had learned that when his mother went to bed braced by stiff doses of the unlabeled distilled whiskey luke brought her on a weekly basisthe house became his own he owned it from the cavernous cluttered living room to the dark and scary basement it was his domain on nights like this the house seemed immensely large it was a kingdom vast and a little eerie and he was its uneasy ruler tonight clifford chose to stay in his room with the radio scanner since last week he had been spending most of his nights listening to the military radio traffic the scanners speaker disconnected and his walkman headphones plugged in so his mother wouldnt hear he was careful to keep the scanner a private business he had learned a lot from it he had borrowed the folding map of two rivers from the kitchen drawer and tacked it up on his bulletin board he took it downa precautionwhen luke was visiting for three consecutive nights he had used it to track the military patrol routes through town he gave each car there were ten in all a letter of the alphabet and he wrote down the time whenever an intersection was called out he had needed to stay up until four in the morning with the help of some coffee brewed without permission but the final product of this systematic eavesdropping was a complete schedule of the nightly curfew patrol where the cars would be and when the last few nights clifford had been doublechecking his results they seemed accurate a car might be late at a checkpoint or call in early but never by more than a few minutes there might be a few rogues visitors like luke who had made acquaintances among the townspeople but even luke was usually careful to observe the curfew it was a barracks deal involving more of that white corn liquor that allowed him to stay out all night on friday or saturday clifford had overheard this explanation and took it to be true armed with his notes clifford had drawn his own amendment to the map a pencilline route connecting his house to powell creek park given the right timing this was the way a person on a bicycle could travel to the park and back without crossing the path of a patrol car the idea of a nighttime bicycle jaunt had come to him last week the scanner made it a practical possibility but the idea was intrinsically appealing curfew had made the night a forbidden zone but clifford had always liked the night he liked summer evenings with their hush and warmth and the lingering smell of trimmed lawns and hot supper he liked winter nights so cold the snow squealed under the pressure of his boots but above all he had liked autumn evenings smoky and mysterious and most of this autumn was already gone had been stolen from him he thought too he liked the idea of exercising the secret knowledge the scanner had given him using it to his own advantage he was afraid of course but he was powerfully tempted on a windy night like this the temptation was especially strong he sat for a time in his room in the dark listening to the headphones and resting his elbows on the windowsill the window glass was cold wind turned the branches of a leafless oak in the yard next door and when the high clouds opened there were stars it was well after midnight now all the patrols were on schedule he looked at his watch and made a mental calculation the decision he came to was sudden and wordless he didnt even think about it just moved he padded downstairs turned on the hallway light and found his sneakers he laced them high and tight he put on his padded blue winter jacket and locked the door behind him when he left his bike was leaning against the wall of the garage the handlebars were shockingly cold and clifford wondered whether he ought to have worn gloves but there was no time to go back he was on the clock nowand the schedule was tight the wind tugged his hair as he rolled down the empty street every house was dark the bicycles bearings ticked into silence and the clouds lifted like a curtain on a great show of stars what made this dangerous dex graham told himself was the peculiarity of the empty town it was too easy to feel alone hence safe hence careless he wanted to say this to howard but they had resolved not to talk unless it was absolutely necessary the sound of their voices might wake someone and there ought to be no witnesses to this expedition the alley behind the cantwell house passed between tar paper garages and the brittle remains of vegetable gardens the paving was ancient and frostcracked set back on each side woodframe houses slept behind wooden siding screen doors peeling shingles lights were sparse dex carried a crowbar in his right hand and resisted a juvenile impulse to bang it against these fence slats howard stalked ahead in long nervous strides he wants this over with dex thought but caution caution was vital they walked downhill in the deepest shadows and stopped where the alleyway opened onto oak street crossing oak was going to be the hard part the big question mark oak street divided the town from east to west and had once carried most of the traffic to the cement plant and the quarries it had been widened last year and lamp standards had been planted every ten yards the light was surgically bright worse the road intersected every commercial street including beacon a car might turn any corner for four blocks in either direction without warning the road was an asphalt desert much too wide and as hospitable as a guillotine the wind came down that avenue in frigid torrents we should cross one at a time howard whispered from the other side you can see more of the intersection pointing to beacon a block away where a traffic light rattled in a cold gust then if it seems safe wave the second man across ill go dex said no i should be the one the declaration was brave dex felt a little of what this trip meant to howard howard never talked much about himself but dex had learned a few things about him in the same wordless way he came to understand the kids who filed into his classroom every september by gesture and posture by what was said and what wasnt howard took no delight in defying authority dex pictured him as the bright quiet kid who always picks a desk at the back of the room the one who doesnt smoke on school grounds or liberate bags of m ms from the corner grocery the one who follows the rules and takes a certain pride in doing so not much like me dex thought a middleaged man with no possession but himself and too careless even with that he said no ill go howard seemed to be working up an objection but dex made it moot by vaulting out onto the windy space of oak street he sprinted toward the opposite side he felt a little giddy actually out here on the empty pavement once when he was seventeen and living with his parents in phoenix he had gotten drunk at someones party and ended up walking home at four in the morning on an impulse he had stepped into the middle of what in daylight was a busy suburban street and he had sat down crosslegged on the white line king of creation there had been no other pedestrians that night no traffic only dry air and a patient starry sky he had stayed in that sublime lotus for almost five minutes until he saw a distant wink of headlights then he got up yawned and sauntered home to bed it amounted to nothing but the feeling still lingered in his memory he was tempted to sit down in the middle of this street a dumb and reckless notion it was a familiar impulse though the urge to wave some flag of defiance in the face of the universe and he supposed one day it would get him hurt or killedprobably sooner than later given the state of things but at times like this he felt both genuinely alive and somehow closer to abigail and david who had perished in the fire fifteen years ago maybe they were around one of these dark corners maybe if he tempted fate fate would deliver him to his lost wife and son but he crossed oak without incident and stopped a little breathless in the shadows on the opposite side the silence seemed larger here he paid attention to it sorting through windsounds for the rumble of a motor there was nothing he braced himself against a brick wall and leaned into the street he looked hard east and west and saw only streetlights traffic signals and the icy white sidewalks he located howards silhouette in the alleyway and waved an allclear howard jogged toward the meridian of oak in gawky birdlike strides he wore a khaki hunting jacket that came nearly to his knees and a black watch cap too low over his eyes his ducttaped eyeglasses winked in the artificial light he looked like a cartoon terrorist dex thought and why the hell didnt he get a move on he was a target out there howard had only just crossed the white line when dex saw headlights probing the corner of oak and beacon he took a half step out of the alley and waved frantically at howard trying to hurry him in howard saw him and did exactly the wrong thing froze in place confused and frightened dex heard the sound of an approaching motor probably headed south on beacon we are seconds away from being seen he thought shouting was a risk but unavoidable now he cupped his hands howard get the fuck over here run you dumb son of a bitch howard looked left and saw the headlights reflected in window glass it seemed to untangle his legs he began to sprint and dex admired the speed with which the physicist covered those final yards of blacktop but the car a black patrol car had turned the corner and there was no way of knowing what the men inside might have seen get down dex said down behind the dumpster back against the wall draw your knees up and he did the same the patrol car had turned and was coming their way along oak he could tell by the sound of its engine it growled a lower note theyve seen us dex thought he tried to imagine an escape route south down this alley and maybe out some fire lane to beacon or one of the suburban streets get lost in tree shadows or crouch under a porch there was a sudden light dex watched it sweep the alley he pictured the patrol car the driver the militiaman in the passenger seat with a handheld spot he was aware of the sound of howards tortured breathing run he whispered run if you have to you cut left ill cut right but the alley was suddenly dark again the engine coughed and tires crunched on cold asphalt dex heard the sound fade down oak howard let out a shuddering breath must be they only caught a glimpse dex said or theyd be down here after us christ that was a near call he stood and helped howard up i vote we get the hell back across oak and head for home while we can pardon me howard but this whole thing was a stupid idea howard pulled away and shook his head we didnt get what we came for were not finished at least im not you can go home if you want dex regarded his friend well hell he said finally look whos rambo clifford stockton sat at the top of the high hill at the center of powell creek park with his bicycle beside him and the cold night wind plucking his hair there had already been flurries of snow this season and it felt like there might soon be more although the sky tonight had grown crisply vividly clear but the cold didnt bother him it was exhilarating he felt completely alive and completely himself far from the world of his mother and the soldiers and school the town lay at his feet from this high place it resembled the map he had pinned to his bulletin board back home it was completely static a grid of stationary lights except for the patrol cars performing their slow waltz the cars moved like a glittering clockwork pausing a beat at each intersection go to hell clifford told them this was a whisper a delicious heresy the wind carried it away but there was nobody around to hear him giddy clifford stood up and shouted it go to hell the patrol cars wheeled on as implacable as the motion of the stars clifford laughed but felt near tears it was almost time to go home he had proved he could do this all that remained was to prove he could get back safely he was excited but the cold air began to seem colder and he thought about his room his bed with a first pang of longing he picked up his bike down the brick path to cleveland avenue and west toward home that should be easy enough but something caught his eye the hilly part of powell creek park overlooked the business district clifford enjoyed an unobstructed view down to the intersection of oak and beacon he saw the twin red taillights of a patrol car as it reached the corneron schedule but the car turned west on oak and shouldnt it have gone east and now the car slowed and that was strange too its spotlight probed an alleyway behind beacon street clifford crouched on the grass watching he felt suddenly vulnerable too obvious he wished he had his scanner maybe he could listen in the spotlight winked out and the patrol car moved on along oak and turned a corner it disappeared from cliffords view behind the stores on knight but he was able to track the glow of its headlights down knight to promontory farther from the park then east again then mysteriously back onto beacon circling clifford thought and now slowing now stopping the headlights winked off something was happening clifford thought something was happening or was about to happen on beacon street far off along commercial street he saw a second car coming fast probably summoned by the first a call must have gone out by radio all the patrol cars were converging on beacon which meant the schedule was messed up which meant he wasnt safe here he ran for his bike dex graham worked the point of the crowbar between the frame and the rear door of desktop solutions and leaned on it the lock came away from the wood with a sound like a gunshot howard winced the door sprang open dex said be my guest howard pulled a long watchmans flashlight out of the deeps of his jacket and entered the store dex stayed outside watching the alley he calculated that this trip from the cantwell house to the computer store had taken no more than twenty minutes though it seemed like much longer thank god the deed was nearly done here we are he thought two of the least likely breakandenter artists ever to jimmy a lock in the town of two rivers and the least competent now that the adrenaline rush had faded he was cold he rubbed his hands together and warmed them with a breath alone here he was uncomfortably aware of the perilous distance between himself and safety until the close call with the patrol car there had been an edge of excitement to this trip that was gone replaced by a sour anxiety the wind rattled a loose doorway down the alley winter at the heels of a wind like that dex thought when he came here five years ago he had been startled by the severity of the northern michigan winter he wondered how much of two rivers would survive the season and what would be left of it by spring the question was unanswerable but the possibilities were mainly bleak he heard a percussive rattle and whirled to face it but the culprit was only a dog a hound nosing a trash barrel overturned by the wind the dog looked at dex with an expression of rheumy indifference and shivered from the neck down i know how you feel dex thought he looked at his watch then peered into the dim interior of the store hey howard how you doing in there no answer but dex could see the beam of howards flashlight poking arounda little too vigorously dex thought he took a step inside howard nothing howard its cold out here bag your loot and lets get going all right he felt something touch his leg overcome by a sudden sense of unreality dex looked down here was howard crouched behind the cash counter with sweat beading on his pale forehead howard had grabbed dexs ankle and was waving some panicked indecipherable signal dex guessed this ought to be frightening but for a long moment it was only confusing he said out loud what the hell and the flashlight beam continued to probe the darknessbut not howards flashlight another presence loomed in this dark arcade of shelves and desks suddenly visible as dexs eyesight adjusted to the dark he turned to face the rear door just as the beam of light pinned his shadow to the wall he saw his shadow ride up toward the ceiling as loosejointed and comical as a marionette then there was a flash and a deafening bang a pressure and a pain that knocked him off his feet he heard howard shouting something it might have been dont shoot or god damn and he felt his left arm twitch in a useless distant fashion and the wet warmth of blood and then footsteps and then a sudden second lightthe brightest yet clifford decided to ride home by way of powell road which crossed beacon north and uphill from the business district it was a short ride down the park path and out the gate onto powell home from the park was a gravityassist all the way the bicycle bearings shrilled into the dark and clifford felt the wind on his face like a barrage of needles the big houses near the park blurred past on each side of him fading behind him like an elegant dream he leaned on the hand brakes at the corner of beacon and came to a stop beside a tall privet hedge curiosity and prudence had begun a pitched battle in the pitof cliffords stomach curiosity had the advantage he peered around the hedge downhill toward the shops south of oak there was not much to see from this distance only a distant light a headlight which winked out when he looked at it another patrol car would it be dangerous to try to get closer well obviously it would no doubt about that he had seen the bodies on that wooden cart outside city hall last june and the memory put a jog into his heartbeat people had been killed for what he was doing right now but it was night and he was agile and he could always hide or run and anyway it wasnt him they were after he wheeled down beacon almost all the way to oak keeping close to the trees and hedges of these big lawns most of which had grown high and weedy over the summer at oak clifford pulled up next to a dark automobile parked at the curb and noticed with a sudden shock of fear that it was a military patrol car and that he had come abreast of it with the idiotic boldness of a fouryearold he dropped his bike and was about to run for the cover of a leafless willow tree when he saw the car was unoccupied both soldiers must have crossed oak and gone down beacon where he could dimly see a motion a commandostyle jog from storefront to storefront and the dance of several flashlight beams he had come too far and was too exposed he lay in the grass considering his options he didnt think he was in danger at least not yet he was fascinated almost hypnotized by his proximity to something potentially important something somber and hidden then clifford heard a bang like a firecracker and saw a simultaneous flash of light someone had fired a gun he thought and the implication of that simple event seemed to wake him from a daze the soldiers were shooting at someonethe soldiers were quite possibly killing someone and maybe it should have scared him but mostly it made him angry he thought again of the dead bodies outside city hall that had angered him too though it had been too awful to absorb all at once the anger was subtle it lingered it had no outlet this was more immediate and cliffords anger focused to a fine point the soldiers had no business here no business telling people what to do and certainly no business shooting them he wanted to do something about it take some retaliation and he looked around helplesslyand saw the patrol car parked a few feet away the canvas roof was closed against the weather but the door might not be locked clifford crossed the sidewalk and grasped the unfamiliar handle it opened easily he leaned inside distantly amazed at his own audacity the interior of the car smelled of worn leather and cigarette smoke the air was stale and still warm he leaned across the bench seat wondering what sabotage he might be able to perform his eyes fixed on the knobbed lever projecting from the floor a gear shift he guessed he remembered his mother explaining the gears on her honda experimentally clifford grasped the handle and twisted it left and down left and down he didnt know what kind of gear mechanism this automobile might have there was no reason to expect it to work like the cars he was accustomed to but it did possess a neutral gear and clifford knew at once when he found it the car inched forward its tires crackling on the cold street he sat up in alarm the patrol car was rolling at an angle across beacon which was useless it would only fetch up undamaged in the drainage ditch he needed to get out but first he twisted the oddly shaped steering wheel until the car was pointed more or less directly down the slope of beacon a steep enough incline to get some real momentum going which happened more quickly than he expected clifford scrambled back across the bench to the open door and found the pavement scrolling past at a surprising speed he closed his eyes and jumped an awkward leap he hit the sidewalk with feet hips shoulders he tore his shirt and scraped his palms bloody he would have to explain this to his mother come the morning if he ever reached home he hurried back to the shadow of the tree to watch the empty car which had already rolled a considerable distance its motion was stately at first then alarming its speed increased until it seemed to clifford as if the car had been launched from some enormous slingshot it rattled over every bump in the road took small but perilous leaps now well across oak and down the empty avenue of beacon it tilted perilously on two wheels and then righted itself the slope of the street declined past oak but the runaway car seemed to take no notice he tried to figure out where it would impact the hardware store he thought or no it was veering right the barber shop the bookstore the gas station clifford gasped and held his breath he felt a sudden awe at the enormity of the events he had triggered he understood that there was going to be more damage than hed imagineddamage on a huge scale damage that made his knees weak with anticipation he couldnt guess at the speed of the patrol car as it left the road but he thought it might be going faster than any car had ever gone on beacon street the tires came up over the lip of the curb and the whole car seemed to levitate above the airandwater dispenser at the gulf station it rotated as it moved the back end rising as the nose dipped and when clifford realized it was going to collide with the selfserve gas pumps he instinctively covered his ears a grinding crash echoed up the empty road clifford watched through eyes squeezed nearly shut he saw the patrol car sheer off a pump unit before it came to a full stop there was a last rattle a fading hiss then silence and clifford dared to take a breath then the patrol cars damaged battery shorted itself into a spreading pool of gasoline and it looked as if the sun itself had risen over the rooftops of beacon street nicodemus bourgoint a line soldier of the fifth athabasca infantry had been due for shipment to the mexican front when he was diagnosed with a peptic ulcer and transferred to domestic duty in the otherworldly town of two rivers given a choice he would have preferred the front there the dangers were predictable war didnt frighten him getting shot or blown up that was a human thing it was a fate anyone might come to but two rivers frightened him it had frightened him from the beginning the soldiers detailed to two rivers had been offered no explanation of the existence of the place barring some aphorisms from a bureau attache about the bountiful mysteries of god the genetrix mundi was endlessly fecund nico supposed and there might well be an occasional wrinkle in the pleroma but that was small consolation when one was condemned to endlessly patrolling the vacant streets of this terrifyingly strange place not only that but the accommodations were crowded the duties were tedious and repetitive and the food was bad the mess sergeant had been promising roast beef since august it never arrived he longed for home he had been raised on a cattle ranch in the northern province of athabasca and he felt confined by these wooded hills these leafless trees the alien village never more so than tonight he had been assigned night patrol with filo mueller who liked to torture him with campfire stories about headless corpses and onelegged ghosts and as much as nico tried to conceal the uneasiness this caused in him some evidence of it always showed on his facemuch to muellers amusement such things simply werent funny nico thought not in this place of course when they turned the corner of oak and beacon and saw the figure disappearing down the alleyway all frivolity ceased nico wanted to stop and give chase but mueller a devious sort argued for calling in reinforcements and circling the block let our trespasser think we gave up if we chase him well lose him youre not a hunter are you nico my uncles hunt buck in the mountains nico said defensively but you never went with them youre not the type they circled the block mueller radioed for another car and nico was all in favor of waiting for it to arrive but mueller spotted the glint of someones flashlight in a store window and fixed his serpentine stare on nico you go in he said mueller was nicos superior by a degree of rank and technically entitled to give the order but nico assumed he was joking it was the look on muellers face that convinced him otherwise the son of samael was grinning take your pistol out of its pouch for once mueller said demonstrate some testicles nico im not afraid good for you go on but he was afraid he hated these shops with their windows full of incomprehensible goods one of the stupider infantrymen a huge man named seth was forever proclaiming his idea that two rivers was actually a settlement on the outskirts of hell that these truncated roads had once run straight to the temple of the lord of the hebdomad the father of grief the idea was childish but sometimes annoyingly plausible for instance tonight nico moving as slowly as his pride permitted approached the door of a building called desktop solutions the sign in its odd graceless english script was confounding like so many of the inscriptions on these stores it made no sense the words had no comprehensible connection to one another just like unisex hair or circuit city it seemed to promise the impossible or the absurd the shapes in the window were only gray boxes small items like miniature television sets plain and uninviting he drew his pistol a sense of unreality overtook him as he pushed open the doorthank god it wasnt lockedand braced himself in a shooters stance pistol in his right hand flashlight in his left this might be a dream he thought he might be in the barracks sleeping he hoped he was he saw a gaunt figure duck behind a desk and his attention focused instantly he stepped closer wishing someone had come with him even mueller but surely mueller and his reinforcements would be here soon he came close enough to see the man huddled on the floor without a weapon and he was about to order the man to stand when a second figure approached from the rear with a crowbar in his hand nico aimed his flashlight at this new apparition the man blinked and turned nicos finger tightened on the pistol and it bucked in his handhe wasnt even certain he had meant to fire only that it happened almost without his volition an event to which he was an accessory but not the main cause the man was wounded the man fell nico took another bewildered step forward the shot man was unconscious and his friend huddled over him eyes wide on nico dont move nico said dont shoot the other man pleaded nico held the pistol trembling but level and wondered where mueller was surely he had heard the shot what was keeping him then there was a thunderous crash from behind him and a light so bright it seemed to drain the color out of everything and the window glass came hurtling inward in a thousand fragments nico bourgoint felt the glass cut his back and arm he turned and dropped his pistol in astonishment at what he saw the lord of the hebdomad rising in a pillar of flame from the opposite side of the street dex did not begin to make sense of events until he was in the alley his good arm over howard pooles shoulder and his feet moving by some logic of their own he looked at howard who was breathless and bleeding from what looked like a hundred small cuts what he said it was meant to be what are we doing but the words evaded his grasp howard gave him a brief look run if you can run just do it they jogged together each step triggered new fireworks from his shoulder and arm no longer numb alas he didnt look at the wound he had never been keen on the sight of blood his own or anyone elses and he couldnt afford another spell of lightheadedness he did risk a glance behind him he saw what appeared to be a largescale hallucination above the pebbled roofs of the beacon street shops above the rain gutters and the tangled telephone wires a column of fire had risen into the cloudless night sky the flames as they ascended became a luminous shade of blue and in that coruscating substance it seemed to dex there were faces immense and endlessly shifting gods sake howard rasped dont stop they crossed oak and were some yards uphill along the crowded lane when dex said wait howard regarded him with a desperate impatience were leaving a trail dex said look bright drops of blood had speckled the asphalt connect the dots dex thought theyll find us by morning lights had winked on in all these houses but there were deep shadows among the alleyside sheds and fences and all attention must be focused on the fire they crouched in a tangle of darkness its mostly me howard you have to bind this wound or apply a tourniquet i dont know if i can do that ill tell you how put down that box first of all dex squinted at it the optical reader you stole the damn thing after all didnt you in spite of all this i had it in my hands when the soldier came in its what we went for youre a singleminded son of a bitch howard you learn that in grad school he took a breath its hard to tell but it looks like the wound is in the fleshy part of your arm clear through its bleeding a lot but its not uh gushing what do i tie it with use your belt for a tourniquet tight above the injury any kind of cloth to soak up what leaks howard worked while dex sat on the cold ground and fixed his attention on the board fence next to him it had once been painted but the paint had all peeled away except for a few flakes clinging to the grain the fence had once been white tonight it was gray mottled by the light of the distant fire the pain was enormous and his grip on consciousness a little uncertain he said howard uh what the hell happened back there i dont know something blew up lucky for us a coincidence i suppose so synchronicity at least im about to tighten this dex counted silently to ten his vision blurred somewhere around seven make words he instructed himself what happened back there it was strange uhhuh not natural i guess not basically it was weird you could say so there a final tug can you stand up yeah but he was unsteady can you walk oh yeah id better walk its pretty much walk or die dont you think howard didnt answer clifford turned and ran when he saw the pillar of blue fire he was halfway up the block when he remembered his bike he screwed up his courage and went back grabbed the bike and straddled it and cut west on oak because it was the quickest if not the least conspicuous way home his view of the events on beacon street had been comprehensive and he understood everything up until the moment of the explosion it unrolled inside him like a movie like a videotape spliced into a maddening loop his anger the empty patrol car working the gear lever his rising dread when he understood what the consequences would be and the explosion at the gas pumps and then but that part made no sense in his tapeloop memory it looked like this the gas pumps detonated in a ball of fire and then something something like a vast ethereal blue spark had come down from the sky to touch the fireball and the spark had coalesced into a cobaltcolored snake about as wide as the gulf station and twisting up into the night sky as far as the eye could reach it seemed to clifford that the column had curved a little to the west but he wasnt sure he hadnt been looking at it with scientific detachment with panic if anything in that terrible moment it had occurred to him that he might somehow have caused the end of the world itself because the blue light had not been merely light it had been full of faces and formshuman faces and forms one in particular a grim bearded face god or the devil clifford thought his bike flew through the november darkness like a wild bullet his legs pumped in a ceaseless fury that would have startled him if he had been aware of it his only thought was of home his house his room his bed he slowed when he reached the suburban part of town he had to his breathing was so labored it hurt his lungs and he had a painful stitch in his side he let the bike drift to a stop and put one leg down to steady himself reluctantly fearfully he turned and looked back at two rivers the pillar of blue flame was gone to cliffords immense relief maybe he had only imagined it he must have but the ordinary fire burned on he could see the glow of it reflected from houses on the high ground near powell creek park what pained him now was the knowledge that none of this could be taken back not everfor the rest of his life he would be responsible for blowing up the gulf station and please god clifford thought let no one have been inside it the memory was part of his permanent luggage and worse it would have to remain a secret this was something he could never be caught at or confess to not in two rivers under the rule of the soldiers there was no juvenile court in two rivers anymore there was only the executioner he pedaled the rest of the way home unaware of the tears on his face home he parked his bike out of sight he unlocked the door stepped inside locked it behind him unlaced his sneakers and put them in the hall closet padded upstairs to his room the sight of the bed made him instantly staggeringly tired but there was work yet to do he stripped his torn and dirty clothes and took them to the bathroom he wedged them into the dirtyclothes hamper down toward the bottom his mother was lax about the wash these days and she probably wouldnt notice anything out of the ordinaryhis clothes were often dirty and many of them had been torn since june then he turned on the taps hoping the sound of running water wouldnt wake his mother he stood in the tub and used a washcloth to soak the dirt off his face and sponge the clotted blood from his hands and elbows whence seemed clean front and back he wiped down the tub then rinsed the cloth and stuffed it into the hamper with everything else he turned off the water and the light and tiptoed back to his room he put on pajamas his old ones a little too tight nowadays flannel with blue and white stripes then only then he allowed himself the bed the sheets were as cool and welcoming as absolution and the blanket contained him like a prayer he meant to plan his excuses if anyone questioned him tomorrow but his thoughts quickly turned to nonsense and a tide of sleep carried him far away tom stubbs was asleep at the fire hall when he heard the gulf station blow he sounded the alarm and made sure his crew was out of their cots but the truth was he couldnt do much until the telephone rang mr demarch had made it quite clear last july the two rivers volunteer fire department performed a valuable service and they would be supplied and maintainedbut if they left the station after curfew and before this newly installed radiotelephone rang theyd be shot like any civilian two pumpers and the ladder company were waiting when the call finally came tom acknowledged it hastily and ran to the lead truck which rolled at once he knew as soon as they turned onto the slope of beacon street that this was no ordinary fire the gulf station was indeed burning the underground tank had recently been filled with that leaded diesel the military cars ran on and it looked like one of the topside pumps had not only caught fire but gone gusher but that wasnt all like the fire at the defense plant so many months ago this fire had a frightening aspect a tower of blue light rose from the flames to the sky and maybe arched a little tom thought as if its rainbow trajectory might bring it down somewhere over ojibway land but it faded before that it was a vein of light with if you looked long enough faces in itand that was terrifying the fire at the defense plant had been terrifying too but that had not stopped chief haldane from attempting to fight it and the chief remained an idol in toms eyes even after his untimely death this past summer with that in mind tom drove as close as he could to the gulf station supervised his men as they connected at the mains and did his level best to end the conflagration the column of strange light faded to nothing in the steam and that was fine with tom it made him nervous to work with the devil looking on dex graham left howard at the cantwell house and made his own way home over the younger mans protests makes sense he told howard right now theres chaos in the morning therell be soldiers everywhere and they might be curious about a wounded man you can make it yes at least he thought he could he took it street by street pain and the dizziness that rode with it came in tidal movements of ebb and flood he was only dimly aware of the sound of sirens the distant flicker of firelight he reached his apartment after an eternity of footsteps the stairs seemed at a steeper angle than he remembered he whispered small encouragements to himself as he climbed he locked his apartment door behind him and left the lights off now you can rest he thought and reached for the bed as darkness took him among those who had witnessed the strange phenomenon above the burning gulf station reports were mixed soldiers reported seeing what they described variously as ialdaboath samael a demiurge or the father of grief civilian witnesses in the neighboring houses claimed they had seen god or like tom stubbs the devil only howard poole connected that visitation in the sky with alan stern and howard didnt file a report by morning everything east of oak stank of smoke and diesel fuel chapter ten if dex woke with the sun in his eyes and the knowledge that time had passedtoo little or too much time he wasnt sure which the events of the night had been large and significant and he dreaded the returning memory he tried to roll onto his side but a starburst of pain prevented him he tried again more slowly and discovered he was stuck to the bed he peeled away the bloody sheet from the shirttail bandage howard had wound for him and managed to sit up he didnt remember loosening the tourniquet but he must have done so that instinct had saved him a close encounter with gangrene he thoughtat least so far he was thirsty feverish and appallingly weak he went to the sink in a drunkards stumble he poured a glass of water sip it he thought from the medicine cupboard four aspirin one two three four he was scheduled to hold classes between ten and twelve and it seemed to dex he really ought to try to be there as impossible as it might seem at the moment the soldiers or the bureau could be keeping an eye on his movements he didnt want to draw attention to himself by staying home the proctors might be looking for a wounded man better not to appear wounded the trick would be to avoid collapsing in the street he examined himself in the bathroom mirror when the storefront window blew in he had been turned away from it his face wasnt cut though his back when he worked his shirt loose seemed to have been flayed nearly skinless the cuts werent as bad as they looked fortunately only a lacework of shallow lacerations after he sponged the scabbed blood away but not pleasant his arm well he was able to move it though the effort cost him dearly wait until the aspirin takes hold he told himself the aspirin would help at least a little though a mere four bayers under the circumstances might be a spit in the wind as for the wound itself he didnt want to risk disturbing the makeshift bandage he didnt want to bleed again of course it would have to be changed it might already be infected but later this afternoon say when he could faint at leisure he put on plausible work clothes a cautious step at a time the bandage bulked conspicuously under a clean shirt but the sport coat disguised it could he walk the five blocks to jfk high he guessed so he felt disoriented but it was probably no worse than the disorientation of a bad case of the flu the aspirin might at least take the fever down two classes he could handle that the walk passed in a series of curiously static tableaux here was the front door of the apartment block open on a cold november morning here was the sidewalk arrayed before him like a flickering alabaster river here the soldier on the corner with his highcollared black uniform and expressionless face eyes tracking dex as he passed here much later the school ancient brick victoriana small high windows the big door the corridors were dirty and smelled of sour milk they were abandoned nowadays except for a few stalwarts student and faculty dex felt more lucid here soothed by the bleak familiarity of the building the aspirin had not done much for the pain or the fever but seemed to allow him to rise a distance above these things he nodded at emmy jackson who was still manning the reception desk the principal bob hoskins hailed him as he approached his classroom damn cold hoskins said the powers off again as you no doubt noticed some idiot blew up the gulf station last night and the proctors are so pod they cut the electricity for a full week somebody said if you can imagine anything so petty dex said have they caught anyone no which is precisely whats bothering them in my opinion if they had some poor soul to hang im sure theyd be delighted he squinted at dex are you all right flu well theres plenty of it going around you sure you can manage you look awfully pale ill be okay well knock off early if you have to hoskins sighed i dont know how much longer well be here anyway its like minding an empty store sad but true the classroom was as cold as the rest of the building dex had left his notes at home and doubted his ability to lecture coherently for forty minutes when his first students shuffled in wrapped in shabby winter coats he declared a study session and assigned them a chapter to readthree hectographed pages on america in world war i when youre done you can talk among yourselves the time passed he sat at the big desk and pretended to grade assignments the assignments were real and he kept them in front of him and remembered to turn a page now and again but the words were unintelligible the printed or handwritten letters had developed lives of their own they bobbled over the paper like loose balloons the urge to put his head down and sleep was powerfully strong and by the end of his second class he was afraid he would simply nod offhis head was inclining when the bell rang students shuffled out some looking at him oddly shelda burmeister a studious girl in highpowered corrective lenses and a torn turquoise sweater paused at his desk until the others were gone mr graham yes he swiveled the weighty beam of his attention toward her what is it shelda i think you cut yourself she nodded at the desktop he looked down blood had traveled down his left arm and pooled just beyond the cuff of his coat about a tablespoon he thought i guess i did he said i mean cut myself thank you shelda will you be all right yes go on im fine she left he stood up more blood trickled down the wounded arm now he was conscious of the distasteful warmth of it he held the cuff closed and moved to the door maybe he could clean up in the staff mens room change the bandage the door opened before he reached it and linneth stone stepped into the classroom she was fresh and impossibly radiant in a white blouse gray skirt he looked at her with some confusion dex i know we didnt have an appointment but the afternoon was free and i thoughtdex my god what happened she caught him as he fell and lowered him to the floor there was blood on the blouse he meant to apologize im sorry he wanted to say but linneth the classroom the school all vanished into a sudden night part two the past gives birth to the present according to the laws of thermodynamics nothing dies only form changes we reenact our evolution in the womb as a species our history is engraved in every cell but evolution can only operate under the dicta of natural lawthe evolution of the universe as much as the evolution of life in the first nanosecond of the primordial singularity everything that now exists became an implication needing only time to achieve embodiment the early universe contained human consciousness the way an acorn contains an oak the gnostics speak of the protennoia mind as the original substance of the world a protennoia derived from an uncreated god aggenetos ungenerated and androgynous humanity as a fractal subset of mind in an imperfect pleroma our divine spark our apospasma theion an ember of the big bang consciousness the quantum mechanics of the archaic universe erupting into cold matter through the medium of humanity i think we are the lever by which something unspeakably ancient moves the world from the secret journal of alan stem chapter eleven coming back to the capital even for a week was a restorative for symeon demarch no matter what happened hereand he expected nothing good from his scheduled meeting with bisonette he would have time to draw at least a few unfettered breaths he rode a truck to fort leduc where a ponderous air transport waited on the military runway the airplane had been outfitted with a padded wooden bench along its steel inner wall an instant nuisance to demarchs spine and the four smoky engines with their immense blades rattled the fuselage and deafened the passengers the most reliable air transportation had gone to the western front months ago but demarch forgot his discomfort as soon as the vehicle lifted above a plain of cloud and wheeled away from the setting sun he was going home he let his attention focus on the circular window opposite him and his thoughts drift away except when the plane banked into a turn there was only the sky to see a winter blue turning to ink at the apex the electrical heating labored and demarch turned up the collar of his veston it was altogether dark when the aircraft circled down to the capital the city was invisible except for its lights but demarchs spirits were buoyed by the sight all that grid of electricity was familiar territory parts of it he knew by heart he picked out the stone pavilions of the bureau centrality as the plane lost altitude a few windows shining in the hierarchs buildings and watch lanterns burning in the courtyards then a landing field rose to meet the wheels he shuffled out of the aircraft with the other passengers a few enlisted men who watched him guardedly as he crossed the tarmac to a waiting car the bureau had sent him a vehicle and driver the driver spoke no english and his french was deeply accented a haitian demarch supposed a number of haitians had lately been imported to fill menial jobs emptied by conscription neige the driver said bientot je pense snow soon no doubt demarch told him and let the conversation languish he was happy with his own musing as the miles spooled past there was not much traffic even in the narrow streets where the sacral brothels were but it was late and of course there was the gasoline rationing one saw more horsedrawn vehicles these days than before the war dorothea had written him about a sugar shortage too everything was rationed but the fundamental nature of the countryside hadnt changed especially here beyond the city center telegraph poles lined the cobbled road and the smell of burning sod was pungent in the cold air he was surprised at the upwelling of pleasure he felt when the car came abreast of the house it was a small house compared to the rambling compounds of the censeurs farther west but spacious enough and respectably old it had belonged to an uncle of dorotheas and still did not properly belong to demarch it was an extended loan from the saussere family during his posting to the capital but he had lived here for ten years it was as much a home as any place had ever been more so he thanked the driver and walked briskly up the stone steps to the door the door opened before he touched it dorothea stood in a halo of lamplight perfect and beckoning light twinkled from the silver crucifix pinned to her bodice he embraced her and she offered her powdered cheek for a kiss christof peeked at him from behind a banister frowning well christof had always been shy at reunions it was hard for him to have a father so often absent but that was what it meant to be born into a bureau family dorothea whispered father is here and demarch saw the wheelchair rolling from the study armand saussere seeming to smile but as inscrutable as ever behind his vastly old face demarch closed the door on the night air the smell of home surrounded him christof come here he said but christof kept his wary distance the same driver arrived in the morning to take him to town the temperature had dropped but the sky was cloudless pas de neige the driver said no snow not yet demarch let familiar sights lull him until the car passed under the eagle gates of the bureau centrality the centrality was a town of its own with its good and bad neighborhoods its loved and hated citizens the censeurs in their black hats and soutanes moved across the courtyard between the ordinage and propaganda wings like stalking birds demarch felt compromised in his simple lieutenants uniform when he worked here he had seldom crossed the invisible line separating staff officers from the hierarchs quarters unless he was summoned always a frightening episode well today he had been summoned too he left the haitian driver and crossed the pebbled yard to the departement administratif the halls inside were marbled and high and supported by halfcolumns set into the walls this was the heart of the centrality part temple part government it was a more powerful government within its sphere than the praesidium a mile away clerks and pages called it the capitals capital censeur bisonette waited in a conference room a tall room with a mosaic floor and a long oaken table bisonette was at ease in a highbacked chair his angular face composed he didnt stand when demarch entered demarch stepped forward and bowed his footsteps echoed from the high ceiling everything here was designed to intimidate everything did sit bisonette croaked they would speak english it was a concession or an insult or both i want you to know our thoughts on the investigation our thoughts the bureaus new doctrine the investigation two rivers among the hierarchs it was always the investigation a nebulous enquiry whose object must never be named or defined demarch had learned the protocol in those first mad months bisonette said the inventory and warehousing should be speeded up another military detail has been assignedtheyll be there when you get back i want you to report to me on their progress i will the technical and academic assessments can proceed apace how is that going by the way a great deal has been written ultimately i dont know how valuable it will be copies have gone to the ideological branch but i can have them forwarded directly to the departement if youd prefer no never mind let the archivists deal with it there was an explosion i understand a fire at a gasoline depot accidental or sabotage well we arent sure it seems now as if a militiaman might have neglected to set his hand brake there was a robbery but the fire may be coincidental may be its impossible to know at this stage delafleur insists it was sabotage wasnt it bisonette himself who had called delafleur a pompous idiot demarch sensed bureau politics at work here a turn of the wheel probably not to his advantage of course it could have been but theres no way to prove it personally speaking though you have a suspicion a simple robbery and a careless soldier but again i cant present evidence yes i do understand that your bets are covered lieutenant demarch he felt himself blushing the censeur said we dont want to see any more episodes of the kind but in the end it doesnt matter because weve advanced our schedule it took a moment for the significance of that to sink in when it did demarch felt faintly dizzy the weapon he said bisonette nodded watching him closely progress has been faster than we expected weve already dispatched engineers to erect a test gantry the prototype should be available within a matter of weeks i thoughtyou said the spring thats changed do you object lieutenant demarch how could he no although i wonder if it gives us time to extract everything we can from the ah enquiry oh i think weve extracted a considerable amount well be mining the archival material for decades you know from what i understand i think thats enough we cant really let the situation stand as it is lieutenant none of us knows what happened in that place and i doubt that any of us ever willits beyond comprehension which is to say its in the nature of a miracle if we wait to understand it well be waiting until the end of time in the meantime theres a real risk of contagion both figuratively and literally you might look at their medical arcana some time these people may be carrying diseases and that poses an immediate risk theyre certainly carrying ideological diseases he shook his head the site has to be burned and if i had my choice i would sow the ground with saltthough if this weapon operates as promised that wont be necessary demarch tried to rein in his thoughts be practical he instructed himself it might take time to make arrangements people will be suspicious if we start shipping out soldiers en masse im sure they would but most of the soldiers wont be shipped out i dont understand bisonette shrugged as if to dismiss an annoying triviality the town was manned by secondrate troops theyve seen more than we want them talking about theyre disease vectors at least in the figurative sense but dont worry well extract the people we trust after he left bisonette he made an unscheduled stop at the small peripheral building marked enquetes where he had once held a desk job he kept his collar up and walked briskly to the office of guy marris an old friend friendship was important in the centrality friendship governed what gossip you heard the pivot on which a career might turn guy had been a wine friend in bureau jargon someone you trusted enough to get drunk with guys office was a small rooma closet compared to bisonettes conference chamber guy a bespectacled man with more gray hair than demarch remembered looked up from a stack of requisition forms symeon demarch nodded and they talked for a time the usual whatareyoudoingbackintown and whataboutthefamily but this wasnt entirely a social visit and demarch began to drop hints to that effect until guy said you want a documentis that it i need a set of identification papers really just the basics enough for someone to show at checkpoints or to an employer guy studied his face for a long moment and then said come with me they walked to the courtyard a standard maneuver if you wanted privacy demarch wondered why after all these years the hierarchs had never found a way to eavesdrop on this windy common or maybe they had or maybe they knew about it and still permitted a sliver of secrecy no machine runs efficiently without a little grease guy marris shivered at the frigid air he took a victoire cigarette from the package in his breast pocket and lit it with a match i think this is unofficial work youre talking about yes demarch admitted well tell me the essentials i dont promise anything a woman midthirties make her thirtyfive dark hair height five foot eight weight say ten stone she sounds intriguing you still write documents i hope there were times when bureau operatives needed manufactured identification and enquetes was the department they came toat least that was how it was done when demarch worked here oh we do documents guy said that hasnt changed but an unauthorized requisition he shook his head suppose could attribute it to someone else but everything is signed for symeon my name ends up on the paperwork one way or another mind you if it reaches the file room its as good as lost he smiled have you seen records we call it the library of babel but in the meantime if anyone asks questions demarch nodded he already felt guilty about asking about jeopardizing a friend forgive me guy said but you never struck me as the type a liaison is a liaison but you never let it get between you and the bureau is this a special woman i dont mean to bring her home to dorothea only to save her life which was true his feeling about evelyn woodward was that she didnt deserve to die it didnt go deeper than that because he wouldnt allow it to his fatherinlaw had once warned him to beware of women theyre dangerous he had said grinning lewdly they make your soft parts hard and your hard parts soft briefly demarch wondered what hardness inside him evelyn woodward had somehow managed to thaw the wind was cold and guy was beginning to seem nervous the tip of his victoire flared as he drew on it and the tobacco crackled in the chill air how long can you wait a week thats not much i know guy marris took a last draw on the cigarette and crushed it under the heel of a dress shoe come see me before you leave thank you demarch said no dont thank me yet he gave christof a toy he had brought from two rivers it was called a rubiks cube evelyn had said and christof was delighted with the unexpected way it turned and twisted in his hands he insisted on taking it to bed dorothea led him upstairs and demarch sipped an evening brandy with his beaupere his fatherinlaw armand they sat in the library under the eye of more than five hundred books property of the saussere familymainly bound collections of sermons some of them older than armand himself demarch had never liked this room armand sat brooding in his wheelchair five years ago he had suffered a stroke that paralyzed his right leg and removed him from active bureau duty his mind was unaffected the doctors said but since the stroke he had seemed more withdrawn less apt to share himself tonight the brandy seemed to loosen him he turned his head slowly and fixed demarch with a birdlike oneeyed gaze symeon this hasnt been an easy posting for you has it you mean the enquiry yes the enquiry were so shy of words plain words are dangerous but make allowances for me im short of wind tempted to brevity it must be difficult for you well i think ive done a respectable job hard for a man to preside over such strangeness you dont know the half of it demarch thought but armand still cultivated his bureau contacts he obviously knew more than demarch would have guessed he said of course and so many deaths actually there havent been many but there will be and you know it yes he shrugged i dont think about it but you do you know one always thinks about it and if you dont think about it you dream about it armand lowered his voice until it was a rumble from the deep barrel of his chest demarch leaned forward to listen i was at the mandan river armand said after the lakota rebellion they dont tell you about that in the academie do they no nor in any other sort of school except to say that a menace was disposed of careful words discreet they dont tell you what the camps looked like with their watchtowers overlooking the prairie sloughs how the grass goes on for miles and miles they dont tell you how muddy it was that spring or how the smell from the furnaces lingered when the bodies were burned the bodies of men and women and childreni know one isnt supposed to call them that but thats what they were or seemed to be whatever the condition of their souls i suppose their souls went up with the smoke a body is some ounces lighter when it dies i read that somewhere his eyes seemed to glaze everything is a test symeon in our line of work am i being tested were always being tested armand sipped his brandy were all subordinated not just the ones we kill there are no victims you have to remember that were all in the service of something larger than ourselves and the difference between us and those corpses is that we are its willing servants thats all thats all were spared because we put our bodies on the altar every day and not just our bodies but our minds and our wills remember the vow you took when you joined the bureau incipit vita nova a new life begins you leave your priggish little intellect behind the brandy made him reckless he said and our conscience that was never yours armand said dont be absurd he turned out the lights after armand wheeled himself away the fire had burned down to embers he finished his brandy in the dark and then moved upstairs the old mans words seemed to follow him in stuttering echoes through the chilly house we put our bodies on the altar every day but for what something larger than ourselves the bureau the church the protennoia something more surely some idea or vision of the good a republic of permissible relations a step up from the barbarism of the lakota and all the countless other slaughtered aboriginals but the corpses pile higher every day and need to be burned dorothea was asleep when he joined her in bed her long hair lay across the pillow like a black wing she reminded him of a temple serene and pale even in sleep he stood a moment watching the snow that had begun to fall beyond the double panes of the bedroom window he thought about christof christof still acted like a stranger the way he looks at me demarch thought as if hes seeing something alien something that makes him afraid bisonette telephoned after five days we think you should go back tomorrow the censeur said im sorry to cut short your time with your family but the arrangements have already been made whats wrong has something happened only clement delafleur getting a little overzealous in your absence im given to understand hes hanging children in the public square he kissed dorothea goodbye christof was presented for a kiss and consented to it probably he had been coached he told the haitian driver to stop at the bureau centrality on the way to the airport guy marris was in his office demarch said he was stopping to say goodbye he had been summoned back to duty his friend wished him luck and shook his hand at the door he tucked a sheaf of papers into the pocket of demarchs veston neither man spoke of it it had snowed a little the haitian driver said but it would snow much more before long chapter twelve linneth arranged with the schools principal to take dexter graham back to his apartment as inconspicuously as possible in the principals automobile which he still drove from time to time although his hoard of gasoline was almost exhausted mr hoskins was wary of her intentions but understood the urgency of the situation she was aware of the way he watched her in the rearview mirror the distrust was mutual but there was nothing to be done about that fresh snow had fallen and the rear tires slipped each time they turned a corner no one spoke during the drive when the car stopped linneth helped dex out of the rear seat his blood she saw had stained the upholstery the principal pulled away quickly and left them alone in the twining veils of snow linneth guided dex up the steps to his apartment he was lucid enough to use his door key but he passed out again when he reached the bloodstained bed linneth had learned emergency aid during her three years with the christian renunciates she stripped his shirt and unwound the sodden dirty bandage from his arm dex moaned but didnt wake the injury under the bandage leaked blood and suppuration in lazy pulses linneth cleaned it with water and a cloth as gently as possible but the pain was unavoidable dex screamed and twisted away im sorry she said but this has to be done get me something the aspirin the what in the bottle on the kitchen counter she fetched the small tubule of pills and peered at its label the fragmented english defied interpretation is it a narcotic a painkiller and itll bring the fever down she shook out four tablets at his instruction and he swallowed them with water she said do you have a disinfectant too no uh wait theres some bactine in the medicine cabinet for cleaning wounds she didnt like the way his eyes wandered he might not be coherent for cuts he said you spray it on cuts she found the bactine and experimented until she understood the operation of the aerosol bottle when she came back to the bed dex had closed his eyes again he didnt rouse until she bathed his injury with the disinfectant then he screamed until she gave him a wadded pillowcase to bite on the wound was patently a bullet wound the missile had passed through the fleshy part of his upper arm she would have liked to close the injury with stitches but there was no needle or thread at hand he did have sterile cotton in a bag in the bathroom medicine cabinet and she used some of that to pack the wound and a clean linen bandage to wrap it but his fever was very high she pulled a kitchen chair near to the bed and watched him within an hour the fever had subsided at least to her touch and he seemed to be sleeping peacefully that was the effect of the antipyretics linneth supposed still she didnt like the way his wound had lookedor smelled the light from the window was thin and gray the snowy afternoon had begun to wane she called his name until he opened his eyes dex i have to go ill be back if possible before curfew youll stayhere wont you he squinted as if to bring her into focus where the hell would i go out to make more trouble i dont doubt she put a second blanket on him the room was cold and he owned no fireplace or gas jets she hurried through torrents of dry granular snow to the towns medical clinic the town of two rivers lacked a hospital this building was the nearest thing a cube of consulting rooms with windows of tinted glass and a wide tiled lobby dr eichorn would be here today if her luck held she identified herself to the soldier at the door and asked where she could find him first office left off the lobby he said last time i saw him miss dr eichorn was the medical archivist who had been called in like linneth by the proctors he was a tall hairless patrician southerner a teaching physician with a degree in natural history she found him at a desk in a consulting room he was wrapped in two woolen sweaters and a scarf frowning over the pages of a medical journal eyeglasses thick as jewelers loupes riding the end of his nose she tapped the open door he looked up and his eyes narrowed in some combination of suspicion and annoyance miss is it stone we met in the commissarydidnt we yes now that she was here she didnt know how to begin is there something i can help you with yes there is forge ahead she thought dr eichorn i need a course of sulfa drugs you mean youre sick no its for a friend he was like a muddy pond it took time for things to sink in eichorn pushed the journal aside and leaned back in his chair youre that woman anthropologist from boston i am i didnt know you were also a medical prodigy sir im not but i was trained by the christian renunciates and i know how to administer drugs and how to prescribe them the object is to ward off infection in a wound a wound you say yes one of your anthropological subjects the question was awkward but linneth nodded i see well maybe the best thing would be if the patient came to me directly that would be difficult or if you took me to the patient it isnt necessary she worked to keep any hint of desperation out of her voice i know your time is valuable im asking this favor as a colleague dr eichorn as a colleague am i the colleague of a woman who studies savages he shook his bald head ponderously sulfanilamide well thats problematic there was trouble last nightyou may have heard of it only rumors shooting in the main street i see a fire if you say so eichorn studied her from his turgid depths linneth waited for his verdict she counted silently to ten and was careful not to lower her gaze in this building eichorn said there are antibiotics the like of which ive never seen i dont know where this town came from or where it may be going but there were some clever people here well be reaping the rewards for decades we owe someone a debt miss stone i dont know who he rubbed his scalp with a bony hand no one will miss a bottle of pills but lets keep this between us yes linneth knew that something inside her had changed but the change had been gradual and she couldnt be sure of its nature or degree it was as if she had opened a familiar door and found a strange new landscape beyond it maybe the change had begun when the proctor symeon demarch invaded her home in boston or when she arrived in this impossible town but the axis and emblem of that change was surely dexter grahamnot only the man but the qualities she had espied in him skepticism courage defiance she thought at first his virtues might be common american virtues but the evidence for that was scant linneth had sampled the magazines and newspapers of his world and found them brash but often vulgar and concerned above all else with fashion fashions in politics as much as fashions in dress and fashion linneth thought was only that drab whore conformity in gaudier paint dexter graham defied convention he seemed to weigh everythingeverything she said to him her words her presenceon an invisible scale he had the bearing of a judge but there was nothing imperious or awful in it he did not exempt himself from judgment she sensed that he had long ago passed some verdict on himself and the verdict was far from favorable obviously she should have turned him over to the soldiers as soon as she saw his wound but when she thought about it she remembered a passage in the book he had given her huckleberry finn by mr mark twain much of the book had been hard to decipher but there was a pivotal moment when huck debated whether he ought to turn over his friend the negro jim to authorities by the standards of his time giving up jim was the right thing to do huckleberry finn had been told he would go to hell and suffer unspeakable torment if he abetted an escaped slave nevertheless huck helped his friend if it meant going to hell then hed go to hell ill go to hell then linneth thought the sulfa pills rattled in her coat pocket as she paced through snowy gloom because the electricity had been turned off to punish the townspeople there would be no streetlights tonight the military patrols had been redoubled but the snow would slow them down she was allowed to come and go as she wished from the civilians wing of the blue view motel she ate dinner at the commissary in order not to arouse suspicion the dinner was a stew of beef in watery broth and slices of dense bread buttered with suet she told the pions who patrolled the hallway that she would be working on a paper tonight and didnt want to be disturbed she left a lamp burning in her room and pulled the curtains when the pions adjourned to the lobby to smoke their noxious pipes she went out a side door into the windy dark she fell twice hurrying along the empty streets the church bell was tolling curfew when she reached dexter grahams apartment she fed him sulfanilamide and aspirin and sat with him through the night when dex slept she slept on the sofa across the room when he woke often raving or thrashing she bathed his forehead with a damp cloth she was aware of the danger of being here and of the danger dex was in the proctors were like poisonous insectsharmless enough if allowed to toil undisturbed in their nests lethal if aroused she remembered the day the proctors came to arrest her mother before she was sent to the renunciates and that ancient fear rose like flood water from the culverts of memory while she cooled his forehead she admired dexter grahams face he was handsome she seldom thought of the men she knew as handsome or unhandsome they were threats or opportunities seldom friends or lovers the word lover sounded lewd even when she pronounced it in the privacy of her thoughts her last lover if he could be called that was the boy campo that was in the old days when she was very young and before the idolatry laws were enacted her father had taken the family to the annual civic service in rome where the temple of apollo was festooned with garlands and the bishop of rome himself rendered the oracles of the prophetess in latin hexameter linneth was bored by the ritual and sickened by the sacrifice of the animals she avoided services and stayed in the paradeisos where foreign visitors lodgedor at least she promised to in fact she escaped each morning and taught herself to ride the buses and elevated trains and she met campo an egyptian boy who had come to the shrines with his family as linneth had come with hers they spent their meager allowances together on the trams at the zoo in the cafes he told her about alexandria she told him about new york in secret in his small room in the paradeisos they undressed one another her first and last lover campo on the great passenger steamer sardinia bound for new york harbor after the rites were finished linneths mother interpreted her silences and frowns sometimes we meet pan in unexpected places she said smiling obliquely linneth werent the fountains lovely she supposed so and the choirs in the shrine oh yes and the flowers and the perfume and the priestess on the axon yes and that african boy we saw you with linneth supposed he was lovely too she remembered the sunny days on the steamship with the atlantic ocean churning behind she had seen distant mountains of ice blue as summer air floating off the grand banks at night constellations turned like mill wheels in the sky after that her life had changed the proctors took her to finish her schooling with the christian renunciates at their gray stone retraite in snowy utica new york not greece she had worn gray dresses that swept the floor and she had learned the christian panoply of gods archons demiurges and dour apostles and there had not been a lover since campo whose skin had smelled wonderfully of cinnamon and cedar when she was little her mother told her the god who lives in the forest lives in your belly and in your heart she wondered if her fierce scholasticism her invasion of the masculine strongholds of library and carrel had really been a search for that outcast god in whose myths villages meadows sacred places campo and pan and the golden bough she thought everything we worshiped or should have worshiped or neglected to worship she tended dexter graham through his fever as the snow fell from the dark sky after a day he woke and was able to drink a bowl of soup which linneth heated over a wax candle he was thin under the many blankets she bathed him with a sponge and changed his bandage often and she saw that the wound and the fever had drawn heavily on his stores of life and strength she thought he might have lost some of his distrust of her and that was good although his eyes still followed herif not suspiciously at least curiouslyas she moved about the room she was away often enough to establish her presence in the civilians compound in the evenings she came back when dex was awake she talked to him she asked him questions about the book huckleberry finn the decision huck finn makes about jim she explained represents a wellknown heresy to say well then ill go to hell to imply that there exists some moral standard higher than church and law and that this standard is accessible even to an ignorant peasant boy that huck finn might have a firmer grasp of good and evil than for instance a proctor of the bureau well people had burned for less dex said do you think its a heresy of course it is do you mean do i think its true she lowered her voice and eyes of course its true thats why im here a week passed the snow mounted on the sill of the window and the talk between linneth and dex gathered a similar weight she brought a paraffin heater to make his small rooms bearably warm though she still had to wrap herself in sweaters and dex in blankets and she brought food pails of stew or bread with crumbling wedges of cheese linneth talked about herself as the snow sifted against the window glass with a sound that made her think of feathers and diamonds she told him about her childhood when the forests near the familys stone house had seemed enchanted during the icebound winter days about mugs of mulled wine devotions in mysterious latin storybooks wrapped in red paper and imported from the pagan states of southern europe and byzantium her father was bearded devout aloof and learned her mother told secrets something lives in everything her mother said if only you look for it when the idolatry laws were passed and the proctors came to take her father away he went wordlessly a month later they came back for linneths mother who screamed all the way down the drive to the boxy black truck the proctors took linneth too and sent her to the renunciates until a christian aunt in boston bought her free and arranged for her education the best education money could buy dex graham talked about a wholly different childhood suburban fastpaced suffused by the glow of television it was a freer existence than linneth could imagine but narrow too in its way where dex came from no one talked much about life or death or good or evil except linneth pointed out mr mark twain but he was of an older tradition was it possible she wondered to suffocate in triviality in dexs world one could spend ones entire life in a blaze of the most florid triviality it blinds you he said but it doesnt keep you warm she asked if he had been married he said yes his wife had been abigail and his son had been david they were dead they died in a fire their house had burned down were you there when it happened dex looked at the ceiling after a long time he said no then no thats a lie i was there i was in the house when it caught fire she had to lean closer to hear him i used to drink sometimes i drank to excess so one night i came home late i went to sleep on the sofa because i didnt want to disturb abby when i woke up a couple of hours later the air was full of smoke there were flames running up the stairs abby and david were up there i tried to go after them but i couldnt get through burned the hair off my face the fire was too hot or i was too scared of it neighbors called the fire department and a guy with an oxygen mask dragged me out of the house but the question isin the end nobody could say what started the fire the insurance people investigated but it was inconclusive so i keep thinking did i knock over a lamp leave a cigarette burning the kind of thing a drunk does he shook his head i still dont know whether i killed them he looked at her as if he regretted saying it or feared what she might say so she didnt speak only took his hand and touched a cooling cloth to his forehead she came to the apartment every day even when his recovery made it obvious she wasnt needed she liked being here the room dex graham occupied was sparsely furnished but oddly pleasant especially now that the punitive week had passed and the lights were back on it was a cloistered space a bubble of warmth in the snow that seemed never to stop falling dex tolerated her presence and even appeared to welcome it though he was often subdued often quiet there was a dimple of pink flesh where the bullet had entered his arm the wound still hurt him he favored the arm she had to mind the injury when she came into bed with him this was a sin she reckoned by some lights but not a sin of the forest or the belly or the heart the renunciates would call it a sin so would that bureau ideologue delafleur let them linneth thought it doesnt matter let them call it what they want ill go to hell chapter thirteen on the first night of that cold week when the windows grew opaque with ice and the street was crowded with soldiers clifford tore up his maps and notes and flushed them down the toilet the maps were evidence of his guilt they might not prove anything but they would surely get him into trouble if luke for instance found them he couldnt dispose of the radio scanner as easily he buried it under a stack of encyclopedias of science at the back of his bedroom closetbut only until he could think of a more permanent solution his mood alternated between boredom and panic in those first days after the fire wild rumors circulated cliffords mother passed them on absentmindedly but in meticulous detail over the meager dinners she made him sit down to she kept perishables in the snow on the back step since the refrigerator wasnt working mostly there was bread and cheese on the table and not much of that people had seen peculiar things his mother said some people claimed they saw god that night or maybe it was the devilthough what either one of them would want with the beacon street filling station was beyond her according to mrs fraser some soldiers had died in the explosion according to someone else it was a proctor who had been killed and god help us all if that was true mr kingsley next door said it was some new experiment at the defense plant that caused the explosion but joe kingsley hadnt been in his right mind since his wife died last august you could tell because he never washed his clothes anymore and so on on friday clifford picked up a singlesheet edition of the two rivers crier from the stack at the corner of beacon and arbutus the newspaper reported hooliganism on the main street but said no one had been seriously hurt and clifford decided to believe that although you couldnt be sure of what they printed in the crier anymore the towns punishment had been fairly mild considering what was possible and the number of soldiers on the street declined over the course of the week so it was probably true that no one had been killed if a soldier or a proctor had died clifford thought things would be much worse it was good to think he hadnt hurt anyone still the presence of the scanner in his closet continued to make him nervous he lost sleep thinking about it his mother said cliffy are you sick your eyes are all puffy friday night luke came to the house again he brought rice and a half pound of fatty ground beef plus the inevitable quart jar of barracks whiskey cliffords mother cooked the meat and rice for dinner all of it at once the whiskey she placed at the back of the counter next to the microwave oven handling the bottle as reverently as if it were a piece of the true cross clifford ate a good share of food although the conversation at the table was strained and halting as usual the talk picked up after he departed for his room they always sent him to his room after dinner clifford only went as far as the halfway point on the stairsclose enough to the kitchen to hear what was being said close enough to the bedroom to make good his escape when they left the table what his mother said to luke or the soldier to his mother sometimes bewildered him and sometimes made him blush his mother seemed like a different person a stranger with a hidden history and a new vocabulary the soldier called her ellen that made him uneasy clifford had never thought of his mother as ellen as she drank she used more dirty words she said no shit or well fuck and clifford always winced when this happened luke drank too and in the long pauses between drinking he would talk about his work it was this talk clifford particularly wanted to hear the disaster on beacon street should have cured him of eavesdropping he thought eavesdropping with the scanner had almost gotten him killed but he went on listening to luke it seemed important he couldnt say why tonight was a good example tonight luke talked about all the bulldozers that had come in from fort leduc and what the bulldozers were doing on the edge of town tuesday was the first food depot day after the electricity came back on and clifford volunteered to make the trip to pick up rations his mother agreed which was no surprise she seldom left the house if she could help it some days she didnt even leave her room the air outside was damp and cold the pale sun at noon was just warm enough to melt the skin of the fallen snow and fill the gutters with frigid water clifford passed the time during the long walk to the food depot by trying to make perfect footprints in the crusty snow when he stepped straight down his boots left cookiecutter outlines behind him he carried an empty bag to fill up with food and another baga plastic bag into which he had placed the radio scanner in its box he held the bag with the scanner close to his body and hoped no one would pay it any attention at the depot he collected the familyallowance of bread and cheese then he stood across the street under the awning of the two rivers thrift shop watching the ration line grow as it hitched forward the people in the line looked unhappy and too thin some of them were sick the cold week had been hard on people his mother had told him he paid attention to the faces of the men in the line would he recognize the one he was looking for he thought so but it was hard to wait his toes were numb inside his boots the cold air made his nose run the line lengthened until it was twenty people long then it began to shrink as the shadows grew the soldiers dispensing food were tired they punched notches into ration cards without really looking at them and paused to take off their gloves and blow into their cupped hands clifford was about to begin the walk home disappointed when he saw the man he was waiting for the man looked skinnier than clifford rememberedand he had been a thin man to begin withbut it was definitely the same one the man joined the line and waited with no particular expression on his thin face when he reached the front he offered his ration card for clipping then opened a dirty cloth bag for the bread and cheese then he turned and walked away with his head bent into the wind clifford gathered his own food bag in one hand and the bag with the scanner in the other and followed the man west toward commercial and river after a twisty walk among the slatboard houses of the west end of town the man went into a shabby house clifford hesitated on the sidewalk a shoal of cloud had hidden the low sun and meltwater was freezing in the gutters there was a film of ice on the empty road he went to the door of the house and knocked howard poole opened the door and peered in obvious surprise from a dim hallway the plume of his breath hung like a feather in the air clifford wanting to be sure said youre the man on the hill at the defense plant that day youre howard he nodded slowly and youre clifford i remember he looked around the snowbound yard did you follow me here clifford said yes but youre alone right yes you need something you need some help no clifford said i brought you something well come in in the barely warm kitchen clifford took the radio scanner from its bag and set it on the table he explained to howard how it worked and how he was able to hear the soldiers talking on the marine band he left out what had happened to the gas station he didnt want even howard to know about that howard accepted the gift gravely he said it would probably be useful though he wasnt sure how clifford you want something to drink theres milk powder even a little chocolate i could probably manage cocoa it was tempting but clifford shook his head i have to get home but theres something else you remember when i told you about luke luke the soldier my mother sees oh yes i remember he talked about something theyre doing he said the proctors brought in a whole bunch of earthmovers from fort leduc band saws too and stump cutters theyre using them all around the town following the line where you know where our territory meets their territorythat whole circle theyre cutting down trees and digging up dirt its a big project from my house you can hear the noise all the way from coldwater road howard looked very solemn his eyes were big behind those tapedup glasses clifford did luke say why theyre doing this he says he doesnt know and the proctors wont talk about it but it looks like what theyre cutting is one big firebreak the boy went out into a windy dusk howard wanted to pass on this information about the proctors to dex but curfew was too close and a visit might be dangerous in any case he closed the door maybe tomorrow the house was dark after months of hiding here howard was still reluctant to use the lights but a little light was good for a week the cantwell house had been cold and dark and even more lonely than it had seemed in the autumn a strange shore to have washed up on he still felt like an intruder here he climbed the stairs to paul cantwells study and loaded the last fifty pages of the buchanan and bayard counties white pages into the hewlettpackard pc this work had been interrupted maddeningly by the week of darkness and today by the need to pick up rations he finished it now with more dread than excitement the experiment for which he had risked so muchhis life his friend dexs lifemight be exactly as ephemeral as dex had predicted he had built an ornate palace of conjecture and that delicate structure might well collapse under the weight of reality the telephone number stern gave him hadnt appeared in the first hundred pages of the phone bookunless the optical reader had mistranslated it or the program he was reading it into had some kind of flaw but that was unlikely more likely was that he simply hadnt found the number yet or that it was unlisted howard finished loading the directory and told the computer to sort for the target number the disk drive chattered into the silent room it didnt take long the machine announced success as prosaically as it had announced failure the number simply appeared highlighted in blue a name and address appeared at the left wintermeyer r halton road two rivers less than three blocks from here he spent a sleepless night thinking about stern his mind crowded with a hundred memories and a single image stern so like his name fiercely intelligent eyes dark lips pursed behind a curly beard generous but mysterious howard had been talking to alan stern for much of his life and every conversation had been a treasured event but what had he learned about the man in back of the ideas only a few clues from his mother stern the enigmatic stern who was his mother once said trying to secede from the human race howard walked to the halton road address in the morning in a dizzy mixture of anticipation and dread the house itself was nothing special an old twostory row house faced with pink aluminum siding the tiny lawn and the narrow passway at the side were obscured by snow a tin trash can peeked out from a drift a path snaked to the front door there was a light in a downstairs window howard pushed the doorbell and heard the buzzer ring inside a woman answered the door she was in her fifties howard guessed slim smallboned her gray hair long and loose she looked at him warily but that was how everyone looked at strangers nowadays he said are you r wintermeyer ruth r only to my tax form she narrowed her eyes you look a little familiar but only a little im howard poole im alan sterns nephew her eyes widened and she took a step back oh my god i think you really are you even look like him he talked about you of course but i thought what you know i thought you must have been killed at the lab no i wasnt there they didnt have a place for mei stayed in town that night he looked past her into the dim interior of the house she said well please come in warm air embraced him he tried to restrain his curiosity but his eyes searched for evidence of stern the furniture in the sitting room a sofa side table bookcaseswas casual but clean a book was splayed open on an easy chair but he couldnt read the title howard said is my uncle here ruth looked at him for a time is that what you thought he gave me the telephone number but not the address it took me a long time to find you howard your uncle is dead he died at the lab that night with everybody else im sorry i thought you would have assumed i mean he did spend most of his nights here but there was something going on some kind of work did you really think he might be here after all this time howard felt breathless i was sure of it why he shrugged it was a feeling she gave him another longer look then she said i have that feeling too sit down please howard would you like coffee i think we have a lot to talk about chapter fourteen the clergy of two rivers had responded to the events of the summer by putting together what they called the ad hoc ecumenical council a group of pastors representing the towns seven christian churches and two synagogues the group met in brad congreves basement twice a month congreve an ordained lutheran minister was proud of his work he had assembled a delegation from every religious group in town except for the kingdom hall of jehovahs witnesses and the vedanta buddhist temple which in any case was only annie stoller and some of her new age friends sitting crosslegged in the back of annies selfhelp store the churches had not always been on friendly terms and it was still a chore to keep the baptists talking to the unitarians for instance but they all faced a common danger in this peculiar new world certainly they had all shared a trial of faith congreve often felt the way he supposed the incas must have felt when pizarro marched into town with banners flyingdoomed that is at least in the long run there was a christianity here but it was like no christian doctrine congreve had ever imaginedit was not even monotheistic the god of the proctors presided over a cosmogony as crowded as the super bowl jesus being only one of the major players worse these faux christians were numerous and well armed symeon demarch had allowed the churches to carry on with services which had been a morale booster but it was congreves private conviction that the writing was on the wall he might not go to his death a martyr but he would probably go down as one of the last living lutherans there was not even history to sustain him history had been erased somehow the only thing that had not been challenged was his belief in miracles in the meantime he drew together the christian community in two rivers and tried to set a dignified tone there was argument tonight about the explosion at the filling station and the curious phenomena some people had seen there signs and wonders congreve shunted that aside when he called the meeting to order it was not the kind of issue they could resolve it only fostered disagreement instead he raised the more immediate and practical question of christmas decorations the electrical power would be restored by the beginning of next week and it was already the first of december although it felt more like january with all this snow his youth group wanted to string christmas lights on the church lawn a few lights would make everybody feel better congreve supposed but christmas lights were a religious display and according to demarch all such displays needed prior approval by the proctors that was where the problem arose symeon demarch was out of town the man in charge was an unpleasant bureaucrat named clement delafleur father gregory of the catholic church had already spoken to delafleur and the meeting had not been a happy one delafleur had expressed a desire to close down the churches altogether and had called father gregory an idolator and an alien but christmas decorations were a secular tradition too and no doubt some of the private citizens in two rivers would be moved to dig out their strings of lightsso why not the churches a plausible argument congreve thought but the proctors might disagree he counseled a prudent caution reverend lockheed of the mission baptist said his young people were also anxious to do something to mark the season so how about decorating the big pine in the civic gardens outside city hallas a kind of test case if the proctors objected the lights could be unstrung though not without vocal objections if congreve knew terry lockheed lockheed made it a formal motion congreve would have preferred to hold over the entire issue until demarch was back why court trouble but the show of hands overruled him the combined lutheran and baptist youth groups plus interested parties from the episcopalians and catholicsabout seventyfive young people in allconverged on the civic gardens east of city hall the next saturday morning electrical power was still interdicted at the source so no one brought lightsthose could be added later instead there were ribbons balls colored string spunglass angels gold and silver coronets tinsel brocade and popcorn chains by the yard a morning snow fell gently and there was room for everything among the capacious snowy branches of the tree reverend lockheed showed up with a cherrypicking ladder so that even the peaks of the big pine were not neglected work went on for more than two hours despite the cold when the last ornament was installed pastor congreve handed out songsheets printed on the methodists handcrank mimeograph silent night to be followed by come all ye faithful midway through the first carol a military vehicle pulled up across the road and a single soldier emerged the militiaman stood looking on without expression congreve wondered if he understood the purpose of the display the soldier watched arms folded across his chest but didnt interfere across the square a crowd of townspeople had been watching the treetrimming they ignored the militiaman and clapped for the carolers terry lockheed looked at the soldier then at congreve a mute enquiry should we carry on why not congreve thought one more song if this was a crisis they were already well in it he nodded his head the faithful the joyful the triumphant were duly summoned then suddenly there was nothing left of the morning the young people adjourned to tuckers restaurant for hot milk the crowd melted away before long the civic gardens were empty save for the soldier the tree and the falling snow the tree disappeared that night sometime before dawn it was cut thrown into the back of a military transport and burned on the perpetual trash fire in the parking lot of the highway eleven only the stump remained a snowcovered hummock by the dim light of morning the news traveled fast it was never clear who initiated the youth club picket forced to guess brad congreve would have picked the thickset burmeister girl sheldathe one who wore bottleglass lenses and quoted gandhi during sunday discussion it was exactly the sort of febrile notion shelda would have taken into her head she was certainly one of the twelve young people who had set up a picket line around the civic gardens carrying stickandcardboard signs with such legends as let us worship as we choose and jesus doesnt play favorites this time there was no pastoral guidance and no approving crowd of strangers this wasnt fun or familiar this was patently dangerous pedestrians who saw the picket line stared a moment then turned away when the soldiers came shelda and her eleven compatriots filed submissively into the back of a dunggreen transport truck in best gandhian fashion they were willing to be arrested calmly they appealed to the consciences of the soldiers the soldiers grim as stones said nothing at all the trouble with being close to a man evelyn woodward thought is that you find out his secrets from hints and silences from phone calls halfoverheard and words halfpronounced and documents glimpsed as they crossed his desk she had learned one of symeon demarchs secretsa secret too terrible to contain and impossible to share it was a secret about what was going to happen to two rivers no worse than that lets not be coy evelyn thought it was a secret about the last thing that would happen to two rivers it was a secret about an atomic bomb no one called it that but she had discerned words like nucleic and megaton among the veiled discussion of what would be done with the town the vexing and impossible town of two rivers now with symeon away and the house empty and all this snow coming so relentlessly from a woolen sky the secret was an awkward weight inside her it was like having a terminal disease no matter how hard she tried not to think about it her thoughts came circling back her only consolation was that symeon had not originated the idea and even seemed to despise it he hadnt argued when he talked to his superiors but she heard the unhappiness in his voice and when he told her she would be safe he seemed to mean it he would take her away he might not live with her he had a wife and child in the capital but he would find a place for her out of harms way maybe she would go on being his mistress but that left everybody else her neighbors she thought dex graham the grocer the schoolkidseverybody how do you imagine so many deaths if you went to hiroshima before the bomb fell and you told those people what was going to happen to them they wouldnt believe younot because it wasnt plausible but because the human mind cant contain such things there was plenty of food and she dealt with the cold by burying herself in sweaters and blankets and lighting the propane stove symeon had left but she couldnt keep out the dark and in the dark her thoughts were loudest sleep didnt help one night she dreamed she was hester prynne from the scarlet letter but the a on her breast stood for atom not adultery she was gratified when at the end of that unendurable week the electricity came back she woke up to a wave of new heat the blankets were superfluous the room was warm the windows ran wet with condensation she ate a hot breakfast and sat by the stove until it was time for a hot lunch and then a hot dinner and bright lights to batten out the night the morning after that she felt both restless and celebratory she decided she would take a walk not in any of the fine dresses symeon had given her which would mark her for abuse but in her old clothes her old jeans her shabby blouse and heavy winter jacket dressing in these things was like putting on a discarded skin old clothes have old memories inside briefly she wondered what dex was doing now but dex had moved out when the lieutenant came evelyn had chosen to stay in the house dex had been threatened by the proctors worst of all dex was going to die in the bomb blast damn that hideous unstoppable thought she walked along beacon past commercial until she reached the woody corner of powell creek park which was quite far enough her cheeks were ruddy and her feet were cold the exercise helped to empty her mind evelyn hummed to herself from deep in her throat there was not much traffic on the streets and it was better that way she decided to go home by way of city hall a walk she had always enjoyed in winter when the skating rink was open she didnt skate but she used to like seeing the people glide in looping curves like beings from a better world light as angels of course the skating rink was closed the civic gardens looked barren too city hall itself was stony gray and there was something odd about the lampposts lining the avenue when she saw the dead children she didnt understand what she was looking at the bodies were stiff inside frozen clothing they moved in the wind but not like anything human the ropes had been thrown over the angle brackets of the streetlights and knotted in timeless fashion around the childrens necks the childrens hands had been tied behind their backs and their faces were hidden under shapeless hemp sacks evelyn came closer without really meaning to shocked beyond reason the shock was purely physical like putting your finger in a wall socket she felt it in her arms and legs somebody went and hung their laundry from the lampposts she thought and then the world became suddenly much uglier no those are children those are dead children she stopped and stood for a long time looking at the dead children hanging from the lampposts outside city hall a delicate snow began to float down from the sky the flakes of snow were large and perfect and they landed on the humped frozen clothing of the dead children until the dead children were clothed all in white a perfect unsullied purity a patrol car passed on the snowy street evelyn turned to look at the soldier who was driving but he was hidden in the shadow of the car and had turned his head away away from evelyn or away from what evelyn had seen she walked without a destination and after a bleak passage found herself peering up through veils of snow to the window of dex grahams apartment his light was on the window was a yellow punctuation in the snowscabbed brick wall she went inside walked up the stairs knocked on his door dex opened the door and looked at her with unconcealed surprise maybe he had been expecting someone else that was natural after so much time apart but seeing him she was overwhelmed with memories that seemed terribly immediate of his voice his touch his smell there was that catalog of intimate knowledge still between them she wasnt entitled to it but couldnt put if away he said evelyn evelyn what is itare you all right i have to tell you a secret she said chapter fifteen we met at a bar ruth wintermeyer said sounds tacky doesnt it but really we met because hed read my book she lit a cigarette drew the smoke into her lungs and closed her eyes a moment after the accident at the lab ruth said she had driven to the local grocery and filled a bag with cartons of cigarettes lately she had weaned herself to one cigarette a dayjust a little taste of better times she had two packs left howard poole sat in an easy chair opposite her too warm in his jacket but cold without it like everyone else ruth wintermeyer was cautious about turning up her heatas if electricity could be hoarded too she said im a member of the historical society i wrote a book of peninsula history from colonial times to the civil war strictly amateur scholarship my degrees are thirty years old and my publisher doesnt distribute east of the great lakes but i guess in two rivers that makes me an intellectual your uncle called on the phone and we got together he was interested in the history of the town in a way think he was adopting it he refused to live in government housingwhen i met him he was renting a room at the blue view very unorthodox the government wanted him inside perimeters but stern wouldnt hear of it he was a kind of scientific celebrity and he could get away with a little prima donna behavior i think the price of having stern was indulging stern she paused not that the security people werent busy when he started seeing me suddenly there were these you know little men these guys in threepiece suits parked outside the house or asking questions at the bank checking my credit record and so forth i guess i passed the test im not much of a security risk you two were dating does that surprise you no its just that i never saw much of his personal life to be honest i wasnt sure he had one a private life a romantic life i guess i imagined he was all intellect i know what you mean he didnt do intimacy very well part of him was always detached howard have you always called him stern everybody in the family called him stern except my mother when they were together and even thenshe called him alan but i didnt sense a real connection she said he always stood apart even as a child the sterns were a big family had a big house on long island not rich but certainly not poor there was some inherited money i think ruth said a religious family agnostic at best because he talked a lot about religion he had some odd ideas ruth stubbed out her cigarette and cleared her throat maybe we should talk about those odd ideas she said the conversation wound into the afternoon ruth fed him sandwiches and coffee for lunch ground coffee from the pine street depot its stale and theres more than a little chicory in it but its hot and as curfew approached and a new snow dappled the windows a picture of stern began to emerge alan stern the outsider the one who stood apart even in childhood stern the seeker his religiosity wasnt so mysterious howard thought it was not an uncommon motivation among the scientists howard knew though few of them would admit it one of the things that drew people to cosmology was the promise that the universe might yield up a secret or two maybe even the secret a glimpse into the hidden order of things but the best science is always tentative a grope into the darkness that was never enough for stern he wanted more he was always playing with the grand systems in his own field he paid attention to people like guth and linde the fearless theoreticians or else it was hegel platonism the gnostics oh gnosticismhe loved to talk about hellenic and christian gnosticism and it was genuinely interesting i borrowed some of his books but it wasnt just a hobby he saw something in it himself ruth said promptly he saw himself in it what would you call the basic gnostic idea howard i think its that theres a secret world that its hidden from us but we can find our way to it or hack to it because were imperfect reflections of perfect souls embedded in an imperfect world cast out from the pleroma howard supplied the world of light yes the gnostics said you can find your way to this because youre part of it you long for it its your original true home howard pictured stern as a lonely child perhaps too aware of his own awkwardness and great intelligence he must have felt it keenly that lost imperium from which he had dropped into humble matter and we do live in an unholy world ruth said he was always conscious of that when he watched the news on tv the wars and the starving children he looked like he was in pain howard said it became an obsession oh at least more than that ruth are you questioning his sanity i dont want to judge i knew him for a little more than a year howard we were close i loved him or i thought i did all i can say is during that time he changed maybe something at the lab affected him he started spending more time with his books he picked up religious arguments everybody else abandoned centuries ago worse he wanted to have these arguments with me she held up her hands in a helpless gesture i dont have any particular faith in god i dont know if evil is a creative force i worry about you know shopping or the national debt if im ambitious not theology the room was silent for a moment howard listened to the ticking of snow on a windowpane he sipped coffee ruth toyed with her cigarette pack but didnt light one he said its hard not to make the connection she nodded at once ive thought of that its a neat little scenario stern is obsessed with gnosticism he runs the two rivers research lab something happens out there god knows what and were transplanted into a place where theres a powerful church that professes a version of gnostic christianity i wasnt sure you knew about that ive heard the soldiers at the food depot swearing by samael and sophia achamoth i dont know the details if its a meaningful connection howard said what are we saying that stern somehow brought us here somehow yes thats the implication i cant imagine what it means in practical terms whatever happened at the lab may still be happening there was that incident on beacon street god in a pillar of blue light god or someone howard hesitated you know i truly thought he would be here ruth i hadi still havea powerful feeling that stern is alive yes so do i they regarded one another but if hes alive ruth said finally i dont know where he can be except at the lab and i thought the lab had been destroyed maybe not howard thought he recalled the buildings trapped in light the luminous forms roaming the old ojibway land ruth stood up howard its getting late things being what they are you shouldnt cut it too close to curfew but before you go theres something i want you to see she led him up the stairs to a door at the end of a dim corridor it used to be a spare bedroom ruth said he made it into his study the door opened on a tiny room crowded with bookcases the bookcases overflowing with volumes howard supposed had been his uncles there were physics journals shelved with religious esoterica philology texts next to photo reproductions of aramaic codices had stern taught himself to read aramaic it was unlikely howard thought but far from impossible the room was obviously sterns there was a sweater hanging from the back of the wooden chair that faced an oak desk an electric typewriterno computer the room even smelled like stern a musty echo of pipe tobacco and crumbling paper howard felt dizzy with the memories it evoked i never went in here much ruth said he didnt like me to i didnt even clean even now i dont go in here very often it feels funny but ive looked at a few things she picked up a thick bundle of typewritten pages bound with a rubber band he left this howard took the manuscript from her what is it his diary she said the one he never showed the people at the lab the single word journal was typed on the top page howard regarded it with wide eyes he said have you read it only a little its technical i dont understand it she looked at him solemnly maybe you will part three our work yields a harvest of impossibilities speculation is that the fragment may not be matter as we conventionally know itapart from its measurable mass and volume it lacks qualities we would call material it cannot be subdivided its structure is grainless undifferentiated even at great magnification though optical scanning might be misleading for several reasons its radiation violates the inversesquare law as if the curvature of local space were being disturbed by an immensely greater mass though the fragment can be lifted by four reasonably strong men although none of us would be so unwise as to touch it it seems to conjure highenergy photons from the surrounding air and shifts them toward the red as it radiates them the effect includes reflected light the fragment actually seems disproportionately more distant as you back away that is it shrinks too quickly with distance the inverse is also true and makes nearfield measurement almost impossible at microscopic distances the fragment appears as a homogeneous structure as large as the surface of a star though fortunately not as energetic although this makes it hard to handle perhaps the miracle is that it is not much harder what a privilege to be allowed to witness these mysteries how strange that the fragment should have come from an excavation in a middle eastern desert draw a radius of a thousand miles around the dig site and it encloses centuries of religious thought moses jesus mithra manx valentinus recall lindes idea of the observable cosmos arising from a chaotic foam of possible configurations of space and time embedded in tangled up with other universes similar and dissimilar in a dream saw the fragment as something whole as a sort of wormhole boat for traveling between adjacent islands of creation in the dream the vehicle was assembled by luminous beings strange and unknowable dwelling in the pleroma using the device to penetrate the mystery of created matterbut unsuccessfullybroken fragments of ursubstance scattered through countless islands of spacetime including our own we mean to bombard the fragment with highenergy particles knocking on heavens door from the secret journal of alan stern chapter sixteen when the bureau de la convenance collaborates with the war department symeon demarch thought anything is possible the test gantry had been assembled in his absence it rose from a bald patch of ground in the forest two miles west of the wreckage of the laboratory facility and it looked deceptively simple a steel tourelle that might have passed for a watchtower a crane was in place to lift the weapon into its cradle the weapon itselfor its parts prior to final assemblyhad arrived on two fiercely guarded trucks from the airstrip in fort leduc along with a cargo of nervous technicians the bomb parts resided now under the roof of a tin shed nearby tended under glaring banks of lights by the same whitesmocked civilians demarch walked the grounds with clement delafleur the ideological branch attache who had become his chief rival in two rivers a gentle snow encircled the two men and softened the harsh angles of the gantry on its concrete pad the snow did nothing to soften the equally harsh lines of clement delafleur he was at least ten years older than demarch and much closer to confirmation as a fully fledged censeur the lines of his face were a geology of ancient frowns and disapprovals etched there by decades of political maneuvering no doubt delafleur had more friends at the centrality than demarch himselfperhaps even including censeur bisonette whose branch loyalties ran in one direction and personal loyalties perhaps in quite another all of which meant that demarch could not openly question the wisdom of hanging twelve of the towns children by the neck until dead he could only allude to itdelicately delafleur chose to be more blunt what they were doing was insurrection and the actions i took were well within our brief you know that as well as i do the noon bellsounded across the camp demarch listened as the ringing faded into the perimeter of snowy trees he wondered what he ought to say his own position was still unclear he remembered riding back into town and seeing the small corpses dangling like wheat sacks from the street lamps he had ordered them cut down he said i wont debate the justice of it or your authority to give the order only whether it was wise to generate more ill feeling he nodded at the test gantry especially now i fail to see why i ought to be concerned about the sensibilities of people who are next door to annihilation to avoid provoking counterattacks for one a military patrol had already taken rifle fire from a grieving parent the parent had gone the way of his offspring but on a less public gallows we can deal with that delafleur said but should we have to its moot and delafleur looked at the test gantry as if it answered all objections perhaps it did demarch had learned a few things about the nature of the weapon difficult to believe that it can do what they say yes i dont understand it myself to think of everything within such a vast radius leveled or burned the engineers have cleared a firebreak all around the perimeter or else we might lose much of the forestwe might burn the entire peninsula he shook his head they say it operates on the same principle as the sun itself incredible these trees would be kindling demarch thought and the town a brick ovenan oven full of meat the image made him wince you deserve some of the credit delafleur said looking at him slyly it was your idea to plunder the libraries was it not which im given to understand helped advance the work on the bomb at least by a few months they were already well along of course so it isnt all your fault delafleurs smile was bottomless you neednt look so startled lieutenant he consulted with delafleur and an adjutant about evacuation plans the agenda came from the capital but there were details to be arranged it was almost surrealistic demarch thought to be negotiating escape timetables with this prim endlessly fastidious bureau functionary delafleur was like so many of the hierarchs demarch had met ambitious loyal and utterly innocent of conscience the impending deaths of thousands of people mattered to him less than the protocol of this rush to the exits but wasnt that as it should be if the deaths were sanctioned by church and state wasnt it absurd to question the decision if bureau functionaries made their own policies and obeyed their own consciences surely the only result would be anarchy still there was something evil about delafleur according to the church every soul possessed an apospasma theiona fragment of god but if such a fragment existed in delafleur it must be buried very deeply when the negotiations were finished he drove through a bitter dusk to the house where evelyn was in the bedroom she looked at him with a wounded warinessthe way she had been looking at him every day since his return he knew she had seen the executed children though she hadnt spoken of it her wide bruised eyes reminded him of christof upstairs intimidated by her silence demarch showed her the documents he had obtained from guy marris evelyn looked at them with no visible emotion this is me for certain purposes the travel permits were blue registration yellow citizenship green birth and baptism pink guy had been as thorough as ever im not as tall as it says it wont matter evelyn no one really looks she folded the papers and handed them back this is for when we leave town yes he knew she had surmised something of what would happen he didnt know how much they hadnt talked about it only exchanged glances she said when the decision hasnt been made how soon symeon this was treasonous he thought but so were the documents so were his thoughts there was no turning back now before the end of the month he said chapter seventeen dex talked to bob hoskins who sent him to one of the pta parents terry shoemaker who introduced him in turn to a skinny excharter pilot named calvin shepperd they met in tuckers restaurant in the small back room that had served as a pantry in the days when there was enough food to store dex shook the older mans hand and introduced himself i know who you are shepperd said my brothers girl cleo was in your history class couple years back he seemed to hesitate bob hoskins vouched for you but frankly i was reluctant to have you involved may i ask why oh the obvious for one thing youre seeing that woman from outside her name is linneth stone her name doesnt matter the point is i dont know what she says to you or you to her and that raises a question plus didnt you used to go out with evelyn woodward at the bedandbreakfast whos been on the arm of the chief proctor lately small town dex observed is was and will be im not opposed to gossip mr graham especially nowadays as gossip its honest enough dex said all those things are true maybe theyre liabilities but they gave me access to some information you need meaning bob hoskins tells me youre trying to set up an escape route to ferry out some of the local families bob hoskins must have a fair amount of confidence in you shepperd sighed and folded his arms go on evelyn had come to his apartment three times with fresh information much of it gleaned from documents demarch had left unattended on his desk dex described the firebreak the bombthe apocalypse bearing down on two rivers like a runaway train shepperd leaned against a shelf that harbored a single gallon can of pinto beans and listened with a fixed expression when dex finished he cleared his throat so what are we talking abouta week two weeks i cant pin it down but that sounds like the right range we might not have much warning theyll have to evacuate the soldiers i dont think theyre planning to what you mean leave em here let em burn dex nodded jesus shepperd said coldhearted bastards he shook his head bet any money the proctors move out though so theres some warning there if any of what youre telling me is true dex said nothing shepperd put his hands in the pockets of his jacket i suppose i should thank you dex shrugged incidentally hoskins said he was surprised when you came to him with this he figured you were mainly talk not much action so what changed your mind twelve kids hanging from the city hall lampposts yeah wellthatll do it twelve kids hanging from the lampposts dex thought as he walked the snowy streets twelve kids some of whom he had known personally three of them his students twelve kids any one of whom might have been his son might have been david if david had lived he didnt believe you linneth asked she sat at dexs kitchen table warming her hands over a pot of ration tea the sky beyond the window was blue a cold wind rattled the loose pane he believed me dex said he didnt want me to know it but he believed me how large is his group maybe thirty forty adults plus their families according to bob hoskins theyve scared up some hunting rifles and even a couple of automatic weapons amazing what some people keep in their basements they hope to escape so i gather it isnt very many people considering the size of the town there are other groups like shepperds but they dont talk much to each otherand it may be better that way still no matter what too many people will die he nodded she said even the scholars from outside i dont think they mean to let us leave weve seen too much and were too likely to talk about it dex said well get out a few lives saved is probably the best we can hope for he shrugged into his jacket she said where are you going now unfinished business im going to look for howard poole let me come with you he thought about it theres another jacket in the closet leave yours here and keep a scarf around your head i dont want us to be recognized she walked beside him in the street head down her arm in his she was small and perfect dex thought and probably doomed like everybody else in these quiet winter houses chapter eighteen so much had become clear in the last few dayshoward didnt know how to begin to tell dex dex had come out of a cold afternoon without warning he brought a woman with him linneth stone an outsider but not a proctor dex said you can talk in front of her shes an academic howardshe has tenure he looked at her whats your subject cultural ethnology oh kinship systems yuck howards a physicist dex said oh linneth said atomic particles yuck but the news was more important than all this howard turned to dex and said listen i found her her the woman stern was living with shes only a couple of blocks away and she has all his notes howard that doesnt matter now but it does it matters a lot dex exchanged a look with linneth then sighed all right he said tell me what you found out stern wasnt the only physicist obsessed with god think about einsteins objection to quantum theory or schrodingers notion of the hidden unity of the human mind if you look hard enough at the cosmos howard said all these metaphysical questions emergereligious questions but sterns obsession was much stranger than that he had been godhaunted from his earliest childhood driven by what could only be called a compulsion by dreams or visions or maybe even a hidden physical problem a tumor temporallobe epilepsy borderline schizophrenia stern had studied the worlds religious texts for clues to a mystery that must have seemed omnipresent urgent and taunting the mystery of what might lie beyond the borders of human knowledge he had looked for answers with equal vigor in einstein and the talmud in heisenberg and meister eckehart physics gave him a career but he never set aside his volumes of esoterica he had been especially fascinated by the wild cosmogonies of the early christian gnostics creation myths cobbled together from fragments of judaism hellenic paganism eastern mystery religions in the flourishing mystical thought of the late roman empire stern had perceived a fertile metaphor for the universe behind the quantum and before creation he must have been a brilliant man linneth said terrifyingly brilliant a little scornful of his colleagues he was capable of eccentric behaviorhe never wore any clothes but jeans and tshirts even when he accepted the nobel prize but he had the brains to get away with it intimidating linneth said always it was part of his shtick it made him a reputation and it was his reputation that brought him here dex said im surprised he accepted government work he didnt want to especially during the cold war government research was often the equivalent of dropping into a black hole if your work is classified you cant publish and if you cant publish it aint science but they made him an offer he couldnt refuse they promised him a long look into the heart of the mystery howard described the turkish fragment an object so defiantly strange that it beggared comprehension you can imagine how it fed sterns obsessions by day he took measurements and made cautious rigorous hypotheses by night he installed himself in the study in ruth wintermeyers house and composed rambling notes about the plenum the fragment as a divine artifice literally a piece of the appennoia the journal he left is partly autobiography partly scientific chronicle partly the ravings of a lunatic he was losing the ability to distinguish speculation from fact it all became one thing the mysterium tremendaethe outer limit of rational thought linneth said but ultimately did he discover what the fragment was not with any certainty he came to believe it was a piece of what he called a wormhole boat wormhole call it a device for traveling between parallel worlds but that rests on some highly speculative physics and a lot of sterns own bizarre ideation he did prove one interesting thingthat the fragment responded in minute but detectable ways to the proximity of living beings it knew when someone was close in other words stern took this as evidence for another of his pet notions that consciousness is tied to reality in some way more profound than we generally suppose whether it really proved any such thing is questionable of course and the accident dex asked ah interesting theres no way to reconstruct it from his notes but he was talking about pouring radiation into the fragment to see how it responded he had these enormous power lines installed ultimately i guess he provoked a bigger response than he anticipated crossed some threshold and brought us here yes you mean personally well howard said its a puzzle but the pieces are in place the fragment responds to sterns presenceto his mind stern would claim he applies a tremendous amount of energy and some kind of catalysis takes place and in some unimaginable way were transported here but more than that i think the process isnt finished its still happening i dont understand isnt it obvious the lab is still enclosed in that dome of light and think about what happened when the filling station caught fire energy was liberated and it took a strange form people saw god or the devil but to me he looked at the table then raised his eyes defiantly to me it looked like stern himself howards reasoning had gone deeper than he wanted to admit from the scant evidence in the journal he had decided that stern might be right the fragment was part of a device meant to cross between avenues of creation the infinite universes of linde or the multiple alternatives of the uncollapsed wave functionor somehow both and it had interacted with human consciousness with stern himself it was a boat and stern had become its pilot had taken this piece of northern michigan with him into a world that echoed but imperfectly all his stubborn obsessions he pictured stern as a lingering presence inside the ruined lab preserved somehow as alive as he had seemed in howards dreams when the proctors were investigating the lab they sent people inside in protective clothing it must have helped if only a little i want to get hold of one of those suits howard thats ludicrous dex said what could you possibly achieve he hesitated did it make sense to say that he knew he should do this not only that he wanted to but that he felt asked to compelled to i cant explain it he said finally but i have to try linneth said you dont have much time howard looked blankly at her what do you mean she means the town doesnt have much time dex said the proctors mean to destroy it they have some kind of atom bomb out on the old ojibway reserve thats what we came to tell you howard even if stern is alivetheres no way to help him all we can do is try to get out howard thought of all that random energy the white heat of nuclear fission flooding the ruined lab and whatever mystery still pulsed at the heart of it he remembered a dream of his uncle in a globe of light dex said we cant stop them the only way out is to get out howard took a breath then shook his head what he had heard in his dreams was a cry for help stern lost at the edge of the world looking for a way home he had turned away from it once bad decision no he said youre wrong dex maybe not for you but for me i think for me the only way out is in chapter nineteen the temperature dropped steadily but the clouds parted and for three days the sun shone from a flawless blue winter sky last weeks snow receded from the streets and clifford was able to take his bike out again he started early in the morning and rode eastward through the silent town each storefront each dusty window glittered in the sunlight clifford wore his warmest winter jacket plus gloves boots and a knit cap pedaling was a little awkward under all these clothes and he tired easily but maybe that was because of his diet there hadnt been meat for two weeks except what luke brought no fresh vegetables for months the town encased in winter was doomed clifford knew what the firebreak meant two rivers was going to burn he had been certain of it as soon as he saw the teenagers hanging by their necks from the city hall streetlights if that could happen clifford thought anything could happen he pedaled east toward the highway and the old ojibway land luke had said the proctors were building something out there something the soldiers werent supposed to know about he reached the highway before noon and ate luncha sandwich of stale bread and old cheese he stood off the road in a pine grove enclosed by snow eating his sandwich in big bites bars of sunlight came through the pine branches and the moist air after lunch he rode in the direction of the ruined lab but turned left where a new track had been cut into the woods there was not much traffic here and he had plenty of warning when a truck or car approached the roar of the motor and the crunch of tires on old snow carried a long way in the afternoon air the rutted wet road was difficult for his bike however so he left it in a shadowy copse and walked a distance among the trees he was about to turn back when he came to the crest of a low hill and saw the steel gantry above the distant pinetops clifford approached more cautiously now aware of the din of voices and clatter of tools he moved close enough to see all of the tower its girders entwined like metal scrollwork against the sky he guessed its purpose he had seen a movie about the first atomic bomb test and he knew the los alamos bomb had been dropped from a gantry like this one maybe this wasnt a bomb maybe it was something else but what else would burn a territory as large as two rivers he stood a long time looking at the gantry and the enclosure above it which might contain the bomb itself so much destruction to fit in a simple steel box he half hoped the explosion would happen now that it would carry him away in one whitehot instant but it didnt he thought of the town and all the people in it all with no future including his motherhimself then suddenly tired he turned and headed for home shortly before curfew he knocked at howard pooles door and told him what he had seen but howard had already heard about the bomb clifford said are you still trying to save the town in my own way maybe not much time left clifford said maybe not is there anything i can do no then after a silence or maybe there is clifford this radio scanner howard took it from a kitchen cupboard i want you to take it to someone dex graham ill write down his address take it to him and show him how it works dex graham clifford repeated and tell him how you and i met tell him you need to get out of town and tell him i said he would help can you remember that sure clifford said the prospect of leaving two rivers intrigued him he had not thought it was possible but what about you howard smiled in a strange way dont worry about me chapter twenty john f kennedy high school had closed for the holidays and never reopened the reasons were both political and practical early in january the words proctors murderers were spraypainted across the schools brickwork where it faced la salle avenue a military patrol arrived in the morning to splash whitewash over the slogan but the words showed through baleful and ghostly the proctors declared the school a property of the bureau de la convenance and welded a chain across the doors the gesture was largely symbolic parents had agreed among themselves that the risk of sending their children to school was not worth taking any longer anything might happen to children out of sight the evidence of that had been ample besides what were they learning ancient history to what end none evelyn had copied some of symeon demarchs written dispatches in her careful longhand dex passed them on to shepperd in exchange for more information on the planned escape the plans were reasonably credible all the military traffic moved on a northsouth route that connected with the highway and led back to fort leducobviously not a viable way out but during the invasion in june a tank battalion had come in from the west along a seldom used corduroy road through the forest shepperds scouts had established that this largely unguarded road was a logging trail that led to an evacuated timber camp twenty miles southeast from there a larger road led westpresumably toward civilization but avoiding the bottleneck at what used to be the mackinac bridge there was plenty of tree cover and even a large expedition might go undetected provided we get out relatively clean and the weathers favorablesay cloudy but not too snowy if we land on our feet a lot of folks are talking about heading farther west maybe what we would have called oregon or washington state its supposed to be kind of a frontier out there the proctors are less powerful homesteading is a possibility in the long run he told dex well let you know when the times are final but its close obviously youll need transportation extra gasoline snow tires chains if you can get em rope tools food bob hoskins says he can help you out on that account and we prefer a fully occupied vehicle we have more refugees than cars if you dont have at least three passengers come to me theres a waiting list tell me you ever do any shooting dex said in the reserves but that was years ago still handle a weapon i suppose so then take this shepperd pressed a caliber military pistol into his hand and filled the pocket of dexs jacket with spare clips i trust you wont have to use it but im a trusting soul dex graham went home to linneth the proctors had recently withdrawn their guards from the civilian wing of the blue view motel and it was easier now for her to spend the night after dark blinds pulled she sat beside dex on the bed and unbuttoned his shirt the bullet wound was a pink dimple in the meat of his arm it was only intermittently painful she touched it with the palm of her hand in a gesture that was probably unconscious but seemed to dex full of significance a healing caress she might have learned from her mother maybe a token of the strange religion she had grown up with hellenic paganism evolved through centuries of europe in london she said they still allowed temples in the city oracles of apollo in leicester square she undressed in the dim light with a combination of modesty and glee that was half puritan half pagan in spite of all the hardshipthe arrest of her parents three years in a gray nunnery in utica her long and arduous educationshe still owned this hidden liveliness it ran through her veins like blood and it struck a similar chord in dex strange to realize so close to what was liable to be his death how much of himself he had lost invisibly he was accustomed to the idea that he had seen the boundaries of the world and that he was lingering here by default neglected by death for reasons he couldnt fathom that belief had made him brave or at least insolent careless grim but it was an addictive sort of courage teflon courage he had glided through time adhering nowhere it was a courage in any case not much exercised he had never been called on to face down a tank like the murdered students of tiananmen square he was an american and it was still possible even at the ragged end of the twentieth century to live a life insulated from evilany evil but his own he had occasionally wondered what evil looked like it was easy enough to find it on cnn the bodies in the pits the death squads in their dusty pickup trucks but evil face to face would he cower before it or would it have the same stale odor as his own guilt but now he had seen it the small bodies hanging outside city hall were its frank signature what else to call it but evil there was nothing to exonerate the hangman no extenuating circumstances or plausible excuses only a contrived practiced cruelty and it was not frightening it was offensive banal repellent crude tragiceverything hut frightening it could hurt him certainly kill him probably it would but its face was only the face of the proctors selfaggrandizing and completely superficial and here was linneth its opposite her smile repudiated oppression and her touch brought martyrs back to life prisons opened with every breath she took there was nothing complicated here he thought only a doorway with daylight beyond it and an opportunity after all these dry years to step forward and pass through pass through linneth was with dex in the morning when the boy came to the apartment the boy was an ordinaryseeming child large eyes under a cascade of unkempt blond hair but linneth thought she noticed a hint of recognition from dex odd because the boy was clearly a stranger he had come with a strange sort of radio and instruction for its use from howard poole the boy must be twelve years old or so linneth thought blueeyed like dex he looked almost like a relative or a son ah how many agonizing times had that spark of recognition leaped to strangers it must be terribly hard for him she thought the boy said howard had promised that dex would help him when it was time to leave two rivers of course dex said and my mother clifford said theres just the two of us we have a car if you need a car a honda theres even some gas in it dont worry about it dex said we have room for two but a darker thought had occurred to linneth she said clifford when did you talk to howard yesterdayjust before curfew you told him about the tower in the forest you said the bomb he already knew about it and he gave you the radio and told you to come here yes that sounds very final clifford do you think he was getting ready to go somewhere clifford seemed to think it over maybe he had a big winter coat by the door a backpack next to it he could have been getting ready to go somewhere and linneth looked at dex who knew at once what this meant dex hurried to the house but it was empty the light had been turned off the kitchen cleaneda futile but typical gestureand howards sleeping roll was missing from the basement where dex had seen it last i didnt think he would really do this dex said its suicide he knows that perhaps he didnt feel he had much to lose or perhaps he really thought it was a way out linneth shrugged unhappily i didnt know howard well but he seemed like a very religious man chapter twentyone because it was friday night lukas thibault borrowed a car from the motor pool and drove across town to ellens it was easier nowadays to borrow a vehicle and find someone to cover for him in the evenings not that it wasnt still dangerous nico bourgoint newly recovered from his flyingglass injuries at the gas depot explosion had been stockaded for laying over with a woman from the roadhouse crowd but nico had few friends no one would cover for him it was a matter of protocol really the purely mechanical aspects of an assignationvehicles duty rostershad lately been less problematic all the commanding officers seemed distracted thibault parked his car in the shadow of ellens garage the neighbors would know he was here of course discretion was only a gesture but he doubted ellen spoke often to her neighbors she opened the door at his knock her eyes traveling to the bag that contained a quart of barracks whiskey in a glass jarthe real object of her desire she waved him inside they sat together at the kitchen table thibault had grown almost accustomed to the strange unkempt sybaritic luxury of the house with its broadloom stained sleek machines dusty glittering countertops chipped still it struck him every time he crossed the threshold a dizzy feeling how mysteriously these people had lived he had found ellen at the roadhouse on the highway not long after the occupation began the roadhouse had become notorious as the place where a soldier might meet a woman who would barter her virtue for ration coupons it quickly became a brothel in all but name in a sense thibault had rescued ellen from that she had worked tables there when the roadhouse was respectable and she had been unhappy with the new clientele crude farmhands mostly dragged unwilling from their provincial pigpens thibault who took pride in his manhattan pedigree had saved her from an amorous private who was trying to impress her by showing off his glass eyethe only oneeyed gunner in the army of god though he was more likely to e found on latrine duty than near the artillery samael what an army they had brought herebattalions of the halt the lame the blind thibault had driven ellen home his first illicit journey through the town of two rivers she had been grateful would he stay the night he would stay the night would he come back he would come back would he bring some food of course tonight the boy was away somewhere which was all right with thibault ellen cooked a desultory supper and advanced directly to the jar of copperkettle drinkmedown her drinking was heavier and faster these winter nights too bad there was something unappetizing about a drunken woman not that thibault was about to turn and leave cliffords staying at a friends house ellen said we have the place to ourselves and she ducked her head in a gesture she probably imagined was coquettish thibault nodded that boy ellen said his ideas luke she stroked his cheek are you really going to burn us all up what do you mean digging ditches around the town he says to keep in the fire to keep it from spreading she stood and leaned against the kitchen counter thibault was not really drunk yet only a little loose in his skin as the farmers said his eyes traced the curve of her hip she wasnt young enough to be genuinely beautiful but she was pretty enough he was only vaguely alarmed by what she was saying a person hears rumors he said all kinds of rumors a bomb cliffy says bomb an atomic bomb i dont understand to burn us all up he was genuinely baffled by the word atomic but otherwise this was old newsthough he was surprised it had traveled as far as ellen no doubt two rivers was going to be razed the firebreak wasnt hard to figure out perhaps it did involve an atomic bomb maybe that was what the proctors had built out in the forest anything was possible thibault supposed she wanted to be reassured he said ill take care of you ellen dont worry cliffy says you wont be able to she took a long deliberate drink of the barracks whiskey soldiers get burned up too cliffy said what the proctors dont care they really dont you know theyll burn up everyone even you lovely luke even you my charming soldier he woke the next morning with a headache and a sour stomach ellen unconscious next to him looked to thibault like a lump of stale flesh slightly greasy in the daylight he glanced at the bedside clock then moaned he was late he was on watchtower duty this morning maybe maroix or eberhardt had signed on for him but maybe not he had the nagging thought that he already owed too many favors he dressed without waking ellen and drove away into a chilly gray dawn at quarters he signed the car back into the motor pool and ran for the barracks he needed todays duty chit and a plausible excuse but all he had was the chit it didnt matter two roster police and a fat proctor were waiting at the barracks the proctor was named delafleur thibault recognized him delafleur had been everywhere lately fluttering about in his black pardessus and bureau uniform the new chief proctor people said the voice of the centrality thibault swept his cap off and nodded his head delafleur came nearer his jowly face swinging close to thibaults the expression on his face a mixture of contempt and sorrow things have changed he said and i think you were caught unawares monsieur thibault patron i know im late you spent the night at the house of and delafleur made a show of consulting his notebook madame ellen stockton thibault flushed which of these pig farmers had betrayed him his head throbbed mercilessly he couldnt force himself to raise his eyes to meet delafleurs he felt the proctors breath on his facethe man was that close tell me what you talk about with the woman nothing of any consequence thibault said grimly aware that he was begging now he tried to smile i wasnt there to talk that wont do you dont understand monsieur thibault the town is on the verge of panic we want to prevent lies from spreading two infantrymen were attacked in their car on night patrol while you were in bed with this womandid you know that youre lucky you werent killed yourself he shook his head as if he had been personally insulted worse there are rumors being repeated even in the barracks which could have tragic consequences this isnt an ordinary offense in the end thibault told him what ellen had said about the bomb the atomic bombbut he was careful to defend her honor ellen didnt really know anything about this he said it all came from the boy from clifford who behaved oddly who was often out of the house and delafleur nodded making notes thibault had never liked the boy anyway the boy would not be a loss the proctors took him to the makeshift stockade in the city hall basement and locked him in a cell there thibault who hated confinement paced his cage and remembered what ellen had said theyll hum up everyone she had said even you was that possible it was true there had been some muttering in the barracks and at mess hallthibault had never taken such things seriously but there was the firebreak that was real enough and the tower in the forest and his imprisonment lukas thibaults head felt as if it had been cracked like a walnut he wished he could see the sky even you my charming soldier chapter twentytwo work at the test site peaked and ebbed many of the civilian workers had been sent back to fort leduc a battalion of physicists and engineers remained behind to initiate the bomb sequence and study the results the stillness of completion had descended on the circle of cleared land the air was cold and tense clearly demarch thought these were the final hours censeur bisonette had flown in from the capital for a oneday tour two rivers before the end demarch stood on the snowy margin of the test grounds while bisonette marched about with his press of bureau personnel delafleur unctuously proclaiming each tedious landmark this was followed by a lunch in one of the freshly emptied tin sheds trestle tables stocked with the only decent food ever to be trucked into town breads meats fresh cheeses leek and potato soup in steaming bouilloires demarch sat at the censeurs left delafleur to his right despite this ostensible equity conversation flowed mainly between bisonette and the ideological branch attache more evidence of a shift of patronage demarch thought or an even deeper movement in the geology of the bureau de la convenance he felt left out but was too numb to care the wine helped red wine from what had once been spanish cellars in california spoils of war after the meal he had bisonettes attention exclusively which was really no improvement demarch rode in the censeurs car during what was meant to be a tour of the town itself though it was difficult to see much beyond the bustle of security cars on every side the procession wound eastward from the fragmentary highway over roads full of potholes past drab businesses and gray houses under a sunless sky the wealth of the town and its impoverishment were both much in evidence bisonette was unimpressed i notice there are no public buildings only the school the courthousecity hall not much civic spirit well this wasnt a city of any proportion censeur you might say the same of montmagny or surmer at least at montmagny there are temples the churches here aggrandized peasant huts their theology is impoverished too like a line drawing of christianity all the details left out well demarch had thought as much himself he nodded the cavalcade wound through beacon street and back to the motor hotel the bureau had appropriated as headquarters the chauffeur parked and stood outside without offering to open the doors demarch moved to get out but bisonette touched his arm a moment he tensed now waiting news from the capital bisonette said your friend guy marris has left the bureau oh yes with three fingers missing demarch stiffened three fingers was the traditional penalty for stealing bureau property or lying to a hierarch bisonette said i understand the two of you were close nauseated weightless demarch could only nod fortunately you have other friends your fatherinlaw for instance hes fondly remembered though very old no one would want to insult him or his family not while hes alive bisonette paused to let this wisdom sink in lieutenant i assume you want to keep your fingers he nodded again you have the forged papers guy marris gave you they were in his breast pocket demarch said nothing but his hand strayed there give them to me no more need be said at least for now demarch caught and held the censeurs eyes his eyes were a mild blue the color of a hazy sky demarch had wanted to find something there the apospasma theion or its opposite the antimimon pneuma a visible absence of the soul but he was disappointed he took evelyns pass papers from his breast pocket and put them in the censeurs ancient hand chapter twentythree bisonettes visit was more troublesome than delafleur had expected it distracted his attention from the situation developing in the military barracks two militiamen hadbeen caught trying to bluff past the checkpoints out of town questioned they admitted that they had heard the town would be burned with the soldiers still in it that the proctors had decided they were expendable which was true but not for public consumption it was a dangerous rumor and needed to be stopped today three more militiamen had disappeared on routine patrol perhaps killed or captured by townspeople more likely on the run all this would be taken care of in less than twentyfour hours but a lot could happen in that time if the soldiers rioted it would make everything problematic delafleur had taken over city hall as his quartier general and made the basement storage rooms into a kind of stockade lukas thibault was down there but lukas was not the only font of this poisoned water delafleur moved restlessly through what had once been the office of the mayor with its commanding view of the town the town was deceptively still motionless except for the wind and the falling snow the trouble was subterranean but for how long and the weather was a problem in itself would snow postpone the bomb test he listened to the chatter on the radio monitor the military men had installed for him but it was only technical caquetage the countdown hadnt begun delafleur wished he could hurry time onward push the hours until they tumbled over there was a knock at the door delafleur said come in and turned to see a soldier waiting the woman you wanted us to pick up was out censeur the man said im not a censeur delafleur said irritably call me patron its in your handbook for gods sake the soldier ducked his head yes patron but the boy we found the boy delafleur looked past the soldier and saw the boy in the waiting room a nothinginparticular marmot wearing spectacles and a rag of a shirt so this was clifford stockton lukas thibaults nemesis lock him downstairs delafleur said perhaps the rumors could no longer be contained maybe it was too late for that but it couldnt hurt to try he shooed out the soldier then he picked up the telephone and called the military commander corporal trebach and told him to keep his troops confined to quarters today there had been gunfire from the townspeople he said and he didnt want anyone hurt it was a lie of course two lies no gunfire at least not yet and he didnt care who got hurt whether trebach was fooled who could say it was strange work delafleur thought like plugging holes in a dike until the dike can be destroyed its tomorrow evelyn woodward said i dont know what time probably around noon i heard him talking to delafleur on the phone there are some problems with the soldiers so no one wants to wait dex nodded evelyn had shown up at his door for what he supposed was the last time bearing this final nugget of information she looked cold he thought gaunt though there was no doubt plenty to eat while she was under demarchs wing her eyes took in the room without expression she never smiledbut why should she he promised he would pass on the news then he said you can come with us evietheres room in the car he had told her about linneth about his escape plans she had not seemed jealous and dex supposed she didnt have the emotional capacity for it after so much else she had only looked at him a little wistfully as she looked at him now she shook her head ill go with the lieutenant she said its safer i hope so thank you dex i mean reallythank you she touched his arm youve changed you know he watched from the window as she walked into the falling snow shepperd came by later with essentially the same information from a source of his own dday was tomorrow the convoy would begin an hour before dawn bless you if you arent ready but we cant wait everybody just head west up what used to be coldwater road and pray for luck and carry that damned pistol dont leave it lying on your kitchen table for gods sake dex offered him the use of the scanner but shepperd shook his head we have a few useful items check the marine band though if youre curious and a signal up around thirteen hundred megahertz we think thats coming from the bomb people mostly its incomprehensible but you might pick up a clue mainly though dont worryabout that set out on time is the main thing i would like us all on that corduroy road westbound by daybreak you have a car i gather he did an aging ford in a basement lot the car he used to drive to work on days when the weather made walking a chore he had already stashed a couple of jerricans of black market gasoline in the trunk shepperd offered his hand dex shook it good luck he said to us all shepperd told him linneth came before curfewawol though nobody cared anymore the guards had been posted elsewhere there was no question of sleep she helped dex carry supplies down to the car he filled the tank with acridsmelling american petrol three hours after midnight they ate a final meal in dexs kitchen a granular snow was still gathering and blowing in the street the wind rattled the casements of the window dex raised a glass of tepid water in a toast to an old world he said and a new one both stranger than we thought they had not finished drinking when they heard the sound of distant gunfire chapter twentyfour among the huichol indians of the sierra madre occidental it was called a nierika a passagewayand simultaneously a barrierbetween the everyday world and the world of the spirits the nierika is also a ceremonial disk both mirror and face of god it resembles a mandala the four cardinal directions radiate from the sacred center in huichol paintings the axis always rests in a field of fire howard reached the highway before dark but was barred from crossing it by an uninterrupted stream of traffic mainly trucks and automobilesthe proctors and their possessions a few military commanders the last looting of the town all bound south for fort leduc and safety it cant be long now howard thought he broke into an abandoned shack off the road and out of the snow and pulled his sleeping bag around him for warmth while he waited there was no possibility of sleep and probably no time for it he rested in an ancient bentwood rocker made brittle by the cold the windows were choked with dust waiting was the hard part he was all right while he was moving there wasnt time to think beyond the next step but while he waited he began to grow frightened he was as close to death as he had ever been for a time the immediacy of the danger paralyzed him fear seemed to fall as inexorably as the snow in icy crystals from a dark sky howard shivered and closed his eyes after midnight the sound of the traffic lapsed he stirred rose on cold and aching legs and folded his sleeping bag into his backpack to carry with him he jogged across the highway multiple tire tracks were already dimming under fresh grains of snow the asphalt slick and treacherous beneath the woods on the far side the old ojibway land were black with shadow howard used a watchmans flashlight to find his way along the dirt track eastward among the trees the trees were tall and he listened to the snow sifting among the pine needles each ripple of wind sent snow showers cascading around him and made a flickering ice tunnel of the flashlight beam he passed a fork in the road to the left was the way to the testing ground ahead the way to the ruined lab he pressed forward though this road was less traveled old snow still frozen under the new a difficult walk as he approached the near radius of the lab he saw more of the ethereal forms he had glimpsed in the night last autumn they were less frightening now though not less mysterious they seemed disinterested in him disinterested in anything but their own stately motion perhaps a circle around the ruined buildings restless ghosts he thought chained here in fact they were strangely beautiful nearly human flags of light casting very real shadows among the trees their reflections glinting from countless prisms of fallen snow it was as if the trees themselves were moving performing oddly graceful pirouettes against the blackness of the night howards eyes blurred with tears at the sight though he could not say what moved him he walked for what seemed hours among the shifting shadows it was hard to remember to follow the road it was hard to remember anything at all he paused when one of these creatures if it could be called that came near him he held his breath as it moved across his path he felt a prickling heat on his skin the snow nearby melted to gloss he looked deep inside it past translucencies of green and fiery gold to inner complexities of indigo and luminous purple evolving outward like the corona of a star then fading and falling back like the arc of a solar prominence its eyes were shadows dark as the night it didnt pause or look at him it moved on howard took a deep ragged breath and did the same he reached the laboratory grounds as dawn was lightening the sky he walked fearlessly past the wire fence and guardpost the proctors had erected and abandoned there was no one here there hadnt been for months this was the mystery the proctors had declared too frightening to contemplate and too dangerous to endure their works lay scattered under softening dunes of snow earthmoving machinery rusted tin sheds a few vehicles stripped to the axle and open to the sky the largest intact structure the proctors had left was a windowless brick box with wide tin doors sealed with a bar and padlock howard moved that way the dome of blue light surrounding the original two rivers physical research laboratory loomed above his head he had never been this close it interested him the border of light the passage between inside and outside was crisp and distinct within that border no snow had fallen the grass was still an eerie green a single tree still held its leaves though all these things began to change and mutate if he stared very long strange howard thought but had the phenomenon at the lab cast a subtler effect beyond its borders those creatures in the forest for instance and even here in the dawning light the snowhumped detritus looked oddly bright as if his peripheral vision had grown prismatic flensing rainbows from every acute angleas if a junkyard had been strewn with jewels in his last days stern had viewed the fragment in the laboratory as a new sort of matter quantum matter its material volume only a fraction of its true size which was incalculable because it lay outside the observable universe it was a piece of the protennoia and therefore unknowable its effects on surrounding matter were quantum effects acting on the collapsing wave function of reality in ways unpredictable and often bizarre was that true howard wondered if he stepped past that border of blue light would he be in some sense inside the fragment or was he already inside it perhaps the proctors and their world all their universe to its farthest limits was inside the fragment alreadythe illusion was that the universe contained it it was a gateway a barriera nierika axis mundi his uncle had called it the proctors had left much of their equipment and salvage protected from the weather in this shed files boxes of paper retrieved from the nearest of the laboratory buildings notebooks abandoned tables strewn with aerial photographs of the site books of physics books of the bible there was a tumble of white smocks and lead aprons in the corner and in a doorless closet three of the suits clifford had described to him in the autumn heavy quilted vests with a sort of hood a smokedglass helmet the vests to ward off radiation howard supposed he remembered hearing that the fire chief dick haldane had died after driving his truck into the glow the helmets he guessed were to diffuse a glare he had not yet seen some unimaginable radiance the blinding light of creation but what could protect you from that he took the outfit off its shelf and draped it over himself no doubt a futile gesture but it made him feel less vulnerable then he stepped out into the cold air the sun had only begun to rise and the air was gray under gusts of low cloud he walked past this deserted building past diamond fields of rusting machinery onto the flat snowcontoured surface of the road and into the nimbus of blue light chapter twentyfive morning found the test site hushed and vacant the last technician had left at midnight the observation bunker was miles to the east a slitwindowed slab of reinforced concrete remote monitors communicated the status of the weapon to banks of telemetry consoles inside their anodized faceplates glittering with jewelfaceted lights the telltales showed amber or green in reassuring patterns everything was going according to plan everything was as it should be milos fabrikant thoughtat least within the narrow compass of these machines fabrikant had been invited here as an observer and he still had not received a convincing explanation why the proctors had chosen this particular place to test the weapon was cartagena a snowbound target was spain so full of pine woods but the proctors inevitably followed their own logic he hadnt pressed the issue all fabrikant had done was his duty which was to extract enriched uranium isotopes and apply them to the manufacture of a bomb three functional implosiontype weapons had been constructed with more on the way one of them rested on the gantry in the forest the other two had been shipped to some atlantic airbase or other and if this test was successful the bombs would be dropped on belligerent europe and then god help us all he had seen the yield prediction from the bureau centrality and it was even more prodigious than his own calculation he wondered who was right in either case the numbers defied imagination divining energy from mass he thought as if we were archons ourselves the sheer hubris of it he was privileged to be here and not a little frightened he turned to the censeur in charge that unpleasant man bisonette how long two or three hours yet monsieur fabrikant please be patient i wasnt trying to hurry it fabrikant thought symeon demarch had stayed close to the telephone all night talking in relay rounds to bisonette at the test bunker delafleur at city hall trebach at the soldiers quarters and the commandant at fort leduc from the dim light of evelyns study he had watched the parade of lights along the far shore of lake merced a huge detachment of proctors and senior military men in a convoy bound for safety and the south the traffic had possessed a strange beauty in the falling snow it looked like a candlelight procession like a body of renunciates making a midnight pilgrimage on ascension eve the procession of automobile lights faded long before dawn of those leaving two rivers only trebach and delafleur and himself and their chauffeurs were left delafleur was worried about some unrest at the military barracks he tied up the line to bisonette and demarchs phone was quiet for an hour before sunrise demarch sat motionless in the silence not asleep but not really awake only sitting a military car came for him at dawn he answered the knock at the front door and told the driver all right yes just wait a moment sir we dont have much time the driver was a young man and worried theres trouble in town you can hear the shooting and this snow is a problem too i wont be long he trudged upstairs to the bedroom evelyn was inside perhaps she hadnt slept either she was wearing the dress he had imported from the capital so many months ago she looked frail in that confection frail and beautiful the bedroom window faced the wind and the snow had covered it completely evelyn looked up at him from a dimness of silk and ice her eyes were wide she said is this it are we leaving now demarch felt as if something had lurched inside him incipit vita nova he thought dazedly a new life begins not when he joined the bureau but now here in this room now something is left behind now something is forsaken he thought of dorothea and the memory was so vivid that her face seemed to float in front of him he thought of christof and of christofs wary eyes he had left home for a place less real a makeshift and temporary place he thought it would only exist for a few hours more he thought of guy marris missing three fingers from his right hand downstairs the driver was calling his name evelyn frowned its only a chore he told her they want me at city hall ill be back before long he left the room before she could answer he didnt want to know whether or not she believed him evelyn hurried downstairs and reached the big window in the front room just as the car was pulling away it skidded on the snowslick surface of beacon street then picked up speed as it headed east and out of sight when the sound of the motor faded she was able to hear another soundpopcorn bursts of distant gunfire faint but unmistakable was there still time to reach dex graham evelyn doubted it and anyway that wasnt what she felt like doing mainly she wanted to watch the snow it looked lovely as it fell she thought it absorbed the attention she would sit in her bedroom and watch the morning snow shaped into ripples and dunes by the wind that blew across the frozen surface of lake merced that would be a fine thing to be doing evelyn thought when the bright light finally came but first she wanted to change her clothes she didnt like this dress anymore she didnt want it touching her clement delafleur lost the phone line with corporal trebach and reached him moments later by radio trebach was shouting something about the barracks about his men but it was unintelligible in gusts of static delafleur told him leave for gods sakeit doesnt matter now just leave but there was no response trebachs radio had failed too delafleur went to search for his own driver he had fulfilled his duties with what he thought was considerable elan under pressure and any inconvenience would soon be erased as in the joke about doctors he would bury his mistakes if trebach ran into trouble and was forced to stay then delafleur would be the last to leave and that might impress censeur bisonette who seemed to have overcome his distaste for the ideological branch delafleur was attracting patronage these days the way sugar attracts insects it was a consoling thought he walked to the outer office where his chauffeur should have been there was another radio here tuned to the broadcast from the test bunker it emitted a highpitched whistle punctuated by bursts of incomprehensible data or mechanical time checks less than three hours to the detonation delafleur noted and a little late to be leaving but this messiness with trebach had delayed him where had the driver gone the rest of the office was empty of course he had dismissed the staff all faithful proctors and pions and sent them off in a midnight cortege the driver had stayed behind drinking black coffee from the strange cafetiere in the comer but now the room was empty delafleur roamed the carpeted hallways with an increasing but carefully suppressed anxiety he checked the toilet but the driver wasnt there nor in the empty offices their doors all ajar nor in the marbled foyer on the first floor there wasnt time for this he was suddenly conscious of the ebbing minutes to which he had been oblivious only an hour ago there was snow on the roads and some of it had drifted dangerously deep they must leave soon he heard the sound of gunfire from the west according to trebachs last dispatches that was some disturbance at the edge of town a guardpost had exchanged gunfire with civilian automobiles presumably refugees attempting to escape on one of the logging roads trebach had sent out a few more troops and that should have ended it but the sporadic firing went on and ona bad sign maybe the driver was in the basement delafleur thought down among the water pipes and concrete walls and the steel cages where thibault and the boy clifford stockton were imprisoned but no that wasnt likely in any case delafleur was reluctant to go down there he was afraid of being trapped all these walls seemed suddenly too close he pulled on his winter pardessus and went out through the main doors to the allee damn the man let him burn he would drive the car himself if necessary but as he hurried down the snowrounded steps he saw that it was not just the driver who was missing the car was gone too delafleur was mute with outrage hell pay more than three fingers for this delafleur thought hell pay with his head there had not been a beheading in the capital since the depression but there were still men in the committees for public safety who knew what to do with a traitor but that was irrelevant he needed transportation more than he needed revenge no vehicles had been left behind his cowardly chauffeur had taken the last delafleur felt a surge of panic but instructed himself to think to be constructive there was still the radio maybe bisonette could send someone from the bunker there might be time for that he was about to march back up the steps of city hall when a black van came roaring around the corner past the civic gardens and for a moment delafleur felt a blossoming hope somehow they had come for him already but the van had taken the corner too quickly it wavered drunkenly from side to side and finally skidded off its wheels and over the curb delafleur stared the van was silent a moment then armed men began to leap from the outflung doors like ants from a disturbed nest they were soldiers and they were obviously drunk and dangerous one man aimed a rifle at a streetlight fired a single shot and sent a flurry of shattered glass to join the falling snow the others began to shout incoherently not just drunken they were also terrified they know whats about to happen delafleur thought they know theyre doomed he thought and they know who to blame a window shattered somewhere over his head had he been seen here in the shadow of city hall perhaps not delafleur ran back inside and barred the big door behind him chapter twentysix dex didnt like the idea of driving into gunfire but shepperds plan was the only real option make for the logging road and pray for confusion the snow was deep enough now to be a real impediment bad enough on the streets of two rivers and certain to be worse on a onelane track through the forest but he would worry about that later his first task was to pick up clifford stockton and his mother and his second was to put distance between himself and the fission weapon in the ojibway land linneth sat beside him with her attention focused on the predawn gloom beyond the windows the streetlights burned pale amber overhead there were lights in many of these houses as if the buildings themselves had been startled awake dex wondered how much of the population had been warned about the escape lots of the parents had been contacted shepperd had said getting kids out was a priority and school staff had been generous with names the black community around hart avenue had been nervous ever since the proctors forced them to register as negroes or mulattos on the town rolls that was another substantial fraction of the convoy but two rivers was too big for a genuine mass evacuation word had spread rapidly in the last couple of days but there must be many who simply hadnt heard dex saw them peering cautiously from the draped windows of their houses no doubt wondering at the sound of gunfire and all the unaccustomed traffic dexs car was not the only one on the road several sped past him too panicked for caution and at least one ended up in the ditch beside la salle avenue with its wheels spinning vainly dex pulled over at the address clifford had given him a house not far from coldwater road and left the motor running as he ran to the door he knocked waited knocked again no answer was it possible that clifford and his mother had somehow slept late or left early in desperation he pounded his fist on the door ellen stockton opened it she wore a housecoat and her eyes were red with weeping she held in one hand what appeared to be a mason jar of oily waterbut it smelled like bathtub hooch dex said mrs stockton need you and clifford in the car right away we really dont have time to wait they took him she said the falling snow clung to her dark hair her eyes were red and unfocused dex said i dont understandyoure talking about clifford who took him the soldiers the soldiers took him so go away fuck you we dont need you were not going anywhere linneth helped get the drunken woman dressed and into the car despite the occasional obscenity mrs stockton was too tired to fight and toointoxicated to offer more than a token objection in the back seat she became a malleable object under a woolen blanket dex sat at the wheel of the car it was fully morning now there were plumes of smoke all over town linneth saw and still that sporadic crackcrack of gunfiresometimes distant sometimes much too close she said the boy is probably at city hall they have a makeshift prison there unless he was dead which was possible even likely but dex must surely know that and linneth didnt want to say more in front of the mother the stockton woman said something about a neighbor who had seen the soldiers taking her boy into city hallso at least clifford had been there not long ago dex said slowly there may not be much of a guard all the proctors are gone by now soldiers though maybe he looked at linneth she thought he wants me to decide then no he wants my permission because it was her life at risk too not just his own she thought but we might die but surely that was true no matter what people were already dying more would die very soon and she would probably be among that unfortunate majorityand so what the renunciates had taught her that if she died outside the church she would be scourged by the angel tartarouchis with whips of fire forever so be it linneth thought no doubt tartarouchis would be busy with the war and all city hall was five blocks behind them she told dex we should hurry wanting to get the words out before her courage failed he smiled as he turned the car around symeon demarch sat braced against the plushly upholstered rear bench of the bureau car as his chauffeur mumbled to himself and drove at a dangerous clip east toward the highway demarch had stopped thinking about evelyn he had stopped thinking about dorothea or christof or guy marris or the bureau de la convenance he wasnt really thinking at all only gazing from this sheltered space at the pinegreen and cloudgray shape of the exterior world he faced the window where each flake of snow that lighted would cling a moment before it slid into winddriven dew some trouble at the military barracks the chauffeur said the chauffeur was a young man with pomaded hair and a nahanni drawl a civilian employee not a pion demarch saw the nervous way his eyes flicked to the rearview mirror they turned onto the highway heading south this road connected with the route to fort leduc but it also passed the motor hotel that had been commandeered as a military garrison demarch said is that a threat to us i dont know lieutenant but it may be see that smoke up ahead demarch peered forward and saw nothing but snow the same snow that sent the wheels askew whenever the car turned a corner must you go so quickly sir if i slow down we might end up spinning our wheels for traction i prefer a little momentum do what you think best a few moments later the driver said god and samael and the car lurched sickeningly as he pressed the brake ahead on the lefthand side of the road the military barracks was burning it was a strange sight in the falling snow and demarch was mute marveling at it black smoke billowed from the many windows of what had once been the days inn the flames rising from the embrasures looked almost like faces the road was blackened with soot but passable dont stop demarch said not here for gods sake then a window shattered it was the front window drivers side the chauffeur jerked and turned as if to look back but his visible eye was full of blood his foot convulsed against the gasoline pedal and the car bucked sharply as he slid away from the wheel the car rolled into a mile marker demarch was thrown forward by the sudden stop and before he could right himself he saw the chauffeurs bulletcracked skull staining the upholstery with slurries of blood a cold wind came through the broken window demarch looked past the clinging tines of glass to the pine woods opposite the burning motel where soldiers were emerging through flags of smoke they carried rifles most of their rifles were aimed at the car the soldiers took aim as demarch scrambled from the rightside rear door he was wearing his bureau uniform even at this distance they would know him for a proctor glass exploded all around him in brittle showers and he heard the whine of bullets and their hammering impact on the snowbound roadway when he stood to run he felt the bullets enter his body then he was on the ground the soldiers shouted and waved their weapons but that sound faded into noise breathless demarch turned his head to look at the burning building the roar of it was all around him the fire had melted the snow into mirrors of ice mirrors full of sky fire ash the world himself clifford stockton had slept a little during the night lukas thibault had not each had been given his own cage in the basement jail at city hall they were separated by a dusty space in a room that had once been the buildings archives all the filing cabinets had been moved out and their contents burned when delafleur took over the building the walls were concrete the ceiling was white acoustic tile the floor was green linoleum and it was as cold as winter earth clifford had learned to keep his feet off it his snow boots were scant protection he spent most of his time on the tiny hemp cloth cot the proctors had provided he woke to the sound of lukas thibaults cursing i want my breakfast luke was shouting assholes were starving down here brief silence then the rhythmic banging of lukes fist against the bars clifford didnt bother to look he could see lukes cell only by forcing his head against the bars of his own cage and peering around an lbend where the cages followed the wall it wasnt worth the effort he was grateful for the relative privacy clifford emptied his bladder into the crockery pot provided for the purpose embarrassed by the sound it was cold enough this morning that the pot steamed for a few minutes after he was finished he sat back down on the cot and wrapped the blanket around himself fuckers luke was screeching cretins bastards clifford waited until the soldier had lapsed back into silence then he said they arent here luke said whatstartled as if he had forgotten clifford was in the basement with him theyre not here it was obvious for hours after dark the building had been full of sound legions of feet upstairs doors opening and closing motors roaring and then fading away beyond the high dustclogged windows that vented the basement theyre gone they evacuated today must be the day the day of the bomb he didnt need to add that was why luke was here for talking about the bomb that was also why clifford was here though no one had told him sono one had talked to him the soldiers had just put him in this cage and gone away it was too late now to do anything but wait and he told luke so thibault called him a little idiot a criminal a liar they cant leave me here sons of samael even the proctors wouldnt do that but the morning ticked on and luke lapsed into a despairing silence clifford knew it was past dawn by the faint light in the vent windows that was his only clock the shadowy fluorescent tubes overhead were the only other lightand most of those were burned out clifford gazed at that patch of daylight far up at the margin of the ceiling for a time he could not calculate it was interrupted only by the sound of lukas thibaults sobbing then there was another sound gunshots and not far away sophia mother luke cried out this was a new threat clifford was dismayed better the bomb clifford thought than a gun he had read about hiroshima and nagasaki the bomb washed everything away in a tidal wave of light the people were gone with only their shadows left behind he had resigned himself to dying in the bomb blast but this gunfire was different it worried him the shooting paused crackled for a time paused again then the door marked fire exit swung open and here was the proctor delafleur wideeyed and with a pistol in his hand chapter twentyseven in the beginning was the ennoia and the world was made of light then sophia a thought of the uncreated god committed the sin of creation cast out from the primordial nous she fashioned base matter the hyle and fertilized it with her spiritual principle the dynamis which is both seed and image of the world of light thus the world was both created and separated from its origins it was matter with a kernel of spirit in it neither kenoma nor pleroma it was incomplete less than whole it was asymmetric here was the metaphor stern had found so compelling it resonated with modern cosmology pull a linchpin from primordial symmetry and everything cascades forth quarks leptons atomic nuclei stars eventually kittens dung beetles physicists and in all this there is embedded an unquenchable epignosis the memory of that ancient isotropic unity of all things in the uncreated world sophia abandoned wanders the infinite shoals of hylic matter with her terrible longing for the light and yet and yet sophia laughed howard had found the phrase in sterns notebook circled and underlined and crowned with question marks sophia laughed howard calculated that he had to walk a hundred yards across the parking lot of the two rivers physical research laboratory to reach its central building the collapsed concreteblock structure whereperhapsstern had died it was not a long distance ordinarily but this was no longer an ordinary place he had passed the boundaries of the ordinary he was inside the glow no snow fell here the air was suddenly moist and warm the neat bordered lawns near the workers quarters were green though the grass had not grown since the spring did time pass more slowly here if so howard thought his attempt to reach stem might be futile the bomb would detonate between one footstep and the next but he could see the snow falling only a few paces behind him and it was falling at its usual pace so time didnt pass especially slowly here though he supposed it might pass differently and he took another step forward his vision was obscured the eye didnt like this environment nor did the other senses he felt dizzy awkward alternately too hot and too cold most confusing though was this refusal of any solid object to hold still and be seen images curved and lost proportion as if the act of seeing them challenged their reality observation howard thought was a kind of quantum guillotine it sliced uncertainty into this or that particle or wave here there seemed to be no such effect the collapsing wavefront the moment of isness was imprecise too fluid as if he were experiencing time a fraction of a second before anything happened for instance this asphalt under his feet glimpsed briefly it was the lab parking lot spaces marked with whitewashed numbers stare too long and it became granite or glass or grains of crystalline sand and the temptation to stare was immense he understood why the firefighters had beat such a hasty retreat too much exposure to this would surely affect more than the senses madness must look like this howard thought but he took another step and another after that the light around him was bright but sourceless it wasnt daylight it pervaded everything everything was lit up from within colors were divided split as if by a prism into countless bands every motion was a blur he took another step and another though his stomach was churning there was a turbulence all around him the air itself seemed to solidify and take form as if translucent bodies were moving through it more ghosts he supposed maybe they really were ghosts the restless remains of the men and women who had died in these bunkers the night of the explosion but howard doubted it there was something purposive in the way they crossed his path circling the laboratory buildings as if they were trapped here and perhaps they were maybe these were the creators of the fragment still attached to it orbiting it a helpless half step out of time he shook his head too much speculation that had been sterns downfall stern who was calling him onward set aside the rationalization and that was why he was here stern had called him and stern was calling him yet you might he as smart as your uncle howards mother used to say it was a compliment a suspicion a fear stern had always loomed over him like a monument stony and unapproachable in howards family noone talked much about the important things but stern always came with a baggage of big ideas and he always shared them with howard teased him with them you like this morsel then how about this and this howard remembered his uncle leaning forward from the cane chair on the porch on a summer evening alight with stars and fireflies his voice obscuring the faint rattle of china dishes on a faraway table your dog sees the same world we do howard your dog sees those stars but we know what they are because we can ask the right questions and thats knowledge the dog can never share by his nature never so then howarddo you suppose there are questions even we cant ask fireflies here too sparks in his vision he was approaching the central building its roof had collapsed but the concreteblock frame was intact a crack ran through the steel door on closer inspection the brickwork was filleted with jewels diamonds clung like barnacles to every wall there was something seductive about these faceted surfaces and howard was careful not to stare too long there were other horizons here not his own he touched the door it was hot this was real heat and he was probably close enough to the core event that he was being bathed with real radiation enough to kill him probably but that was of no concern any longer he had used the word awestruck in the past without knowing what it meant but now he understood it he was stricken by awe consumed by it it obliterated even his fear this was the place where his uncle had crossed the border of the world if stern had brought them all here did that make stern a demiurge had he found this world or actually made it constructed it consciously or unconsciously with the aid of the turkish fragment from his own fears and hopes if so then like sophia he had made an imperfect thing everything he had wanted from his ancient books a key to the pain and the longing he felt a cosmogony beyond physics here in the world of the proctors it was all transmuted into something base a lifeless dogma everything noble in it had grown calcified and oppressive maybe stern was lost howard thought trapped in his own creation and helpless to redeem it am i prepared to face a god he shuddered at the thought but he opened the cracked and jeweled door chapter twentyeight with daylight the town surrendered to panic fire broke out in the beacon street business district and there was no one to control it tom stubbs had headed west along with most of the volunteer fire department flames swept through the emily dee largesize fashion shop the new day bookstore and an empty corner property with boarded windows on which the faint words coming soon another fry castle family restaurant were still faintly legible refugees approaching coldwater road encountered a roadblock manned by a detachment of soldiersword of the escape attempt had leakedbut the lead cars including calvin shepperds each carried three sharpshooters and the cream of virgil wilsons collection of semiautomatic rifles the gunfire began before dawn and continued sporadically through the morning three truckloads of soldiers turned back from the road to fort leduc by steel gabions and a skirmish line of tanks passed through town at high speed one truck made it nearly to coldwater road before a rear guard of armed civilians caught it in a crossfire the driver was killed instantly and spared the knowledge that his last act had been to steer the vehicle over a barricade and down a vertical embankment into the shallow ice of powell creek the second truck headed north in a vain attempt to cross the firebreak and reach safety it broke an axle in a snowy hydroelectric rightofway twentyfive soldiers without winter clothes or adequate supplies formed a line and marched into the dark woods hoping to outrun the angel tartarouchis the third truck turned over in front of city hall spilling a cargo of angry draftees who fanned out and began to empty their rifles into the unblinking facades of these alien houses in this town on the edge of the abyss this temple of grief dex started a turn onto municipal avenue when he saw the soldiers among the trees on the city hall promenadeand the soldiers saw him taken by surprise he twisted the steering wheel hard right the road surface was too slick for traction the car slid at a skewed angle toward the sidewalk and dex fought to keep the wheels out of a drainage ditch something pinged from the hood he saw the new dent and a gleam of steel where the paint had been scoured by a bullet he told linneth to get down and keep her down tooellen stockton who was gawking at the soldiers with boozy incomprehension the car stopped shy of the ditch dex threw it into reverse and stepped on the gas with as much restraint as he could musterbut the wheels only raced on a slick of compressed snow he worked the gear shift rocking the car forward and back when he spared a glance down the street he saw a soldier maybe a hundred yards awaya kid it looked like barely voting age aiming a big bluebarreled rifle at him it was a mesmerizing sight the soldiers aim wobbled and then seemed to steady dex hunkered down and goosed the gas pedal again a bullet popped two of their windowsback seat left and right the safety glass fell away in a rain of white powder linneth emitted a stilled scream dex stomped the accelerator the car roared and leaped forward in a cloud of blue exhaust he worked the vehicle into a turn and steered away from the soldiers he heard more bullets strike the trunk and bumper harmless pings and thunksunless one of them happened to find the gas tank he steered left on oak still fighting the wheel the car danced but moved approximately north he was two blocks gone and around another corner before he dared slow down christ jesus ellen stockton said suddenly as if all this had only just registered what are they doing to cliffy its all right mrs stockton dex said he looked at linneth she was pale with anxiety but she nodded at him they dont seem to have any particular interest in the municipal building well just have to go in from the back time was a precious commodity and worse there was no way to know exactly how precious it really was nevertheless he waited in the car until the sound of the soldiers sporadic gunfire had moved away he was two streets beyond city hall in a quiet residential neighborhoodquieter than ever except for the pop and echo of the gunshots the road was flanked on either side by tall row houses old buildings but carefully preserved some of these houses were empty some undoubtedly were still occupied but the occupants werent showing themselves the snow fell in gentle gusts on some distant porch a wind chime tinkled it was cold ellen stockton said with the wind coming in these shotout windows get under the blanket dex said i want you to stay here while were gone can you do that youre going to get cliffy i mean to try though it looked more and more like a futile effort or worse a gesture city hall had been evacuated clifford stockton in all likelihood had been killed or carried off to fort leduc he told linneth maybe you should stay here with ellen im sure shell be all right she looked at him steadily its a misplaced chivalry im not baggage dex i want to find him too he nodded we should go on foot its less conspicuous a good idea and dont forget about that pistol in your jacket the funny thing was he had he took it from the vest pocket and slid the safety off the grip was cold in his hand they moved across a snowhumped backyard over a cane fence collapsed and unrepaired across another quiet street the wind swirled snow into exposed skin and sifted it like sand against dexs vinyl jacket he reminded himself that clifford was not david it was tempting to yield to that obvious parallel back into another doomed building to save another doomed child tempting dex thought but were not allowed to reenact our sins it doesnt work that way but the memory came back more powerfully than it had in a long long time and he made room for it some part of him welcomed it it was possible to smell the reek of burning in all this cold snow there were no soldiers in the space behind city hall only a narrow corner of the civic gardens and the white wasteland of permit parking only no one had been here lately dex thought the snow was pristine he hurried into the shadow of the building with linneth next to him city hall was not a large building under all its stone facades and sculpted lintels it contained an assembly room a rotunda and a battery of offices on two floors and the basement in better times he had visited this building sporadically to renew his drivers license and pay his rates the employees entrance was unlocked dex stepped inside with his pistol drawn then beckoned linneth after him he listened for voices but heard only the rush of the wind through some distant vent to his left stairs led upward he followed them to the second floor and out into an empty broadloomed hallway he passed doors marked ombudsman license bureau land management all these doors were wide open as if the rooms had already been searched all abandoned linneth whispered she was right papers had been strewn everywhere many with the letterhead of the bureau de la convenance plainly visible some of the office windows were broken the wind rattled vertical blinds and rolled plastic cups like tumbleweeds over the carpet dex touched linneths arm and they both stood still he said you hear that she cocked her head a voice he held the pistol forward a marksmanship course in the reserves had not prepared him for this his hand was shakinga gentle tremor as if an electric current were running through him he located the source of the voice in the anteroom of the office of the mayor it was a radio one of the proctors radios an enormous box of perforated metal and glowing vacuum tubes it was plugged into a voltage converter that was plugged into the wall it spoke french quarantecinq minutes and a continuous metallic beeping as of a time clock once per second dex looked at linneth quarantequatre minutes the radio shrilled he said what is this theyre counting down the time there was another burst of speech indecipherable with static but dex heard the word detonation he said how long she took his hand fortyfour minutes quarantetrois minutes fortythree clifford recognized the man who came through the fire exit door this was the proctor the others had called delafleur an important man lukas thibault drew a sharp breath at the sight of him delafleur wore an overcoat nearly long enough to touch his ankles and he reached into the depths of that garment and took out a gun one of the longbarreled pistols the proctors sometimes carried a revolver not an automatic weapon like the one luke once showed him the handle was polished wood inlaid with pearl none of these refinements seemed to matter to delafleur who was sweating and breathing through his mouth luke said patron let me out of here for gods sake delafleur looked startled as if he had forgotten about his prisoners maybe he had shut up he said there was the sound of more gunfire outside the building but was it growing more distant clifford thought it might be delafleur stalked down the length of this basement room between the stockade cages and the wall with his long coat swinging behind him he carried the pistol loosely in his left hand in his right hand was a pocket watch attached by a silver chain to his blue vest his eyes kept traveling to the watch as if he couldnt resist looking at it but he plainly didnt like what he saw he pulled a wooden crate under one of the high tiny windows and stood on the crate in a vain attempt to look outside but the window was too high and louvered shut anyway clifford thought it opened at ground level there wouldnt be much of a view delafleur seemed to arrive at the same conclusion he sat down on the crate and fixed a baleful stare at the door where he had come in luke said please patron let me out delafleur turned in that direction in a prim voice he said if you speak again ill kill you he sounded like he meant it luke fell silent though if clifford listened carefully he could hear his labored breathing luke had often been silent in the last few hours but never for very long would delafleur really shoot him if he made a sound clifford was sure of it the proctor looked too frightened to make idle threats and if he shot luke would he then shoot clifford it was possible once shooting started who could tell what might happen but he didnt want to think about that if he thought about it the cage began to seem much smalleras tight as a rope around his neck and clifford worried that he might make a sound that the terror might leap uncontrollably from his throat time passed delafleur looked at his watch as if he were hypnotized by it at the sound of each fading gunshot he cocked his head theyre going away delafleur said onceto himself more fidgeting with the watch but the proctor seemed to regain a degree of composure as the seconds ticked past finally he stood up and adjusted his vest without looking at the cells he began to walk toward the fire exit lukas thibault panicked clifford heard the soldier throw himself against the bars of his cage fuck you he screamed dont you leave me here goddamn you and that was the wrong thing to say because clifford saw delafleur hesitate and turn back the proctor shifted the longbarreled pistol into his right hand clifford cowered in the corner of his cell as far away from the proctor as he could force himselfwhich was not very far he had ceased thinking coherently as soon as delafleur turned back from the door delafleur walked past him with a steely expression around the lbend to where luke was both men were out of cliffords sight now but he could hear them lukas thibault had stopped shouting now his voice was low and feverish and hoarse with panic bastard ill kill you you bastard but it was the other way around clifford thought delafleurs pistol sounded like a cannon in this stony basement room lukas thibault gave a choked scream clifford heard him fall against the cold floor it was the terrible muted sound of bones and soft tissue striking concrete a limp dead sound now the proctor came back within the compass of cliffords sight delafleur was pale and grim the pistol in his hand trailed wafts of blue smoke his eyes roamed a moment before they fixed on clifford clifford felt the pressure of that gaze as dangerous as the gun itself the eyes as deadly as the weapon he couldnt look away but then there was another sound and delafleurs eyes widened and he jerked his head toward the door fire exit opened dex graham stepped into the room dex fired a handgun at the proctor and missed now the proctors weapon came sweeping up and clifford had time to cover his ears before the batteringly loud bang no telling where that bullet went dex fired a second time and the proctor sat down on the floor the pistol dropped from his hand he slumped against the bars of the cage moaning dex came striding forward linneth stone came through the door behind him she picked up the weapon the proctor had dropped dex found a length of copper piping and used it to pry the lock from the door of cliffords cell the lock burst and the door rattled open and clifford ran to the schoolteacher without thinking he noticed dex grahams eyes how strangely calm they seemed linneth took the boy to the stairway dex lingered a moment longer he looked at delafleur who was still alive the bullet had shattered his hip he was paralyzed below the waist the wound was bleeding freely into the silklined folds of his long winter coat i cant move the proctor said dex turned to leave delafleur said you dont have time its hopeless i know dex said chapter twentynine some of the cinderblock walls of the highenergy laboratory had melted to slag and most of the roof was gone a sky of blue sheet lightning illuminated a maze of corridors howard walked through the rubble during the brief intervals when his vision cleared he saw structural rods protruding from concrete forms broken electrical cables as thick as his arm ceramic insulators scattered like strange pottery all around him when his vision was not clear he saw these things through endlessly multiplied prisms as if a snow of faceted crystal had filled the air he moved toward the heart of the building he felt its heat like sunlight on his face sterns last coherent scientific writings had leaned toward the idea of chaotic inflation a cosmological scenario in which quantum fluctuation in the primordial void gives birth to universes in endless profusion not a single creation but infinite creations and no universe accessible to any other except perhaps through quantum tunnels known as wormholes in this schema a universe might even contain a universe if you could somehow compress an ounce of matter inside the orbit of an electron it would blossom into a new avenue of time and space someone elses big bang someone elses quarks and leptons and stars and skies in other words it was possible to contemplate the technology of becoming a god stern thought it had already been done the turkish fragment was the result of an effort perhaps to connect two branches of the world tree these ghosts they moved through howard and around him with clockwork regularity might be its makers mortal gods demiurges archons but trapped chained to this vortex of creation here at the center of the building the ruins were more chaotic howard climbed a bank of broken brick and tile he was dizzy or perhaps the world really was spinning around this axis he fixed his eyes rigidly ahead everything he saw seemed to swarm with iridescence blackened walls rose above him like broken teeth he passed markers and signs some words still faintly legible warning and authorization and forbidden the core of the building had been a containment unit surrounded by two layers of reinforced steel this was the matrix into which all the cabling and conduits had run this was where stern had focused immense energies on the fragment particle beams hotter than the surface of the sun the containing walls had been breached but sections were still standing everything elsedebris dust shrapnelhad been scoured away by the explosion the containment unit stood alone in a sort of black slag crater within the larger ruins of the laboratory building howard stepped into that circle reached the tattered containment room felt a new wash of terrible heat as he moved through air thick with ghosts and stars to the crenellated walls through a vacancy that had once been a doorway and inside to the heart of the world axis mundi inside stern was waiting for him it was stern even though it was not human any longer he must have been here when the fragment was bombarded with energycloser than he should have been by design or by accident the fragment had become an egg of bluegreen phosphorescence it was perhaps twenty feet in diameter or seemed to beappearances howard knew were immensely deceptive it was hot and vividly alive it looked as fragile as a bubble but much more menacing a bubble of spun glass containing the substance of a thousand stars it was patently radioactive and howard assumed it had already killed him no matter what happened hereeven if a miracle happened herehe would not live longer than another few hours alan stern stood outside the sphere he was touching it howard knew this was stern although there was not much left of him in some sense stem probably was dead some incomprehensible event or process had preserved only a fraction of him here his mind but not much of his body what howard saw against the glare of the sphere was a body as translucent as a jellyfish the nervous system the brain and bundles of nervespulsed with a strange luminosity sterns arms touched the sphere and seemed to merge with it and so did a dozen other limblike projections that had grown into and from his body fixing him in place like the roots of a tree sterns presence was more nebulous it enveloped howard and seemed to speak to him howard sensed a terrible stasis an entrapment a speechless fear if the sphere was a doorway stem was powerless to pass through it and couldnt retreat he was caught between flesh and spirit he turned his heada fleshless bulb in which even the skull was only a dim shadowand somehow eyeless looked at howard he was pleading for help howard hesitated for a time he couldnt count or calculate all his speculation and all of sterns had circled around a truth that the object in this room was a passage between worldsor even a means of creating a world the idea seemed to flow from the object itself wordlessly the sphere announced its nature but if that was so the only way he could help stern this thing this tortured essence of stern was to step into that doorway perhaps to open it wider to succeed where stern had failed and how could he do that stern was the geniusnot howard stern had revised and elaborated the work of hawking and guth and linde howard had barely understood them stern was the wizard howard was only an apprentice the intangible bodies of the ghosts pressed closer around him now as if the question interested them howard took a dizzy breath the air was blisteringly hot the memory that came to him was of his mother at the kitchen sink washing dishes while howard dried years ago how old was he fifteen sixteen better days stern had just accepted the nobel prizehis picture had been on televisionand howard was babbling about how great it was to know this man this genius his mother rinsed the last porcelain dish and began to drain the soapy water alan is smart all right but hes also i dont know a word for it she frowned for him everything was always a puzzle a trick show him a stone he could tell you what it was made of and how it came to be at your feet or how its atoms worked or what it would weigh on mars but just to pick it up to look at it to hold it in his hand to feel it never it was beneath him it was a distraction worse an illusion she shook her head he understands the world howard but i will tell you this he does not love it contemptus mundi contempt for the world and the things of the world when howard read the words in an undergraduate philosophy text he thought immediately of stern he hesitated but there was nothing to turn back to only the proctors their terror a fiery wasteland he was surprised the detonation hadnt come sooner the entity that had been stern regarded him with a pain as tangible as this awful heat howard put out his hand the skin of it pulsed with new veins of light now the light was all around him a sudden presence of it a world of light the bomb howard thought sophia wept and was in pain because she had been abandoned alone in the darkness and void but when she thought of the light that had abandoned her she took comfort and she laughed a field of fire he touched something everything he held it in his hands a stone chapter thirty ellen stockton cried when she saw clifford running for the car the cold air had made her sober she knew how unlikely this reunion was she opened the door for him and he ran into her arms dex stood outside with linneth she looked at him as if awaiting some verdict he said fifteen minutesif the countdown can be trusted he lowered his voice so the boy and his mother wouldnt hear were too far east these roads the snow we cant make the town limits in that time much less a safe perimeter linneth was almost ethereally calm i agree is there anything else we can do drive and hope for a miracle the proctors wont delay this explosion not if they have a choice too much has gone wrong already drive and pray dex said or else what i keep thinking about howard you remember what he said the only way out is in he meant the ruined laboratory do you think that would offer us some sort of protection i cant imagine how but maybe who knows he touched her shoulder and said something else we should think about is that its closer to the bomb hardly an advantage linneth it might be if the worst happensit would be faster she looked into his eyes irreclaimable seconds ticked away she said you may be right but i want this to be because theres a chance do you understand not just suicide i think some part of you wants that but i dont did he want to die out there on the wooded ojibway reserve the strange fact was he did not for the first time in many years he would have preferred to go on living wanted desperately to live but the roads were thick with snow and he remembered the yield predictions evelyn had smuggled out of symeon demarchs study he remembered everything he had ever read about hiroshima and nagasaki a quick death would surely be better than some lingering blistered agony he couldnt bear to see linneth die like that and there was a chance he thought at least a long shotat least howard had seemed to think so the snow was soft and seemed suspended in the air the air itself seemed to tremble with anticipation he said were wasting time the research lab was not much closer than coldwater road it would take some fancy driving to get them there inwhat he checked his watch thirteen minutes linneth pressed her face to the window as the car passed along beacon road much of the commercial district was on fire the flames reflected wildly on the snow smoke fanned across the road dex was driving at a perilous speed but he knew the route she avoided looking at the strange digital clock on the dashboard she couldnt change the time and didnt want it to obsess her instead oddly she thought of her mother dead years ago in some bureau prison something lives in everything she had said perhaps something lived in that tangle of ruins dex was driving toward perhaps it was the man howard had called stern who was a sort of demiurge if she had understood correctly a mortal god a good or malevolent angel low clouds rolled across the sky the snow fell in a gentle curtain the car turned onto the highway clifford understood soon enough where they were headed he didnt question it he had seen enough to know dex graham meant him no harm but when the car left the highway for the narrow road into the foresta road clifford knew too wellhe could not contain a sigh of resignation its all right cliffy his mother said as a roof of pine boughs closed over the car itll be okay now she didnt know any better the trees had sheltered this road from much of the snow but the road itself was deeply rutted the military vehicles had a wider wheelbase than dexs car which kept wandering in and out of the ruts the old snow here had been beaten down to black ice more than once the wheels began to spin freely and the car slowed and dex had to fight it forward patiently carefully like linneth he tried to ignore the clock not as successfully the time available had slipped below five minutes clifford had guessed their destination he said theres a hill before you get to the lab where the road cuts through the escarpment it might be slippery dex saw it ahead not a steep rise but a long one the angle was maybe thirty degrees he eased his foot down on the accelerator carefully carefully the car picked up speed it wobbled alarmingly from side to side but he kept the nose pointed forward the car was doing sixty through the snow when it reached the foot of the hill he was counting on the momentum to carry them forward and it took them a long way up before he began to lose traction linneth held her breath as dex worked the gas pedal and the car slowed to a crawl now the front wheels lurched sideways and the car slid back a foot or so dex stepped on the gas let the wheels spin maybe they would grind down to a solid surface blue smoke roared from the exhaust pipe the car jumped forward hesitated jumped another yard or two the peak of the hill was tantalizingly close dex made the mistake of glancing at the dash clock they were on overtime now and the bomb was less than half a mile away clifford had been staring out the back window from here he could see the gantry above the trees linneths hands were clenched into fists in her lap another yard forward and another the motor screeched as if it had been burned clean of oilwhich was possible by the look of the steely blue smoke in his rearview mirror almost there now he pushed the gas pedal all the way down this wasnt strategy it was panicbut the car surged over the summit of the hill in a series of spastic leaps and suddenly it was the brake he was fighting the ruined two rivers physical research laboratory lay ahead this blister of strange light was more energetic than dex had expected from howards description of it it was like liquid lightningfrightening to drive into more accurately to slide into the car was gathering speed and he was on the verge of losing control everybody hold on he said linneth whispered something about time ellen stockton held her son against her dex took his foot off the brake if the wheels locked now the car would tumble were a sled dex thought madly this is freefall a timeless moment passed then the sky was full of light and the pine trees caught fire and burned in an instant chapter thirtyone milos fabrikant followed the censeur m bisonette to a trench that had been carved into the cold bare hillock in front of the bunker the snow had stopped the clouds were high and thinning the countdown proceeded with a relentless precision and fabrikant listened to the numbers unreel from the mouth of a metalhorn loudspeaker when the count reached twenty seconds fabrikant and bisonette and a half dozen other privileged observers crouched with their backs to the west wall of the revetment the light from the detonation was sudden and shockingly bright shadows flared to the east a revision of nature fabrikant thought silent at first it was his thoughts that were loud bisonette stood up immediately cupping his hands around his ambercolored goggles fabrikants joints were agonized by the cold he was slower to stand the fireball glowed like sunset in the far undulations of the pine forest incredibly the clouds above the blast had been torn open a pillar of smoke boiled into the sundered heavens the sound came at last a battering roar like the outrage of the offended protennoia fabrikant touched the sleeve of the censeurs greatcoat he felt bisonettes unconcealed tremor of delight he is as full fabrikant thought as i am empty we should take cover again censeur he said bisonette nodded and ducked into the trench the wind came next as hot as the wind from tartaros evelyn woodward was blinded at once the new sun devoured her eyes briefly the sensation was beyond pain then lake merced turned to steam as the shock wave crossed the water and suddenly the window was gone and the house and the town clement delafleur had tried to staunch his bullet wound with the silk lining of his torn pardessus but he had lost a great deal of blood despite his best efforts in the time it took dexter graham to drive to the ojibway reserve delafleur managed to drag the insensate meat of his legs as far as the door marked fire exit from there his plans were vague perhaps to lift himself to salvation but time was short he was panting and only dimly conscious when the high basement windows admitted a column of superheated steam and the stone walls of city hall were crushed and carried away above him calvin shepperd listened to the countdown on a portable scanner up at the limits around mhz when the count approached zero shepperd stopped the lead car and flashed his blinkers the signal went down the long line of the convoy it meant take cover that is hunker down on the upholstery and turn your engine off which he did his friend ted bartlett huddled next to him and in the back a sharpshooter named paige shepperds wife sarah was seven cars back riding with a woman named ruth and fiveyearold damion sarahs nephew he hoped they were all right but he hadnt been able to check no time to stop it was slow driving on this old logtruck road even with chains the flash was distant but it penetrated the cathedral pines like slow lightning the sound came later a basso thunder that barreled out of the troubled sky and then a hot whipping wind the car was buffeted christ jesus paige exclaimed then a series of hard but muffled thuds against the roof the windshield the hood some kind of bomb debris shepperd thought wildly but it was only snow huge mounds of snow shaken out of the crossed boughs of the trees it slid against the window glass already wet in this unnatural heat drive on ted bartlett said as soon as the roar abated this cant be healthy shepperd started up his engine and heard others revving behind him hang on sarah he thought and put the car in gear shepperds convoy reached the abandoned logging camp which was three tinroofed wooden longhouses and a potbelly stove at dusk he calculated that this expedition had saved maybe one hundred families out of the thousands in two rivers the rest were smoke and ashes and that was a crime so grievous it beggared comprehension but the people with him had been saved no small accomplishment and that included a lot of kids he watched them filing out of the cars as they were parked in a defile between the tallest trees the kids were cold stunned but alive it was the kids he had some hope for they knew how to adjust not that the future looked especially rosy one of his scouts had come back from the south with a road map and sales of hoarded bottle liquor and bathtub hooch to the soldiers had built up the gasoline fund in local currency to a respectable size but they were marked strangers even their cars were strange no amount of paint or pretense would allow a honda civic or a jeep x to pass for one of those cumbersome boats the natives drove still the few roads west were said to be lightly traveled if passable this time of year and if they made it over the unthinkable obstacle of the rocky mountains even if it took until june the northwest was supposed to be wide open hardly a policeman or proctor to be seen outside the biggest towns he held that thought it was comforting the clouds were gone by sunset even the towering mushroom cloud had dispersed though there was still a column of sooty black smoke which he supposed was the incinerated remnant of two rivers michigan drawn up like a migrant soul into the blue ink of the sky sarah joined him under the shadow of a longhouse roof and shepperd put his arm around her neither of them spoke there were no words for this a military aircraft passed overheadamazing how much those things resembled ps shepperd thoughtbut it didnt circle and he doubted they had been seen it was a safe bet he thought that they would all live to see morning after mr graham says its important to keep this diary he wants me to keep up with my english although thats not what they speak here and with history although they have a different history here too today although still winter by our calendar is warm almost as warm as the day we came here i dont remember all of that which is just as well my mother says mainly i remember how green everything seemed after we came through the light the lab looked very strange a few ruined buildings in a clearing as round as a crater all surrounded by green the bushes with long pointed leaves and the trees that looked like green feathers a few snowflakes were still in the air around us of course they melted quickly the blue light was gone for a few days after that we stayed in a partly collapsed dormitory building at the edge of the forest but mr graham said we couldnt stay too long because there might still be radiation we had the food and supplies in the car but no road to drive on only trails then the new people came and took us to their town the town is really as big as a city mr graham says if you count the underground part the people have been good to us their skin is mostly dark sometimes even a shade of dark green the green of shadows in a forest most of them are not as tall as mr graham about the size of miss stone their language is hard to learn but i already know several words when i learn a new word i write it the way it sounds in my language notebook they treat us well and are curious about us were not prisoners but everything is very strange above ground the buildings are as green as the trees the ceilings are arched like church ceilings i saw an airplane yesterday its wings were painted purple and white like butterfly wings mr graham and miss stone talk a lot about all the things that have happened to us last night we went up to what we call the courtyard an open space with stone benches not far from the market square you hear music there some nights and its never crowded the stars were out the stars are the same miss stone says even if everything else is different she thinks it was howard poole who created this world she says he is a demiurge now mr graham said he didnt think so i think this worlds gods are a little more distant its not a haunted place but i think howard may have steered us here at least a godlike act itself miss stone said her voice was quiet and she was looking at the stars i dont know if i believe in god my mother says if you believe in jesus it doesnt matter if you go to church or not she never did miss stone says something lives in everything i dont know what the new people believe but i am curious to find out and as soon as i learn more of their language i hope to ask them
