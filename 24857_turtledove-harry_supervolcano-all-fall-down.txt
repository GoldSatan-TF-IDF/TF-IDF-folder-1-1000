harry turtledove supervolcano all fall down i colin ferguson called upstairs to his wife you ready just aboutnot even a minute kelly answered we need to get going he muttered discontentedly he was punctual to a fault a police lieutenant had to be in his younger days the navyd rammed being on time down his throat to be fair he hadnt needed much ramming hed never been the kind of person who always ran fifteen minutes or half an hour behind scheduleunlike one poor sailor a pissedoff cpo finally tagged the late seaman kurowski and to be fair neither was kelly as quickly as shed promised she joined him by the front door patting at her honeyblond hair she asked do i look okay im the wrong guy for that question babe he said you know you always look good to me you she shook her head but she was smiling colin meant every word of it he was happy the way only a man in his early fifties still pretty newly wed to a damned finelooking woman in her late thirties can be happier than he figured he had any business being in other words after louise walked out the door on him after she and the lawyers got through with him hed never dreamt he could be this happy this way again one never knows do one he thought which like his earlier woolgathering was beside the point lets head on out he said kelly nodded sounds good out they went colin locked the dead bolt thered been a breakin the next block over last week you didnt want to make things easy for burglars they might get you anyway but why help em along brr kelly said and buttoned her denim jacket it didnt exactly go with colins blue wool suit and maroon tie but she did what she liked while he dressed the way he did more from force of habit than for any other reason san atanasio was a south bay town the nearby pacific and the good old sea breeze had always moderated its climate it didnt get as cold or as hot as downtown la to say nothing of the san fernando valley as far as colin was concerned the best thing you could say about the valley but this was june it was supposed to be mild if not hot the sun wasnt supposed to shine palely from a sky more nearly gray than blue this past winterif winter was pastthe la basin had got its first allover snowfall in more than sixty years and then a month later its second you and your supervolcano colin said if he and kelly had been in an interrogation room it would have done duty for an accusation i was just studying it i didnt make it go off and if the copter that got me out of yellowstone had taken off fifteen minutes later chances are i wouldnt be here for you to complain to she replied in at least medium dudgeon well im glad you are he admitted nothing much was left of yellowstone for that matter nothing much was left of wyoming or of big chunks of montana and idaho most of the rocky mountain west and the great plains was pretty much screwed too when the supervolcano eruptedfor the first time in close to seven hundred thousand yearshed heard the roar and felt the quake here in san atanasio eight hundred and some odd miles away volcanic ash and dust had rained down here too but not the way they had closer to the eruption site as he and kelly walked over to his silver taurus wes jones waved from across the street wesan aerospace engineer now retiredand his wife had been neighbors for more than twenty years colin waved back pointing to the taurus wes called you got gas darn right colin said solemnly that kimchi i ate last nightd do it to anybody wes laughed more than the joke deserved ah youre nutso he saidhis word for anything out of the ordinary after hearing it for so many years colin found himself using it too wes went on say congratulations to marshall from ida and me well have a little something for him when he gets back to town thanks will do colin didnt bother telling wes that his younger son was less than thrilled about finally graduating from uc santa barbara and about the idea of coming back home to live marshall in fact had often seemed to try his best not to graduate but accumulated time and units caught up with him at last like it or notand he didnthed have to face the real world colin used his keyring control to open the car doors he sat down behind the wheel kelly slid in on the passenger side when he started the engine the fuel gauge shot all the way up to the capital f kelly pointed to the gauge a year ago we would have taken that for granted uhhuh colin nodded less crude was coming up out of the ground in the usa because of the supervolcano the spasmodic nuclear war between iran and israel hadnt done production any favors either quite a bit less oil was getting refined into gasoline and what did get refined had a devil of a time reaching la put it all together and a full tank was something of a coup north on la merced the little street he lived on the left onto braxton bragg boulevard was easy not much traffic these days west on braxton bragg toward the oceanand more toward the point toward the most of the gas stations flew red flags to show they were out of fuel cars queued up at the few that were open the date was an odd number so was the last digit of colins license plate if he had to he could gas up today he hoped he wouldnt have to north on the past lax past ucla through the sepulveda pass to the west on the even if the sign said north about miles from san atanasio to santa barbara two hourslikely less with the freeways once they got out of the valley and into ventura county the came down close to the pacific it was a pretty drive a hell of a lot prettier than if marshall had chosen uc riverside riverside was or had been as hot as the valley it was also where the sea breeze blew the smog from the la basin the hills are so green kelly marveled its june everything is supposed to be brown by now shed grown up in torrance not far from san atanasio though shed gone to grad school up at berkeley she knew how things in southern california worked or had worked everything was supposed to be brown by now colin remembered years when everything was brown and bare by april fools day he remembered the horrendous brush fires that often followed in such years too no one hereabouts remembered a year where it snowed twice during the winter thered never been a year like that not till the yellowstone supervolcano blew and things were just warming upor rather cooling down yeah yeah los angeles is the new seattle kelly quoted the new conventional wisdom sure it is colin snorted and fifty is the new thirty and the check is in the mail fifty is the new thirty was part of the baby booms fanatical effort to deny the obvious like it or not the boomers were getting older fifty might or might not be so bad thirty it wasnt colin had seen both and he knew the difference as far as he was concerned anybody who didnt was a goddamn fool something with one hell of a wingspan floated over the freeway hawk eagle vulture he didnt get a good enough look to tell he had to keep most of his attention on the asphalt ahead and the morons all around they were nearing santa barbara when kelly suddenly said its cool with marshall that im coming to his graduation and his mother isnt that kind of thing was and always would be a second wifes worry it probably got more acute when the second wife was closer in age to her husbands children than she was to him but colins answer came quick and certain as far as i know hes fine with it yes but how far do you know kelly persisted marshall doesnt leave a lot of clues about whats going on inside his head if anything is with all the weed he smokes colin said disgustedly here he was a cop and both his boys got wasted every chance they could rob the older one used his engineering degree to play bass in a band called squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles theyd been stuck in the middle of maine since winter came down and winter there didnt want to let up if la wasor was alleged to bethe new seattle maine could double as the new baffin island vanessa who fit in between rob and marshall didnt do a lot of dope or if she did it sure didnt mellow her out colin wondered when or if shed escape from that refugee camp somewhere near the oklahomaarkansas border just past the eastern edge of the ashfall from the supervolcano shed got out of denver alive which most people whod lived there hadnt so he was inclined to count his blessings here most of a year after the eruption nobody knew how many people it had killed not to the nearest hundred thousand well up into seven figures that was for sure kelly clicked her tongue between her teeth hes plenty smart she said and he knows what he thinkshe just doesnt want to tell the rest of the world it could be for most things colin allowed but im as sure as i need to be that he doesnt want to see louise right now not when shes going to present him with a little halfbrother or halfsister pretty soon he also wasnt exactly thrilled that his ex was pregnant again for that matter neither was louise everything with the aerobics instructor for whom shed left colin had been all loveydoveytill teo found out hed knocked her up then when she didnt want to get rid of the baby right away hed dropped her like a live grenade why is she having it kelly asked hesitantly colin had known louise for upwards of thirty years now he shrugged anyway you tell me and you win the prize he said my best guess is because dear sweet teo told her to lose it and then bailed so she wont do anything he wouldve wanted her to but thats only a wag he didnt like to cuss where women could hear him do it the acronym didnt seem to count though wouldnt be reason enough for me kelly said when i have a baby itll be because i want to not because somebody i cant even stand any more doesnt want me to i feel the same way having said that colin realized his wife wasnt speaking hypothetically when i have a baby shed said not if i have a baby when she had a baby colin figured he would be very much involved in the process he wondered whether he was ready to be a dad again at his age fifty the new thirty if only with a newborn screaming in the house he glanced over at kelly when you do decide to youll let me know first oh i suppose she sounded as much like him as a contralto was ever likely to she sure sounded as dry as he ever did which wasnt easy had she had that tone before they started hanging out together colin was inclined to doubt it but couples rubbed off on each other all kinds of ways they never would have expected before they hooked up colin drove past the campus exit and past the ones for isla vista beyond it most ucsb students lived in isla vista just west of the university it was a rowdy place with bars everywhere and such quaint tribal rituals as couchburnings to celebrate the end of spring quarter it was full of college kids in other words marshalls apartment was in ellwood farther west still the part of goleta called ellwood housed plenty of students too but it wasnt just kids and their amusements a lot of the students who did live there were in grad school which made them a little older andwith lucka little more sensible all things considered ellwood was more staid than isla vista that was one of the reasons colin had chosen that particular apartment building marshall needed more temptations the way he needed an extra set of ears off the southtoward the ocean hereto hollister right on hollister to the street excitingly called entrance road left at the light there after making its entrance the road divided so that on a map it resembled a tuning fork marshalls building which looked an awful lot like apartments of s vintage in san atanasio lay halfway down the righthand tine fewer buildings up here had underground garages than they did down there that meant more people had to park on the street so finding a space was always an adventure colin parallelparked his way into one half a block down from his sons place kelly softly clapped her hands very neat no big deal colin said hed had to parallelpark yeah but he hadnt really had to squeeze trying to find somewhere to put the car within a mile of your place in berkeley that was combat parking you did it though she said yeah well i had incentives he let his right hand drop to her denimcovered thigh incentives kelly swatted the hand away is that what they call it these days i dunno all i know is its what i just called it colin opened the car door come on lets go round up the graduate i havent been waiting for this foreverbut it sure feels that way the air was cool and moist morning air in santa barbara was apt to be cool and moist the year around still and all this was cooler and moister than colin would have looked for before the supervolcano erupted a soft breeze blew mistnot quite fog but closein off the ocean it carried with it the camphory smell of the eucalyptus grove in back of the beach marshalls apartment was on the second floor the livingroom window faced west which gave him a terrific view of the gorgeously gaudy sunsets that had become the norm since the eruption filled the air all over the world with what people with high foreheads who wore lab coats called particulate matter in plain english that meant finely ground crud from what kelly said the yellowstone supervolcano had belched out over six hundred cubic miles of rocksay a hundred times as much as krakatoa which wasnt east of java thered been a couple of years of spectacular sunsets in the s theyd probably last longer yet this time around how long they would last wasnt the first thing in colins mind as he knocked on the door he wondered if his son had ever used one of those overthetop sunsets as background music so to speak to help get himself laid if marshall hadnt hed missed one hell of a chance he opened the door now he had on slacks a dress shirt and a tie not his usual choice in clothes but you were supposed to spiff yourself up under your robes he was an inch taller than colins fiveeleven a good deal slimmer and also sharperfeatured of colins three kids the one who most resembled him was vanessa somehow though on her it looked good hey dad hi kelly marshall shook hands with colin and hugged his new stepmother then he moved aside cmon in the apartment was imperfectly neat a sweater lay across one arm of the sofa the kitchen table was all over papers kelly worked the same way which made colin a little more willing to cut his youngest some slack colin would have bet dishes filled the sink though he didnt go check it out a stretch in the service might have worked wonders for marshall it wasnt the first time that had crossed colins mind his son grabbed one of those papers and held it up herecheck this out he said colin tilted his head back to look through the bottom half of his bifocals kelly just leaned forward that indignity of age hadnt caught up with her yet the sheet marshall was showing off looked like a printout of some email it said something called storytastic was buying a piece called sunset beach and would be sending a check for which was five cents a word the story would be going up on their web site as soon as marshall made a couple of what sounded like tiny changes this time kelly hugged him awesome she said thats twice now pretty amazing huh marshall said it is colin wasnt kidding marshall had sold another short story near the end of the year before anybody colin figured could do it once well maybe not anybody but lots of people doing it more than once probably took both talent and stubbornness a good combination he said this isnt as much per word as you got for the first one is it colin kelly sent him a reproachful look you would remember that wouldnt you marshall said colin only shrugged remembering details was part of his job his son continued i sent this one to new fictions too but they turned me down so i tried some other places and it stuck here a nickel a words not bad okay congratulations believe me colin set a hand on marshalls shoulder the kid hadnt let getting rejected keep him from sending his story out again more than once by the sound of it stubbornness sure as hell and marshall was bound to be right about the pay rate colin had stayed friends with bryce miller vanessas old boyfriend even after she dumped him bryce was a published poet and had yet to be paid in anything more than copies of course bryces poems were modeled after greek pastorals from the third century bc that was one way to use the phd hed just earned but not one likely to make hollywood start banging on his door and seducing him with armored trucks full of cash whats sunset beach about colin asked it had to have more to do with here and now than the stuff bryce turned out sure enough marshall answered a guy whos just graduating from college and trying to figure out what to do with himself when hes got like zero chance of landing any kind of real job sounds cheerful colin said marshalls first salewhich still hadnt seen print though hed gone over the galleys by nowhad been about a college student caught in the middle of his parents divorce if he could write about his own life and get paid for it well that was a real job if he could do it often enough not the smallest if in the world not even close still other prospects were bleak nothing like getting the countrys midsection trashed to shoot the economy right behind the ear the stock market had fallen and couldnt get up the crash wasnt so spectacular as but things sure didnt look good and with the weather going to hell in a refrigerated handbasket heaven only knew when or if things would ever straighten out enough of this doom and gloom kelly declared marshall youre getting your bachelors today we celebrate we can worry about all the rest of the crap some other time okay marshall raised an eyebrow at colin colin knew what his son wasnt saying something like whats an old cynic like you doing with an optimist hed asked himself the same question right this minute he was being happier than he had been in he couldnt remember how long if that wasnt a good enough answer he had no idea what would be he looked at his watch that he checked it instead of his phone was another sign he was getting up there ceremony starts at half past ten right we better get it in gear grab your robe and your fancy hat kiddo its a mortarboard kelly said fancy hat colin repeated i thought the board they used for moving mortar was a hod marshall topped him hoddehaha youve both hod it if you keep that up kelly said groaning companionably they went down to marshalls toyota in the little apartment lot it was smaller than the taurus but marshall had a guaranteed parking space when they got back either car would have to pay to park on campus the university of california didnt give anything away for nothing not these days it didnt marshall drove he knew the car and the town better than colin did his cell phone stayed in his pocket he also knew better than to talk on it or text where his old man could catch him colin hoped like hell he knew better than to do that stuff even when nobody was watching texting behind the wheel was askingbegging reallyto wrap your car around the nearest tree or light pole kids in gowns and mortarboards fled from the parking structure toward the soccer and track stadium along with parents and siblings and friends every so often thered be a squeal somebody would throw her or himself into somebody elses arms maybe the tears that flowed were tears of joy colin suspected they were more likely to be tears of fear he kept his trap shut better to stay quiet and be thought cynical than to speak up and remove all doubt he and kelly went up into the stands which were no more comfortable than they had to be marshall took his place among the other graduates from the creativewriting program hed changed majors more than once in his erratic academic career not least to stretch his time here as far as he could still and all two sold stories argued that he hadnt ended up in the worst of all possible places in due course the ucsb chancellor came to the mike her academic regalia was a hell of a lot more impressive than the cheap polyester crap the undergrads rented colin tried to decide whether that made her look imposing or like a pompous jerk again he said nothing about his conclusions after some pious blather of her own the chancellor introduced the main commencement speaker the vice president of the united states he definitely looked like a jerk in his cap and gown people said hed restored the vice presidency to its proper insignificance after the excesses at the start of the century colin hadnt voted for him but he sure agreed with those people we are on the way back the vice presidents foggy baritone boomed out of the sound system by the podium we are on the way back as plenty of comics had noticed he believed in saying things twice and in repeating himself the united states has taken a heavy blow the heaviest blow in our history but we will pick ourselves up and get back on our feet beside colin kelly made a small but discontented noise one of the many reasons he loved her was that she knew bullshit when somebody slung it natural catastrophes no matter how large and violent cannot keep this great country on its knees for long the vice president waved out to the kids in the folding chairs on the soccer pitch you are our hope we know you can overcome whatever mother nature throws at us we know you can and we know you will kelly made another discontented noise this one not so small colin touched her hand she rolled her eyes she knew what the supervolcano had done and was doing colin often wondered whether anyone back in washington really did when he was feeling charitable he figured the disaster was too damn big for anyone to cope with when he wasnt one of the new graduates yelled do you know where i can get a job maybe he wasnt electronically amplified the whole stadium heard him anyhow the vice president looked confused no enormous surprise get him offscript and hed stick a foot in his face once upon a time hed thought about running for president himself then his campaign struck the iceberg of his gaffes and sank faster than the titanic im sure something will turn up for you he said now and tried to get back to his speech that seemed safe enough it shouldnt have been another gaffe it shouldnt have been but what where when how the graduates shouted and variations on all those themes they knew their prospects were rotten how blind was the vice president if he didnt ladies and gentlemen please the chancellor came to the microphone to try to quiet them down lets give our speaker the chance to finish his address they booed her and they booed the vice president a couple of them made paper airplanes out of program pages and flung them toward the podium but that was as far as it went back when colin was a kid rioting ucsb students had wrecked isla vista and burned down the bank of america there these kids had better reason to rise up than their elders could have imagined so it seemed to colin at any rate but they subsided after some more jeers and catcalls in due course the vice president did finish and sat down he got a lot of applause when he did along with more derisive hoots he said something to the dean or vice chancellor next to him they both chuckled why not they didnt need to worry about where their next paycheck would come from the kids on the other hand colin noticed something odd when the chancellor finished the ceremony by formally awarding the degrees she announced each group separately the abs from the college of letters and sciences the bss from the college of letters and sciences and so on each group in turn whooped and cheered and hollered as it turned its mortarboard tassels from left to right to show it was now full of graduates to say nothing of those bss each group in turn till the chancellor awarded the phds the newly minted holders of doctorates turned their tassels silently and without any fuss same thing happened when rob graduated here a few years back colin told kelly in a low voice isnt that funny it doesnt surprise me one bit when i finally get my diss done ill be too tired to feel like making a fuss even if i do go to the ceremony kelly said right now she was teaching geology at cal state dominguez hills not far from san atanasio the slot was probably a wedding present from her chairman up at berkeley and a very welcome one she kept working on the dissertation in her copious spare time huh colin said thoughtfully hadnt looked at it like that sure makes more sense than any of my guesses trust me kelly said most of the time few phrases set off more alarm bells in colins head than that one he nodded now along with the rest of the graduates relatives he and kelly went down onto the pitch to meet up with their hero of the moment and to immortalize that moment in ones and zeros marshall duly pantomimed turning his tassel he started to do it again but paused in midturn to hug a pretty asian girl sorry about that he said as he went back to posing she was in my writing class this past quarter dont worry about it colin answered if id come up here by myself i wouldve wanted to hug her too kelly poked him in the ribs you want to tell me some more about that mister she said in a mockfierce growl didnt say i wouldve done it i said i wouldve wanted to colin explained im married but im not blind hmm lets see how much deeper you can dig yourself in here kelly said what youre telling me is its all a question of impulse control you can have the impulse but as long as you dont do anything about it youre golden after some thought colin cautiously nodded yeah thats pretty much what im saying an awful lot of policework is catching the jerks who go ahead and do the first thing that pops into their heads if theyd stop for five seconds to wonder what happened next half the cops in the countryd be out of work but they dont chances are they cant marshall made vague waving motions listen guys i gotta go give the gown back and get my receipt for it see you in a few he headed off towards an exit already crowded with new graduates eyeing that crowd colin suspected returning the gown would take more than a few waiting till tomorrow though would bring on a fee the university of california system missed few tricks when it came to revenue enhancement the uc system did let you keep your mortarboard and tassel colin prayed such untrammeled generosity wouldnt bankrupt it in due course marshall made it back he was usually the most eventempered of colins children even when he wasnt stoned now though he looked and sounded irked boy that was fun he muttered darkly i bet colin said sure looks like they couldve organized it better kelly said a beat later she corrected herself sure looks like they couldve organized it there you go marshall said he turned to his father and spoke in serious tones you should keep this one thatd be nice colin could hardly have sounded dryer all the same he was most sincere he wasnt sure how hed survived one divorce if he had to try to survive two he shivered as if a goose had just walked over his grave an awful lot of cops marriages failed that was one reason why eating your gun was an occupational hazard of the trade i think so too kelly said pointedly and took his hand colin didnt need to worry about things falling apart right this minute so he didnt where do we go now marshall asked hed got done with college at long long last too much to hope for to expect him to have any real notion of what came next well i got us reservations for the china pavilion but they arent till six colin answered we have some time to kill first you did how marshall cool marshall actually seemed impressed the china pavilion was downtown santa barbaras best chinese restaurant and the race wasnt even close the place was always jammed ill tell you howi did it three months ago as soon as i was sure you really would get your sheepskin colin replied marshall just gaped advance planning was almost as alien to him as it was to a driveby shooter with a head full of crack to use up the afternoon they went to the santa barbara zoo it wasnt the kind of place that would drive the san diego zoo or even the one in los angeles out of business any time soon it was small and funky one of fdrs swarm of wpa projects nobody nowadays would built a zoo like this but nobody in the s had worried about that animals prowled or dozed in concrete enclosures peanut shells littered the walkways the signs at the concession stands warning about peanut allergy were relatively new though you werent supposed to toss the monkeys peanuts but people did anyhow colin thought it was terrific when they got to the china pavilion just before six it was as crowded as usual more crowded than usual in fact along with prosperous locals almost a redundancy if you werent going to school hereprices knocked the china pavilion out of most starving students price range the restaurant was full of parents celebrating with their kids sure enough though the receptionist ran a perfectly manicured finger down her list and nodded yes your table is waiting mr ferguson please come this way she grabbed menus and led colin kelly and marshall to a table by the window is this all right couldnt be better colin said someone will be along to take your drink orders soon the receptionist swayed back to her station colin asked for laphroaig over ice kelly and marshall both chose tsingtaos if you were going to drink beer with chinese food why not chinese beer and the brewery in tsingtao dated from the days before the first world war when the germans ran the town say what you wanted about germans but they knew how to make beer marshall eyed the menu with astonished respect boy this place is even more expensive than i remembered he said and looked a question at his father dont worry about it its not like you graduate every day colin said for quite a while there it hadnt been as if marshall graduated any day now colin wouldnt have to worry about tuition or rent or utilities at the apartment hed got to like the armenian couple who owned the building and several others in ellwood which didnt mean hed be sorry to quit writing them checks every month a waitera hispanic guy like most people in his line of work in southern californiabrought the drinks you folks ready to order dinner yet i think so colin answered courses revolved around crab and duck marshall grinned in anticipation his old man hadnt been kidding about ignoring the cost for a night after the waiter hustled off to the kitchen colin said this is why god made plastic his son and his new wife snorted on almost identical notes aliens must have grabbed hold of your brain dad marshall said that cant be you talking colin was the kind who paid off his credit card balance in full every month except for his mortgage he owed nobody in the world a dimeand hed lived in his house long enough that he wasnt far from waving byebye to the mortgage too even when he was going through his divorce hed paid the lawyers on time it hadnt been easy but hed done it like a bear bedeviled by mosquitoes he shook his big square head he didnt want to remember the divorce now not while he was out having a good time with kelly but he couldnt very well forget it not when he saw louises face every time he looked at marshall how much of life was rolling with the difference between what you wanted and what you got a hell of a big chunk for sure then the food came he couldnt imagine a better or a more delicious amnesia inducer no he couldnt afford to do this every day or even very often all the more reason to enjoy it when he could hed reached blissfully overloaded nirvana when kelly touched his hand look outside she said softly its raining it never rained in june in southern california sure as hell though the sidewalk and the street out there glistened with water cars went by with their wipers and lights on he couldnt forget about his divorce the supervolcano insisted on being remembered too ii in the year without a summer back two centuries ago now it had snowed in maine in june as a matter of fact it had snowed in june as far south as pennsylvania rob ferguson knew more about the year without a summer than hed ever wanted to find out the eruption of mount tambora down in what had been the dutch east indies and was now indonesia touched it off mount tambora had been one hellacious boomtwo and a half times as big as krakatoa a lifetime later though without such a good press agent and that hellacious boom was maybemaybefive percent the size of the yellowstone supervolcano eruption guilford maine had a park that ran along by the banks of the piscataquis river rob stood in the park on the fourth of july and watched snow drift down from a sky the color of a flock of dirty sheep boy this is fun justin nachman said his breath smoking at every word now that you mention it rob answered no we could bail out justin said not for the first time he played lead guitar and did most of the singing for squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles he would have been squirt frog had they reckoned things that way he was short and kind of chunky hed worn a perm he described as a yiddish afro till the band got stranded in guilford not long after the eruption he hadnt kept it up since but his hair was still plenty curly we could yeah robs words showed agreement his tone didnt for a long time getting into and out of guilford had been as near impossible as made no difference rob had never seen never dreamt of so much snow in his life he was from la so that didnt prove much all the guys in the band were californians theyd come together at ucsb but people whod lived in guilford their whole lives said the same thing basically maine north and west of i had been left to its own devices by a country that had bigger catastrophes to worry about than too goddamn much snow way the hell off in its far northeastern corner food fuel oil and gasoline stopped coming in the power went outnot all at once but now here now there till eventually nobody had any the nineteenth century came back in a big way and the locals made it through better than rob would have believed they cut down a lot of secondgrowth pines they shot a lot of moose and whitetailed deer and ducks and geese rob had shot a moose himself with a rifle borrowed from dick barber the proprietor of the trebor mansion inn the b amp b where the band was staying barber was a longtime navy man who had a pretty fair arsenal and rob a cops kid knew what to do with guns except for occasional target practice with his father hed never used what he knew till this winter eating something youd killed yourself he discovered made both the hunt and the following meals feel special almost sanctified this time around justin didnt want to let it alone its not as bad as it was we can get to bangor the airports open we can go anywhere we want he had a point of sorts it didnt snow all the time any moreonly some of the time when it wasnt snowing it got warm enough so the stuff that had already fallen started melting it had climbed all the way up into the sixties once or twice in june roads emerged from under snowdrifts here and there food and fuel started coming in though it wasnt as if the rest of the country had a whole lot to spare it seemed to matter less than anyone would have dreamt possible before northern and central maine got stranded sure we can rob said again with that mismatch between tone and voice i bet we blow up the band if we do though justin had expressive features right now what they expressed was annoyance verging on disgust biff will come along if the rest of us decide to go back to civilization he said dont bet anything you cant afford to lose rob said biff thorvald played rhythm guitar he was also the guy in the band who trolled hardest for girls they all did some of it what the hell was the point of playing in a band if it wasnt to help you get laid but biff took it further than justin or rob or charlie storer the drummer the phrase hardon with legs hadnt been coined with him in mind but it might as well have been justin still looked annoyed hes not that serious about sarah or cindy or whatever her name is bullshit hes not rob retorted cindyhe thought that was her namewas a waitress at calebs kitchen on water street if rob turned his head and if the snow eased up a little he could see the diner from where he stood it was tolerable for breakfast but hadnt been much for lunch or dinner till they put moose stew and venisonburgers on the menu whatever her name was biff was all head over heels for her and she was just as crazy about him oh man justin waved in frustration at the trees on the far bank of the piscataquis the ones that werent pines were mostly barebranched all the late frosts and snowfalls had screwed their leafgrowing to the wall rob wondered if theyd die this was a town park so nobodyd chopped them down over the winter but if they were nothing but firewood waiting to happen justin went on this is nowhere with a capital n uhhuh rob admitted what he couldnt very well deny but he also said i kinda like it yknow the look justin gave him had et tu brute written all over it youve got to be kidding me he said nope rob shook his head right after we got stranded i wouldve kissed a pig for a plane ticket to well anywhere but it grows on me honest to god it does like a wart justin was not a happy camper look dude if you just gotta go then you gotta go and thats all there is to it rob said well be sorry and well miss you and all that good shit but we wont hate you or anything the bands not worth squat if the only reason youre in it is you think you have to stay in it if you leave well hell we had a better run than most outfits do we even made a living at it for a while up from obscurity justin muttered most outfits never make it that far rob said they dont call em garage bands by accident the drummers loud and crappy and annoys the neighbors and the guys say fuck it and get on with their lives coming as far as we have we beat the odds we got all the way up to cult band justin said he didnt mean it in any good way but rob nodded even so we sure did and it paid the bills whats wrong with that i mean would you rather play gigs or sit in a cubicle next to dilbert and stare at a monitor all day justin flinched he might have been stuck in a lab not a cubiclehe was an escaped biologist but one of the reasons you got into a band was so you wouldnt get trapped in a ninetofive of course you could get trapped in a band too up from obscurity he repeated and then down to obscurity again that was how it went it wasnt so exact as calculating where a missile that went up on this course at that angle with the other velocity would come down but it came close nobodyd ever heard of you then people did hear about you and you were as hot as you ever got then they started forgetting about you and looking for something new but if enough people got to like you while you were it you could still make a living on the afterglow like really powerful missiles a few bands went into orbit and never did come back to earth squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles never would have been one of those it was too quirky and probably too smart for its own good as long as everybody in the band accepted that they could have fun anyhow justin sighed now i know what it is that farrell guys got a mojo on you oh give me a break rob said everything around here would have gone to hell if he hadnt pitched in jim farrell was a retired history prof dick barber had helped run his failed campaign for congress in the last election the successful democrat stayed in washington he showed no interest in sharing his constituents frigid fate farrell was still here and better adapted to the new reality than most younger people he also had a buglelike baritone that made peoplepeople on this side of i anyhowtake notice of him hes uh kind of out there by the way justin said it he was giving farrell the benefit of the doubt rob only laughed and were not not that way a big wet snowflake landed on the end of justins nose his eyes crossed trying to focus on it then it melted and they uncrossed again he let out another sigh i guess im not going anywherefor now okay rob said if justin waited much longer winter would clamp down hard on guilford once moreand on big stretches of the rest of the country too snow in la twice in one season how crazy was that crazy as a supervolcano eruption you never thought it could happen then it did and you had to live with the aftermath if you could vanessa ferguson checked the time on her cell phone a quarter past three she let out a sigh full of theatrical disgust part of that was because she had to meet micah at four the other part was because although camp constitution had been up and running for almost a year only little gadgets like cell phones had power here and sometimes you stood in line for a couple of hours before you got to use the charging station too she didnt know how many refugee centers there were set up just past the edges of the ashfall from the supervolcano she did know they stretched from iowa to louisiana on this side of the eruption and from washington state down into california in the west they all had patrioticsounding names camp constitution camp independence camp federalist camp liberation and on and on some fema flunky back in dc probably got a bonus for every fancy moniker he thought up she didnt think anybody knew how many people remained stuck in these miserable camps as with deaths from the eruption she didnt think anybody could guess to the nearest hundred thousand till she ended up here shed never imagined there was this much tent canvas in the whole us of a and if she never saw another mre for the rest of her life it would mean they were finally running out of them and then all the refugees would really be in trouble the roof over her head right now was olivedrab canvas she sprawled on a bunknext to the top in a stack of five she had a twoinchthick foamrubber pad over the plywood bottom of the bunk in camp constitution that was luxury and this was a pretty quiet tent that was luxury too the three little brats in the first tent where shed washed up they couldnt watch tv they couldnt play video games they couldnt get on facebook so they drove everybody nuts instead vanessad wanted to rip their little heads off she didnt suffer fools or pests gladly but what you wanted to do and what you could get away with were two different critters dammit micah had got her out of there of course everything came with a price pretty soon shed deliver another payment not long after shed come to this tent shed figured she didnt need to deliver any more that only proved shed been naive once you let somebody know what bugged you you left yourself vulnerable to him who would have dreamt micah could find kids even more horrible than the ones shed left behind well he did it damn him these were boys not girls which only made them wilder and there were four of them not three their mother had long since given up trying to keep them under control they had no father in evidence just to make matters worse they were africanamerican if vanessa complained about them through regular channels shed look like a racist so irregularly she went back to micah he raised an eyebrow he looked surprised is that so he said and he sounded surprised too damn him he was such a dweeb how unfortunate for you i was not aware of the situation another government agency called that kind of thing plausible deniability vanessa called it horseshit she was learning what can you do about it she asked him im not sure he said if they were properly transferred into that residence area i may not be able to do much at all only a bureaucrat who didnt have to live in one would call a surplus gynormous army tent a residence area and only someone who knew damn well he could take care of things if he decided to would deny it that way shed paid off before to get away from her first tent that made picking it up again easier but left her more disgusted with herself than ever if micah had been greedier but he wasnt not with any one person vanessa was as sure as made no difference that he had plenty of others coming around that africanamerican mother and her four monsters vanished from the tent as abruptly as theyd appeared in it everybody else breathed a sigh of relief vanessa breathed a sigh of resignation micah had delivered now she would have to deliver too she kept delivering every couple of weeks the way she would have kept up her autoinsurance payments out in the real world everything worked out for the best micah told her one afternoon i was able to gain the washington family access to a relocatable unit relocatable unit was more bureaucratese this time for trailer fema trailers had had an evil reputation since katrina the ones at camp constitution looked as if theyd been working hard at least since the hurricane hit new orleans they were the refugee camps equivalent of beverly hills anyway only large families got to stay in them yippee skip vanessa had said in lieu of hot shit she would rather have seen all four of the little gangbangers in cells now she checked the time once more three thirty the minutes just flew by when you were having so much fun yeah right she thought she climbed down from her bunk carefully so as not to bother the people in the bunks below hers they were as bored and miserable as she was what else were places like camp constitution but breeding grounds for boredom and misery she understood where palestinian terrorists came from much better than she ever could have before the supervolcano erupted camp constitution lay somewhere between muskogee oklahoma and fort smith arkansas it should have been up in the nineties with humidity to match but the sun shone pale from a sky drained of blue the way a vampires victim was drained of pink it might have been seventy then again it might not the breeze came out of the west vanessa slipped on a surgical mask all kinds of volcanic ash and dust remained in the air especially when the wind blew from that quarter coughing was one of the characteristic sounds of the camp you didnt hear it as much now as you had when the miserable place first opened though most of the people whod had lung troubles when they got here were already dead that breeze also brought the reek of row upon row of outhouses there were showerscold showers there were spigots where you could fill bottles and jugs and whatever else you happened to have with potable water and that was about the extent of the running water in these parts a sewage system there was not people in ugly illfitting clothes tramped the camps dusty unpaved avenues vanessa knew she was one of them knew it and hated it like everybody else here shed arrived with only what she had on her back everything else came from donations shed never seenshed never wornso much polyester in so many garish colors in her life a real building the only one in the camp housed the fema functionaries who ran the place they had electricity and plumbing and highspeed internet access and all the other benefits of western civilization they were workers after all not refugees they were there to helpif they happened to feel like it a long line of people snaked out the front door and down the street every one of them wanted something some would get it the deserving the persistent or sometimes just the attractive vanessas mouth twisted on her her fathers strong blunt features looked good she sometimesthese days more and more oftenwished they didnt but all you could do was play the cards you had shed used her looks to her advantage before like most nicelooking people shed sometimes done it without even noticing in a way she was still doing it in a way there was another door around the back no line at this one just a sign next to it with big red letters fema staff only a guard wearing a fritz hat and body armor and carrying an m stood there to back up the sign vanessa nodded to him shed been here before i have an appointment with mr husak she said let me check he spoke into a telephone mounted beside the door hanging up he nodded go on in then before she passed through the metal detector she took a revolver out of her purse and handed it to the guard he accepted it without surprise plenty of people in camp constitution packed heat there were also metal detectors at the front door there hadnt been till what the camp administration kept calling an unfortunate incident three dead seven woundedyeah that was unfortunate all right prompted their urgent installation she and the rest of the junk in her handbag passed muster so she got to go inside everything in the building was or should have been achingly normal fluorescent tubes glowed behind frostedglass panels set into the ceiling cheap battleshipgray industrial carpet lay underfoot keyboards clicked before the supervolcano blew up shed worked in a place in denver not too different from this if you were stuck under canvas with nothing to look forward to but another mre it was a lost world a clock on the corridor wall said it was four straight up vanessa knocked on the second door past that clock micah husak opened it his smile showed a broken front tooth youre right on time he said wonderful vanessa was compulsively punctual when she kept these appointments she wished she werent lets get it over with okay the smile slipped he wanted her to like him for the favors hed done her and he had done them too she wouldnt have come here if he hadnt but wanting her to like him hey people in hell wanted mint juleps to drink that didnt mean theyd get them well he said he closed the door and clicked the locking button in the center of the knob then he sat down in the swivel chair behind the generic office desk he undid his belt unzipped his slacks and slid them down around his ankles he hiked up his blue cotton dress shirt vanessa got down on her knees in front of him she took him in her hand and then muttering took him in her mouth she sucked hard she wanted to get it over with as fast as she could a few minutes every couple of weeks in exchange for living better than she would have otherwise a simple enough bargain shed thought so when she made it payback was a bitch though as it often was he opened his pale hairy knees a little wider trying to stretch it out but he wanted to come too just before he did vanessa pulled her head away so the nasty stuff landed on his belly and in his pubic hair she wiped her chin off on her sleeve micah husak pulled a couple of kleenexes out of a box on the desk and tidied himself up i wish youd let me finish in your mouth he said peevishly forget it she answered as she got to her feet i dont do that for anybody not even for men i do like she thought but coming right out with that wouldnt have been smart even if it was true she thought the idea totally gross shed got a badtasting slimy surprise the first time she sucked a guy off and shed vowed then and there shed never let it happen again she hadnt either well micah said once more but a guy whod just been blown wasnt in the mood to do a lot of complaining he wasnt the first with whom vanessa had seen that as he set his clothes to rights he went on ill see you in two weeks then yeah vanessa said tightly she was sure one of the reasons he didnt insist more with her was that he had his other side girls if he wanted to come in somebodys mouth no doubt he could camp constitution was a humongous place and it was only one of too many all depressingly alike how much petty corruption like his went on in them lots and lots she was all too sure of that enough so people on the outside didnt get up in arms when some of it surfaced up in arms hell most of the time they didnt even notice it wasnt as if they didnt have troubles of their own she couldnt even slam the door behind her when she walked out of the little office it had a compressedair cylinder attachment at the top that thwarted tantrums she left the administration building by way of the fema staff only door have a good one the guard said as he handed the pistol back to her here fat chance she answered he only chuckled did he know what went on with the women who had appointments with micah husak if he didnt know could he guess vanessa wouldnt have been surprised a new thought occurred to her as she trudged grimly back toward her tent was micah the only one there who collected favors for favors or did half or more than half the fema guys get what they wanted when they wanted it that wouldnt have surprised her one bit either there were bound to be too many chances too many temptations to resist a cat ambling down the lane glanced back over its shoulder at her and picked the amble up to a trot it was mostly white with a couple of black spots it had a fat bottom and a small head when it paused for a moment to wash a foot it looked like a bowling pin with ears loneliness stabbed through vanessa kitty kitty kitty she called theyd made her turn her cat loose when she got to the refugee center in garden city kansas the high school there had no room for pets she kept hoping someone else had realized how wonderful pickles was and taken him in but she knew he was bound to be dead so were most of the people whod lived in garden city an awful lot a volcanic ash had come down there not as much as in denver but an awful lot all the same she called the fatassed white cat again its ears twitched toward her but it decided that foot was clean enough and trotted on stupid thing vanessa muttered more likely though it already had a humanor like micah husak more than oneon its string even if it didnt cats had a fine old time at camp constitution swarms of people in one nonetoosanitary place meant corresponding swarms of mice and rats you could have pets here some people had brought in big mean dogs those mostly didnt last long they either had sad accidents or they started starving and had to be released outside the camp or put down there were no kibble distributions here you fed pets from your own rations a cat no problem a rottweiler that was a different story a little dog might be okay cats could like you pretty well but they were also in the deal for what they could get out of it dogs loved you whether you deserved it or not that kind of slavish devotion had always grated on vanessa the longer she had anything to do with micah husak though the less attractive feline expediency looked a puppy she said and nodded to herself a puppy they wouldnt be hard to find and something that wouldnt care for her just on account of what she did for it seemed especially wonderful right after shed visited the administration building louise ferguson glanced at the clock on the wall across from her desk she stood up shed forgotten how much effort that took when you were pregnant out to here the bowling ball in your belly messed up your balance too just at the time when falling would be most disastrous she stuck her head into mr nobashis inner office her boss was on the phone yelling in japanese mixed with occasional english swearwords the ramen companys corporate headquarters were in hiroshima the san atanasio building was only a colonial outpost mr nobashi raised a questioning eyebrow please excuse me louise said but i have a doctors appointment at eleven oclock she patted her bulging belly to show what kind of appointment it was oh jesus christ her boss covered the phones mouthpiece with the palm of one hand okay you go i see you after lunch yes his english was telegraphic and heavily accented but louise rarely had trouble figuring out what he meant thank you yes louise answered the baby kicked or stretched or did whatever the hell he did people talked about the miracle of life what that amounted to for a woman was stuff was going on inside you but it wasnt stuff you were doing it was wonderful sure but this was the fourth time louise had gone through it and it still weirded her out she walked out to the parking lot the ramen works american center had been on braxton bragg boulevard since the s the neighborhood was a lot rougher now than it had been back in the day a fence of stout steel palings topped by razor wire surrounded the lot despite the fence an armed guard stayed on duty the hispanic guy out there now nodded to louise and touched an index finger to the brim of his dark blue smokey the bear hat in what was almost but not quite a salute he remained watchful and alert hed probably done a tour or two in iraq or afghanistan how much easier was this he didnt have to worry about ieds in san atanasio anyhow he kept an eye on her till shed left the lot she didnt know where the ramen company hired its guards but they were all solid she flicked on her headlights the morning fog had thinned but it was still there the lights wouldnt do anything to help her see theyd help other people see her though which also counted the south bay could get some real peasoupers but at this time of year she shook her head not before the supervolcano erupted not a chance her obgyns office was only about ten minutes away the doc shed gone to when rob vanessa and marshall were born had long since retired dr travis suzuki was one of the new breed younger than she was brusque and efficient he thought she was nutso for having the baby he didnt come right out and say so but she also didnt need a magnifying glass to read between the lines when she walked into the waiting room two other pregnant women were sitting there they were both in their twenties the blonde chewed gum while she listened to her ipod the asian gal was leafing through a copy of people they both gaped at her stomach as if they couldnt believe their eyes they probably couldnt she was about as old as the two of them put together she grabbed the first magazine in the rack and sat down to look at it it was vegetarian times hardly something she would have chosen if shed been paying attention teo had talked about not eating meat any morean aerobics instructor feared fat even more than he feared the irs but hed never done more than talk he needed protein to stay strong and just as much to the point meat tasted so good well she didnt need to worry about teo any more except of course for the small detail hed given her to remember him by the detail that was getting bigger by the day and would pop pretty soon yeah except for that she thought one of the other women got called into an examination room then the second a hispanic gal came in she was older than both of those twoin her thirties somewhere she still gave louise a look that said you gotta be jiving me louise stared stonily back in your ear lady the hispanic woman looked away first she sat down and started texting on her blackberry the door to the back part of the office opened you can come in now ms ferguson the receptionist said happy day louise levered herself out of the chair with one arm she wasnt sorry to put vegetarian times back in the rack it was a sad little magazine skinny and printed on crappy paper who would have thought the supervolcano could screw up something like that it did though along with so much else a nurse took charge of louise why dont we climb on the scales she said we youre getting on with me louise said the nurse her name was terrilouise felt proud of herself for remembering laughed it wasnt that funny but then neither was terris assumption that because she was having a baby she was also turning back into one she got on the scale she weighed what she weighed she wondered how much would come off after the kid finally emerged she wondered if any would one more thing to worry about it wasnt even close to the top of her listand when she couldnt worry too much about her weight that was one honking list terri led her into an examination room and took her temperature and her blood pressure the nurse wrote in the chart what are they louise asked both normal terri answered after a moments pause the nerve of some people wanting to know their own numbers louise had seen that attitude before in other nurses terri went on dr suzuki will see you in a few minutes out she went there was a magazine rack in the examination room too but the only magazine in it was a car and driver from before the eruption louise was more interested in it than in jumping out the window into the parking lot but not much more she left it in the rack she wouldnt die of boredom before the doctor came in and in he swept terri in his wake to keep the proprieties proped or whatever he reminded her of mr sulu from star trek his weapons of choice though were rubber gloves not photon torpedoes how are you feeling today he asked briskly like the goodyear blimp how else am i gonna feel she retorted he laughed she added and i do wish hed come out and get it over with im sick of lugging him around dr suzuki nodded how many times had he heard variations on that theme probably from every woman close to her due date he glanced into the chart your numbers have been good all along your bp is low youve never had protein in your urine or anything like that it should be a normal delivery we will be extra careful though i dont mean to offend you but at your age we cant take anything for granted im not offended i know how old i am id better louise said eryes dr suzuki didnt seem to know what to make of that was i so dry before i married colin or did it rub off from him louise wondered chances were it had rubbed off she still thought of anything peculiar as nutso because of wes jones and he was just the guy whod lived across the street not somebody whod fathered her three children three out of four now she thought dr suzuki tried again if anything seems even a little out of the ordinary call me or go to the hospital right away dont waste time and dont take chances do you understand i cant very well not understand that can i louise returned sharply he rolled his eyes ms ferguson youd be amazed and that was bound to be true if anybody learned never to underestimate the power of human stupidity someone whod been married to a cop for a long time sure would the armed robber whod left his drivers license on the counter of the liquor store hed knocked over but who seemed surprised anyway when he got busted the gal whod stabbed her husband in the neck over a sixpack of big red chewing gum oh the list went on and on well i hope im not dumb that way anyhow louise said okay fair enough dr suzuki nodded ill see you again in two weeks or when your contractions start whichever comes first louise made the appointment with the receptionist whether shed keep it as the obgyn had said was more up to junior than to her the doctors office was in a better part of town than the ramen works it didnt have or need a fortified parking lot louise sighed she remembered the days when no business in san atanasio did which proved what exactly that the world changed whether she liked it or not that she wasnt so young as she had been once upon a time all of the above the baby kicked inside her as she got into her car stop that she told him not that he listened she wasnt too old to get pregnant shed thought she was but nooooo life was full of surprises wasnt it uhhuh you betcha when she walked into the ramen place patty asked her how you doing in the old days patty would have been a man with a green eyeshade what she couldnt do with and to numbers couldnt be done except for thislouise patted her front bumperim fine yeah except patty would have to fill louises slot too when louise had the baby it wasnt that she couldnt she could do the job better than louise could shed taught it to louise but she couldnt stand mr nobashihe drove her nutso as soon as louise got back to her desk he yelled for a coke and a danish he ran on them why he didnt have diabetes louise couldnt imagine not from lack of effort that was for sure fetching the stuff for himself would have been beneath a japanese boss dignity having a massively pregnant woman do it for him wasnt all things considered patty had a point once shed supplied mr nobashi with his earlyafternoon sugar and caffeine louise went back to figuring inventories and sales trends it wasnt what youd call exciting well if she wanted excitement all she had to do was wait till junior came out hed take care of that for her oh wouldnt he just iii the door to marshall fergusons room had a strip of yellow police tape running diagonally across it crime scenedo not cross was printed on it in big black block letters like any newly returned college graduate living in a house with his father and his fathers new wife he was sensitive about his privacy unlike some he realized they were sensitive about theirs too and they didnt pry he could even smoke dope in there if he didnt make it too obvious he was getting wasted for somebody whose dad was a cop that was a small or maybe not such a small miracle about the only thing his father required of him was that he sit in front of his computer for a couple of hours every day working on whatever he was working on look colin ferguson said i know turning into a writer doesnt happen overnight but it doesnt happen if you dont work at it either so youll work marshall resented that but not as much as he might have he was old enough to have got past the teenage thing of being sure anything his old man said was bullshit just because his old man said it but he did bristle when his dad suggestedno ordained was the better wordthat he pay a third of whatever he made as rent what happens if i get a fat book contract he asked two sold stories and he had big ambitionsor dreams anyhow then we dicker dad said at once which tossed a bucket of water on marshalls sparking temper his father went on look im not trying to screw you im just trying to remind you that youve got some obligations youre allegedly a grownup after all thanks for that allegedly i appreciate it marshall said figured you would dad didnt even blink trying to top him at sarcasm was a losing game he eyed marshall other thing is if i get sick of nothing coming in after a while youll start looking for a job or youll find yourself somewhere else to stay how long is a while who gets to decide i decide how long it is colin ferguson answered both questions at once he even explained why after all im the guy paying the mortgage what am i supposed to say to that marshall wondered he almost asked if kelly was paying rent fortunately he had the sense not to for one thing she was married to dad for another she had a paying job at dominguez hills so all marshall did say after that brief pause for thought was okay his father had inhaled dad was braced for an argument all right and ready to blow marshall out of the water now he exhaled again hed got dressed up and he didnt have any place to go he sent marshall a crooked grin you are growing up arent you marshall was convinced hed been grown up for years now whenever he tried to say as much his old man gave him the horse laugh since theyd come through this exchange without the fireworks that might have soured things between them he let it go without offering dad such a juicy target whatever he said and left it right there the less you came out with the less youd regret later on then his father caught him by surprise i bet i know where youll be able to make some money anyhow not enough to live on but some oh yeah where marshall wondered what kind of harebrained scheme was dancing through dads beady little mind only it turned out not to be so harebrained after all taking care of your halfbrother thats where colin ferguson answered your mother will be looking for somebody to do that im sure once she runs through however much maternity leave they give her huh marshall said thoughtfully whatever he might have been looking for that wasnt it im not sure i want to do that i dont know how much i want to have to do with mom these days and taking care of of that kid he didnt even want to say teos name teo after all had stolen mom away from dad and screwed up the family that was how hed seen it at the time anyhow little by little hed come to realize things werent so simple which was another part of growing up the first approximation still ruled his gut though his father sighed well its your call if you dont want to i sure wont try and make you but its not like id mind or anything i wish your mother the best in spite of everything i dont want her back too much water over the dam for that but i do wish her the best and shell need the help better if she gets it from somebody she knows somebody she can trust and not somebody she hires off a supermarket bulletin board or from craigslist or somewhere ill think about it marshall hadnt expected to say even that much thanks you do that dad gave him another one of those lopsided grins five gets you ten taking care of a baby gives you something new to write about too hot shit if marshall sounded distinctly unenthusiastic it was only because he was he didnt let dad beat him to the punch line either thats what id be writing about too isnt it hot shit and cold shit and piss and spitup and all kinds of gross stuff his father agreed but thered be other stuff too getting to know your halfbrother and him getting to know you when youre old enough to be his father i guess marshall didnt want to think of it in those terms if he was old enough to be his mothers sons father somewhere a goose was walking on old oedipus grave the idea creeped him out bigtime maybe that showed on his face because his father said ill let it go you dont have to make up your mind right away one thing you should do though if youre even halfway thinking about it is poke around online and see what kind of money childcare providers or whatever they call em make if you do decide to take it on youll want to get what you deserve makes sense marshall said to his relief dad did leave him alone then he chewed on it for a while chewed on it without deciding one way or the other he had moms number on his phone of course he could count on the fingers of one hand how often hed used it since his folks broke up odds were she wouldnt even recognize his number if he did call her again the baby might be stillborn it might be kidnapped by gypsiesor even by roma if you wanted to be pc about baby thieves all sorts of things might happen to keep him from needing to make up his mind he might even sell some more stories if he sold enough he wouldnt need to worry about playing nanny to his mothers bastard writers find inspiration and incentive wherever they can any excuse for sitting down in front of a keyboard and monitor instead of doing somethinganythingelse is a good one marshall was still very new to the game but hed already figured that out and for the next several days he wrote a hell of a lot more than usual bryce miller had a fancy new phd in classics from ucla with all the rights and privileges appertaining to the doctorate of philosophy chief among those privileges it seemed was the privilege to starve hed saved money from his taships and research assistantships his only real vice was books as vices went it was a cheap one his old car was paid for his apartment wasnt expensive so he starved slowly an inch at a time instead of in a hurry he scoured the online chronicle of higher education craigslist monstercom anything that might possibly land him an academic job he sent out zillions of resumes by email and snailmail both nobody wanted anything to do with a newminted classicist even one who could also teach ancient history he wasnt fussy he was desperate if he ran out of money before he landed something hed have to move back in with his mother boomerang kids were a phenomenon of his generation before the supervolcano blew there were more of them now with the economy still on its back with its feet in the air and xs where its eyes ought to be the idea humiliated him all the same he wasnt a little boy any more dammit no matter how much his mother wanted to keep him one he sent his cv to every catholic school in los angeles and orange counties if anybody needed a latin teacher a catholic school was likeliest to most of them didnt answer his queries the ones that did either already had a latin teacher they liked or didnt want any and so his alarm went off before six one morning he had to get out of bed to turn it off a sensible precaution for anyone who slept as soundly as he did he hopped in the shower gulped bread and jam and coffee for breakfast and drove downtown to the offices of the department of water and power they had or so their online ad said an opening for a grant writer the requirements were a bachelors degree and three years of writing experience hed published his first poem almost exactly three years earlier fortunately they didnt ask how much hed made from his writing even if you put a cash value on the copies the journals paid in his total earnings would barely touch three figures but they didnt hed got through that round of vetting and here he was at the dwp taking a test along with several dozen other worriedlooking people the men and women ranged from his age up to their early sixties maybe a civilservice job wasnt exactly what they had in mind either it beat the hell out of no job at all though they took the test in what looked like the lunchroom though the foodserving part was closed off everyone had a stock of numbertwo pencils it might have been the sat all over again in came a plump woman in a burgundy polyester pantsuit his mother would have lovedhe couldnt think of anything worse to say about it she carried a fat manila envelope im stella garcia she said i will be administering this assessment instrument before we begin i want everyone to put their cell phone on the table in front of you upside down and in the off position there were more ways to cheat on exams now than there had been back in the day even if you did call them assessment instruments had anyone brought more than one phone would it help bryce hadnt he wasnt hardened enough to this game besides he had only one mrs garciaher ring flashed under the fluorescentspassed out the exams facedown do not turn them over and begin until i tell you to do so she said you will have two hours precisely to complete them she checked her own cell phone for the time even though there was a clock on the wall behind her begin it was eight on the dot or near enough bryce put his name address and email on the front page of the booklet then dug in it was like the sat english test grammar analogies taking the meaning from passages only the passages were mindnumbing bureaucratese not the fairly straightforward stuff on the sat he didnt care he aced standardized tests he always had and he could read bureaucratese even if he didnt write it well he filled in bubble after bubble one poor shlub strolled into the lunchroom at half past eight mrs garcia gave him a booklet and made him put his cell where she could see it bryce didnt figure him for serious competition but what about the woman who handed in her test at five to nine was she brilliant or hopeless she walked out of the room before bryce could make up his mind he finished about nine twenty he was the sixth or maybe seventh to turn in the exam another guy handed his in a moment later they walked out together what did you think the other guy asked once the door closed behind them he was fortyfive or so heavyset and needed a shave he hadnt showered before he came in either it had been easier than bryce expected he didnt want to say that so he shrugged and answered who knows how about you i did the best i could the older man said which also might mean anything he went on hope i land the job im gettin awful sick of pork and beans know what i mean oh man do i ever bryce said not much out there these days not much theres fuckin nothin the other guy said good luck to you jackbut not too much no offense yeah well back atcha bryce replied they swapped wry grins it was raining when bryce went to his car the only rain la was supposed to get in later summer was the occasional thundershower when the monsoon slopped over the mountains from the desert to the east this wasnt like that it was chilly clouds blanketed the sky it felt like december or february he turned on his wipers and his lights he made sure he remembered to turn the lights off again when he got back to his apartment building calling aaa to come out and give you a jump was a pain in the ass waiting in his mailbox were a couple of bills and a letter from a noaccount university in florida it was a form rejection he didnt even remember applying for a job there but that proved nothing much hed sent out a hell of a lot of resumes all right he carried the depressing snailmail up to his place if he wanted to apply to some school in minnesota or the upper peninsula in michigan he might have a decent chance of landing something but he wouldnt have wanted to live in minnesota or michigan even before the supervolcano went boom these days los angeles was getting what would have been unseasonable rain minnesota and michigan were getting what would have been outofseason snow though not all of what theyd got this past winter had ever melted if you were into sled dogs they werent bad places to go otherwise he shook his head next to those places even moving back in with his mom looked well not so bad when he called susan he got her voice mail he thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand classes at ucla had already started that didnt matter so much to him not any more but it did to her she was finishing her diss on the eleventhcentury holy roman empire and she had a taship so she was probably ramming the epic of gilgamesh down the undergrads throats right this minute at the tone he said well i took the dwp test i guess i did okay call when you get a chance love you bye as he stuck the phone back in his pocket he shook his head again this time in slow wonder had they really been going together for three years longer than that now hed had a few random dates after vanessa dumped him but nothing that was going anywheretill he met susan ruppelt theyd just clicked one of these days hed ask her to marry him he had no doubt shed say yes but he wanted to be able to support her before he did fathersinlaw with jobshers was a mechanical engineertended to look down their noses at unemployed sonsinlaw she called back about four that afternoon hi hon she said so it went all right it didnt seem that hard not as bad as the sat bryce answered how many other people were taking it she asked bunches fifty maybe seventyfive it was in this big lunchroom thing bryce sighed every job that got advertised drew swarms of people he did his best to stay hopeful theyve got to pick somebody maybe itll be me i hope it is susan paused i guess i hope it is i mean you worked so hard doing what you wanted to do seems a shame if you dont get to use it welcome to the real world bryce said thats pretty much what my chairperson told me when i turned in the thesis hey it was fun while it lasted yeah every day brought susan closer to banging her head against the same wall she tried to look on the bright side like you said somebodys going to get that job you know how things are at the universities when somebody retires or dies half the time they just close the damn position more than half tell me about it bryce said bitterly how many times had some classics departments chair or more often boss secretary signed a letter saying their slot wouldnt be filled after all more than he cared to rememberhe knew that well something good will happen people got through the great depression well get through this susan had a sunny temperament she sometimes needed it too to put up with bryces spells of gloom we didnt have the whole planet screwing us to the wall then though he said now it was just bank failures and stuff they wouldnt have called it just she said thats cause they hadnt seen this he returned but she kept trying to cheer him up and he let her think she had making her worry less about him actually did make him feelsomebetter it was convoluted but it was there two days later he got an email from the dwp asking if he could come back for an interview and more testing on the following monday he wrote back that he could hed made them think twice about him anyhow hed already sent his confirmation before he wondered how much he honest to god wanted a realworld job more than he wanted to live with his mother ever again that pretty much settled that yes this was a large eruption even by supervolcano standardsnearly six hundred cubic miles kelly ferguson told her class at cal state dominguez hills this was just about the size of the first yellowstone eruption more than two million years ago and almost as big as the mount toba blast in indonesia seventyfive thousand years ago she paused anybody remember how many times the yellowstone supervolcano blew between that first big boom and this last one anybody remember was a profs shorthand for how many of you did your reading a couple of tentative hands went up kelly pointed at one of them the owner of the hand a big broad brown guy she guessed was a samoan said uh two he didnt sound very sure but he was right she beamed at him good she said he looked relieved if she remembered how hed done on the last quiz he had reason to look that way the state university was californias second tier behind the university of california students here came in two kinds the ones who couldnt get into the uc system and the ones who couldnt afford it some of the latter bunch were as good as anybody who did get into the university of california the others mostly werent kellyd done enough taing to know the kind of work uc students did too many of these kids couldnt come close to that standard well you did what you could with what you had she went on both those other eruptions were still enormous even the smaller one ejected about sixtyfour cubic miles of rock and dust and ash thats four times the size of the blast from mount tambora back two hundred years ago and mount tamboras the volcano that gave the united states and europe what they called the year without a summer she glared out at them and anybody who mixes up mount tambora and mount toba is in big trouble you hear mount tambora is still there one of these days itll go off again what used to be mount toba is lake toba nowthe volcano blew itself to hell and gone one of these days itll go off again too but i pretty much promise we wont have to worry about it weve got enough other things to worry about the kids laughed nervously for all the world as if she were kidding they scribbled notes some of them just recorded what she said so they could listen to it again before the test shed always thought putting the material into her own words helped make it hers she still did but shed come to see not everybody worked the same way recording sure was easier than taking notes okay she said the smallest yellowstone eruption was four times the size of the one from mount tamboraand mount tambora was pretty big for an ordinary volcano how much bigger than that little supervolcano eruption was this last one she waited shed told them how many cubic miles of ejecta the yellowstone supervolcanod belched this last time now they had to remember that or find it in their notes and make the calculation calculators and cell phones came out doing math in your head wasnt quite so obsolete as writing in cuneiform but it came close a girl in the front row indignantly hit what had to be the clear error button either shed made a mistake or she didnt believe the answer shed got a skinny black guy tentatively raised his hand kelly nodded to him nine times by the way he said it he had trouble believing it too but kelly nodded again thats right she said the girl in the front row looked disgusted so she must have thought a right answer was wrong well it was pretty unbelievable all right if you spread the ash and dust and rock evenly all over california it would be about twenty feet deep the ones who wrote wrote that down of course the ejecta werent spread evenly lava and pyroclastic flowsthe really dense stuffstayed relatively close to the supervolcano caldera but relatively was a relative term jackson wyoming lay maybe sixty miles south of what had been the southern edge of yellowstone national park today it was as one with pompeii and herculaneum one of these centuries it would probably astonish archaeologists there was a hell of a funny book one whose author she couldnt remember called motel of the mysteries it was all about the stupid conclusions excavators with no cultural context would jump to when they dug up a twentiethcentury motel it also made you wonder how much of what you thought you knew about ancient egypt was nothing but bullshit well jacksonand a good many other townswould give future diggers their chance at dumbness a girl who could have been anything and probably was an la mutta little bit of everythingraised her hand question kelly asked uhhuh the girl said somebody told me you were like in yellowstone when the supervolcano went off is that right um no kelly answered if id been there then i wouldnt be here now trust me on that one the class laughed nervously she decided she needed to say more i was part of a team of geologists doing research in the park while the supervolcano was ramping up a couple of helicopters flew us out when things started looking really scary wed just landed in butte montana about two hundred miles away when it blew i was on the runwayi mean wed just landed the earthquake knocked me over and then the windthe blast wave if you want to think of it like thatblew out most of the windows in the terminal blew me down the strip and knocked my copter over on its side from two hundred miles away the girl said wow wow kelly agreed yeah from two hundred miles away itswhat eight hundred miles from yellowstone to la and you guys heard the blast here right she knew colin had hell theyd heard it across the whole country theyd heard it in western europe we felt the quake too the girl replied we felt it before we heard the boom kelly nodded you would have earthquake waves travel faster than sound i thought the world ended the skinny black kid said way thingsre at right now maybe i wasnt so far wrong either snow in la if that aint the end of the world what is it anybody know for sure how long the cold weathers gonna last regretfully kelly shook her head anywhere from a few years to a few hundred years no one can tell you any closer than that weve never had a supervolcano go off before when we were equipped to study it the big samoan guy raised his hand when kelly pointed to him he asked while you were in that helicopter just before the big eruption were you like yknow scared no shit kelly blurted the undergrads burst into startled laughter they didnt expect that kind of language from a prof even one who wasnt all ancient and dusty but what else could you say when somebody sent you a really silly question maybe theyd decide she was a human being after all it might be too much to hope for but maybe youve got to remember the hot spot under the supervolcano has been active a lot longer than its been under yellowstoneunder what used to be yellowstone kelly had loved the park loved hiking in it loved the geological formations without a match anywhere in the world all gone now the ecosystem would be tensmore likely hundredsof thousands of years healing it started up under northeastern oregon seventeen or eighteen million years ago as the north american tectonic plate slid along on top of it it erupted every so often across idaho till it got to where it is now the snake river valley follows the path of the eruptions pretty well a few of the kids looked impressed kelly knew damn well she was a single geological feature active across so much time the hot spot that created the hawaiian chain had been around even longer so had the collision between india and asia that pushed up the himalayas not a whole lot of things like that there are a couple of museums in nebraska full of beautifully preserved rhinoceros bones from eleven or twelve million years ago the animals died around a water hole and got buried by the ash from one of the blasts when the hot spot was under idaho kellyd known about ashfall historical park for a long time you heard of it when you studied the yellowstone supervolcano funny though that bryce millerd seen bones from that excavation when he was in lincoln funny also that kelly as colins new wife should get to be friends with his daughters exlivein rocks werent the only things that laid down strata so did relationships it was ten till twelve she let the class go warning them theyd get another quiz friday they gave the predictable groans as they trooped out she hoped shed find an open gas station before she got home if she didnt shed have to see how the bus lines worked before she left tomorrow shed have to see how long getting here by bus took too la buses suckeda technical term but you did what you had to do if you could do anything at all thered been a boom in apartment buildings in san atanasiohell in the whole south bayin the s colin ferguson whod lived there a long time remembered when they were still pretty new the twostory courtyards with the pools and the rec rooms and the underground parking garages had had an almost jetsons kind of cool well platform soles and leisure suits werent what they had been when you could wear them without irony neither were those apartment buildings they got old they got shabby they got rundown young people on the way up stopped living in them till they could afford to buy a house some of the folks whod moved in a long time ago got old along with their apartments poorer people moved into other units these days the papers when there were papersthe supervolcanod almost finished the job the net had started always called san atanasio a workingclass community that was the polite way to put it anyhow this particular building had a bronze plaque out front that said marseille gardens the stucco was faded and cracked and chipped it needed a new paint job the newest paint on it was a patch where someone had halfheartedly covered up graffiti that must have been a while ago fresh spray squiggles writhed across the coverup the entrance and exit to the parking garage both reminded colin of tank traps there was a security door to get into the lobby and another one up the flight of stairs from the lobby to the courtyard colin sighed as he got out of the unmarked cop car that was a privilege of his rank another gorgeous spot he said oh hell yes man sergeant gabe sanchez scratched at his saltandpepper mustache he kept it as bushy as regs allowed and then a little more besides officious superiors got on his ass about it colin couldnt have cared less gabe made a hell of a good cop next to that what was some face fuzz jack diddly thats what a blackandwhite had got there ahead of them the red yellow and blue lights in the roof bar flashed one after another in the glassedoff lobby a uniformed cop was talking to a tiny grayhaired woman who broke off every once in a while to cover her face with her hands seeing colin and sanchez the cop waved colin nodded back gabe sanchez sighed gotta do it he said ill go in you take a minute colin told him gabe sent back a grateful look he lit a cigarette as colin climbed the stairs to the lobby san atanasio was as aggressively smokefree as any other socal city there would have been stereophonic hell to pay had the sergeant lit up inside the car he smoked now in quick fierce puffs colin knew hed come along as soon as he got his fix when colin walked into the lobby the cop wearing navy blue said lieutenant this is mrs nagumokiyoko nagumo shes the one who called her sister is in apartment uhhe glanced at the notes hed been taking apartment thanks pete colin turned to mrs nagumo and showed his badge im lieutenant ferguson mrs nagumo your sisters name is eiko ryan there were still some japanese in san atanasio thered been more before a lot of them headed south to torrance and palos verdes as blacks and mexicans moved in quite a few had intermarried with whites some of the resulting names were a lot more amusing than this one mrs nagumo said thats right we were supposed to have lunch today i called her she didnt answer i came over to see if she was okay shes lived here ten years now since her husband passed away i see colin wondered how many times hed heard stories like this the ryans had probably had a little tract house somewhere not far from here after he died even a little house might have seemed too big or the memories there might have hurt too much but if eiko ryan wanted to stay independent a place like this would have seemed pretty good what happened when you got here maam by the way pete shifted from foot to foot hed already asked her that well tough i buzzed she didnt let me in i rang for the manager he knows me he let me go in i knocked on her door still nothing i went back to the manager and asked him to open the apartment i was afraid maybe shed fallen or something she was of an ageand her sister would be toowhere a fall was liable to mean a broken hip when she didnt go on colin gently prodded her what happened then mrs nagumo ohand when was the last time you did talk with your sister it was last friday when we set up lunch this is wednesday sofive days ago mr svanda he complained but he always complains he did what i wanted him to do chances were most people did mrs nagumo couldnt have been taller than four feet nine but she had immense dignity her grief was all the more stark on account of it he opened the door and we found her in the bedroom i called then a tear ran down her wrinkled cheek did you or mr uh svanda touch anything inside the apartment colin asked he wondered why he bothered if this was another south bay strangler case the bastard never left prints hed been raping and murdering little old ladies all through this part of la county for years now and nobodyd laid a glove on him nothing much anyway kiyoko nagumo said we watch tv we know about fingerprintsoh yes okay colin fought a sigh everybody watched tvand everybody thought the cops always caught the bad guy right before the closing commercials real life unfortunately could be a lot messier and less conclusive and reallife cops took the heat when it was ive got a pretty good statement from her lieutenant pete said as gabe sanchez came up the stairs to join them if you want to have a look at the crime scene before the forensics guys and the coroner get here yeah ill do that colin said resignedly mrs nagumo started crying again hearing about the coroner must have reminded her her sister was dead the door up into the courtyard was open people milled around there the way they always did after something bad happened a grizzled fellow limped up to colin and gabe like anyone with an ounce of sense he knew cops when he saw them im oscar svanda he said my wife glinda and me we manage this building i let mrs ryans sister into her place and then we seen the poor ladys body he crossed himself he looked green around the gills and well he might civilians rarely saw things like that and rarely knew how lucky they were not to gabe why dont you take mr svandas statement colin said i do want to have a look at the apartment okay ill catch up with you gabe pulled a notebook from an inside pocket of his blue blazer you want to spell your last name for me so i make sure i have it right mr svanda the other uniformed officer from the blackandwhite stood at the door to apartment she looked a trifle green herself your first strangler case heather colin asked understanding that all too well she managed a nod fraid so lieutenant well welcome to the club now you see why we hate the son of a gun so much colin said grimly heather nodded again this time with more conviction he walked inside the furniture was that furnishedapartment blend of tacky and functional the naugahyde covering on the dinette chairs had orange flowers the couch and chair were upholstered in industrialstrength fabric with a really horrible red white and black plaid but everything was scrupulously clean and neat a faint but unmistakable odor led him into the bedroom eiko ryan had been there two or three days all right her long flannel nightgown was hiked up to her waist alive she might have been an inch or two taller than her sisterwhich would have done her a hell of a lot of good trying to fight off the bastard whod killed her colin clasped his hands behind his back to make sure he didnt touch anything it wouldnt matter but he did it anyway habit was strong in him and got stronger as he got older he heard some kind of commotion outside he feared he knew what kind too sure as hell heather called the reporters are here lieutenant oh joy colin said and went out to meet the press iv louise ferguson felt as if shed gone fifteen rounds with mike tyson and hed thrown nothing but body punches the whole time they called it labor for a reason shed found that out when shed had her first three kids but shed been in her early twenties then now she was old enough to be a granny she felt every year of it too and about twenty more besides she lay on the bed flicking the tv remote her roommate wasnt therethey were running some kind of test on her she was a korean gal who didnt speak a whole lot of english when she was there she kept stealing glances at louise as if to say what the hell were you doing but the answer to that was only too obvious wasnt it james henry fergusonseven pounds nine ounces twentyone and a half incheswasnt there either theyd asked if she wanted him with her or if he should stay in the nursery when she wasnt feeding him shed had rob with her all the time despite her own exhaustion shed started at his every twitch and sneeze and wiggle and shed learned her lesson vanessa and marshall had stayed in the nursery james henry could damn well do the same thing here was the local news living with colin for so many years had given her a jaundiced view of it blowdried male robots and beautycontest third runnerups struggling to read from teleprompters the newsies didnt seem a whole lot smarter once shed walked out on colin either but the headline behind this toothy blonde in a clinging red sweater was south bay strangler strikes again louise decided not to change the channel again colin had started chasing the strangler while they were still married he still hadnt caught him neither had any of the other south bay police departments found dead in her san atanasio apartment was eiko ryan age seventynine the newswoman said dna analysis has not been completed but the mo seems consistent with the notorious south bay strangler our jerry michaelson was on the scene their jerry michaelson thrust a mike in colin fergusons face what can you say about this latest strangler atrocity lieutenant he asked excitedly i dont want to say much of anything till the lab team and the coroner do their job colin answered but it is a strangler case isnt it michaelson persisted right now it looks like one and thats about as much as i can tell you colin said their jerry michaelson wasnt about to let him off so easily when will you catch this monster whos been terrorizing south bay senior women for so long believe me theres nothing id like better colins impatience was starting to show hed always had a short fuse with reporters if youve got any good ideas id love to hear em michaelson started to splutter the news cut back to the studio the blonde in the tight sweater deplored the cops failure to apprehend anybody she had a little trouble with apprehend but managed almost well enough then a filipina nurse walked in and louise stopped worrying about the news how you feeling the young woman asked run over by a truck louise answered honestly the nurses eyes widened she laughed oh i bet you do she said having a baby not easy for anybody harder when you get a little older that was a polite way to put it the nurse grabbed a gadget on a pole stuck louises finger in a clip and wrapped a cuff around her arm the cuff inflated painfully tight then relaxed the nurse wrote in the chart well louise always wanted to know what was what blood pressure good blood oxygen normal the nurse stuck something in louises ear then wrote again temperature normal too you okay except youre crazy she didnt come out with it but it was written all over her face oh boy louise fought a yawn then she didnt fight it any more shed earned the right to be worn out by god and she knew shed better sleep while she had any chance at all the baby sure wouldnt let her once she got home she wanted a shower too she was all over greasy sweat but she lacked the energy right now tomorrow would do epesiotomy hurt the nurse asked its starting to louise admitted theyd given her a local down there while they sewed her up it was wearing off now one more delight of childbirth shed managed to forget if women remembered all the lovely details they would never have more than one kid and the human race would have vanished a long time ago father come see baby the nurse inquired i doubt it louises voice was colder than supervolcano winter in greenland if teo had wanted anything to do with his oops of an offspring if hed wanted anything to do with the kid a lot of things now would be different but he damn well hadnt and they damn well werent i dont expect any visitors no the filipina girls eyebrows rose too bad you have pretty baby those things were relative newborn babies werent the cute laughing things they became in a few months james henry was very pink he had next to no hair and he looked like a conehead because hed got kind of squashed coming out that he would look that way at least louise had recalled shaking her head the nurse went away the news was doing the weather report it would be chilly and rainy it was either chilly and rainy or just plain chilly most of the time and la had it way better than most of the country dinner came it was unexciting hospital food a redundancy if ever there was one louise didnt care in the classic phrase she could have eaten a horse and chased the driver an attendant wheeled in the korean lady in the other bed shed just got her tray when her husband showed up they pulled the curtain and chattered in their own language with occasional english words thrown in it reminded louise of mr nobashi talking to hiroshima though neither side of this couple was in the habit of yelling oh jesus christ then colin walked in louise knew she looked like hell she felt like hell too and she wasnt only sore and beat all her hormones were working on emergency overdrive it wasnt the ideal moment for a visit from an exhusband in other words come to gloat did you she snapped his face never showed much that was a useful attribute for a cop but it had always irked her his mouth did tighten a little shed managed to piss him off well i can always leave if you want me to he said i heard youd had the baby and i wanted to see how you were doing im trampled thats how louise replied i remember he said but youre okay and the kid is too he waited for her to nod then did the same himself good thats the only thing that really matters does kelly know youre here louise asked a touch of acid in her voice uhhuh colin nodded again she gets that i wasnt rolled up in bubble wrap before we ran into each other theres still stuff in my life from days gone by like the strangler louise said his mouth didnt just tighten this time it twisted yeah like him im sorry louise said the rational part of her what there was of it right this minute knew shed hit too hard hed done more for her after she got knocked up by the other man than an ex had to more than most exes would have the checks hed sent really had helped her out one of these days i will catch him ill see they stick a needle in his arm too colin said i hope you do louise meant that marshall says maybe hell come tomorrow colin shifted gears he was working on something now typing away pretty fast okay if marshall wanted thing one to do with her that would be an improvement if he could be persuaded to help take care of the baby when she had to go back to work she had hopes will he really make a writer believe it or not i think stranger things have happened who woulda thunk it colin awkwardly dipped his head listen i better get home i did want to check on you though take care of yourself louise he lumbered out of the room now when she most wanted to sleep louise found she couldnt the korean couple on the other side of the curtain didnt bother her they wouldnt have bothered her if they were speaking english memory had more weight she was still wide awake when the filipina nurse brought in james henry louise set the baby on her breast he rooted then settled down and started to nurse rank they said whoever the hell they were had its privileges vanessa ferguson thought blowing the fema dweeb was oddson the rankest thing shed ever done but that also had its privileges every once in a while for instance micah husak let her use his computer in camp constitution with next to no electricity that was more precious than rubies or it would have been had it done her any good before she moved to denver shed banked with wells fargo had she kept her money there she could have got at it here she could have got the hell out of here in fact even fort smith looked like heaven next to this but shed gone native shed put her money into the rocky mountains savings bank it paid higher interest you could deal with human beings who actually seemed to care about what you wanted it was local yes it was local and there as hamlet said was the rub wells fargo had servers all over the countryall over the world as far as vanessa knew the rocky mountains savings bank had servers in well denver whoeverd set up their data system hadnt anticipated a supervolcano eruption burying the place in several feet of ash and dust and so whenever vanessa accessed their web site all she got was a s gif of a couple of sawhorses and some yellowandblack tape with the allcaps legend under construction below it shit she snarled when she saw it yet again by all the signs that site would stay under construction till the day after doomsday her bank account was as one with nineveh and tyre and denver micah had himself wiped off and his trousers as opposed to his cock up again he looked over her shoulder how unfortunate for you he said she glared at him yeah you really think so dont you if i had the money to bail you think id stick around here to get your rocks off she did what he wanted she didnt have to waste time being polite about it neither did he there are others he answered shrugging and there were bound to be men wanted the pleasure women could give them some women would always give that pleasure in exchange for what they could get from the men they did it for if that made them want to break every mirror they owned afterwards hey it was a rough old world there was a word for women who gave in exchange for what they could get no cash changed hands in these transactions vanessa knew the word stuck to her all the same you must have relatives you could get a loan from micah said shed chewed on that before her father probably would front her the money to get back to california or at least out of the camp shed had too much pride to ask him shed made her own way since she dropped out of college to try the real world instead asking him for anything would seem like failure so what exactly do you call sucking this guys joint in exchange for a better tent and a chance to use the net once in a while she asked herself but this wasor shed always figured this wastemporary once she got the hell out of here she could always pretend micah husak had never been born taking money from her old man was different she wouldnt forget it neither would he i dont want to do that she said after a short pause evidently not his smile showed off that halfmissing front tooth well i cant say im sorry you dont it was a peculiar kind of smile but she needed only a moment to recognize it he didnt just get off on having her go down on him anybody could do that he got off on having her go down on him even thoughor rather especially becauseshe hated it she was acquainted with those complicated pleasures too they turned out to be less enjoyable when you were on the wrong end i think id better go she said her voice thick with notquitesuppressed fury it was a good thing for the dweeb that they made you check your firearms before you walked into the fema building otherwise he would have been lying on the floor with that nasty smile still on his face and with the back of his head blown out eryes he said if her rage didnt give him pause he was even dumber than she thoughtand that was saying something but he had or figured he had the whip hand because he added ill see you again before too long vanessa grunted and got out of there as fast as she could doing what she wanted to do would make her happy now but shed be sorry for a long time later no she wouldnt be sorry nothing that happened to micah husak could make her sorry but she didnt want to spend umptyump years in jail either no what do you call this place even jail food might be better than mres she tried not to think like that as she stormed down the corridor to the back door thinking like that would leave the dweeb dead and bleeding the big black guy who stood guard there studied her thoughtfully you sure i ought to give you back your piece right now he asked doubt all over his voice and on his face maybe everybodyd do better if you came back for it later im okay vanessa said and so she was as long as she didnt think about looking at micah husaks blind snake from eyecrossingly close range trying not to think about something of course was as impossible as usual grinding her teeth she made herself go on i wont plug the son of a bitch no matter how much he deserves it huh the guard seemed no happier he explained why you dont want to go hurting yourself neither we got too much of that around here he had his reasons for worrying the number of people at camp constitution and all the rest of the refugee centers near the edge of the ashfall line who took the long road out was a national shame and disgraceor it was when the rest of the united states wasnt full of its own screams of anguish the camps didntcouldnteven got noticed a lot of the time all the same suicide wasnt on vanessas radar not the way turning the dweeb into a colander was you dont need to worry about that she assured the black man i wouldnt give him the satisfaction she gave him other kinds of satisfaction not just getting his rocks off but making her blow him when she would rather have blown him away well okay the guard said slowly even more slowly he turned around took her out of its slot and handed it back to her dont you do anything silly now you hear he had a deep butteryrich voice as if he ought to be singing gospel music instead of standing here in a polyester uniform and a stetson i wont vanessa answered reluctantly because she really did feel as if saying that to him was like making a promise it wasnt as if shed never broken a promise or told a lie but even so better not he said thatd be a waste you know what difference does any one person make vanessa didnt try to hide her bitterness the whole countrys been wasted hell the whole worlds been wasted as soon as she saw the cloud of ash and dust from yellowstone boiling toward denver shed known nothing would stay the same any more but shed had no ideano one had had any ideahow different from before after would be jesus loves us any which way the guard said you accept him as your personal savior hon vanessa got out of there in a hurry without answering she didnt want to talk about religion with him or with anybody else if he had one he was happy with terrific groovy even but if he wanted to go around inflicting his beliefs on other people that wasnt so terrific of course he might have tried inflicting himself on her too the way the damn dweeb had that would probably come next well she still had the revolver and the way things looked it was a damn good thing she did oohwahh james henry ferguson owned a voice like an airraid siren shut up you little bastard marshall ferguson said his motherand james henryswasnt there to disapprove of his literal accuracy it wasnt feeding time at the zoo yetpretty soon but not quite yet marshall went into the bedroom to find out why his tiny halfbrother had ants in his pants only it wouldnt be ants it would be something a lot more disgusting than ants what babies could do to breast milk and formula guys made grossout jokes all the way from second grade through high school dealing with genuine noshit shit though was something the guys making those jokes mostly didnt know thing one about marshall stuck a finger in there he pulled it out slimy and yellowbrown this wouldnt be the first diaper hed changed on his halfbrother his stomach still lurched as if the plane of his life had hit an air pocket every time he did it though james henry wiggled aimlessly while marshall got him out of the soiled huggy and cleaned crap off his bottom eventually mom said hed be able to fight back when he got changed he hadnt figured that out yet though something else i get to look forward to marshall thought gloomily what he did look forward to was getting paid he was still writing he hadnt sold anything since he graduated though his father wasnt on his case about it dad didnt need to be marshall was on his own case before he could even close the new diapers tapes his halfbrother peed in it marshall kept a piece of cloth over his middle hed got it in the face once but only once he learned fast if not quite fast enough well piss marshall muttered piss it was all right he rolled up the new diaper and chucked it into the plastic pail after the other one the sack inside was filling fast the reek of stale urine got him in the nose again baby poop didnt stink as much as what grownups produced one more diaper went onto james henrys bottom the kid didnt ruin this one before marshall could get it all the way on to him a good thing too as far as marshall was concerned there was talk the authorities would stop letting disposable diapers come into la they took up room that could go to food and fuel instead marshall eyed the baby what do i do then he asked not altogether rhetorically oh he knew the answer cloth diapers and safety pins right out of ozzie and harriet and the lucy show but how were you supposed to fasten those without sticking the kid who was wearing them if the disposables stopped coming hed damn well find out he picked up james henry the baby had a lot of coalblack hair he was swarthier than marshall or vanessa or robswarthier than mom too anybody would think his father was mexican or something changing him changed the note on which he cried but didnt shut him up marshall pulled out his phone yeah now it was feeding time at the zoo all right he carried james henry into the kitchen mom had expressedthat was the word she used for itenough breast milk to keep the little bugger from starving before she got home marshall heated it in the microwave waited till it cooled down some and poured it from measuring cup to bottle james henry ate but he wasnt enthusiastic about it marshal didnt figure he would have been either given a choice between a rubber nipple and the real thing he would have taken the mccoy every time but his halfbrother didnt have the choice not with mom back at work he didnt refuse his bottle he just didnt like it as well as a tit after he finished marshall got a hell of a burp out of him if james henry had known the alphabet he could have made it at least to r a guy whod chugged a couple of cans of coors would have been proud of this one after chow the baby showed signs of sacking out again marshall stuck his finger inside the diaper james henry was dry yesss marshall said changing him again might have perked him up this way settling in a rocking chair marshall went forward and back for a while his halfbrothers eyes sagged shut he rocked for a few minutes longer to make sure the kid was good and out then he rose and carried james henry back to the crib down the baby went on his back marshall and his older brother and sister had gone into their cribs on their stomachs that was what the experts back then had said you should do now they said this by the time james henry was raising his own kids they might change their minds again getting him into the crib was always the tricky part if he woke up and started to scream but he didnt marshall breathed a sigh of relief now he had his own life back till james henry woke up again the first thing he did was make himself a sandwich he thought blondie was one of the lamest comics in the paper a relic from the days when hearsts and pulitzers and other dinosaurs roamed the earth no matter what he thought the monster he concocted out of leftovers lunch meat cheese lettuce tomatoes jalapenos and anything else in the fridge that looked interesting would have turned dagwood bumstead green with envy he attacked his creation like an anaconda engulfing a halfgrown tapir for a few anxious seconds he wondered if his first bite would go down it did and he used a little more restraint with the ones that followed after the sandwich disappeared he wondered if he should fix another one he contented himself with potato chips and washed them down with about a liter of coke hed talked mom into getting some of the real stuff for him she might worry about her weight but he stayed skinny without effort once he stopped feeling peckish he fired up his laptop and started noodling on a story he didnt know how much he could do before his halfbrother woke up again but anything was better than nothing hed already saved in the middle of a sentence more than once when he started trying to write stories hed counted on redhot inspiration to sweep him along to the end inspiration was great you needed it to get ideas to begin with it could sweep you alongfor a while but you had to keep going even after it ran out otherwise you wouldnt finish very much and you had to polish what did come out of the mill it wasnt just about art it was about craft too they talked less about craft in creativewriting classes than they should have it was like cooking except you had to figure out all the recipes for yourself he worked till he got tired of staring at the words on the monitor then he worked another twenty minutes on top of that so the colin ferguson he carried inside his head couldnt growl quitter at him his actual fleshandblood father was a good deal more easygoing than the virtual one who ordered him around maybe his construct was tougher than the genuine article maybe dad had been harder on him when he was younger or maybe marrying kelly had mellowed his father out who the hell knew whatever the answer was marshall would have worked longer yet if james henry hadnt started crying again marshall checked him he was wet but not poopy into the pail went the huggy marshall got the new one on him and closed up before he could ruin it after that marshall went back to the rocker and held him for a while his halfbrother wasnt smiling yet he just stared up at marshall he looked confused the way he did a lot of the time who could blame him either babies didnt have to figure out anything so comparatively simple as how to be a writer they needed to work out how they were supposed to turn into human beings even if there were manuals explaining it all they couldnt have read them if you start squawking again im gonna feed you early marshall said mom would get bent out of shape at him for screwing up james henrys schedule marshall didnt care a wailing baby drove him battier than fingers on a chalkboard if mom didnt like it she could damn well hire somebody else but james henry didnt squawk he kept looking at marshall nobodyd ever thought marshall was that interesting before the baby made little squeaky noises marshall didnt even notice the door open there stood mom looking tired but smiling aww she said that broke the spell james henry might be able to charm marshall his mother didnt stand a chance he hasnt had dinner yet marshall said all business now hell probably want it pretty soon though he did okay with lunch i changed him whenever he needed it thank you mom said do you want to stay for dinner ive got enough ground round to make us both hamburgers thats okay ill see you tomorrow morning marshall got out of there as soon as he politely could or else a little sooner hed take moms money and help her out of a tight spot past that though he didnt want anything to do with her the sun was setting in the usual technicolor splendor when he walked out to his car the wetdust smell of rain filled the air as it did so often these days he was getting used to both the gorgeous sunsets and sunrises and the crappy weather eventually he supposed hed forget things had ever been any other way so would everyone else his age and people like james henry wouldnt even know things had changed louise ferguson didnt mind too much when james henry woke up once in the night she could even deal with twice she was tired enough going back to sleep was no big deal but three or four times that wore you down that had worn her down even when she was half her current age she remembered and it was more than doubly tough now that shed reached her present state of decrepitude caffeine helped but only so much she didnt know what she would have done if coffee hadnt started tasting good to her again cocaine and crank were uppers too but shed stayed married to colin too long to look at anything illegal when the baby left her really exhausted she thought that was a goddamn shame mr nobashi gave her a fishy stare when she sat down at her desk in ramen central you good mrs ferguson he asked what he did to her last name was a caution it sounded like fugusan as if she were an honorable puffer fish ichiban mr nobashi she answered he giggled so her japanese was probably even lousier than his english well too bad she was also lying through her teethshe was a long way from being a number one ichiban or not she could do the job riding herd on noodles and flavoring packets was a hell of a lot easier than taking care of a baby as a matter of fact she hadnt exactly missed it while she was having the kid but she didnt mind coming back to it she also didnt mind when mr nobashi started yelling for coffee and sweet rolls just as if shed never left if he was dead set on jitters and type diabetes shed lend a helping hand patty came by and asked everything okay in her harsh midwestern tones could be worse louise answered i bet the other woman said so whos taking care of junior now that youre back here one of my sons he needs money and i need a babysitter it works out patty nodded thats handy anyways you prolly dont gotta pay him as much as you would if you hired somebody from an agency or somewheres either i wish louise exclaimed its cash on the barrelhead with marshall sharper than a serpents tooth is an ungrateful child the good book says patty clucked it knows what its talking about too it mostly does i guess louise said uncomfortably shed ditched her familys stern presbyterian faith a long time ago despite endless new age experiments though shed never found anything that really filled the gap her kids seemed to get along fine with nothing but she couldnt she wanted answers dammit as the old tv show said the truth was out there somewhere she was sure of it where was a different question and one of the answers she hadnt found yet to her relief patty didnt push it louise couldnt stand people who liked their religion so much they tried to sell you on it too there she agreed with her ex and with her children she couldnt think of many other places where they were all in accord what had felt strangest about coming back was how normal it seemed she knew the inventories she needed to ride herd on she hadnt seen the latest and greatest numbers since she went on maternity leave but they were in ranges and patterns she found familiar the more it changes the more it stays the same there was a reason cliches got endlessly repeated they were the ramen of thought quick easy and filling but without much real nourishment she remembered how to ride herd on mr nobashi too hed changed even less than the inventories he still spent a lot of the time on the phone spewing impassioned japanese laced with english profanity louise presumed he was talking to the home office in hiroshima but for all she could prove he might have been getting bets down with his bookie she knew a few japanese words and phrasesanybody whod lived in san atanasio for a while picked them up the same way southern californians generally had fragments of spanish even if their folks came from denmarkbut she didnt speak the language mr nobashi was just hanging up when she brought him coffee a few minutes before quitting time thank you he said which along with his bad language proved he was getting americanized a boss in japan from everything louise had heard would take getting waited on for granted youre welcome louise said to encourage him he gulped sugary caffeine and smacked his thin lips i talk with hiroshima he said very bad weather hiroshima cold like nobody remember here too louise agreed snow like any good angeleno she said it as if it were a word for people in other less lucky parts of the world and so it had been till the supervolcano went off not just snow either rain all year long its ridiculous snow in hiroshima too mr nobashi said snow now crops in japan very bad this year crops everywhere are bad this year louise said in most of the american midwest there were no crops dust and ash buried much of what had been the worlds breadbasket even where it didnt the horrible weather the supervolcano had caused screwed up crops and shortened growing seasons hai mr nobashi said not much wheatand cost so much oh jesus christ company have trouble afford it sounded as if the price of ramen would go up the price of everything had gone up as if inflated with helium college students would particularly mourn this bump though mr nobashi eyed the clock on his wall you go home he told louise even if it was early you got to be tired thank you mr nobashi she bailed out before he had the chance to change his mind marshall was changing james henrys diaper when louise walked into the condo good job she said to encourage him youre doing super with him no diaper rash or anything yeah well when hes wet or stinky i deal with it he answered and she could hear the shrug in his voice he washed his hands grabbed his laptop and headed for the door see you in the morning marshall louise began he paused but his face didnt open she swallowed a sigh never mind ill see you tomorrow out he went not quite slamming the door behind him no he hadnt forgiven her for leaving colin odds were he never would shed tried to explain how stifled shed felt while she was married to his father shed tried and heard herself failing he didnt understand or want to louise sighed yes shed lost the children and she couldnt do a damn thing about it shed hoped vanessa would get it but vanessas own troubles were the only ones that were real to her james henry made a baby noise halfway between a gurgle and a burp louise picked him up and cuddled him he couldnt even smile yet but she didnt care hed love her no matter what for a while anyhow v ive got a job for you colin mike pitcavage said he didnt look like a police chief he looked like a national news anchor or maybe a senator who was thinking about running for president he was tall and fit and tan with a full head of irongray hair he wore custommade italian suits not the offtherack stuff most copscolin includedput on every day colin didnt even particularly resent him for winning the chiefs job though hed put in for it himself pitcavage could make nice a talent colin knew he lacked you could get by as a lieutenant if people saw what you really thought of them when you had to deal with the mayor and the city council all the damn time that didnt fly any more whats up he asked looking across the desk at pitcavage the desk was about the size of an aircraftcarrier flight deck it was almost entirely bare the only things on it were two framed photographs one of pitcavages wife the other of his son caroline was a nice gal she wasnt a trophy wife or anything theyd been married a long time colins opinion of darren pitcavage was rather lower if he werent a prominent cops kid but he was so the drunkdriving charge quietly got reduced to speeding that fight in the bar people said the other guy threw the first punch thered been something that had to do with vandalism too but that also didnt stick darren was even betterlooking than his old man but his eyes didnt seem to want to meet the camera mike pitcavage opened a desk drawer took out a piece of paper and slid it across the desk at colin weve got a big oil tanker coming into san pedro next week he said the crude will go to the refineries in el segundo all the impacted departments will participate in security arrangements i want you to take leadership in san atanasio before colin said anything he took a long look at the paper then he clicked his tongue between his teeth so this oil is for south bay police departments howd we manage that we managed with some help from the politicians trust meyou dont want to know the gory details pitcavage answered colin believed him the world seemed to get dogeatdoggier every day with more and more people grabbing for less and less where was the surprise in that san pedros part of los angeles i dont see the lapd mentioned here anywhere no and you wont either the san atanasio police chief looked sly huh colin said a narrow strip of territorypart of it ran just east of san atanasioconnected san pedro to the rest of la the port helped make los angeles a great city it had for more than a hundred years so are we going to have to protect this crude from the la cops then they arent supposed to know about the tanker pitcavage said and then you wake up colin exclaimed the chief looked blank colin put it in words of one syllable what are the odds of that weve made the necessary arrangements pitcavage insisted how many bureaucrats had been persuaded to look the other way and keep their mouths shut how much had it cost if lapd does find out were liable to have a war on our hands colin meant it literally the to protect and to serve boys were as hard up for gasoline as anybody else if they found out this big shipment was coming into their port under their noses and all earmarked for other people thered be stereophonic hell to pay well thats one of the reasons i want you in charge of our part of the security chief pitcavage answered youve got the military experience we need to colins way of thinking a hitch in the navy didnt exactly equate him to general patton although one might work wonders for darren pitcavage he could see that saying so would do him less than no good though swallowing a sigh he asked this takes priority over everything pitcavage said flatly including the strangler case everything includes everything the chief said if we dont get our hands on this gas pretty soon well we chasing the damn strangler on skateboards and scooters it wasnt that bad colin knew it and pitcavage had to know it too civilians could still buysomegas but the price went up every day the supervolcano had wrecked refineries and pipelines the spasmodic nuclear war in the middle east had knocked production over the head if the south bay towns had to pay anything close to retail for the fuel their cops used they wouldnt be able to do much else thuscolin supposedthis skulduggery well ill do it he said the only possible reply and ill make damn sure ive got gabe sanchez right beside me however you want it something in pitcavages voice told colin hed just lost points with the chief gabe was too too unpolished that was the polite word to stand high on mike pitcavages goldstar list gabe didnt worry about it he loved his capo di tutti capi too colin didnt worry about it either if pitcavage needed him so bad hed have to live with gabe and he evidently did something else occurred to colin whatever weve bought the swat team in the way of heavy weapons i want that too the chief frowned plainly trying to remember i know weve got some military rifles thatll fire full auto we may have a real machine gun if we do nobodys taken it out of storage except maybe to clean it for a hell of a long time colin nodded he also couldnt remember the san atanasio pd hauling out a machine gun god the paperwork that would have taken but as the man said the times they were achangin no theyd achanged let me have the doorknocker too he said ill lead the parade with it there you go he actually made pitcavage grin you got it the doorknocker was a ford explorer armored against smallarms fire with a ram sticking out from the front of the hood and with vision slits and firing slits for the cops inside a doityourself armored car in other words it was ugly as sin but terrific for smashing down barricaded entryways to crack houses meth labs and lots of other places where the bad guys really didnt want company okay colin said anything but sure if it was let me get my people together and ill see what kind of toys we have in the playroom when does this tanker get in next tuesday the chief answered our convoy of trucks will exit the at braxton bragg boulevard youll meet them at the exit ramp and escort them west through the city before handing off to the hawthorne pd right colin had to hope it would be his opinion of the neighboring department was not high hawthorne was full of gangbangers and its cops were chronically underfunded im worrying about the lapd but theyll have to make sure the crips dont hijack our crude lord knows the crips get into all kinds of shit but i dont think they have a rogue refinery pitcavage grinned to show hed made a joke he thought he had anyhow the crips wouldnt have to turn the crude into gas and motor oil to get value for it all theyd have to do was steal it and threaten to light a match how big a ransom could they squeeze out of people if they did that big big big big colin could see as much could mike pitcavage it didnt seem so he might be able to make nice but he had all the imagination of a cherrystone clam well when he wore a uniform instead of giorgio armani he had the row of stars on either side of his collar he knew where to find a guy with imagination and knew how to give him orders which hed gone and done ill get on it colin said the first thing he did of course was tell gabe sanchez the sergeant pursed his lips and blew out through them it might have been a whistle without sound or an exhalation without a cigarette weve got the fix in good huh he said when colin finished sure sounds that way after a meditative moment colin added wed damn well better boy you can sing that in church gabe agreed the lapd doesnt know thing one about it huh not thing one and not thing two either how many times had colin read his kids the cat in the hat a zillion at least thats what the heap big boss says anyway could get interesting if hes wrong sanchez observed that also crossed my mind as a matter of fact i have the feeling it crossed mikes mind too which is why we meet the tanker trucks loaded for bear yeah gabe sounded enthusiastic he might have rough edges but he didnt know how to back up wonder what an lapd squad card look like after it ran into the doorknocker by the way he said it he couldnt wait to find out mm the idea is for the doorknocker to run into stuff not the other way around colin reminded him details details gabe waved that aside cant wait to see the la cops faces when they find out weve got the goods and they dont if everything works right they wont find out colin said gabe shrugged as if to note that everything never worked right tuesday dawned chilly and rainy as too many days in san atanasio had since the eruption if this was what seattle had been like before the supervolcano went off all the californicators whod moved to the northwest got what they deserved only now socal was getting it too rain or no rain colin and his armed party took their stations on the braxton bragg boulevard overpass to the harbor freeway waiting for the precious petroleum convoy to come up from the south gabe sanchez stood by the rail the hood to his plastic poncho shielding his face well enough to let him smoke colin had his own share of bad habits and then some he didnt know how hed missed tobacco but he had watching gabe crush one cigarette under his shoe and then light another he wondered what would have happened if people had discovered the filthy weed about instead of way the hell back when he didnt need to wonder long he was convinced governments all over the world would have outlawed it as a dangerous addictive drug and no doubt bad guys would be growing it on secret farms right this minute and making stacks of illegal cash off it thered be books and earnest concerned tv movies and obscene hiphop records glorifying the cigar dealer he shook his head gabe saw the motion whats up he asked breathing out smoke nothing colins speculation left him faintly embarrassed gabe would only guffaw just woolgathering before gabe could come up with any more blushworthy questions a uniformed cop called wont be long now theyre moving past the goodyear blimps mooring mast five ten minutes gotcha jimmy colin said tell em were ready and waiting as soon as they get off the freeway he walked over to another blackandwhite and asked the man inside anything interesting going on on the lapd frequencies monitoring the enemy was always a good idea when you were at war the san atanasio policeman wore headphones to help him monitor the radio without interference from the freeways unending whoosh and roar colin had to repeat his question louder the second time then the fellow answered everything seems pretty quiet maybe the fix really is in heres hoping colin still had trouble believing it he turned east toward the offramp the fuel trucks would use a couple of minutes later a torrance police carpart of the advance guard no doubtpulled off the cops inside waved when they saw the waiting san atanasio police officers colin waved back uhoh exclaimed the cop monitoring lapd radio traffic cars on the way to braxton bragg boulevard and the which was where they were and the entrance to the southbound freeway was west of the one coming up from san pedro they could block the tanker trucks if they got here soon enough the freeway ran through the la strip toothe lapd had all the jurisdiction here it needed here came the first precious tanker and here sirens screaming and light bars blazing came three lapd police cars sure as hell they positioned themselves to block the westbound lanes of braxton bragg boulevard uniformed men with riot guns piled out of them get out of the way colin yelled like hell we will an lapd man yelled back hefting his shotgun sonny we will fucking bury you if you dont get out of the way right now colin assured him waving toward the doorknocker as if on cue the machine gun theyd found in storage and mounted on it swung to cover the lapd man who wasnt wearing a helmet his bulletproof vest might stop a riflecaliber round but might wasnt something you really wanted to test you wouldnt dare the los angeles cops voice wobbled he wasnt altogether convinced they wouldnt colin was convinced he would a police force couldnt function without fuelmike pitcavage was dead right about that horses and bikes and shoe leather didnt cut it not in la county they didnt this is our oil well do whatever we need to do to keep it he answered the fuel trucks were piling up on the offramp the lapd guys would already be screaming for their swat team and other reinforcements get out of the way last warning well clear you out if you dont about then the lapd officer noticed that the san atanasio cops were toting ms not shotguns colin waved to the doorknocker again it rumbled forward with intent to squash you people are fucking insane the la cop bleated yeah and so colin answered the lapd guy called him something that would have made a cpo with twentyfive years in the navy blanch with far less time in the service colin only laughed on came the doorknocker inexorable as fate still swearing a very blue streak the lapd cop dove back into his squad car and got it out of the way just before the doorknocker did the job for him as the other lapd blackandwhites also opened a lane so the fuel trucks could go west young man colin posted armed san atanasio officers on the southbound offramp from the to braxton bragg boulevard make em run over you if they want to get past you he told his troopsthat was how he thought of them and if they look like they want to run over you shoot first got it got it the san atanasio cops roared in testosteronefueled unison colin hadnt taken any female officers on this particular run he wanted the headstrong craziness that could only come with a pair of balls it was maybe half a mile maybe a little less from the freeway to new hampshire avenue where the la strip ended and san atanasios jurisdiction actually began one by one the fuel trucks followed the doorknocker through the gap san atanasio cop cars went through too they looked a lot like lapd cars but the guys inside them were grinning the los angeles policemen ran the gamut from glum to homicidal san atanasio police cars looked a lot like las now oldtimers had told colin about a s experiment that for some reason didnt last the city painted its cars a color it called lime yellowa bureaucrats weaseling name for chartreuse and it slapped police on their sides in enormous diffractiongrating letters hed seen photos too but hed believed the oldtimers even without them some shit was just too weird to make up and a decade responsible for grand funk railroad would have to answer for limeyellow cop cars with rainbow letters as well after the last tanker truck rumbled off the freeway and through the lapds wouldbe roadblock colin turned to gabe sanchez and said piece of cake gabe scratched his thick bushy mustache la copsll call it a piece of something else he said with unusual delicacy too bad colin answered cmon lets go i want to be leading the parade again when we hand off to the hawthorne guys they got into their unmarked ford colin waved sweetly to the guys from the lapd as they went by at least three los angeles policemen flipped him off in reply he smiled even widerhe gave them a shiteating grin if the truth be knownand went right on waving as long as they didnt open fire on him everything was jake gabe drove with a splendid disregard for what little traffic there was whos gonna write me a ticket huh he demanded not me dude colin said at the border between san atanasio and hawthorne one of the latter towns finest asked him you get any trouble from lapd by the way one eyebrow quirked he already knew the answer well he would every lapd radio frequency would have been sulfurous and the hawthorne cops would have monitored the scanners just so they could stay informed of course yeah of course colin shrugged and jerked a thumb at the doorknocker they didnt want to see whether we really would have shot them up and knocked them out of the way the guy from hawthorne studied him i think they worked out the answer on their own maybe colin shrugged again the trucks are your babies now take good care of em tell the el segundo guys the same thing when you make the handoff will do the hawthorne officer promised like colin he wore a suit not too new and not too stylish if you became a cop to get rich and look cool you were more than a few boulders short of a rock pile or maybe you were mike pitcavage colin reported back to the elegant chief of the san atanasio pd after the hawthorne cops took charge of the fuel trucks on the other side of his flightdeck desk pitcavage nodded yeah that pretty much matches the complaint i got from lapd he said and then stood up and stuck out his hand good job colin he was manicured too colin noted as much as he shook with the chief just as youd expect pitcavage had a smooth firm grip sometimes us smalltown boys can surprise the city slickers colin said putting on a cornpone drawl there you go they want to draw you and quarter you and put your pieces at the city gates to warn off anybody else who gets ideas like that pitcavage said what did you tell em colin wondered if hed get thrown to the wolves a sacrifice to the great god petroleum but pitcavage answered i said if they wanted to try it theyd have to do me first thanks colin sounded less dry than usual yes hed wondered whether pitcavage would grab the chance to hang him out to dry hed been a rival for the leather swivel chair the chief sat in now he didnt want it any more but pitcavage didnt know that and probably wouldnt believe it if he found out ambitious himself hed always figure everybody else was too but here hed done everything a subordinate could want from his co after a momentary pause colin asked what did they say when you told em that they told me to fuck myself in the ass they said theyd drive spikes through a telephone pole and i could use that pitcavage grinned they were righteously pissed off i guess colin agreed if theyre that up in arms are they really so low on gas themselves theyre la for crying out loud they always get what they want not this time this time they get hind tit they arent used to it and they dont like it for beans pitcavage stuck out his hand again as colin took it the chief went on i wont forget the number you did on them either way to go that was dismissal even colin who didnt always notice hints got this one and took it leaving the chiefs inner sanctum he liked pitcavage better than he had for years if mike had a prick for a son it could happen to anybody colin knew that only too well rob and marshall werent perfect neither was vanessa and neither am i colin thought and neither is anybody else kelly looked up bemusedly at the ceiling of the benson hotels lobby it was a pretty fancy place all dark mellow wood and she had to look a long way up at the molded and gilded plaster on the ceiling the benson dated from when splendor by god was splendor across the street stood the colonnaded magnificence of the first national bank building which might almost have come to portland from the acropolis of athens she shivered not because she mourned the glory that was greece and the grandeur that was rome but because she was bloody cold theyd scheduled the american geologists conclave for december in northern oregon before the supervolcano erupted it must have seemed a good idea at the time now people kept saying los angeles was the new seattle kelly didnt think that was true but people kept saying it no matter what she thought going with it for the sake of argument that made portland the new well what seattle lay about miles north of la what was miles north of portland the end of the world was the first thing that occurred to kelly but shed actually checked on a map before she came up here on that same crappy scale of analogies portland was the new skagway alaska and it felt like it snow swirled through the air and drifted on the sidewalks heat was in short supply by law the only places where you could set your thermostat higher than fifty were schools and hospitals she wore the same clothes she would have taken to yellowstone in winter and she was glad to have them ice was forming on the willamette and even on the broad swiftflowing columbia when the assembled geologists werent giving papers or listening to them they did the same thing as every other group of conventioneers ever hatched they headed for the bar it was just off the lobby to the right of the glassandbronze revolving door that let you in booze didnt really warm you up but it made you feel as if it did which was often good enough and oregon was microbrew heaven even the new abbreviated growing season around here seemed to be enough to let barley mature behind the bar stood a rack of oregon reds and whites from before the eruption when those were gone theyd be gone for good oregon wasnt wine country any more and wouldnt be for nobody knew how many years to come and booze lubricated social gatherings kelly was halfway down a hoppy ipa when a friend of hers walked in she waved daniel olson nodded back he picked his way through the chattering crowd they hugged theyd both been plucked from yellowstone by helicopters just ahead of the supervolcano eruption along with two other rescued geologists kelly had crashed in his apartment in missoula till colin finagled a way out for her daniel ordered himself a pale ale too and clinked bottles with her did i hear you got married he said she spread the fingers on her left hand to show off the ring he nodded sweet and a job too atwhat is it dominguez state cal state dominguez yeah kelly agreed people said san francisco state and long beach state but cal state northridge and cal state dominguez or cal state dominguez hills why they did that she had no idea but they did she asked hows missoula these days do i want to know well its still there and still kind of in business which is more than you can say for most of montana daniel answered but everything that comes in comes from the west weve got electricity but no natural gas kelly nodded i remember when it went out the big pipe that fed missoula came to it across the rest of montana or rather it had come across montana now it lay squashed under god only knew how many feet of ash and dust and rock not much gasoline either daniel went on we chopped down a hell of a lot of trees to get through last winter and well chop down more this time around well regret it one of these days but people are too worried about not freezing now to give a damn about later welcome to america kelly said and the other geologist spread his hands in resigned agreement when this quarters balance sheet decided whether you got promoted you wouldnt care what happened a few years down the line and when it really was a choice between fuel in the fireplace and a missoula winter on steroids youd chop down the pines now and let the bare hillsides take care of themselves in the sweet bye and bye so when are you presenting your paper daniel asked morning session tomorrow kelly answered she was one of the worlds leading experts on everything that led up to the supervolcano blast passing on what she knew probably wont matter one goddamn bit she thought by the time another supervolcano went off odds were they wouldnt understand english any more and even if they did you couldnt do anything about a supervolcano eruption anyhow ill be there daniel promised kelly gulped a little daniel knew as much about the yellowstone supervolcano as she did at least partly to soften him up she said you want to have breakfast tomorrow sure and when we talk shop in the restaurant downstairs everybody can look at us like were nuts daniel clucked and caught himself nah most of the people in therell be nuts the same way we are say half past eight sounds good im scheduled for ten thirty thatll give us plenty of time to eat and then i can be nervous afterwards kelly knew she was kidding on the square shed critiqued other peoples papers before but this was her first big presentation on her own the room would be packed too there wasnt anything more urgent in the field and there wouldnt be for years maybe centuries to come okay i know that song daniel grinned crookedly hed snagged a tenuretrack job at montana state while she was still in grad school had she been jealous oh just a little especially since he was younger than she was now he went on lets meet in the lobby that way whoever gets here first can gawp at the ceiling till the other one shows you do that too oh good i wondered if i was the only one isnt it over the top kelly said as it happened neither one of them beat the other they rode down in the same elevator a couple of people were eating breakfast in the hotel restaurant but only a couple a sharpfaced officious middleaged woman in a fuzzy orange sweater waved away other wouldbe customers we cant serve you now she said were setting up for sunday brunch we dont want brunch we just want breakfast kelly protested there are people in there daniel added we cant take you now the woman in the orange sweater repeated and she would not be moved dejected decaffeinated and pissed off kelly and daniel walked up the stairs to the ornate lobby where can we get something to eat in this miserable town kelly growled at a desk clerk your restaurant seems to be under a curse a curse in an orange sweater daniel agreed the clerk blinked but she said theres the original a block up sixth lets go kelly said grimly out the revolving door they strode kelly was wearing long johns and damn glad shed put them on the wind had knives in it snow crunched under her shoes it drifted here and there not many cars were on the street chains made the ones that were rattle as they slowly went by it was more like a scene from duluth than anything anyone would have looked for in portland before the eruption decor in the original lived up to its name the paintings on the walls were of clowns and mayonnaise jarstogether not separately contemplating what use the swarms of bozoids might have for all that best foods made kelly queasy coffee and ham and eggs and hash browns worked wonders though daniel had sausage and eggs instead when they were finishing up he took his iphone out of his pocket to check the time kelly looked a question at him nine forty he said unless the grizzlies carry us off between here and the benson youre golden okay thanks for a while there i was too mad at that orange bitch to worry about what im going to say you know kelly said maybe i owe her something after all a kick in the teeth daniel suggested id love to people might talk though kelly sighed as if to say there was no accounting for societys foibles when the tattooed waiter brought the check she grabbed it daniel started to squawk but she cut him off hey how long did i spend at your place after things blew up i dunno but i bet it seemed like forever he answered which wasnt so far wrong even so he let her put it on her visa they walked back to the benson through the arctic chill kelly changed into business attire pants hid the long underwear a wool turtleneck under a jacket kept her top half tolerably warm she grabbed the manila folder that held the paper and headed down the hall to the elevator again the packed function room intimidated her less than shed feared it would standing up and lecturing her dominguez hills classes had burned the fear of public speaking out of her and shed have a much more interested audience here than she did there her chairperson introduced her as somebody who knows the yellowstone supervolcano better than anyone if shed been any closer to it when it did erupt she wouldnt be here talking to us now geoff rheinburg might have been stretching the first part of that he sure wasnt kidding about the second half kelly had to adjust the mike at the lectern before she started talking rheinburg was several inches taller than she was i am glad to be hereand you can take that any way you want she said in the second row daniel nodded emphatically he knew how she felt all right and yes larry skrtel and ruth marquez were here too farther back in the crowd theyd also got out in the nick of time and they were sitting side by side now which was or at least might be interesting interesting later now was business time kelly talked about everything the supervolcano had done in the runup to the eruption the earthquakes all the way back to hebgen lake in the rising magma domes the hot springs and geysers picking up the premonitory volcanic outbursts in the southwest and northeast parts of yellowstone and finally the big kaboom even by supervolcano standards it proved to be a large eruption not quite the size of the one million years ago but close she said climatic effects have proved at least as severe as the models predicted her shiver underlined that even with all these bodies in the room it was bloody cold she went on so have other environmental impacts geologists did everything they could to alert the authorities to what a supervolcano eruption would mean the authorities unfortunately didnt want to listen to us at the time i was furious in retrospect i dont think it mattered much during the last big recession before the eruption there was a lot of talk about companies and banks that were too big to fail the yellowstone supervolcano was a disaster too big to let us succeed no matter what we did or didnt do we were going to get overwhelmed we grew up in the golden age its gone it wont come back for decades or lifetimes if it ever does it wasnt anything her audience didnt already know theyd known it before the supervolcano went off which was more than the rest of the world could say but hearing it backed up with all the data kellyd presented was sobering all the same when she asked for questions the ones she got were mostly technicalabout the order and intensity of the precursor signs about possible steps the government might have taken and what those could have accomplished and the like it was all academic and everybody knew it yellowstone wasnt the only supervolcano the one on sumatra deserved careful watching and so did the one on the kamchatka peninsula there was even one near mono lake in eastern california but none of the others seemed likely to erupt for thousands of years the midwest had drawn the short straw this time around well so had the whole planet professor rheinburg beamed at kelly as things broke up good job very solid he clapped his hands with no sound thanks she gathered up her papers im just glad its over i always feel that way and ive been doing this about as long as youve been alive he said so hows your job terrific she replied having one was terrific she had no doubt he was responsible for it he didnt let on he never had hows everything else hows your life how do you like being married so far so good better than so good kelly said one day at a time that was how you did anything vi thunk the axe bit into the pine log rob ferguson raised it and let it fall again little by little trees turned into firewood you could work up a sweat chopping wood even in a maine winter and the way maine winters were these days that was really saying something thunk rob got the axe to do what he wanted now when hed first started with it hed counted himself lucky for not amputating anyone elses fingers or his own leg these days it was just a toola tool you had to respect sure but a tool all the same thunk biff came out of the trebor mansion inn he held up his left wrist to display a windup watch rob wore one too theyd had electricity through what was laughably called the summer in these parts but it was out again now that the ice age had returned without it they had no cell coverage and without coverage their phones were nothing but little plastic bricks to amplify the message biff said town meetings in half an hour gotcha rob swung the axe again another billet of what would be firewood jumped from the log biff eyed it and the ones lying in the snow nearby they were all of pretty much the same size and shape dude youre getting to be like conan the barbarian with that thing the rhythm guitarist jerked a mittened thumb at the axe practice makes pregnant same as with anything else rob hefted his implement of destruction what i think is its goddamn funny to be using a genuine axe for a change instead of he mimed pulling hot licks from a guitar axe axe yeah biff grinned you took the nickname for your instrument for granted until you did a compareandcontrast with the real craftsman article rob went on chopping wood for another ten minutes or so you had to earn your keep all right as soon as the power failed guilford and the rest of maine north of the interstate fell back in time to the land of currier and ives what those nostalgiafilled prints didnt tell you was how much goddamn work that nineteenthcentury life took you had to find that out for yourself rob had and his hands had new ridges of callus to prove it he walked to the town meeting with the other guys from squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles and with dick barber and the swarm of his relations who lived on the family side of the inn theyd had a couple of paying customers when some of the snow melted but only a couple given that the alltime high summer temperature was sixtyone degrees and that it snowed on august ten days after that tropical afternoon having any paying guests at all approached the miraculous barber didnt seem to worry about it are they going to foreclose on me and toss me out in the snow he asked and answered his own question i dont think so that kind of crap is all over at least for now half the country isnt making any mortgage payments now probably more hell there are whole states where nobodys making any mortgage payments he was bound to be right about that nobody was living in wyoming for instance much less keeping the bank happy about the loan on the condo montana colorado and idaho were almost as badly screwed and it got better only in relative terms as you moved farther away from what had been yellowstone national park and was now the worlds biggest hottest hole in the ground the unwritten rule was that everybody shoveled the snow off the sidewalk in front of his own house or shop the snow that got shoveled went into the street back in the day plows had kept the roads cleared theyd mostly given up on that now if you wanted to go from town to town in wintertime now you could take a sleigh or ski or snowshoe children and people like the guys from the band amended the unwritten rule if you were an old man with heart trouble or a woman with a bad back you didnt shovel your own walk you gave somebody something to do it for you food or warm clothes or firewood or sometimes even cash even with the roads opening up in the alleged summer it was an economy of scarcity things counted for more than money did and rob had got some of his calluses with a snow shovel biff ducked into calebs country kitchen and came out with the waitress hed fallen for cindy was a short brunette who hardly ever said anything that had to appeal to biff rob and justin and charlie were all full of themselves and full of their own opinions so was dick barber with cindy biff could get a few words of his own in edgewise caleb the guy who ran and cooked for the diner also came out he turned the sign on the front door to closed wont do no business till the meetins over anyways he said hed stayed open where the subway more dependent on outside supplies went under he raised chickens and a couple of pigs and cooked lots of eggs that improved the overall level of his cuisine eggs were harder to screw up than some of the things that had been on the menu guilford held its town meetings in the episcopalian church one of the few buildings big enough for the crowds everybody came no one made noises about the separation of church and state locals nodded to the guys in the band as they came up they were tolerated just fine though theyd stay outsiders forever dick barber had lived here for years he remained an outsider too though not one who was shy about speaking his mind as far as rob could see dick wasnt shy about anything a fancy sleigh was hitched outside the church rob turned accusingly on barber why didnt you tell us jim was in town because i didnt know till just now barber answered with a broadshouldered shrug the landlines out i can do all kinds of things but i dont read minds itll liven up the meeting anyway charlie said and no one was rash enough to try to contradict him they walked inside boy anybodyd think there were people here or something justin made like phil collins i can feel it in the air tonight feel it wasnt quite right but that didnt mean it wasnt in the air regular baths and showers were modern luxuries that had gone by the wayside along with so much else if you wanted to get clean you heated a basin of water over your fire and washed one body part at a time till the stuff in the basin got too frigid to stand if you had the patience to do that once a week you were about average rob didnt notice how he smelled when he was by himself he hardly noticed how the other people at the trebor mansion inn smelled either hed got used to them but he sure did notice a whole bunch of strangers gathered together in one place he noticed them for about five minutes anyhow after that his nose forgot about them when everybody was funky nobody was funky the mayor of guilford was a stocky middleaged fellow named josh mccann he also ran the local independent hardware store rob gathered that before the eruption it had been one step this side of a junk shop and a small step at that since the supervolcano blew up and maine north of the interstate was mostly forgotten by the rest of the country junk and being able to do things with junk suddenly became worth their weight in goldsometimes even worth their weight in pork spare ribs swaddled in a bulky wool sweater mccann took his place at the pulpit where the minister usually stood he brought down his gavel once twice three times people packing the pews quieted down the way they would have at a church service democracy here was a secular faith and the folks took it much more seriously than they did in socal these towns were small enough that everyone knew or knew about everyone else money and slick advertising didnt matter the way they did in the big city meeting will come to order the mayor rasped in a twopackaday voice rob wondered how his habit was holding up tobacco had as much trouble getting here as everything else did mccann went on first order of business is a little talk by jim farrell hes come a ways to call so it seems only fair to let him speak his piece rob snorted under his breath nor was his the only amused or dubious voice rising to the heavensor at least to the rafters the next little talk from farrell would be the first he was a retired professor of greek and roman history whod moved back to maine after teaching for a million years at suny albany he was used to speaking in front of other people in other words and he was a man of strong opinions and far from shy about letting the world know what they were not long before the eruption hed run for congress up here as a republican hed got trounced dick barber had helped run his campaign and still grumbled about the way it turned out the winner a lawyer with an expensive haircut farrells words was down in washington where it was well warmer anyhow maybe he was doing what he could for his district you never could tell what he could do in this ravaged ravished country seemed vanishingly small farrell whod stayed behind was the biggest cheese north and west of the interstate the other difference was the lawyer knew bureaucracy and politics and policy when the federal government touched this part of maine only while the roads were open and when they hadnt been open much this year he became a cipher jim farrell knew useful things like which root vegetables had the shortest growing seasons and how to salt trout or make sauerkraut he knew and he talked oh yeshe talked and talked and talked some more he got to his feet now instead of the more common stocking cap he wore a snapbrim fedora his pearlgray topcoat was of a cut reckoned elegant when fdr decided we had nothing to fear but fear itself some years before he was born in other words he wasnt young but he wasnt so old as that he was a dandy with antique tastes he had a ruddy irish face with a pointed nose and bushy eyebrows the first time rob met him the winter before hed been reminded of a smaller version of john madden but only till farrell opened his mouth madden had a mouth full of gravel jim farrells baritone was a very different instrument he spoke in sentences that parsed and paragraphs where the sentences followed logically one upon another that should have ruled out a successful political career for him and as a matter of fact it hadtill the supervolcano erupted here we are again he said as he took mccanns place at the pulpit here we are again all right in this the second winter of our discontent the first one was pretty easy as these things go we chopped down the trees that stood closest and we shot the nearest and stupidest moose people chuckled it wasnt that farrell was saying anything that wasnt so theyd done exactly that the winter before theyd got by with it too until things thawed out enough to remind the wider world for a little while that they were there im serious farrell insisted or as serious as im likely to get anyhow im serious and the situation is liable to turn critical if we dont want to end up burning down our houses to keep warm and eating long pig so we dont starve wed better do some planning first rob wondered how many of the men and women in the crowd understood what long pig was sitting next to him justin quirked an eyebrow so he got it well justin knew all kinds of weird things knowing weird things was his specialty maybe even more than playing guitar and dick barber also grinned out of one side of his mouth but he too was a man of parts even if not all of them worked all the time and he would have heard more from farrell than anybody for most of these folks though long pig would be caviar to the general then rob wondered how many people here knew about caviar to the general and then he quit worrying about crap like that and listened to farrell some more got to organize and share what we can gather the retired history prof was saying if we dont hang together you can be sure we will hang separately that was ben franklin before rob could even start to wonder how many people in the church knew that much somebody called i thought you were a republican not a goddamn commie farrell beamed he loved hecklers mostly because he loved demolishing them before mayor mccann could gavel the loudmouth out of order farrell waved for him not to bother right this minute i think moscow and beijing and pyongyang are a little too cold themselves to worry about maine north of the interstate he got his laugh having got it he went on at least i dont think north korea has a rocket that will reach all the way to such a dangerous place as guilford that won him another one washington doesnt worry about us either weve seen that and i am a republican so i say thats a good thing more often than not i dont want big brother watching me but i also dont want my friends and neighbors squabbling like the kilkenny cats and i dont want them starving or freezing either if we can take care of ourselves we wont need to cry because big brothers falling down on the job all politics is local but some is more local than others for about nine months out of the year maybe more ours looks as though its going to be about as local as it gets he went on to talk about schemes for using the gasoline and fuel oil they did have and about organizing hunts and woodcutting parties he talked about parsnips and mangelwurzels and andean potatoes that ripened faster than the varieties of spuds maine had been famous for what the hell is a mangelwurzel rob whispered to justin you grab a wurzel and you hurt it real bad justin explained so he had no clue either none of this will be exciting farrell finished but were not talking about excitement now excitement is for good times its a luxury were talking about survival survival is what well be talking for the rest of my life for the rest of your lives and probably for the rest of your childrens and grandchildrens lives i dont think washington has figured that out yet but it looks pretty obvious here doesnt it nobody not even the guy whod yelled at him tried to tell him he was wrong no one applauded when farrell stepped away from the pulpitthe bully pulpit rob thoughteither the thoughtful silence he got seemed higher praise than any mere handclapping could have been and the agenda items following his talk seemed even duller than they might have otherwise after the town meeting adjourned rob waded through the crowd around jim farrell and waited his turn to talk when it finally came he asked why arent the feds paying more attention to us were hit harder than any place that didnt get covered in ash well for one thing a lot of places did get covered in ash farrell replied and rob nodded the older man continued and washington is out for what it can get much more than it is for what it can give from us that means its out for nothing you cant get blood from a turnip or from a mangelwurzel so washington shines the light of its countenance on the places that are still warm or at least warmer that made more sense than rob wished it did he was less convinced than farrell that being forgotten about by washington was a good thing but he wasnt nearly so sure it was a bad thing as he had been when squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles first got stuck in guilford he let someone else talk to farrell and walked out into the sharptoothed cold outside it was dark outside the church toono working streetlamps rob stepped on somebodys foot before hed gone very far sorry he said wondering who his victim was no damage came the reply a womans voice she couldnt see him either because she asked who are you rob im one of the fellows staying at the mansion inn oh from the band she said you guys are good even acoustic i like it when you play in the park by the river i go whenever i can cool rob replied a fanhe recognized enthusiasm when he heard it but which fan um whom i talking to oh im lindsey kincaid i teach chemistry at piscataquis community secondary school she answered that was the high school not far from the inn rob sortakinda knew who she was the way he sortakinda knew an awful lot of people here about his age halfway between blonde and brunette not half bad all thing considered how much considering did he feel like where do you live he asked can i walk you back there wherever it is if she said no he wouldnt get shot down too badly but she said okay and sounded pleased saying it so maybe hed find out how much considering he felt like attention attention may i have your attention please when a man with a bullhorn shouted for your attention you gave it to him whether you wanted to or not he didnt even have to say please vanessa ferguson wondered why he bothered vestigial politeness was her guess like the human tailbone it was shrunken and useless but the fema guy out there still had that little bit he blared away camp constitution is being adversely impacted by the floodtype conditions currently obtaining in this geographical location that was so bad vanessa almost liked it she couldnt imagine a more bureaucratic way to say the flood here is screwing camp constitution to the wall things had been bad the spring before ash and dust covered the basins of the rivers that flowed into the mississippi from the west she still remembered what a poolservice guy had told her mother when she was a kid your pool is the lowest part of your yard lady anything that can get into it goddamn well will hed had a cigarette twitching in the corner of his mouth and he was tanned as cordoban leather these days he was probably dead of melanoma or lung cancer which didnt make him wrong the rivers were the lowest parts of their big back yards too theyd flooded last year from all the volcanic crud rain and melting snow and wind dumped into them now they were doing it again still more crud going into riverbeds that hadnt yet got rid of everything from the year before and so the riversincluding the mississippi itself which was after all the ultimate channel for half a continents worth of gunkwere spilling over their banks and spreading out across the countryside it wasnt dramatic the way the tsunamis in indonesia and japan had been there werent huge speeding walls of water smashing everything in their path but in the end how much difference did that make whether you went under with a smash or merely a dispirited glub under you went evacuation procedures are likely to become necessary for implementation in the nearly immediate future the flunky with the bullhorn bellowed not just an evacuation mind you but evacuation procedures that made it official to say nothing of officious gather your belongings and prepare to be in compliance with all instructional directives national guard personnel will assist in ensuring prompt satisfaction of requirements theyll shoot you if you dont do what we tell you they would too the national guard had opened fire in the camp several times like vanessa lots of refugees were armed but not many had assault rifles or body armor or military discipline the guard outclassed them what the fuck they gonna do to us now grumbled a middleaged black man a couple of tiers of bunks over from vanessa waddaya think jack a woman said in tones that came from long island or possibly the jersey shore theyre gonna do whatever they damn well wanna and that was about the size of it vanessa hoped the waters would close over micah husak she hoped crawdads and sticklebacks and little fish whose names she didnt even know would pick out his dead eyes and nibble the rotting flesh off his toesand off his dick all the while she understood it was a hopeless hope that kind of shit didnt happen to the people who ran camps it happened to the people who wound up stuck in them gathering her belongings didnt take long everything she owned fit in her purse and in a dark green garbage bag that seemed fitting enough and then some because most of what she owned was garbage off in the distance an m barked a quick professional threeround burst whoeverd been giving some guardsman grief would just have discovered hed made his last dumbass mistake or maybe he was too high on crank even to notice he was dead methamphetamines and weed fired people up and mellowed them out all over the camp the yahoo with the bullhorn ordered the people in the tent next to vanessas out to comply with his instructional directives the middleaged black guy moaned i didnt used to think there was no place worsen this he said but what you want to bet they went and found one made one vanessa corrected the difference sounded tiny but seemed profound to her then half an hour later the bellor the bullhorntolled for them tent b inmates assemble outside the entrance in a singlefile line the guy with it boomed vanessa wondered if he would lead them to the department of redundancy department she didnt make the joke she didnt think anyone else in good old tent b would get it too bad but there you were and here she was nervouslooking guardsmen held their rifles in positions from which they could open up in a hurry there were a lot of them how much trouble had they had evacuating other great big tents quite a bit by all the signs follow me toward the transportation that will transport you to the new provisional facilities bullhorn boy continued obey all commands immediately that was so plain it could only mean dont screw with meor else off they went at a retarded shuffle garbage sacks slung over their shoulders up ahead people were slowly filing onto buses ancient enough to have carried kids back in the days when southern schools were still segregated vanessa made up her mind right there that she didnt want to get transported to any provisional facility camp constitution was bad a halfassed version would only be worse they said it couldnt be done but as often as not they didnt know what they were talking about this looked like one of those times off to one side stood a much shorter row of newer less decrepit buses the people getting into those also seemed newer and less decrepit than the ones boarding the wrecks toward which vanessa was heading pointing at the newer buses she asked one of the guardsmen whats up with those he was a squarely built blocky fellow with beard stubble so dark and thick he probably had to shave twice a day oh those are for the reclamation parties he answered huh vanessa said brilliantly reclamation parties the guardsman repeated you know to go into the country the eruption fucked over and scavenge stuff from it and start cleaning it up so its like worth something again how do i get on one of those buses vanessa asked if you were cleaning up the countryside you werent living in a camp not living in a camp seemed the most wonderful thing in the world to her the way el dorado must have to the conquistadors the guy looked at her you shoulda signed a volunteer sheet they went around like weeks ago sign one i never even saw one vanessa yipped she wondered if that was so all kinds of stupid administrative papers circulated through the tents and fema trailers like most of the other poor slobs stuck in camp constitution she ignored them if shed ignored the wrong one shed just screwed herself to the wall but even if saying shed never seen one might not be true it was definitely truthy she sure hadnt paid attention to one if you didnt sign up you cant go on those buses you gotta get on these ones instead the guardsman pointed in the direction she was already going with the muzzle of his assault rifle full of helpless longing vanessa stared at the newer buses helpless god helped those who helped themselves id do anything to get on one of those buses she said in a low breathy voice she didnt remember using since before she threw out her last boyfriend if she hadnt taken care of micah husak that way chances were she would have kept quiet but after youd done it once the second time turned out to be a lot easier she had a weapon and shed use it the way the guardsman would use the m if he needed to he understood what she was offering all right well he didnt exactly need to be phi beta kappa to figure it out yeah he said as people not so young not so cute and maybe not so desperate trudged past so they could go from a godawful camp to one that had to be even worse yeah vanessa said the fish had taken the bait joebob keep an eye on the parade her guardsman said to the fellow next to him then he turned back to her cmon in here in here was into a tent that had already been evacuated he beckoned to her as he undid his fly lets just make it quick okay okay she got down in front of him blowing him was better than fucking him she wouldnt have to worry about dressing againor about getting knocked up he would have been better right after a shower but he could have been worse too and it would be quick she could tell as soon as she started yeah babe he muttered shoving his hips forward and thrusting deeper into her mouth coughing she pulled away a little then went back to what she was doing he was about to go off just when she was going to jerk away so hed spurt on the ground he grabbed her head and held her to him while he came in her mouth it was as bad as she remembered she gagged and choked and almost puked on his sandcolored army boots all right he said as he let her go eyes watering she spat out as much of the gross sticky stuff as she could he chuckled and ran his hand through her hair affection now not brute strength why shouldnt he feel affectionate shed given him what he wanted you better hustle if youre gonna get on the reclamation bus he told her you bet i am she said grimly she spat again as she climbed to her feet and brushed dirt off the knees of her jeans the guardsman chuckled some more he could afford to think it was funny he hadnt been on the receiving end she fled the tent and hustled toward the newer buses before she realized they hadnt even found out each others names that came closer to the famous zipless fuck than shed ever dreamt shed get she hadnt got fucked though she literally hadnt even got kissed she spat one more time before she got into the boarding line she wished for a jug of scope but wishing failed to produce one the taste lingered as she took her place the woman in front of hera gal about her own agegave her a curious look but didnt say anything a man with a clipboard was making checkmarks on the paper it held a roster sheet vanessas heart sank if shed sucked off that national guard asshole for nothing ferguson she said with more confidence than she felt he frowned you arent on the list im supposed to be she declaredagain at least truthy if not true he inspected her was she going to have to do him too pretty soon shed be swimming out to meet troopships if she wasnt careful but all he said was well get on were a couple people short and you look like you can do the work ferguson your name was thats right vanessa thank you she didnt usually dole out gratitude so casually but she made an exception here as the man added her to the roster she happily hopped into the bus she didnt care where it took her she was out of camp constitution at last when marshall ferguson wasnt babysitting his little halfbrother he had the family house pretty much to himself his father went to the cop shop early every morning and kellymarshall couldnt think of her as a stepmom not when she was as close to his age as to his old mansheaded for csudh not a whole lot later peace quiet if he wanted to make like a writer all he had to do was sit in front of the screen and let the words pour out in theory anyhow theory was wonderful practice he was discovering was a little different yeah just a little theory was all about inspiration and how to court it as he was discovering practice turned out to involve a lot more of figuring out what the hell you did after the fickle bitch upped and left you because she damn well would inspiration had launched marshall into a couple of stories that seemed like surefire winners inspiration took him words into one of them maybe words into the other then he had to work out what happened next and what if anything it meant and he had to work out how to put it across without being obvious or boring somehow neither of those masterpieces of western literature ever got finished but marshall did finish one piece he started with no inspiration whatsoever well almost none his fathers dubious stare at the dinner table every evening kept marshall busy where art and brilliance failed to serve stubbornness and craft got him to the end then he had to put the story on the market being forced to submit by professor bolger at ucsb was one of the best things that ever happened to him hed started early on getting hardened to rejection the prof said straightout that some people would rather submit to a root canal than to an editor marshall had never had a root canal but he understood the feeling hed sold a story during that quarter which freaked him and the prof almost equally but you didnt sell every time and getting rejected sucked he tried to think of it like dating if you didnt hit on girls youd never get laid yeah sometimes they shot you down that didnt mean you didnt pick yourself up and ask somebody else out it might not even mean you didnt try again with the girl whod told you no before or with the market that told you no marshalls stubborn story went out and came back five times before it found a home at a web site that put the munificent sum of two and a half cents a word in his paypal account two and a half cents a word wouldnt make anybody rich marshall knew that only too well in case he didnt his father rubbed his nose in it i dont think youll have tom clancy or bill gates trimming your oleanders any time soon right marshall said and then pass the potatoes please was dad cynical because hed been a cop for too long or had he become a cop because he was already cynical could you answer all of the above that was how it looked to marshall he sold it kelly said two and a half cents a word is better than nothing its more than ive ever got for an article in academic publishing all they give you is the glory of your name in printusually with a raft of coauths yeah well youre advancing human knowledge colin ferguson said not just he stopped short bullshitting marshall suggested you said it i didnt dad wouldnt either not with kelly across the table from him which didnt mean he wasnt thinking it kelly was less touchy about that kind of thing than her husband god knows theres plenty of bullshit in the academic journals she said how about the ones for criminal justice one reason you had to respect dad was that he would fess up when you caught him out well youve got me there he admitted now you read those things youd think we caught every perp and that about day after tomorrow we can talk all the bad guys into staying good guys and put ourselves out of business forever he smiled crookedly and rain makes applesauce is that what they call pie in the sky marshall had run into the phrase but he wasnt sure exactly how it worked his father nodded thats what they call it all right come the revolution they used to say then the revolution came and things were just as nasty afterwards as they were before meet the new boss same as the old boss he got that from some old rock song all animals are equal but some are more equal than others kelly said which sounded like agreement it also sounded familiar thats from animal farm marshall exclaimed i had to read it in western civ its by the guy who wrote back when seemed a long way away it seemed a long way away to him toolost in the distant past like and and and the we got wasnt too great but it was better than the one orwell wrote about dad said if you say so marshall answered he had no memories of kelly would have been a little kid back then so she wouldnt remember much either for dad it seemed to feel like the week before last getting old having all that stuff to remember to try and keep track of had to be a terrible thing thinking about what a terrible thing it was and trying to work out exactly what kind of terrible thing it was must have shown on marshalls face kelly murmured hes getting an idea for a story or indigestion one but dad didnt sound disgusted coming out with snide cracks was as much a reflex with him as breathing was all the other cops marshall knewand he naturally knew more cops than most stoners ever wanted totalked the same way it had to help shield them from some of the nasty shit they ran into on the job well marshall stood up he paid renta third of what he grossed not netted grossed between babysitting and writing he wasnt grossing one whole hell of a lot but he was a cash customer so his old man didnt ride him too hard with most of his high school buddies scuffling even harder than he was he didnt feel embarrassed about living at home misery really did love company he went up to his room he kept it tolerably clean and neat hed learned how taking care of himself at ucsb it wasnt so much for his sake like a lot of young males on their own he didnt mind living like a slob what guys didnt mind though grossed girls out some guys were too dumb to learn from failure and frustration marshall wasnt no one in the house minded if he brought a girl upstairs no one was going to pound on the door with the crimescene tape while he had company things could have been worse he kept telling himself as much he kept looking at apartments too unfortunately landlords were less adaptable about rent than dad was earbuds and his ipod made the outside world go away or they would have but the first song that came out was from squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles a strange droning chant called justinian ii an emperor of byzantium who got his nose chopped off listening to it reminded marshall how much he missed his older brother he hadnt seen rob since before the supervolcano blew maine omg maine was the devils personal icebox these days in the song justinian ii came to a bad end singing about it justin nachman sounded unwholesomely amused he had a knack for that something more innocuous but less evocative shuffled onto the ipod next marshall closed his eyes and listened after a while he shut it off and started noodling on a story not much inspiration no maybe perspiration would do one thing sure the elves wouldnt write it for him no matter how much he wished they would wondering why they didnt make elves the way they used to he soldiered on once he finished the first draft he could read it over and see just what he had or if he had anything at all vii dwip dwip dwip bryce miller didnt know whether everybody who worked for the department of water and power sounded like elmer fudd impersonating a leaky faucet he did know he wasnt the only one though and he knew the noise fit the weather much too well the dirtygray heavens dwipped dwizzle as he pedaled his bicycle toward the bus stop he couldnt afford to drive downtown not with gas through the roof and into the ionosphereand not with most stations showing red flags to let people know they had no gas at any price long long linesold farts talked about marked the ones with a little to sell it wasnt supposed to rain in la in june not even a little bit well it hadnt been supposed to mother nature was reading a new rulebook these days bryce rode on keeping a wary eye out for cars not so many of them on the road these days and a lot more bikes like his some of the people on the twowheelers were as nonchalant as if theyd been doing it for years a few might even actually have been doing it before the eruptiona few but not many others looked as if theyd borrowed some kids bike they almost remembered how to handle bryce figured he fit somewhere in the middle it was his bike and he had ridden it before the supervolcano blew he hadnt ridden it to work though and he wouldnt have ridden it in the rain biking was supposed to be fun right the bus stop on braxton bragg boulevard had a big new parking rack bolted to the sidewalk next to the bench bryce chained his bike to the steel the stop like a lot of others also had a new armed guard a guy who looked as if he was recently back from combat on distant shores and had had trouble finding work here in the states bryce nodded to him the guard gravely dipped his head in response no he wouldnt have got that polite anywhere but in the military other people already stood at the stop bryce nodded to them too he saw a lot of them several times a week the rather cute hispanic chick the hulking black guy the asian fellow who never quit texting theyd been regulars on this route longer than he had up grumbled the bus people stepped away from the curb as it neared not wanting to get splashed the doors hissed open they filed aboard the black guy found a seat then lifted his hat he had a half pint of southern comfort under there sudden discomfort bryce thought remembering a collection of mad magazine pieces older than he was but still funny the guy took a quick knock then stowed the booze again the bus took off a couple of blocks later of course it stopped again more people got on by the time it reached the red line station near the harbor freeway it was packed most of the passengers climbed off there bryce among them he got his ticket from the automated kiosk he felt automated himself once youd done it a couple of times boarding took next to no conscious thought he walked out onto the platformwhich did boast a roofand waited for the next train to pull in along with the other commuters he got on when it did the train headed north toward downtown the tracks ran along the middle of the in other words they went straight through south central la peoplemost of them either africanamerican or hispanicgot on and off at several stops bryce kept his head down and his nose buried in the times like most white kids raised not far from south central hed heard a lot about the areanone of it goodand had gone there never the most horror hed experienced on the train was a couple of guys a little younger than he was yelling at each other in spanish the yells soon subsided to dirty looks neither young man pulled out a glock and shot up the car or seemed likely to yells and glares bryce could live with no yells today nobody even fired up a joint that happened now and again although you werent supposed to smoke anything inside the train funnyhed never seen anybody light up an ordinary cigarette people always waited till they got off for that harder to wait to get baked evidently he left the train and headed for the dwp building skyscraperssome office complexes others hotelsturned the streets into corridors his mother and colin ferguson talked about their childhood days when for fear of earthquakes city hall was the only building allowed to rise higher than twelve stories modern architects and engineers had convinced the powers that be that their efforts would stay up no matter what the san andreas fault did even if they were right bryce wouldnt have wanted to be where he was when the big one hit the skyscrapers might not topple sure as hell though razorsharp spears of glass would rain down from their sides and the glass would slice anybody walking along here into hamburger in nothing flat hey guy a homeless woman of indeterminate age tried to look alluring what she looked was skinny and dirty and strung out desperate in other words youd have to be even more desperate yourself to want to go to bed with her but turning tricks was probably the only way she could get the cash for whatever drugs had washed her up on lifes lee shoreand maybe if she was lucky for a little food too bryce walked by as if she werent there he wasnt particularly proud of it but what could you do stinking fairy she whined after him he could see the logical fallacy that was what he got for doing classics in grad school just because he didnt want her that didnt mean he didnt want any woman plato would have tried to convince this gal that shed understood the flaw in her own thinking all along she wasnt likely to care much for philosophy though all she cared about was the next fix and if she could wound him a little for ignoring her charms such as they were so much the better no doubt shed come on to someone else in a little while and then cuss him out too dwp headquarters wasnt in a skyscraper just an ordinary blocky office building at the edge of the fancyshmancy builtup area you could walk past it without noticing it was there no doubt thousands of people did every day bryce would have if hed worked anywhere else he showed his id to the security guard at the front entrance the man had been seeing him five days a week for several months now but still carefully inspected it only after he was satisfied did he nod and say morning dr miller morning hank bryce didnt know how hank knew he had his piled higher and deeper he didnt go around calling himself dr miller as far as he was concerned doctor was the right title for mds dentists and veterinarians people with phds who glommed on to it were pompous asses that wasnt the dwp mindset here if you had a doctorate you flaunted it like a wellbuilt girl in a spandex tank top somebody must have tipped hank off about bryces sheepskin he became dr miller to people here almost in selfdefense even if he didnt use the title himself otherwise he would have seemed like a security guard he climbed the stairs to the fourth floor have to keep my girlish figure he thought vaguely he didnt boast one of the offices with windows around the outside of the building nope he had himself a cubicle with fuzzy walls in a big room in the middle straight out of dilbertland jay black was already hard at it in the skinner box next to bryces he was a computer whiz a balding fortyish guy who wondered why he had trouble finding a girl he liked because all youre looking for is a twentyfiveyearold supermodel didnt seem to have crossed his mind finding one who also appreciated the fine points of iphone appwriting to say nothing of a crossstitched sampler on the wall that read cubicle sweet cubicle would take some doing he looked up from what bryce hoped was his first mountain dew of the day sugar in the morning sugar in the evening sugar at suppertimeyoull get diabetes and you wont be worth a dime welcome to another day in paradise jay said could be doing anything out there wed never know it bryce answered used to be that was a crying shame black said the way things are now were lucky to be in a building where the lights and the heat work he grinned crookedly this is the last place in town thatll go cold and dark yeah bryce hadnt looked at it that way which didnt mean jay was wrong the coffee machine by the copier still worked too bryce got some caffeine and a little sugar of his own then sat down at his desk for the days important project and other fantasies he thoughthed sure had plenty that were more enjoyable he cut down the text on a newsletter so it would fit on one sheet of paper he did his best to translate a brochure from bureaucratese into english he changed the small print on dwp electric bills to keep up with revised state and city conservation rules when nobody was paying attention to him he fiddled with a new pastoral theocritus meets the supervolcano in effect when he finished he planned to send it to the new yorker after they told him no hed start going through all the markets that didnt pay marshall ferguson wasnt getting rich but he was selling things now and again bryce wished he could say the same himself since he couldnt he had this day job the dwp was the kind of place where you could look up after a quarter of a century and wonder where the hell the best years of your life had gone jay hadnt been here that long but he was starting to get those moments bryce hoped he wouldnt stick around long enough to have them youd never go toetotoe with the donald or bill gates on what they paid you but you could live and even raise a family on it medical dental vision retirement plan when you got all that good stuff would you really worry about where the time was going and why you were bored out of your skull a lot of people wouldnt hell a lot of people didnt they put in their hours and used the company xerox to copy their own stuff and stole paper and pens and anything else that wasnt nailed down and did what was required of them and not a speck more bryce sometimes found himself slipping into that easygoing slothfulness he wondered how different it really was from going nuts in a quiet polite way after lunch someone put an rfp on his desk with a postit note what do you think our chances are for getting ahold of some of this grant money evaluating an rfp especially one from the federal department of energy was a little more fun than passing a kidney stone but only a little could i do this for twentyfive years he wondered as he scribbled notes would anything be left of me if i did somewhere in kansas that was as much as vanessa ferguson knew about where she was probably somewhere in eastern kansas the dust and ash got thicker as you moved toward the colorado border that meant things got more screwed up she didnt think anybody had actually gone back into colorado yet there was plenty of disaster to go around here closer to the edges of the ashfall she didnt care shed escaped camp constitution and escaped whatever sorryass place the suckers flooded out of camp constitution had gone to instead she would never see micah husak again if by some misfortune she did she could kick him in the nuts or plug him instead of sucking him off and all her freedom had cost her was one more quickie blow job on that nameless national guardsman her selfrespect as a matter of fact no you did what you had to do and you counted up the tab later on or else you didnt worry about it at all most of the time she didnt some stretches of ground in these parts were free of volcanic crud rain and wind had blown it away or washed it into riverswhich was why the floods were so horrendous but there was genuine noshit green in those places robins hopped around probing the ground for worms every so often they even found some worms had to be tougher than vanessa had imagined but where the ash and dust had drifted in the lee of houses and fences in places where the wind didnt reach in hollows without streams running through them in spots like that the ground was as gray and lifeless as it had been right after the eruption going on two years ago now no people had been found alive not everybody had fled to the camps maybe but the people who hadnt fled hadnt made it lung diseases brought on by inhaling all the abrasive ultramicroscopic crud in the air did them in it wasnt quite as if theyd smoked twenty packs a day for fifty years but it might as well have been cows sheep pigs chickens horses gone gone gone gone and gone for the same reason those wormhunting robins must have flown here from somewhere else livestock couldnt fly away like that no crops in the ground the past two years either where anything grew up in the fields it was weeds pushing up through dead cornstalks no trace at all was left of year before lasts wheat it was only a memory this country was importing as much grain as it could these days along with oil and so much else the dollar was sinking like a stone it would have sunk even faster if europe and japan and china werent hurting too except for the ruined farmlands all around her vanessa didnt have time to think much about the battered economy washington talked about sending work crews into ashfall country to reclaim it washington though was a thousand miles away nothing would reclaim this country except time so what are we doing here then she asked the boss to whose crew shed been assigned merv saunders looked like something out of a grant wood painting he was tall and thin and bald with wireframed glasses and a long face made up of vertical and horizontal lines of disapproval scavenging he answered matteroffactly lots of stuff got left behind when people had to run quite a bit of itll still workor we can make it work with a little cleaning and tinkering theres an awful mob of folks out in the camps who need anything we can get our hands on ashley pagliarulo let you know at any excuse or none that she had a law degree that didnt mean she wasnt wearing somebody elses old clothes like the rest of the work crew or that she didnt need a shower as much as her comrades but it did give her an attitude now she said under most circumstances this would be theft by the way she said it she expected cop cars to roar up with sirens blaring any second now it wasnt gonna happen if there were any cop cars within a hundred miles vanessa would have been amazed and merv saunders sounded as calm as valium as he answered the abandoned property act makes it legal as you know perfectly well ashley only sniffed either pagliarulo was her married name or her ancestors came from some part of italy that produced petite blondes the abandoned property act will never stand up under judicial review she predicted saunders shrugged if you feel that way about it how come youre here because i was gonna go bonkers if i stayed in that lousy camp another minute the attorney snarled a sentiment vanessa completely understood well okay saunders got it too but we honest to god are doing something useful for the country here a lot of the stuff that were getting out wont be worth having if we leave it here for another few years and most of the people were taking it from are dead some arent some wound up in camps the same way we did ashley was always ready to argue any time any place she was a lawyer all right she went on and even the dead people have heirs were plundering their estates the crew boss looked at her you can always go back to a camp you know he didnt say whether you want to or not but anybody with two brain cells to rub together would hear it in his voice vanessa sure did shed given him some static too now she decided keeping her mouth shut for a while might be a pretty fair plan going back to a camp was the very last thing she wanted to do ashley pagliarulo also got the message loud and clear she said not another word she looked miffed hell she looked righteously pissed off but she was plainly of the same opinion as vanessa that going to a camp was like going to jail only with worse food and accommodations not that being in the middle of ruined kansas was any bargain whenever the wind blew out of the west as it did a lot of the time it picked up dust from the thicker layers in those parts and did its best to recover what time and rain had started to clear they all had pigsnouted gas masks when the wind blew from the west they wore them too hundreds of thousands of people had already died from hpo and other lung ailments brought on by breathing that crap nobody could guess how many more would prematurely follow them into the grave and as vanessa knew from the dreadful days right after the eruption being out and about with the dust blowing around was like trying to carry on after youd had a handful of grit thrown in your eyes wearing a gas mask was a metaphorical pain doing without one was a literal pain reality trumped metaphor every goddamn time here was another farmhouse with the front door standing open maybe the people whod lived here hadnt bothered closing it when they got the hell out maybe looters had hit the place after the owners bailed if they had vanessa hoped the time theyd wasted plundering meant they came down with one of the zillion lung diseases the dust could give you as far as she was concerned looters deserved all the bad things that happened to them and a few more besides her father no doubt would have sympathized with the attitude looters had hit the place the tv was gone there was no computer anywhere pulledopen drawers everything in them now gray with dust said there wouldnt be any jewelry either but there were shoes in the bedrooms and clothes in the closets before long some refugees would be wearing these peoples castoffs vanessa was in clothes like that herself so were her colleagues demand still exceeded supply like her plenty of people in the camps had no money to buy anything new they depended on charityand on the fruits of the abandoned property act the wearables went into black trash bags vanessa wondered out loud what people had done before they had plastic bags to stash stuff in she didnt particularly expect an answer but she got one burlap merv saunders said it was cheap and there was lots of it they still use it for sandbags because of that feed sacks too they found feed sacks out in the barn no livestock remained in there these people must either have taken their animals with them or if they couldnt do that turned them loose and hoped for the best those hopes were doomed to disappointment but they couldnt have known ahead of time vanessa had had to turn her cat loose before they let her into a refugee center shed hoped for the best too but poor pickles tears stung her eyes she blinked them back crying inside a gas mask was a bad idea because tears had nowhere to go and fogged up your lenses like nobodys business but the barn did have those sacks of feedsome made from plasticimpregnated paper others sure as hell of good oldfashioned burlap and feed even feed that was past its sellby date was precious the midwests endless abundance was dead smothered in supervolcano ash and dust those sacks of corn and soybeans and whatever wouldnt be coming out of americas breadbasket by the millions any more not for god only knew how many years animals that had survived elsewhere in the country still needed to eat if the food was stale well stale feed was a hell of a lot better than no feed people werent so fussy now as they had been when times were flush the crew lugged the feed sacks to their truck it wore the mechanical equivalent of a gas mask it sported an enormous heavyduty air filter that sure as hell wasnt part of its original equipment the engine compartment and transmission were much better sealed off than was necessary in most of the country to keep grit from getting into the moving parts vanessa remembered how her own toyota had crapped out on the road while she was trying to get away from the eruption she just thanked heaven shed got her hands on some surgical masks before then otherwise shed be coughing her lungs out now if breathing in that garbage hadnt made her kick the bucket then she thought of pickles again shed had to turn him loose to die this time she wasnt fighting tears but killing rage if she ever ran into the prunefaced bitch whod made her get rid of the cat that gal wouldnt last fifteen seconds and there was the long and short of it and here she was straining her back to lug feed sacks over to a truck kitted out like something from a mad max movie and she was glad to be doing it too because all her other choices looked worse if that wasnt a bastard and a half she was damned if she knew what would be when theyd emptied out the barn merv saunders checked a printout hed got before they started this graverobbing expedition way to go people he said our next stop is arma kansas arma virumque cano vanessa said it was a leftover from bryce and damn near the only bit of latin she knew everybody else in the crew looked at her saunders rolled his eyes its from vergil she said means of arms and the man i sing they didnt care their stares some black and others suspicious as well as she could guess by reading expressions through gas masks showed that only too clearly she wished she could have done three or four more lines but that probably would have just made matters worse she spread her workgloved hands our next stop is arma saunders repeated every line of his body saying wanna make something out of it vanessa gave up and stood there waiting the crew boss went on its a decentsized townmore than fifteen hundred people when it had people its got a gas station if the underground tanks are anywhere close to full thats even more important than bringing back feed the crew nodded vanessa found her own head going up and down any gasoline or diesel fuel that you could get your hands on was more precious than rubies these days the dollar was hurting countries that hadnt been trashed could afford oil imports better than the usa could not that the oil business was in great shape itself the sputtering wars in the middle east made sure of that so graverobbing and it was important enough that even vanessa couldnt gettoocynical about it louise ferguson pulled into her parking space in the condominium complex she wondered how much longer shed be able to keep driving to the ramen headquarters on braxton bragg boulevard it wasnt all that far from here and she didnt use very much gas going back and forth but the stuff was ridiculously expensivewhen the stations had any which they did less and less often back before the supervolcano erupted europeans would have rebelled at paying prices like these they were paying even more than she was now not that that made her happy misery here didnt love company misery was just miserable she walked to the mailboxes at the front of the complex a cable bill a catalogue from a clothing companynew fashions for cooler climes the cover said sounding more cheerful than it had any business being a notice from the electric company warning that reduced generating capacity might mean intermittent service that translated into english as rolling blackouts the governor threatened them before now theyre here she thought as she went back toward the condo that had been teos and was now hers it really was hers the lawyers had done their dance over title to the place dotting every t and crossing every i and doing whatever the hell they did probably lifting their legs and peeing on the papers till the miserable things smelled right whatever it was it hadnt come cheap nothing did not in this day and age up the stairs she trudged she remembered how teo had bounded up them and how her heart had jumped when she heard his energetic strides she would have loved him still if only he could have handled the idea of having a kid she had the kid she had the condo she didnt have teoand if he showed up now shed spit in his eye when she walked in marshall was holding his little halfbrother the babys smile at seeing his mother was so wide it almost made the top half of his head fall off dadadada he squealed thats your mama marshall said mama dadadada james henry repeated even louder than before hell figure it out louise said all of you guys went dada before you went mama too that had made colin proud and irked her not that either one of them would ever have admitted it whatever usually marshall bailed out of the condo as if his nikes were on fire when louise got home that was partly because he liked babysitting no better than any other single guy his age partly because he remained pissed off at his mother for ending the marriage that had brought him into the world he didntby the nature of things he couldntunderstand how dead the marriage was before louise ended it that colin hadnt had the first clue it was dead said nothing good about him not if you listened to louise anyhow today though marshall didnt go anywhere he just stood there louise gradually recognized the look on his face as expectant with a sigh she remembered why she was supposed to pay him today she fumbled in her purse till she found her checkbook and a pen she wrote rapidly tore off the check and handed it to him here you go thanks he put it in the pocket of his levis that he wouldnt help his mother for free never failed to annoy her but he wouldnt if you listened to colin you couldnt reasonably expect anything else but louise made a point of not listening to colin wait she said suddenly when marshall was already halfway to the door he paused wazzup let me see that check again he handed it to her she scribbled the amount in her register she used to forget to do that about one time in five it had driven methodical organized colin straight up a wall louise always figured she had more creative things to worry about till she was on her own and had to balance the checkbook herself instead of letting somebody else worry about it the hassles a couple of unexpected bounced checks put her through did more to make her note every single one of them than colins sarcasm had ever managed she gave back the check now you can escape whatever marshall said again and did just that dealing with the register meant louise had taken her eyes off james henry for a few seconds she couldnt safely do that any more not when he was crawling hed got something in his mouth she grabbed him reached in there and pulled it out a little scrap of paper it wouldnt have hurt him even if hed swallowed it but you never wanted to take chances like that most of the time she wouldnt have wanted to stick her finger into somebody elses mouth either a mom with a baby got used to all kinds of things she wouldnt have wanted to do most of the time she nursed him she gave him some rice cereal and some carrot goop his diapers had got more revolting since he started eating solid food colin used to say a rug rat wasnt human till it was pottytrained like a lot of things colin had said that held just enough truth to be annoying louise found herself thinking of her exhusband a lot more often than she thought about the departed father of her latest child yes shed been together with colin a lot longer than she had with teo but that wasnt it or not all of it colin said and thought more interesting things than teo which mattered only so much teod been a hell of a lot better in bed and easier to get along with till he freaked out when she found herself pregnant james henry was trying to catch his toes and stuff them in his mouth i love you louise told him but you are such a damn nuisance dadada the baby said happily his tummy was full his diaper was dry his onesie kept him warm his mommy was there he didnt care about anything else in the whole wide world i should be so lucky louise thought kelly lay next to colin once upon a time louise had lain with him on the same mattress kelly mostly didnt think about that expecting somebody to get a whole new bed after a breakup would have been way over the top now though it forcibly came back to her mind maybe it came back to his too you sure you wanna go through with this he asked in a low voice it was dark the door to the master bedroom was locked and latched marshalls door was locked too and he probably wouldnt come out for anything this side of the crack of doom anyway and if he did he wouldnt worry about his dad and his dads new wife colin kept his voice down just the same darn right i do kelly said she nodded too it was so dark colin might not see that she reached for him and go through with it they did afterwards kelly sprawled on her side lazy in the afterglow colin said boy i dont remember the last time i did that without protection me neither kelly said one of the reasons she didnt remember was that shed been seriously drunk when it happened and shed let out a long loud sigh of relief when her next period came right on schedule this though this was different you could joke about biological clocks it wasnt as if she never had but things got less funny when you listened to your own tickingand when you knew it would wind down for good in the everlessindefinite future oh sometimes you got a surprise later than you thought you could colins ex sure had and now his kids had an altogether unexpected halfbrother and here i am thinking about louise again kelly was annoyed with herself which didnt mean she could keep from doing it which was part of what she got for marrying a man with a considerable past of course when you got up to her age the only men without considerable pasts were the ones whod never moved away from their mothers they presented differentand usually worseproblems she shook her head what colin asked feeling the motion nothing kelly answered which wasnt quite true but it was nothing she wanted to talk about with him after a moment she went on if we can make something togethermake a baby togetherwhat could be more special than that thats why were doing it and besides even trying is fun colin said kelly poked him in the ribs she was usually more ticklish than he was but she must have hit the bullseye because he jerked serves you right kelly told him what you didnt have fun trying when he decided to be difficult he was difficult as all get out but then he said yknow after louise and i had our three she was always after me to get a vasectomy so she wouldnt have to go on using her manhole cover her what kelly was glad colin couldnt see her blank stare diaphragm he explained oh she poked him again less successfully this time he would make a bad joke like that he not only would he had yeah well he went on i didnt feel like doing anything where the odds of undoing it werent so great i didnt think anything was wrongwhich only shows how much i knew doesnt it but i even used condominiums every once in a while so she wouldnt need the frisbee to do that justice kelly would have had to poke him eight or twelve times she contented herself with snorting instead colin hadnt made the smallest of sacrifices though not from the male point of view guys used condoms but the next man she found who liked them would be the first then again she hoped she wouldnt have to do any more looking for menor why had she just made love wanting to get pregnant colin turned on the lamp on his nightstand he smiled over at her i definitely got lucky he said oh foosh she replied she wasnt anything special not with the way her tummy pooched out and her seat spread shed never actually met louise in person but shed seen photos louise was elegantly slim and her sculpted features reminded kelly of some actress whose name she couldnt quite come up with when she added i dont know what you see in me she wasnt making idle talk somebody i love thats what colin said which was always the right answer he went on somebody who loves me too and who wants to be here with me kelly kissed him you better believe it mister oh i do for a while i didnt think i would ever believe it but i do this time he kissed her thank you my pleasure she meant it he grinned a male grin not all of it lady and the other thing i see is i see this darn sexy broad naked in bed with me and what could be better than that kelly didnt think of herself as a darn sexy broad she thought of herself as a geologist being thought of as a sex object kind of weirded her out then again if you werent your husbands sex object you had other worries colin didnt just want her for that she never would have married him if he had since he did want her for that turn off the light again he was in his fifties second rounds didnt happen quickly the way they would have when he was younger or sometimes at all that didnt make fooling around any less enjoyable and even if he didnt rise to the occasion right away he wasnt shy about using fingers and tongue to bring her along i dont think i can walk to the bathroom she said after a while my knees are all loose thats nice if he sounded smug hed earned the right you could just roll over and go to sleep thats your department kelly retorted though colin didnt live up toor down tothe male cliche very often huh this time he poked her in the ribs she squeaked he chuckled ill go then he said and he did when he got back he added quite seriously i do love you you know i noticed she answered if i remember straight thats how my knees got all loose nah he shook his head the mattress sent her the vibration in the dark room thats just fooling around fooling around is greatdont get me wrong but i mean i really love you that quake in yellowstone was the best thing that ever happened to me well i got some good data from it too the thought went through kellys mind but died unsaid another time another place she would have come out with it colin appreciated dryyou didnt know him at all if you didnt know that not right this minute though not when theyd been trying to start a child together i love you too she said and leaned over and kissed him and now i am gonna go to the john loose knees or not she burrowed under the covers when she returned it wasnt warm it hardly ever was any more good night colin said so he hadnt gone to sleep gnight a few minutes later she did viii it wasnt snowing there was still snow on the ground but not everywhere rob ferguson savored the sun shining wanly down out of a sky exactly the color of a high school girlfriends grayblue eyes here and there hopeful green grass sprouted through the dead yellow tangle of last years halfhearted growth a few deciduous trees showed new little leaves it should have been april or maybe early mayrob wasnt a hundred percent sure how the weather had worked in guilford before the supervolcano went off it was the middle of august it was the second year in a row without a summer the second of nobody knew how many the roads were open for the time being till the blizzards clamped down again maine north and west of the interstate was reconnected to the rest of the country the shell station down the street from the trebor mansion inn had gasnot a lot of gas and twelve bucks a gallon but gas squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles could have got the hell out plenty of people had most of the ones whod left had relatives in warmer parts of the country there werent many colder ones not in the lower fortyeight what was happening to places like fairbanks and nome and anchorage rob didnt want to think about dick barber was glad to see individuals and families pull up stakes so was jim farrell the fewer mouths we have to feed when were on our own again the better off well be he declared to anyone who would listen barber spread the gospel of flight toowithout packing up and leaving himself the band was still here too every once in a while justin would make wistful noises about hitting the road again sometimes charlie storer would nod but not in a way to make anybody think he really meant it one reason he didnt was that biff wasnt going anywhere biff cared more about cindy down at calebs kitchen than he did about touring well he might she was going to have a baby they hadnt tied the knot yet but that also looked to be in the cards and rob wasnt eager to vamoose from the land of moose either hed been going with lindsey ever since they literally bumped into each other outside the episcopal church she wasnt carrying his child but not for lack of effort if it came down to a choice between her and the band rob was glad it hadnt come down to that justin and charlie had also found friends of the female persuasion that no doubt was one reason why they didnt sound more serious about bailing out yes they were musicians yes they were used to temporary attachments but whether or not theyd intended to theyd put down roots here roots every house had a garden all the gardens were trying to grow potatoes and parsnips and turnips and mangelwurzels and anything else that had a prayer of maturing in a growing season abbreviated even for maine extravagant mulch and plastic sheeting fought the cold as best they could and maybe there would be a crop and maybe there wouldnt everyone would find out when the weather turned really bad again in the meantime in the meantime rob ambled down the semigrassy slope to the piscataquis the stream had thawed out enough to chuckle over its rocky bed it had probably been born from glacial runoff rob stuck his finger into it then jerked the digit out again brr he said by all the signs the river was getting back to its roots a blue jay scolded him from a pine tree a lot of birds had flown south for the winter and not come back jays and robins and ravens lingered so did ospreysone plunged into the frigid water and came out with a fish clamped in its talons another jay flew after the fish hawk screeching some kids threw a football around the slope that led to the river meant only sidehill sheep could have played any proper kind of game the kids didnt care they threw and kicked and yelled and laughed it was summer vacation even if it was summer only by the calendar theyd missed a lot of school even when it wasnt vacation lindsey made sorrowful noises about that sometimes it was because they couldnt get to class themselves when the snowdrifts were taller than they were more often though their teachers couldnt make it not all the teachers lived in guilford the ones who didnt had relied on the quaint concept known as motor transportation here and there in the us of a roads still stayed open not in this part of the country though nowhere close the joke for siberia had been ten months of winter and two of bad skiing the joke these days applied all too literally to this part of maine as he had with alaska rob wondered how things were in siberia right now cold the oneword answer immediately supplied itself bloody fucking cold if you wanted to get technical though it might seem hard to believe there had been places with climates worse than the one guilford didnt enjoy if guilford had turned into a pretty fair approximation of siberia what had siberia turned into the south pole rob thought then he tried to imagine penguins roaming the tundra it made him want to giggle a kid missed the football it took three crazy bounces and stopped right at robs feet throw it back man the kid yelled he was about twelveno beard on his cheeks and his voice hadnt broken rob picked it up ill do better than that he said the shape and the pebbly feel of the leather or rubbery plastic or whatever the hell it was combined irresistibly like a certain deranged beagle what redblooded grownup doesnt want to be the mad punter even if only for a moment he let fly he hadnt played football since pe in high school and he hadnt been the punter then by rights he should have squibbed it off the side of his foot by dumb luck he caught it square it flew long and straight it would have been a fortyyarder on any nfl gridironwell any nfl gridiron except mile high stadium which was still deeply buried in volcanic crap wow the kid whod called for the ball wasnt the only one to stare at him wideeyed he tried not to preen damned if he hadnt had standing os at club gigs that hed enjoyed less being applauded for skill was one thing being applauded for skill and strength he felt as if hed grown shoulder pads under his flannel shirt after the kids retrieved the ball they brought it back to him one of the kids flipped it his way do it again he didnt think he could do it twice in a row hell he hadnt thought he could do it once in a row but hed always been able to resist anything but temptationa line his old man had used more than once he punted again it wasnt as good as the first try but it went a lot farther than any kid who hadnt reached puberty could manage they swarmed after it and brought it back like retrievers he didnt want to play punting machine if once was experiment and twice was perversion what was three times boring that was what they didnt ask him for another punt though instead one of them said when are you guys gonna play again i dunno rob answered next town meeting maybe if they want us to that was a week away when you were eleven or twelve a week was as goodno as badas forever wish youd play here in the park again sooner than that the boy said in the daytime one of his friends added there was a lot of daytime at this season of the year just as nights here stretched like silly putty during wintertime more than just the weather told you maine lay a lot farther north than la or santa barbara which were robs standards of comparison well well see he said puhleeze three of them squealed it at the same time hearing them he realized how starved for entertainment they were theyd grown up with tv and the net and playstations and wiis and xboxes all of that stuff took electricity though guilford had power for three or four hours a day during the summer during the winter well people triedyou had to give them that but it was mostly no go and no juice if they wanted to listen to a band theyd surely never heard of before it washed up on their frozen shoreand wanted to badly enough to beg for musicthey really had it bad if squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles could tour the local towns towns that hadnt had an almostrock band get stuck in them it might clean up it might clean up as much as anybody in this part of maine could right now anyhow well see rob repeated but in a different tone of voice this time biff wouldnt mind that kind of tour rob wouldnt mind it himself it might work it was definitely worth talking about the kids caught the difference yeah they said or rather ayuh it was maine all right one of them waved for another to go out on a pass pattern the ball spiraled after him the boys raced away but when rob looked out the windows of his tower garret in the trebor mansion inn the next morning the sky had gone gray and gloomy and dark snow swirled through the air it wasnt a blizzard but it also wasnt the kind of weather that would let the band draw a crowd even from the hardy folk whod stayed in guilford he still intended to talk about playing but this wasnt the day for it colin ferguson looked wistfully at the taurus in his driveway it still ran he fired it up every now and then and took it around the block to keep the battery alive and to make sure the tires stayed round hed drive it if he went out to dinner with kelly especially when it was raining and these days it rained more often in the la basin than hed ever dreamt it could but he didnt go to work in the taurus every day any more even though it wasnt far gas was too hard to come by and too expensive for anyone on a civilservice salary to use very much a san atanasio police lieutenant made a pretty good civilservice salary what kelly brought in from cal state dominguez didnt hurt either all the same all the same he put his briefcase in his bikes cargo basket climbed aboard and pedaled away he hadnt ridden a bicycle very often between the time when he was fifteen or sixteen and the day the supervolcano erupted they said you never forgot how like a lot of things they said that had holes that would have sunk it if it were a boat hed wobbled all over the place when he started riding again hed had a good fall too luckily hed blown the knees out of an old pair of sweats not the pants from any of his suits even more luckily though hed pedaled home scraped up and bruised he hadnt broken anything it did come back in a hurry the mysterious they were right about that much colin had got to the point where he enjoyed the wind in his face as he rode the rain was a different story hed quickly bought a plastic slicker that covered him from head to foot and a broadbrimmed hat to keep most of the raindrops off his bifocals bicycling with an umbrella hed rapidly discovered was an invitation to suicide he wasnt the only twowheeled commuter oh nonot even close bikes and especially bikes with adults in business attire on them had been uncommon sights on laarea streets before the eruption no more as gas prices zoomed up like a trident missile more and more people said to hell with their cars and started doing without infernal combustion colin had dropped five pounds since he started biking more than he drove his wind was better than it had been that was the good news the bad news was the san atanasio pds robbery division was trying to deal with an explosion of bicycle thefts so was every other police department in southern californiaand in a lot of other places too a car whizzed by it didnt come particularly close but he sent it a resentful stare even so now that he rode the bicycle he looked at automobiles in a whole new way the goddamn things were dangerous if you tangled with one you lost it was as simple as that and so many people drove with their heads up their asses bike what bike they might have been saying hed probably driven that way himself as a matter of fact he was sure he had how many times had he almost creamed some green ecofreako with delusions of lance armstrong plentyhe knew as much and hed blamed the skinny morons on the bikes every single time he stopped at a light then turned right onto hesperus that was a bigger street it had more cars on it not a whole lot more though even la and its autobased suburbs could do without the sacred conveyance if they had to they sure were trying to make like they could anyhow pothole coming he muttered reminding himself it was right in front of a tropicalfish place run by a japanese couple who he happened to know also owned about a quarter of the real estate down in torrancea bigger richer burb than workingclass san atanasio but they just plain liked tropical fish so they went on selling them the pothole was a doozy he would have felt it in the taurus on the bike it might have sent him ass over teakettle not for the first time he told himself to call street maintenance and give them hell one of these days in his copious spare time he had to get out into the middle of the street to turn left into the police station parking lot the bike rack there was new since the eruption colin chained his mount to a hitching post the bike was secondhand and had seen better times the chain was new and industrialstrength marshall had had a bike disappear from a ucsb rack on account of an elcheapo chain colin made his share of mistakes but usually not the ones he could see coming six miles down the road gabe sanchez was standing outside the door poisoning his lungs colin nodded to the sergeant what do you know he called i know id rather do this inside gabe answered its cold out here dammit colin didnt feel cold you must have driven this morning he said no he didnt feel cold at all antiperspirant was still getting into socal the world would turn less pleasant if that supply ever failed way to go sherlock sanchez said anybody would guess you were a cop or something you think maybe colin said he looked like a cop he dressed like a cop he talked like a cop he thought like a cop so what was he gonna be a tropicalfish merchant an auctioneer like popeye he was what he was and that was all that he was well almost all if he hadnt been a postdivorce tourist he wouldnt also be a middleaged guy trying to start a second family rob vanessa and marshall might end up with a new halfbrother or halfsister another new halfbrother or halfsister that is and one with exactly zero biological relationship to their last new halfbrother life gets fucking weird sometimes you know colin said no great originality there but plenty of feeling feeling or not gabe shook his head unhunh man thats a negative every once in a while life stops being fucking weird thats when you think it starts making sense and when you do it drops the hammer on you but good because the rest of the time he shook his head again and crushed the coffin nail under his heel then he looked mournful i want another one dammit id go easy if i were you colin left it there like antiperspirant tobacco reached la from points east like antiperspirant and everything else coming in from points east it reached la in limited amounts with prices inflated to match or maybe to more than match people who had the cigarette jones had it bad take gabe sanchez for instance he looked more sorrowful still tell me about it im smoking like half as much as i used to that means i always need the next one twice as bad his laugh was singularlyalmost plurallydevoid of humor the weenies who get on your back for liking the shit at all say youll live longer if you smoke less it sure as hell seems longerill tell you that ready to earn your next pack colin asked stepping toward the door way prices are now thats about two weeks of work gabe exaggerated but less than he would have a year earlier and a lot less than he would have before the eruption he followed colin into the station before long colin wasnt so warm as he had been right after he chained his bike to the rack you couldnt crank up the heat the way you had in the old days you also couldnt roll the ac like nobodys business on a scorching summer day that turned out not to be such an enormous issue the next scorching summer day here after the eruption would be the first supervolcano or no supervolcano people still robbed banks and liquor stores and even a laundromat that one croggled colin the perp had escaped with over a hundred pounds of quarters in four large sacks what the hells he gonna do with all of em he asked not at all rhetorically you cant spend em more than maybe five bucks at a time take your girlfriend out to a fancy restaurant and pay in rolls of quarters people will talk watch out for some dude buying everybody games at the arcade rodney ellis suggested the black detective mimed working a joystick there you go colin said makes more sense than anything i thought of perp was in his forties the crime report says gabe pointed out so thats kinda less likely know what i mean maybe yes maybe no rodney answered but what did that guy say youre only young once but you can be immature forever colin thought of louise and of her adventures and misadventures with her younger man but if he told her anything like that shed go off the way the hot spot under yellowstone had except in the line of duty he tried not to talk to her these days back to business what are we going to do about this asshole he said its not what youd call a good description wait till he hits the next stopandrob rodney said and if he gets away with quarters again right after that hell show up at the san atanasio memorial er with a double hernia everybodys a comedian colin said but he and gabe were both laughing it had started raining by the time they went out to lunch in gabes car the honda stank of cigarette smoke but that was better than getting drenched youre gonna have fun riding home tonight gabe remarked tell me about it colin said gloomily poncho or not hed get wet sighing he went on once upon a time it didnt rain this time of year yeah i know gabe nodded well keep saying that till they shovel dirt over us all the kids too young to remember what it was like back then will think were a pathetic bunch of old farts for all the pissing and moaning about the good old days we do yup colin contented himself with the one word the prediction sounded altogether too likely your wife knows about this shit right gabe said so how long is the weather supposed to stay fucked up colin only shrugged from what she tells me nobody can say for sure twenty years fifty a couple of hundred a couple of thousand we all get to find out he didnt say that kelly feared things would stay bad for the long end of the guessesestimates if you wanted the more scientific term she didnt think a short cold snap would have put homo sapiens through such a wringer years ago after mount toba went kablooie no point passing that on to gabe kelly admitted it was nothing but speculation if gabe wanted to think his kids would see the good old climate again he could nobody could prove he was wrong for thinking so and optimism like so many other things came where you found it the rain had grown more serious more sure of itself while they were eating they ran to gabe sanchezs car boy this is fun sanchez said he pulled out a pack of camels from his inside jacket pocket and held it up you mind you think im gonna tell you what to do here colin said im rude but i aint that rude dude gabe lit up and started the car colin knew secondhand smoke from one cigarette wouldnt give him lung cancer he also knew it would make his clothesand his skin toosmell like burnt tobacco kelly would wrinkle her nose when he came home tonight maybe if he got there ahead of her showered and changed into something else one thing gabe said as he pulled out of the parking lot and onto the street south bay stranglers been quiet lately probably had to pull overtime at his day job colin answered for all he knew it was the exact and literal truth if hed known more if hed known more he would have dropped on the son of a bitch a long time ago the sign was dusty it could have used a fresh coat of paint but it was still easy enough to read keep out it said in big red and blue letters on a white background this means you below that was a line of slightly smaller words trespassers will be violated vanessa ferguson eyed the sign with something less than enthusiasm nice friendly asshole wasnt he she remarked or maybe isnt he merv saunders pointed to the farmhouse in the middle distance somebody might still be holed up in there i dont think so vanessa wasnt shy about talking back to the scavenging crews boss vanessa had never been shy about talking back to anybody shed had a checkered work life and a checkered love life because of it but she was one of those people who counted costs afterwards if they counted them at all do we want to find out ashley pagliarulo pointed to another sign maybe fifty feet closer to the farmhouse that one showed a black skull and crossbones with a blunt warning in red below it achtung minen not danger mines no not that but auf deutsch vanessas lip curled in disgusted scorn neonazi shithead she said i hope he did cough his worthless lungs out he deserved it its likely just bullshit saunders said but he made no move to approach the farmhouse and if people are alive in there were supposed to make contact with them no matter what kind of dumbass politics theyve got no one was supposed to be living in this part of kansas the mandatory evacuation order had gone out soon after the supervolcano erupted vanessa had been stripping farms and little towns of whatever might prove useful to survivors for months now her team steadily working its way deeper into the ruined state shed helped bury more bodies than she cared to remember that was one reason her palms were hard with callus as for livestock carcasses no point even trying to count those the scavengers didnt try to put them underground she did wonder what the country could do for meat with so many of its cows and sheep and pigs and chickens as one with the extinct animals that had died in earlier eruptions and fossilized one of these millions of years funnylooking archaeologists digging up ashcovered cattle ranches might write learned papers about what they found in the meantime id just as soon go on to the next place down the road vanessa said i dont care if we are supposed to make contact with people if they dont want to make contact with us the hell with em several of her comrades in vulturing nodded saunders frowned though we are supposed to get in touch with them assuming theyre alive harder if theyre not vanessa agreed sweetly he gave her a dirty look i dont think its real likely that they are though he said as if she hadnt opened her mouth i think the chances are that that sign is a bluff too or was a bluff when there were people here as if to prove as much he took a few steps past the keep out sign toward the one that warned of the mines he hadnt gone far before something in or near the farmhouse opened up with a stuttering roar tracers zipped past overhead but not too far overhead the machinegun fire stopped get the fuck off my land bastard an amplified voice bellowed i wont shoot to miss next time maybe he had a generator in or near the farmhouse even if vanessa couldnt hear one chugging maybe he just had a batterypowered bullhorn though batteries were drawing ever closer to their shelf life whatever else he had he had the goddamn machine gun vanessa had used firearms often enough having the bullets coming in instead of going out was a whole different feeling though fear tasted like a copper penny under her tongue she didnt piss herself but she had to clamp down hard to keep from having that accident merv saunders didnt argue with the survivalist or whatever the hell he was whatever he was he had survived was he living on stashed food did he go out to do some freelance scavenging of his own had he somehow kept his livestock alive along with himself and whoever else he had in there at the moment all that was academic the governmentsanctioned scavengers retreated with more speed than dignity saunders got on the radio to points farther east except for the satellite variety cell phones didnt work in these parts power remained out through most of the countrys midsection when it would come back nobody could even begin to guess can you call in helicopter gunships vanessa asked eagerly or at least soldiers with mortars and grenades and things the crew boss looked at her have you been eating raw meat again her ears burned we ought to kill that son of a bitch she said go ahead saunders answered you first that made her ears flame hotter her pistol seemed mighty small potatoes when you set it against the concentrated essence of infantry a machine gun represented they can get him on a weapons rap machine guns werent legal anywhere that she knew of then real inspiration struck or for taxes i bet he hasnt paid a dime since the supervolcano went off and you have saunders inquired he was being as difficult as he could it sure felt that way to vanessa anyhow no but i havent had any money either she said which wasnt provably false what followed was actually true my stupid little credit unions servers are back in denver and theyre dead as king tut denver thats right he nodded as if reminding himself not many got out from that far west tell me about it vanessa knew how lucky she was to have fled far enough and fast enough she was as stubborn as she was lucky too taxes work thats what they finally hung on al capone remember the guy probably figured we were bandits not imfromthegovernmentandimheretohelpyou saunders said vanessa inhaled sharply the gang boss must have psyched out what she was going to say because he beat her to the punch by continuing but if it makes you happy ill pass the suggestion along maybe someone in authority will do something about it fuck off get out of my hair that was what he meant if she pissed him off badly enough he could send her back to whatever had replaced the soggy camp constitution if that wasnt a fate worse than death you could sure see one from there she would have done almost anything to keep from ending up in a refugee camp again her mouth twisted micah husak had given her a most unwelcome education about what doing almost anything to get out of something else really meant if saunders made it plain her choice was between coming across and going back to a camp shed already had to make that kind of choice twice now shed yielded both times and loathed herself whenever she had to remember she also would have loathed herself had she chosen the other way she knew that only too well sometimes you couldnt win sometimes you couldnt even play the scavengers boss had shown exactly zero interest in her fair white body that irked her too there werent a whole lot of things that didnt irk vanessa for now though unless she really wanted to piss saunders off she needed to leave him alone she could see that she didnt like it for hell but she could see it with poor grace she walked away dust and volcanic ash that would be dirt one of these years scuffed up under her feet ix a bus up from downtown the subway out to north hollywood which was on the fringes of the valley an express bus out to the heart of darkness actually in los angeles the valley was the heart of whiteness bryce miller wondered if he should have taken his car expensive though that was getting out here this way was a royal pain he could have used the car this once yeah if he had to do it every day he shook his head not a chance from san atanasio to here and back again was about seventyfive miles multiply that by monday through friday by gas at prices that would have made a european blanch before the eruption by the fact that half the time you couldnt buy gas at any price at all and what you got was not a chance one more time if he did end up doing this hed have to move to the valley he couldnt afford or manage to drive for the third time not a chance and this was a saturday and hed left his apartment almost two hours ago and he still wasnt where he needed to be add four hours of daily commuting to a job and youd be nutso in nothing flat before the supervolcano went off he wouldnt have moved to the valley on a bet when you lived in the south bay the sea breeze spoiled you it wasnt quite perfect santa barbara but it rarely got too hot or too cold no sea breeze in the valley the santa monica mountains blocked it off hard freezes during the winter temps that went up past in the summertime if you were a south bay guy you didnt want thing one to do with any of that crap but that was before the supervolcano went off the south bay hadnt just got hard freezes it had got snow so had the rest of the la basin and no way in hell any part of the basin would see again any year soon hard to imagine you could get nostalgic for sweat but human nature argued you could miss anything you didnt have any more christ there were times he still missed vanessa it wasnt that he wasnt happier with susan in all the time theyd been together hed quarreled with her less than he had with vanessa in a bad monthand theyd had several bad months in a row before she invited him to get lost and once in a while he missed her anyway part of it he supposed was that he hated getting anything wrong part of it was that she was the first one hed fallen for hook line and sinker and shed fallen for him the same way when it was your first time of course you thought it would last till the end of time theyd gone to a wedding not long after they got together a couple of her friends were tying the knot a high school english teacher of hers who was there had asked them what they were going to do bryce remembered that very clearly he remembered what hed answered too well live happily ever after and he remembered how that english teacher had laughed her ass off hed been pissed vanessa had been furiousalmost furious enough to make a scene at jack and katarinas reception well prunefaced miz whatshername got the last laugh happily ever after bryce and vanessa did not live as for jack and katarina they broke up before vanessa showed bryce the door shit happened boy didnt it just the bus stopped liberating bryce from his gloomy maunderings the doors hissed open he got off and looked around if the guy wasnt here well that was why god made cell phoneswhen the power let them work anyhow today it was on but a stocky man in his late thirties whod been standing in the little bus station came forward with his hand stuck out youre dr miller arent you he said i went to your facebook page to see what you looked like im vic moretti im bryce miller yeah bryce shook hands with moretti who by his grip might have been a construction worker when he wasnt teaching he wasnt comfortable with dr miller at the dwp and he wasnt comfortable with it here either after a longish pause he managed good to meet you if this guy wanted small talk from him he was in trouble and you moretti seemed very much at ease in his own skin maybe that was personality maybe just years whatever it was bryce envied it the older man went on my cars right around the corner it was a prius bryce envied that too the less gas you used these days the better but some of the envy went away when he got into the hybrid his knees banged the glove compartment he might have been able to fit his legs around the steering wheel he didnt think he could have got them under it moretti chuckled as he fastened his seat belt and started the car helps if youre not a big tall guy he admitted me im fivenine and im fine in here he pulled out into what traffic there was so how much do you know about junipero high not a whole lot bryce was sandbagging a little hed done his online homework too no point not showing that your web site says youre one of the leading catholic high schools in the west valley and craigslist says youre looking for somebody who can teach latin and history i can do greek too if you want me to he liked greek much better than latin though he wasnt about to say so when junipero was looking for a latin teacher well we can look into that a little further down the line moretti said smoothly he had to mean something like greek in a high school youve got to be shitting me bryce didnt get his bowels in an uproar about it no matter how interesting he thought greek was only a handful of prep schools did offer it the prius purred west the valley looked like any other part of the los angeles urban sprawl houses apartment buildings shops strip malls some of the billboards were in spanish so were some of the ones in san atanasio moretti took a couple of turns that got him off the big streets and onto little ones mountains loomed against the western horizon not great big mountains but a lot closer than the smudges on the horizon that were all you saw in the south bay those couldnt be the santa monicas what were they then the santa susanas bryce realized how little he knew about the local geography back east this might easily be a state or two away from him here it was in the same county the scale on this side of the country was different here we are moretti swung into a parking lot he stopped the car under the overhanging boughs of some pines that sprouted from the grass by the lot when bryce got out he heard woodpeckers drumming in the trees he glanced around some of the buildings looked as if theyd gone up earlier this morning others had probably stood there for fifty years or more which made them ancient by southern california standards nice campus he offered it is isnt it moretti agreed thats one of the compensations for teaching here bryce knew exactly what that meant they paid bupkis hed have to take a serious cut if he bailed from the dwp moretti led him to one of the blocks of classrooms a key opened the room that turned out to be his it looked like well a high school classroom instead of sitting behind his big wooden desk he plopped down into the nearest steeltubeandplastic jobs the kids got stuck with he waved bryce into the one in the next row over the easy assumption of equality made bryce like him better youve got a steady job that pays you more money moretti said why would you rather do this bryce had been wondering the same thing when you got out into the real world cash often seemed the most important thing there was but he answered i can do the job ive got but id sooner use some of what i studied and pass it along there arent any university positions out therethe way things are these days theyre shutting down classics departments not hiring new people for them so this looks like my next best bet i see vic moretti steepled his stubby fingers if a university post did come along would you take it of course i would bryce wasnt going to lie to him not when he already had a job and wasnt desperate to grab any spar in the sea he did go on but i dont think thats likely i only wish i did hmm moretti wrote something down youre up front anyhow ill say that for you is he saying it for me or against me bryce wondered aloud he said you may as well know where im coming from thats true we also needed to know whether your degree was genuine weve had a couple of applicants who knew just enough latin to order a pizzaif they didnt want pepperoni on it the junipero teacher looked thoroughly grim oh wow bryce said yeah moretti nodded you were talking about how things are these days yourself some people watch too much poker on tv they think they can bluff their way through anything maybe they hoped they could stay half a chapter ahead of the kids the first year and then theyd have it psyched out with priests on the faculty though that doesnt fly i guess it wouldnt bryce allowed i can do the latin i can do the history too they make you learn it at ucla he probably would have to stay half a chapter ahead of the kids for some of the more modern stuff but that was one more thing he didnt say professor harriman thinks you can moretti said even though bryce hadnt expected anything elsehe wouldnt have listed his chairperson as a reference if he hadhearing that still warmed him it also told him his chances of landing this job were pretty decent sure as hell moretti started talking about money and about benefits no neither was on a par with what bryce had now when will i hear back from you he asked do i really want to do this within a week i expect the older man replied we do have two or three other people who we think are legit and we need to talk to them too okay fair enough bryce said the polite thing whether he meant it as far as he was concerned all those other people could geh kak afen yam one of the handful of yiddish phrases he knew or could they do i really want to do this he wondered again he would be doing something he enjoyed a lot more than sitting in the dwps cubicle farm and they would pay him a lot less for doing it too could he scrape by on what they did pay him if he didnt think so what was he doing here besides wasting his time and vic morettis that is let me run you back to the bus stop moretti said boy thatd be a hellacious commute from the south bay it wouldnt be any fun if you could drive it and bus and subway are a lot slower unless the clogs up bryce answered dryly the teacher chuckled yeah there is that but you probably would think about moving up here huh it has crossed my mind bryce said as they walked down to the prius he went on i never thought i might end up at a catholic school he didnt say he was jewish miller could be anything some people knew at a glance he was a landsman others especially the ones his red hair threw off hadnt a clue its a catholic curriculum yeah moretti said the kidsthe kids are valley kids were maybe ten percent jewish including the quarterback on the football team weve got sikhs muslims hindus koreans you name it theyre here anybody who figures the los angeles unified school district stinks which means just about everybody bryce put in how right you are and theres a reason for that lausd does stink its great if you shuffle papers but if youre a student and you actually want to learn something i spent six years working at la unified the nonsense youve got to put up with made me glad to take the cut that went with coming here i can accomplish something here you know thatd be nice bryce wondered if hed accomplished one single goddamn thing at the dwp hed kept a roof over his head and food on his table in the larger scheme of things not so youd notice he talked things over with susan that night they ate at a chinese seafood place a couple of miles from his apartment that was the kind of thing people used their cars for these days whatever you want to do is fine with me she said money if i worried about money would i be messing around with the hohenstaufens the western medieval world was a lot closer in time to the here and now than bryces period was in attitude he doubted it the hellenistic greeks could seem amazingly modernand amazingly cynical of course from what susan said so could frederick ii but the holy roman emperor spectacularly didnt fit into his own time chances were he would have been right at home amongst the clever cutthroats who ruled ptolemaic egypt seleucid syria and antigonid macedonia their food came seafood was local next to beef or lamb or chicken it was also a bargain people screamed about that all the time they wanted washington to do something they wanted it louder every day too just what washington could do they didnt seem so sure retroactively declare the supervolcano hadnt erupted maybe people like that probably ordered unscrambled eggs when they sat down to breakfast at dennys too all of which was beside the point bryce swallowed a tiny squid braised in hoisin sauce and came to the point if i take the job looks like ill have to move up to the valley will you come up there with me live with you you mean she asked a squid of her own paused halfway between her plate and her mouth she frowned a little a vertical crease formed between her eyebrows they never had lived togethershe was oldfashioned about that shed spend the night at his place and let him spend it at hers but no more bryce nodded anyhow uhhuh its no farther to ucla from there than it is from the south bay closer i think she ate her squid then she said i dont know in a way that told him she did know but was still looking for a way to soften the blow he took a deep breath itd be okay if we got married right hed figured he would propose to her one of these days he hadnt figured this would be the one sometimes his mouth lived a life of its own wild and free by the way susans eyes widened she hadnt figured this would be the day either are you sure she asked werent women trained not to give men a second chance when they popped the question but if bryce said he wasnt sure now they were finished he nodded you bet i am he meant it too even if it means telling your dad i proposed at the same time as i was talking about taking a job that didnt pay so well could be worse you might not have a job at allplenty of academics these days dont pop would really love that susan paused as if remembering she hadnt answered the relevant question she took care of that yes ill marry you bryce you can even invite lieutenant ferguson if you want tobut not vanessa thank you very much not inviting colin to his wedding had never occurred to bryce neither had inviting vanessa even if she were in this part of the country had he been rash enough to invite her he knew she would have said no actually chances were she would have told him to fuck off and die once vanessa was through with somebody she was through with him forever and twenty minutes longer but thinking about one girl when hed just successfully proposed to another one wasnt the smartest thing he could do even if susan had been the one to bring up vanessa he reached across the table and took her hand i love you you know he said the best i can she nodded i know she said accepting the qualification and i know that if you keep working for the dwp much longer youll go right out of your tree so if junipero calls and tells you they want to teach their kids latin you do it you hear bryce sketched a salute yes maam susan stuck her tongue out at him just dont let your eyeballs stick out on stalks when you stare at the cute ones she tried to sound severe but he knew she was kidding they went back to his apartment he did his best to show where she satisfied his appetites by all the signs he satisfied hers too and wasnt that the point of the happy exercise vic moretti called back five days later he considerately waited till bryce was home from the dwp you want the position its yours he said without preamble i want it bryce said you sure you know what youre getting into moretti asked maybe he was joking and then again maybe he wasnt bryce didnt care too much i know what im getting out of he replied moretti paused yeah that counts too he agreed thoughtfully well semesters starting soon its good to have the slot filled good to fill it bryce wondered whether hed mean that five yearsor even five weeksfrom now james henry ferguson sneezed yellowish snot leaked from his right nostril dried crusted boogers clogged the left one he coughed and almost choked but then didnt quite you poor thing louise said if anything was more pathetic than a sick baby she had no idea what it could be james henry didnt know what was wrong with him he didnt know hed be okay again in a couplethree days he didnt know what a couplethree days were or how to wait them out all he knew was that he felt crappy mama he said and started to bawl that did nothing to improve the situation his eyes leaked tears his snot got runnier which meant it oozed from both nostrils looked at objectively he made a most uninspiring spectacle louise wasnt objectivenowhere close mothers werent equipped to be if they had been the human race would have died out long before it ever escaped from the caves colin now she remembered colin surveying a sick kidhad it been rob or marshall why couldnt she remember and going boy hes an ugly little son of a gun isnt he she remembered the clinical interest in his voice and how much it had infuriated her if shed been in touch with her feelings then she would have walked away from the marriage on the spot and if she had her life now would sure as hell be different better worse she hadnt a clue different she was sure of the other thing she was sure of was that the otc meds she was stuffing into james henry werent worth shit she was definitely in touch with her feelings about that it made her mad was what it did back when her other kids were little you could buy stuff that actually made snot dry up sure itd come back as soon as the dose wore off but it went away for a while no more dammit the fda in its infinite wisdom had decided that the drugs that helped most kids also messed up fourteen in a million or whatever the hell the number was and so to keep the fourteen in a million safe the other sniffled for a solid week whenever they caught a cold and they did catch them boy did they ever babies and colds went together like ham and eggs all the cold medicines on the drugstore shelves looked pretty much the way they had back when louise was taking care of rob and vanessa and marshall their boxes said things like safer than ever what that meant was they didnt do squat she cuddled james henry mama he said mournfully he got snot on her shoulder even though shed put a cloth diaper there to try to block that mucus one more blouse shed have to wash at least snot didnt stink the way spitup did her phone rang james henry jerked he wasnt as jumpy about the phone as a cat was but he didnt like it the phone made her pay attention to something besides him and he didnt like that either she fished the phone out of her purse marshalls number was showing hello louise said yo that was marshalls way of talking but it didnt sound like him it was too deep and too slow and punctuated by a sneeze i better not come over there tomorrow imahchoo sick so is james henry louise said she didnt quite remember how shed got into the habit of always using both his first and his middle name but she had did you give him the cold or did he give it to you probably marshall said again the answer sounded like him even if the voice didnt again he sneezed this time he blew his nose right afterwards a long sorrowful honk i wish james henry could do that louise thought her older son went on either which way i feel like dog shit unlike his father he wasnt shy about swearing where women could hear chances were he hardly noticed he was swearing to people of his generation it was just the way they talked louise wasnt offended as far as she was concerned marshalls casually foul mouth only proved colin had wasted time and temper smacking him for cussing right this minute that was beside the point no matter how gratifying it might have been some other time louise didnt want to think about colin not when she couldand needed tothink of herself instead what am i supposed to do she asked how can i go to work tomorrow if james henrys sick and you cant come take care of him beats me mom marshall sounded nearly as chilly and indifferent as his father might have maybe the cold helped or maybe it was the triumph of one heredity over another then he added dont forgetim sick too lost in her own worries louise had forgotten she was briefly embarrassed but only briefly what am i going to do she saidnot quite a repetition but close enough whatever it is dont put me in it yes marshall could sound too damn much like colin and hed always blamed louise for walking out and getting free he got only the first part not the second he took care of james henry for money he didnt really care about his little halfbrother as if to underscore that he went on ill check with you when im not so rancid any more bye silence echoed in louises ear the zen sound of a seashell that wasnt there shit she said most sincerely james henry looked at her shit he echoed the way babies will she laughed so hard she almost dropped him he laughed too till he coughed and choked and sprayed boogers all over his cheeks she wiped him off saw he could have more of the worthless decongestant and spooned it into him he made a horrible face it all seemed so unfair if the crap didnt do any goodand it didntcouldnt it at least taste halfway decent she still didnt know what she was going to do tomorrow she couldnt take james henry to the ramen works hed only make everybody else sick thatd thrill mr nobashi wouldnt it but she didnt want to stay home either waste a vacation day she didnt get enough of them to be happy squandering one on a sick kid which left what anything the yellow pages werent worth shit those days she wouldnt find a babysitting service there she went online instead she came up with several in the area all of them said se habla espanol which was great no doubt but how about ingles well the only thing she could do was start calling and find out so she did sure enough most of the people she talked with had accents flavored with spanish you got used to that in southern california what she had more trouble getting used to were the prices they wanted if marshall ever found out what they were asking hed yell for more himself thats just about what i bring home she yelped to one service that was particularly outrageous sorry maam we got to make a living too replied the woman on the other end of the line that might have been politer than fuck you lady but it amounted to the same thing she ended up burning the vacation day the professional babysitters were too goddamn professional for a mere human being to afford then she had to burn another one because marshall was still sick the next day that got her through friday she dared hope things would be at least near normal by monday back when she first found out she was pregnant her ob had asked her if she would take it out on the baby for blowing up the life shed had shed denied the possibilitydenied it indignantly in fact now now she would have been a liar if she said the idea of punting james henry didnt cross her mind she didnt do it by saturday afternoon the baby was pretty much his old cheerful self again and louise had a scratchy throat and a tickle in her nose you couldnt win the way things looked you couldnt even break even that crossed her mind just before she started sneezing there were times when marshall ferguson felt as if hed never gone to college here he was in the house where hed grown upin his old room again for gods sake he had more money in his pocket than hed enjoyed before he went up to santa barbara but not enough more to move out on his own if his mother hadnt had her little bastard he wouldnt even have had that the economy had fallen and it couldnt get up he wonderedand wondered seriouslywhether hed die of old age before it managed to climb to its feet again and there were times when he thought hed fallen into the looking glass just like alice dealing with his mother as a nearenemy would do that to him however much he tried he couldnt think of her any other way now shed blown up the family what else was he supposed to think about her his dads new wife he liked kelly he liked her better than he liked the woman whod given him birth but she didnt seem like a mother to him or even like a stepmother however a stepmother was supposed to seem what he knew about stepmothers was a weird mashup of fairy tales on the one hand and friends and acquaintances whose folks had divorced and remarried on the other what she really reminded him of was a new older sister he also liked her better than hed ever liked vanessa though why not she didnt try to boss him around the way vanessa always had she didnt make as if she knew everything there was to know either she just got along with him he wasnt remotely used to that he would have liked to talk it over with dad his father was the one unchanged point in his life dad might be a little grayer a little jowlier than he had been when marshall was in high school but how often did you notice that his style hadnt changed not a nickels worth and wasnt the style the man himself somebodyd said that marshall couldnt remember who so much for the bachelors degree theyd finally made him take but because dad was dad marshall couldnt imagine talking to him in any serious way dad would listen hed listen hard like the cop he was and then hed give forth with something that might as well come from mars which was one reason marshall didnt try talking with him hed had that happen before the other reason of course was much older and more basic marshall had expended a lot of time and testosterone gaining such flimsy independence as he had was he going to risk that for the sake of conversation like hell he was and so he had to find some other way to channel his confusion he put it into a story not only was he channeling it he was giving himself a chance to make some money from it he did sell thingsless often than he wanted to but he did the money was nice but he couldnt begin to live on it nobody could live on what you made from short fiction everybody said so and for once everybody seemed right he could talk about that with kelly no testosterone involved there she thought for a little while then said maybe you should write a novel a novel are you nuts marshall made a cross with his two index fingers as if trying to protect himself against vampires i couldnt write a novel why not you sell some of what you write kelly was painfully preciseeven more so than dad did that go with being a geologist or just with being her marshall wasnt sure but either way she went on thats got to mean youre good enough right jeez i dunno marshall muttered what he did know was that the idea of tackling a novel scared him shitless kelly didnt want to let it go you can make a living on novels cant you she asked if youre lucky enough maybe marshall didnt want to admit anything but she had a point or the blogs and twitter feeds and bulletin boards he haunted made him think she did you wrote short stories for glory or experiment or because you liked a little idea so much you couldnt not write it novels now novels paid billsexcept when they didnt so go for it what have you got to lose kelly could be most infuriating when she sounded most reasonable my mind marshall suggested one more thing everybody always said was dont quit your day job considering that his day job was taking care of his halfbrother dumping it didnt seem half bad it wasnt that he had anything personal against james henry the baby was probably as nice as a baby was gonna be he couldnt help it that just by coming along hed fucked up a whole bunch of lives being able to tell mom to find somebody who really was a babysitter though that sounded pretty good if he never messed with another poopy diaper as long as he lived he wouldnt shed one single solitary tear dad always claimed babies werent really human till they got pottytrained marshall hadnt known about that one way or the other before he believed it now making real money grownup money sounded pretty good too zero chance of doing that with short stories your chances of doing it with novels werent what anybody would call good but they werent zero either people did make a living writing novels one or two of them even got rich all the same i mean it kelly ive never had an idea that big how hard have you looked she asked he didnt answer that he had no idea how or why ideas came or why sometimes they didnt maybe the idea fairy was spending a couple of weeks on the beach at maui working on her tan maybe the bulb in his storydetector light burned out and he didnt notice it for a while he had no clue um marshall kellys voice changed it was as if shed suddenly realized she didnt know everything there was to know so marshall thought anyhow but he was feeling harassed right then what is it he asked more roughly than he might have she bit her lip just so you know your father and i are trying to have a baby so there may be another halfbrother or halfsister on the way for you i didnt think it should be a surprise if it happens how about that marshall said which was safe almost all the time his first reaction was oh christ ill never get away from diapers his second reaction made him giggle kelly raised an eyebrow the way dad would havedamned if they werent rubbing off on each other marshall explained here id have two new halfsibs and they wouldnt be related to each other at all how bizarre is that pretty much kelly allowed your father said the same thing about you and rob and vanessa when we started trying oh yeah marshall pondered that nothing he could do about it he decideddad had had a lot longer to rub off on him than on kelly uhhuh kelly got back to the main track is it bizarre enough to be a novel idea it was novel to marshall all right whether it was to his father or not then he realized that wasnt what she meant or not all of what she meant he shrugged maybe it was maybe x the last time kellyd seen missoula montana shed left it behind in a giissue humvee with a superduper desert air filter and a pintlemountedcaliber machine gun that was what the idaho sheriffan old buddy of colinswhod taken her away had called it anyhow kelly didnt know from pintles shed never heard the word beforeor since either but now she was back in missoula looking at more humvees with superduper air filters and pintlemounted guns when she climbed into one of them this time shed be heading east not west missoula was the edge of the world these days the edge of the habitable world anyhow everything closer to the supervolcano was buried in ash missoula had got ashfall too but it wasnt buried plenty of places much farther away had had a lot more dumped on them the prevailing winds kept most of the ash away from here and so if you wanted to examine the new caldera missoula made a good place to start from that you had to be out of your frigging mind to want to do any such thing colin had said as much to kelly hed been as emphatic as he could manage without using profanityenough to impress her quite a bit in fact and then when he saw she was out of her frigging mind at least that particular way and had been for years he threw his hands in the air and said well if youre gonna go i hope to god you learn something worthwhile if that wasnt love what was it kellyd signed as many releases for this little jaunt as she had when she flew over the enormous zit the supervolcano blew on the earths face if anything happened to her while she was exploringanything at all from dandruff to unaskedfor rattlesnakes or bears to getting charbroiled in a lava burpshe admitted in advance it wouldnt be the governments fault this time the humvees had us geological survey stenciled on their sides the guys sitting behind the machine guns however didnt look like usgs personnel they looked like soldiers there was a good reason for that too they were one of them had two little black stripes on each collar point of his camo uniform uh corporal are we really gonna need all of that firepower kelly asked him maam i just dont know he answered with unsmilingand unyieldingseriousness that maam grated but only for a moment he was more than half kellys age but he couldnt have been much more than half her age to him that would make her a walking antique he went on better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it i guess kelly didnt feel like a walking antique no matter what the corporal who had zits of his own though not supervolcanosized ones thought nobody truly antiquated could have a baby right she wasnt going to have one now or they wouldnt have let her do this no matter how many releases she signed but she was trying she took another shot here i didnt know anybody was left alive very far east of missoula well maam nobodys quite surethats what our briefing says the corporal was relentlessly polite some of the ash has washed away since the eruption some of the land toward the crater may be habitable and some people who kind of want to get out from under may have taken up residence there people who kind of want to get out from under that was an interesting way to put it but not a bad one for the first time since wild west days wound down the government of the united states didnt fully control all the land from sea to overfished sea you saw cnn stories about squatters and homesteaders and survivalists and cultists founding their own little communities inside the devastated areas off to the east of the eruption they didnt always like it when the government found them again sometimes they didnt like it with guns you didnt see stories like that about montana or at least kelly hadnt but since when had cnn given a flying fuck about montana kelly wouldnt have bet cnn had ever heard of it and some people had always lived in these parts because they wanted the government bothering them as little as possible some of those people did have guns too lots of guns in fact which meant the pintlemountedcalibers probably werent the worst idea in the world that world wasnt the way you wished it were or the supervolcano never would have gone off to begin with the world was the way it was dammit warts and zits and all her breath smoked missoula in autumn hadnt been a place where anyone would go to loll around in a bikini even before the eruption since places like moose jaw and novosibirsk came to mind what moose jaw and novosibirsk were like these days is someone elses worry thank god kelly told herself firmly all ashore whos going ashore everybody else all aboard larry skrtel didnt have a bullhorn then again the usgs geologist didnt need one either he was as close to an unflappable man as anyone kellyd ever met but hed never had trouble making himself heard he walked up and down the convoy of humvees impersonating a liners chief steward or a train conductor or a mother hen or whatever the hell he was impersonating when he neared kelly he dropped his voice to talk in more civilized tones wont be quite such a mad dash along i this time i hope jesus so do i kelly blurted theyd roared west from butte to missoula in a ford theyd piled into at the butte airport right after the supervolcano blew that impossibly huge cloud of dust and ash swelled and swelled behind them and kellyd thought it would catch them and eat them no matter how big a jump they had on it this was the way the world endednot with a whimper but with a bang skrtel grinned at her were still here the calderas still here of course well go take a good look at it doesnt the bible say something about a dog returning to its vomit beats me kelly had only the most limited acquaintance with the bible if it went on about puking dogs she wasnt sure she wanted any more geoff rheinburg climbed into the humvee right behind hers her chairperson waved and winked when their eyes met kelly hoped he didnt notice how halfhearted her answering wave was even more than she had at the geologists conclave in portland she felt as if shed fallen back into grad school they headed east about an hour later than theyd planned to used to the ways of geologists kelly thought that was a miracle of efficiency the soldiers who manned the machine guns all rolled their eyes and shook their heads they defined efficiency in military terms it took more than surgical masks kelly wore one too to hide their scorn for the first fifteen or twenty miles on i things seemed close to normal the interstate was well the interstate there were a few vehicles on it besides the usgs humvees there were even a couple heading toward missoula from the east missoula might not have been the end of the known world after all then even if you could see it from there when would they reach here be dragons country it didnt take long even before they got out of missoula she saw patches of ash and dust that a couple of years of rain and snowmelt hadnt cleared awaythey looked like nothing so much as the jolly green giants spilled sacks of readycrete a giant had spilled that junk over the continents midsection all right but it wasnt jolly and it wasnt green halfway between the mighty metropolises of clinton and bearmouth neonorange highway signs warned road past this point not plowed proceed at your own risk it wasnt quite all hope abandon ye who enter here but it wasliterallyclose enough for government work odds were those signs had been made with snow in mind what theyd been made for didnt matter though they could and did also warn of other trouble ahead even in the jaunt from missoula to herethe easy part of the tripkelly had watched those spilledcement patches getting bigger and coming closer to the road then there was more grit on the interstate than blowing wind could account for she could feel it in the humvees motion and hear it scritching under the tires fuck said the corporal behind the machine gun signs werent bullshitting were they bearmouth still had people in it ghosts wouldnt have needed to burn stuff and make smoke pour out of chimneys the whole tiny town looked as if someone had smacked it in the face with a dirtygray powder puff about the size of the superdome though kelly wondered if the locals would be as gray as their town but she didnt see any of them pine forests were gray too under that gray how many of those trees were dead or dying most unless she missed her guess rivers ran gray ash covered their beds and swirled along in their turbid waters ash did such a job of clogging rivers that the floods throughout the midwest had been horrendous they would have been even more horrendous if so much of the midwest werent currently uninhabited superduper desert air filter or not one of the humvees crapped out only an hour and a half into the journey everybody stopped people who knew about engines or thought they did huddled about under the hood after a while they threw their hands in the air and gave up once upon a time kellyd seen a world war ii cartoon of a tough sergeant looking away as he gave his mortally wounded jeep the coup de grace with a shed never run into anything in real life to remind her of that not till now they shifted people and supplies to the surviving humvees and went on the interstate became more and more a matter of opinion there were times when kelly couldnt tell whether they were on the road or not only when they went under an overpassor had to go around one that had collapsed under all kinds of strains its designers never worried aboutwas she sure the humvees big heavytreaded tires began throwing up wakes of dust and ash fuck the corporal said again this shit makes iraq and kuwait look like a walk in the park and i thought they were just about all sand when i was there when they camped that night their site precisely defined the middle of nowhere kellyd chowed down on mres before the one she had there did not improve her opinion of them back in the old days hadnt men joined the army to get three square meals a day since then the people who fed soldiers seemed to have forgotten the difference between a square meal and a meal that came in a square box water had turned some of the ash and volcanic dust into something halfway between dried mud and cheap concrete except for the geologists kelly was hardpressed to find anything alive everything was grayish brown well almost everything one of the machine gunners brought in a small plant and said this here is a dandylion aint it it sure is skrtel agreed after popping the dandelion into a specimen jar he checked the gps on one of the humvees to find out exactly where they were he wrote it down they had laptops and ipads but the only way to recharge them in the field was from the humvees batteries keeping their use down was a good idea in other words kellys chairperson did some poking around of his own after perhaps ten minutes he grunted in triumph and plucked a specimen of his own he carried it over to kelly can you identify this professor rheinburg asked as if she were still his student her heart thumped in alarm as if she were still his student she didnt want him to think she was dumb she peered at the plant in the palm of his hand whatever it was a dandelion it wasnt she nervously licked her lips she knew a hell of a lot more about rocks and soil than she did about the plants that grew on them still considering where they were and what this one looked like its a lodgepole pine sapling isnt it he beamed at her thats just what it is the damn things can grow in the crappiest soil there is thats why there arewereso many of them in yellowstone theyre the first squatter trees to come back after an eruptioneven after this eruption except this one wont grow now kelly pointed out nope rheinburg didnt sound upset about it if i can find one after a few minutes of poking there are bound to be millions of them popping up all over the ashfall i guess that made kelly more cheerful but not for long millions of lodgepole pines scattered over hundreds of thousands of square miles meant maybe ten trees per square mile ten saplings per square mile that was not all of them would live to grow up even if all of them did the result wouldnt be what anyone in his right mind could call a forest it would look a lot more like a bald mans combover she said as much to rheinburg he laughed theres a difference he said a bald guys combover gets worse and worse as time goes by cause hes got more and more scalp showing and less and less hair to cover it with here there will be more and more trees and bushes and whatnot to patch over mother earths bald spot kelly found herself nodding well youre right she said her chairperson beamed at her you can say that its one of the reasons i enjoyed having you in the program so much most people would sooner be drawn and quartered than admit theyre wrong he brieflyonly brieflylooked sheepish lord knows i would how come you never told me you enjoyed having me in the program till i wasnt in the program any more kelly asked pointedly how come because grad students are supposed to worry thats how come it makes them work harder if you thought everything was cool youd try to skate through your research and then i wouldnt enjoy having you around so much nopeyou need fear and deadlines and so did i kelly would have liked to tell him he was full of it she didnt even try she knew too well he wasnt what had kept her cramming her head with facts and formulas before her orals but fear of failing if shed been sure she would pass she wouldnt have studied so hardand she would know less now wait till you have grad students of your own rheinburg said youll find out what i mean oh will you ever people were slithering into sleeping bags kelly hadnt done that in a while she was used to sleeping on a nice soft bed with a nice warm husband in spite of a foam pad between her and the ground she tossed and turned trying to get comfortable and not having much luck she couldnt go off behind a bush the next morning no bushes to go behind the geologists went behind humvees instead pointers and setters choosing different vehicles eventually the humvees wouldnt be able to go any farther what would they do then turn their backs she supposed or more likely theyd be able to go behind boulders by then the supervolcano had thrown great big rocks a hell of a long way in fact the humvees lasted till late that afternoon they were tough critters they kept going for quite some time after the eruption had destroyed any sign that human beings had ever lived or built things in these parts had they been halftracks they might have gone farther yet or they might not have wouldnt tracks be even more susceptible to grit than wheels were kelly didnt know one way or the other when she asked at the stop for supper the soldiers who thought they did know got into a hellacious argument some saying one thing some the other they were still close to eighty miles from the crater when even the valiant humvees couldnt force their way through the dust and volcanic ash any more its a shame we couldnt get helicopters to take us all the way in and out kelly remarked the next morning as the geologists got ready for the trek that would follow if they wanted toand if they couldsee the caldera up close and personal larry skrtel clapped a hand to his forehead as much emotion as shed ever seen him show helicopters she says the usgs veteran exclaimed kelly it took handtohand bureaucratic combat to get the humvees the way things are the way theyre gonna stay for as long as anyone can see nobody will spend a dime on anything the computer geeks and bean counters call unessential like i just told you it took a special miracle to get em to spend a nickel mounting the expedition had cost uncle sam and however many taxpayers were still paying taxes a pretty fair pile of nickels skrtel was bound to be right though to a bean counter it looked like small change what did they say about the feds a billion here a billion there and pretty soon youre talking about real money that was the line that was the attitude too but something else skrtel said raised kellys hackles even if she wasnt sure what hackles were who says this is unessential she demanded irately what could be more important than understanding how the supervolcano did its number on us he spread his callused hands in resignation darn near anything he answered its not gonna go off again not the way it didthe magma pool takes a long time to fill up again after it blasts out ordinary volcanic eruptions after what weve already been through those are a piece of cake some of the ordinary eruptions that would come would be enormous by the standards civilization was used to enormous yes but not humongous the technical term geologists used for a major supervolcano blast and skrtels words brought back kellys old worryif studying the supervolcano was obsolete wasnt she well it wasnt quite there might be hope for her yet and she had more urgent things to worry about one was a volcanic hiccup the equivalent of an earthquake aftershock only with lava another was getting lost in this literally tractless wilderness and not making it out again mres and plastic water bottles made her pack feel as if she were carrying another person piggyback everybody who was going forward had a gps set that ought to make getting lost less of a worry and it did up to a point everybody had a compass too but the damn things swung at what looked like random the supervolcano hadnt belched out much iron in relative terms but there was plenty to confuse anything that relied on the earths magnetic field gps systems didnt of course that didnt mean kelly trusted hers completely when sorrows came they came not single spies but in battalions she laughed at herself where the hell had she come up with that bit of shakespeare from an undergrad lit course only showed that generaled requirements didnt always go to waste off she went with her colleagues the dust and ashes scrunched under her hiking boots shed let herself fall out of shape since she got married too well things couldve been worse she could have been slogging through mud as deep as she was tall still nothing manmade visible goneall gone buried on the way to fossilization she looked ahead even the mountains seemed strange so much volcanic rubbish had fallen on them it had changed their heights and their shapes that should have been impossible it wasnt not to the supervolcano scanning the mountainsides with binoculars she did spot a few dead pines sticking up through the dust and ash back in the day you could see dead trunks from the big fires of the s sticking up through snow colin said those reminded him of the stubble on a corpses cheek kelly never would have thought of that herself which didnt mean it didnt fit larry skrtel called back to missoula he had a satellite phone like the gps those still worked they also carried little radios whose signals would cross the ruined land geoff rheinburg called them dick tracy wrist radios they werent quite but that came close enough except for the noises the geologists made the world was eerily quiet no insects buzzed or chirped no birds called no hawks or vultures glided overhead at night no coyotes yipped and yowled no dogs howled at the moon no cats screamed no mosquitoes imitated tiny dentists drills it wasnt the worst of the mosquito season nowhere near but there should have been a few youre right larry exclaimed when kelly mentioned that he made as if to slap himself upside the head i didnt even notice hard to notice something that isnt there professor rheinburg said now we know what the supervolcano really was kelly said when her comrades sent her blank looks she explained the worlds biggest bug bombwhat else they groaned shed been sure they would now thats what i call overkill skrtel said then he paused thoughtfully or is it nothing smaller than a supervolcano could even slow the bastards down its not just the worlds biggest bug bomb rheinburg said its the worlds biggest people bomb too no one said anything to that for some little while the united states one of the most thoroughly measured and counted countries in the world couldnt come close to being sure how many people the supervolcano had killed not even two years after the eruption somewhere between two and three million that was the best guess somewhere between five and ten times that many were still homeless refugee camps were a staple of standup comics and latenight talkshow hosts they werent so funny if you were stuck in one and if youd ended up in one after the supervolcano blew odds were you remained stuck there you could get out if you landed a job somewhere but plenty of other people most of them not from camps were chasing that job too and there were hardly any jobs to land to begin with colins daughter had managed to get out kelly had never met vanessa ferguson colin was tightlipped about her kelly gathered that the guy for whom shed moved to denver the guy who was indirectly to blame for her landing in camp constitution was his age maybe older what that said about vanessa kelly didnt want to know but she was out she was doing some nationalservice gig salvaging what could be salvaged from the eastern fringes of the eruption zone there was a government program that did make sense no two ways about it because the supervolcano wasnt done causing casualties oh no it was just getting started this would be the third harvest in a row that didnt happen in what used to be the worlds breadbasket well the worlds breadbasket had taken one in the breadbasket how many people would go hungry on account of that no way to know not yet but the number wasnt small and how many would freeze on account of climate change from the supervolcano some already had frozen but that would only get worse canada the northern united states scandinavia england russia drop los angeles average temperature by five degrees celsius nine in the scale she still used when she wasnt being scientific and you could still live there drop londons or moscows or torontos living in any of those places after the climate change fully kicked in didnt strike her as a whole lot of fun besides how hard would the sudden cooling hit all the big agricultural areas that werent caught by the ashfall again nobody knew for sure everybody would find out probably the hard way kelly did know the computer models werent encouraging easier to lay your worries aside when you were exhausted which she was and she and everyone else would only get tireder as they slogged on toward the caldera maybe i should have listened to colin and stayed home she thought but that was bare heartbeats before sleep dragged her under she felt more like going on the next morning she felt enough more like going on in fact that even an mre for breakfast didnt discourage her much the instant coffee was nasty but it packed a caffeine punch away they went the wind was at their backs blowing toward the crater all the same kelly got whiffs of sulfur in the air it was as if the devil had set up shop in the phenomenal world she shuddered yeah it was just like that every so often the geologists stopped to collect specimens mass spectrography of samples of dust and rock and ash from varying distances from the caldera would tell them all kinds of interesting things about what went into the magma pool deep underground that was the hope anyhow right this minute kelly was just glad the technology had come far enough that the samples could be little tiny ones she didnt want to carry one more thing than she had to for that matter she didnt want to carry the stuff she did have to her backpacking muscles were as out of practice as her hiking muscles when she complained about it daniel olson gave her a crooked grin itll get light faster than you wish it would said the geologist from missoula trust me on that one yeah yeah she said much of what she was carrying was food and water she had enough to get her through the planned length of the trek and a little more besides if something went wrong though they were liable to find out how far they could go on empty in due course larry skrtel consulted his gps and announced well were inside yellowstone national park i hate to tell you but its not worth the price of admission any more kelly said that was definitely in the running for the understatementoftheyear prize the ground here was as ugly a graybrown mashup of dust and ash as it had been half a mile farther northwest here and there igneous bouldersyes there were plentygave the landscape variety they made it ugly in a different way daniel tugged on larrys sleeve like a spoiled sixyearold he sounded like one too squealing i wanna see the buffaloes and the grizzly bears and the wolves and things too in a high thin voice kelly laughed if you didnt laugh youd cry the usgs geologists face was only half visible what with his breathing mask and hat but he seemed closer to tears than to mirth so do i man he answered softly so do i yellowstones wideopen spacesits wideopen protected spaceshad saved bison from extinction at the end of the nineteenth century it hadnt quite been the only place where grizzlies still lived in the lower fortyeight but it had held more of them than any other area of similar size wolves had been a recent reintroduction here but theyd done well enough to leave the park and start raiding nearby farmers flocks and herds all gone now buffalo herds grizzlies wolf packs gone gone gone hell the whole park was gone and it wasor had beenbigger than several states so were the nearby flocks and herds and crops and the ones not so nearby too i loved this place kelly said we all did geoff rheinburg agreed i loved it she repeated i did but theres nothing left not even the parts that didnt fall into the caldera its off the mapi mean literally off the map you can still figure out what some of the mountains are but even thats not easy tell me about it her chairman said ive been photographing them as we go by to help work out the changes in the local geography something far overhead made grukking noises a raven kelly exclaimed in amazement it was the first one theyd seen i feel like something out of edgar allan poei want it to go nevermore not me daniel said during the civil war when sherman was marching through georgia he said hed wreck it so well that even a crow flying across it would have to carry provisions i was looking to see if the raven had a backpack you suppose its carrying mres kelly asked wouldnt that be cruelty to animals rheinburg put in they could always bitch about their alleged nourishment seriously though something may sprout where it craps daniel said seeds in the shit a little extra fertilizer thats one of the ways life starts up again after big eruptions a million ravens crapping for a million years kelly shook her head it wouldnt take anywhere near so long a million years from now the supervolcano probably would have gone off again and mellowed again afterwards in geological terms these things healed fast it was only in terms of human lifetimes that they seemed longlasting only she shook her head again scientists had invented all kinds of other time frames to help them grasp things that happened very slowly or very quickly but a human lifetime and its smaller divisionsthose were what they lived in the same as other people they reached the crater at the end of the fourth day the air smelled of brimstone and metal it smelled hot too or kelly thought so even if no thermometer showed a rise in temperature till they got very close to the edge when they did when they did it was with a certain amount or more than a certain amount of trepidation one little burp from the supervolcano something so small as to be unnoticeable next to the eruption that dropped so much of yellowstone into the frying pan would be plenty to make sure the presumptuous geologists didnt make it back to the humvees no doubt about the heat at the edge kelly could see the air shimmer the way it did above a desert highway in the summeror more to the point above a burner on a stove the odor of sulfur was stronger now had people got the idea for hell by staring down into active volcanoes kelly wouldnt have been surprised with the others she collected mineral samples from the caldera lip she carefully labeled them using the gps to get her exact position one of these days she thought ill have to see where this would have been in yellowstone before the supervolcano went off like the others shed loved the great park and mourned its lossalong with so much else but that would be one of these days she had no idea when shed come back to the caldera or whether she ever would she stepped forward till she could look down and look across it was like sticking your head into an oven on high you could do it for a little while but not long more of the lava half a mile down had congealed into rock than had been true when she flew over the crater in a learjet she snapped a few photos then she had to step back and cool off for a bit the rest of the geologists were doing the same thing awe softened larry skrtels features as he drew back from the very edge kelly knew he wasnt a man who awed easily the scale of the thing he said its amazing kelly agreed it was too big for anything so mundane as mere words more than heat shimmers blurred the calderas far wall it had to be thirtyfive or forty miles away this was a bigger eruption than the one that had created yellowstone more than half an hour at freeway speeds how many thousands of years would it be before there were any roads here again much less freeways kelly stepped up for another look something out there on the crater floor geysered upward but that wasnt boiling water it was melted rock she got a pic a good one she saw when she checked her viewfinder gold and red against the grayno things down there hadnt calmed down nor would they for a long time to come anywhere on earth but here except maybe on the big island of hawaii that would have been spectacular astonishing even newsworthy in this place what had gone before utterly dwarfed it such minor spurts happened all the time satellites recorded some of them others just made small squiggles on seismographs too many trees had fallen in this forest no one cared if the next one was noisy after a while geoff rheinburg said people we have done what we came to do now lets get the hell out of here kelly couldnt remember hearing an idea she liked better xi winter back in his socal days rob ferguson had thought the season a bummer yeah it got kind of chilly yeah sometimes it rained when it did the freeways clogged there were landslides if it rained a lot every once in a while one would squash a car on pacific coast highway that was socal that was socal before the supervolcano erupted this was guilford maine in the third winter after the eruption comparing one to the other was like comparing odouls to everclear he carried a rifle through pine woods during the second world war the germans and russians whod fought in front of murmansk might have carried rifles through weather like this or maybe it had been warmer and less windy up there just for a moment he wondered what murmansk was like these days this particular shiver had nothing to do with the deep freeze in which he walked better not to think about something like that or maybe it wasnt the only reason murmansk had ever been even slightly habitable was that it got the gulf streams last gasps if it was still getting them it might have stayed slightly habitable but the gulf stream was supposed to be in trouble too hed heard that with the gulf of mexico and the caribbean suddenly so much cooler less water was going out from them into the atlantic if that was true murmansk wouldnt be the only place getting the shaft as a result all of northwestern europe would go up against the walla wall made of blocks of ice that was northwestern europes worry though his worry was shooting something to help guilford through this latest winter of its distress the few summer months had let the government send in what supplies it could but even the government was running out of things and couldnt get more for love or increasingly worthless money if people up here were going to make it they would have to make it on their own i could go back to california rob thought hed been telling himself the same thing since squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles found themselves stranded in the middle of maine the advantages were obvious rain not snowat least not snow all the goddamn time electricity tv the net he hadnt sent or got an email in months only one thing was wrong with that picture he liked it here he couldnt imagine any place hed rather be guilford would have been a neat place to live even before the supervolcano cast it back on its own resources everybody knew everybody elses business and all the people figured they had a right to know and everybody chipped in to help everybody else too it wasnt like socal where half the time you didnt even know the name of the people who lived next door to you and there was lindsey hed never figured himself for the sort who fell in love which made him slower to recognize it when it happened than he might have been but he knew what was what nowknew it and liked it which surprised him all over again the wind howled down from the northwest snow flew almost horizontally even in his extraheavyduty ll bean winter gear and a bright vest over it rob was chilly but he wasnt any worse than chillywell except for the few square inches of face he had to expose to the blizzard what he really hated about weather like this was that a super bowl crowd of moose could amble by a hundred yards away and hed never know it unlike so many things that really mattered moose were lots of meat on the hoof you couldnt afford to miss them if they were around if sooner or later maine would run out of them if people north and west of the interstate had to get through every winter on moose meat it would be sooner rob didnt know what theyd do about that they were doing what they could lots of people were raising pigs and chickens unlike other livestock those made do at least in part on human garbage with greenhouses and sometimes even in carefully tended ground outside some of the root vegetables of the far north got enough of a growing season to mature rob had never tasted or heard of a mangelwurzel before he got to maine the food in california had to be better than this something shot past him seen and then gone he started to raise the rifle but lowered it again a moment later feeling foolish you needed a shotgun to go after a flying goose trying with a rifle only wasted ammo waste these days felt criminal he laughed at himself two years here and youre turning into a new englander he thought but what he felt wasnt really oldfashioned new england frugality no it was postsupervolcano desperation when you used something these days you could never be sure youd be able to replace it that flurry of motion was a fox he took them for granted now though the first one that darted in front of his suv had freaked him out he supposed there would always be foxes and weasels and mice and squirrels theyd find enough to eat whether people could or not sure as hell a squirrel chittered at him from high in a pine if hed had a instead of a he might have knocked it down rob had nothing against squirrel meat one more delicacy if that was the word hed met here but hit a squirrel with what was originally a military round and you didnt commonly leave enough to be worth salvaging hed had to walk farther to reach the woods than he would have at the start of the winter before and quite a bit farther than he would have the winter before that like the moose the firewood had held out so far what would they do when it ran out you couldnt raise baby pines to a useful size on table scraps in a few months the wind eased up the snow kept falling but more nearly vertically rob could see farther that way or thought he could maybe his eyebrows were just a little less frozen that over there in the electricorange vest was another hunter moose hardly ever wore vests like that someone had got shot near doverfoxcroft in spite of a dayglo vest hed lived officially it was listed as an accident unofficially people said the guy whod plugged him didnt get along with him still as near a stranger as made no difference even if hed been here more than two years rob didnt know about that one way or the other more motion this time straight ahead damned if that wasnt a bull moose sure as the ghost of teddy roosevelt rob did his best to impersonate a bright orange pine sapling the moose dug at the snow with a big splayed hoof not much grass had come up during this abbreviated sortasummer rob would have bet the moosed come up empty and he would have lost the bet too because it lowered its dewlapped head and started pulling up whatever it had found yeah you go ahead and chow down robs mouth silently shaped the words fog gusted from his lips if hed worn glasses it might have screwed him up not a sound came out to spook the moose slowly smoothly he raised the rifle to his shoulder a gunshot next thing he knew he was lying in the snow he couldnt figure out how hed got there he didnt hurt or anythingand then all of a sudden he did quite a bit as a matter of fact fuck he said in lieu of howling like a wolf no wolves in maine yet or none anybody knew about anyhow from how far up in canada would they have to come however far it was they hadnt got here and rob had other things to worry about it felt as if one of those wolves that werent here was gnawing on his left leg he wondered if he wanted to look down if that bullet had shattered tib and fib they were liable to have to take the leg off a cripple in the ice agejust what i always wanted to be blood on the snow more of it every second it steamed like his breath breath bloodboth showed life going out he hiked up his jeans and his long johns each had a neat piece bitten out his stomach lurched when he saw that his leg had a piece bitten out too but then he realized the wound was a groove it had got the muscle on the inside of his calf but it hadnthe didnt think it hadsmashed the bones to smithereens he yanked a hanky out of his pocket and packed the bleeding gouge with it not exactly sterile but hed worry about that later little by little he realized hed probably be around to worry about it the other hunter lumbered over to him the moose was long gone dude what happened the other guy said brilliantly some dumb asshole went and shot me rob answered the fuck you think happened his wits began to work again after a fashion you got anything i can use to hold this bandage in place sure do the other hunter pulled a fat rubber band out of his trouser pocket what he was doing with it in there god only knew rob took it gratefully any which way in the war he would have dusted the wound with sulfa powder he would have done it now too if only hed had any another man came up im so sorry i was aiming for the moose he had to be the guy whod nailed rob yeah well you got some long pig here rob said the local only stared at him so he had no idea what long pig was clueless git rob thought aloud he went on look i dont think its too bad can you guys get me back into guilford and let them patch me up he had one good leg the hunters made animated crutches the fellow whod shot him turned out to be ralph obrian who worked at the shell station down the street from the trebor mansion inn when he had anything to do there im so goddamn embarrassed he said i never done nothing like that before swear to jesus i didnt believe me once is twice too often rob said through clenched teeth the leg hurt like a mad son of a bitch now and sparklers of pain burned him whenever it touched the ground or bumped obrian who was on that side of him he would be rob thought it didnt hurt enough to make him want to pass out or anything he rather wished it would have they were almost back to town when they came upon a middleaged woman hauling a big sack of rice to her outlying house on a sled in a matter of moments the rice was off the sled and rob was on it the woman put the sack on her back and trudged away the clinic did what it could for guilford there was a real hospital in doverfoxcrofta little one but still rob hoped he wouldnt have to go there at the clinic dr bhattacharya said oh dear me how did this happen the small brown man sounded like somebody who did tech support from mumbai damn venezuelans are giving the moose aks rob answered deadpan for a split second the doctor took him seriously then he snorted through his bushy mustache you are probably not at deaths door he said in his lilting english sending rob a dirty look good rob said what really happened was im a crappy shot obrian broke in yeah well listen mr crappy shot go on over to the school and let lindsey know what happened to me okay and stop at the mansion inn and tell the guys too rob said ralph obrian nodded and scurried away seeming relieved at the excuse to be gone dr bhattacharya brandished a needle rob wished he had an excuse to get the hell out of there too i will give you the local anesthetic the doc said it will sting then you will grow numb then i will clean the wound and i will suture it you will experience some pain when the local anesthetic wears off i will give you pills for it they will help less than you wish they would i will also give you antibiotics have any more good news in spite of the way robs leg was yelling at him he felt the needle go in and the sting of the local he felt them several times in fact because dr bhattacharya stuck him again and again then blessedly he stopped feeling anything south of his knee the doctor went to work when he finished he said let me see if we have a set of crutches that will fit you your height is im sixone rob answered using crutches through snow didnt sound like something he much wanted to do the alternative seemed to be staying right here till he healed though crutches then if they had them dr bhattacharya pulled a pair from a closet shook his head and put them back too short he muttered and tried again the next set he found made him nod yes these will do he used set screws to adjust their length six feet one you said uhhuh see how you do here then rob tried hed used crutches before but that sprained ankle was half a lifetime ago now the knack didnt come right back he swung himself across the linoleum of the clinic floor dr bhattacharya gave him a vial of vicodin and one of amoxycillin what doesnt kill me makes me stronger somebody said that who he couldnt remember if it was true hed just gained some serious strength points and if he could make it back to the trebor mansion inn without breaking his other leg or his neck hed pick up some more then the local would wear off he wasnt looking forward to that even with drugs in his anorak pocket maybe it would make him stronger too somehow he couldnt work up much enthusiasm for finding out lindsey rushed in just before he was going to leave the clinic i got marya to cover my class for me she panted ralph said you got shot my god ralph said i got shot rob echoed something in the way that was phrased made him go on did he say who shot me no who he did her face was a studydisbelief amazement and rage chasing one another across her features ill murder him she said when her mouth stopped hanging open dont rob said wearily it was just one of those stupid things it wasnt like he meant to do itand im not too badly damaged anyway for a gunshot wound it is very minimal dr bhattacharya agreed for a gunshot wound lindsey said not for any other kind of wound the doctor didnt tell her she was wrong would you break trail for me while i go back to the inn rob asked her thatd help come to my place instead she said its closer and you wont have to climb stairs and a ladder to get to your room ill do that he said you bet i will i should get shot more often she snorted and held the clinic door open for him bryce millers alarm clock went off like a bomb it was a windup timex of uncertain but ancient vintage its ticking was loud enough to be annoying when he noticed it it kept rotten time hed bought it for two bucks at a goodwill store right after he landed the job at junipero high that was six months ago now these days one like it would cost at least ten times as much likely more six months ago power in la had been pretty reliable now now all the supervolcano sludge in the columbia had screwed the fancy turbines up there but good the grid had other problems too but that was the juicy one so la had power a few hours a day a few days a week bryce vaguely remembered reading bucharest had been like that back when the communist dictator old nutty whatshisname ran romania the cold war was only history to him and seemed almost as far removed from the here and now as his pet hellenistic poets the cold war here and now was the war against real physical cold the worlds politics were still screwed up but not that particular way los angeles remained lucky it might get chilly here but chilly wasnt arctic and bryce was awake once that alarm started clattering he would have had a hard time staying dead with a rented truck hed spent a small fortune moving up to what they called west hills he was only a couple of miles from junipero high here these days that was walking distance he had a gas stove he could light a burner with a match when the electric flamestarter didnt work that let him boil water to make coffee to go with his bagel he liked real cream in his coffee but he used coffeemate with sugar coffeemate kept basically forever cream didnt keep at all without refrigeration the apartment had a refrigerator it made a fair icebox when he could get ice which wasnt often enough out he went carrying a briefcase and an umbrella it wasnt raining right this minute but you couldnt trust it even in summer after the eruption let alone in winter hed work up a sweat by the time he got to school but he didnt worry about it he wouldnt be the only one when he got to the campus the first thing he did was check his box with email scarce and unreliable paper was making a comeback a typewriteran ancient manual dredged up god knew whereclacked on a secretarys desk when you lacked what youd had before you did the best you could with what you could find or welcome back to the turn of the twentieth century bulletins and orders might be typewritten but they got xeroxed when the power did come on junipero dished out less bullshit than hed heard public schools had to endure all the same the administration had some pretty good fascists in trainingor would they be inquisitors here bryce taught latin world history and us history in the latter he was indeed staying a chapter ahead of the kids maybe next year if the world hadnt ended by then the powers that be honest to god would let him take a swing at greek or maybe they wouldnt and if they didnt maybe he wouldnt be so very upset seeing what tough sledding the students made of latin they might not grok greek at all us history first period in he walked to go over the causes of the civil war one more time before the kids showed up by junipero standards it was a big class twentythree students no public school wasnt like this the kids were totally socal which was to say almost everything under the sun hispanics irish a very bright jewish kid named perry ginsberg who seemed to be stoned most of the time a dark pretty girl named singh which probably meant she was a sikh a vietnamese kid a korean no africanamericans though there werent many at juniperofewer bryce thought than there were jews it would have been funny if it werent sad fewer black parents than jewish ones trusted a catholic school not to mess up their children he covered the points he needed to cover slavery he said thats the biggest cause all the talk about states rights and other stuff its just a smokescreen for slavery the south wanted to keep it and make it grow the north wanted to stop it and eventually roll it back most of them took notes a few didnt give a damn their parents were wasting the cash they spent here what could you do though question bryce nodded towards a raised hand yes the sikh girl nodded how do you know it was slavery most of all what is the evidence would she be a lawyer when she grew up or a biochemist bryce was just glad hed done his review before the class started he had the answer at his fingertips well lets look at south carolinas ordinance of secession south carolina was the first state out of the union remember when the ordinance talks about why the states leaving it says these statesthe free oneshave assumed the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions and have denied the right of property established in fifteen of the states and recognized by the constitution they have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery they have permitted the establishment among them of societies whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and elointhat means stealthe property of the citizens of other states they have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes and those who remain have been incited by emissaries books and pictures to servile insurrection it goes on for several more paragraphs after that instead of reading them though lets look at the confederate constitution that was the law the south set up for itself to live by a lot of its modeled after the us constitution but some isnt heres article one section nine part three no bill of attainder ex post facto law or law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed the confederate constitution talks about the right of slaveholders to keep their property in a couple of other places too he looked at her so is that evidence it is she nodded gravely right then he was a little relieved to have no black kids in the class reminding them southern whites had been sure enough that their ancestors were no more than cattle with hands to fight a war about it wouldnt have been comfortable which was putting things mildly easier to sound dispassionate about it while they were out of the room so to speak or maybe the fact that he still worried about it meant the country had taken longer to dig out from under the burden of slavery than it would to clean up after the supervolcano eruption and if that wasnt a scary thought he didnt know what would be latin was cleaner it didnt seem so intimately connected to the world they lived in well yes the romans were slaveowners too well yes the hispanic kids or most of them spoke a language that was one of todays versions of vulgar latin details details trying to explain what cases were all about took up a lot of his time when he was in college hed taken german before latin so the dead language had confused him less anyhow the kids might well have had an easier time with calculus some of them were having an easier time with calculus then there was sasha smyslovsky he spoke russian at home and russian had more cases than latin his trouble wasnt grammarit was vocabulary people who grew up with english and even more so people who grew up with spanish could figure out a lot of latin words from their modern cognates russian though didnt have that kind of relationship to latin sasha was a junior so he was sixteen maybe seventeen to bryce he looked about thirteen all the boys in his classes even the football players who could have cleaned his clock without breaking a sweat looked like kids to him he worked hard not to show it hed hated his teachers condescending to him when he was in high school that had to be a constant of human or at least teenage nature some of the girls in his classes looked like kids to him too some of them struck him as seventeen going on thirtyfive he also worked hard not to show that he didnt want to give them ideas and he didnt want some of the ideas they gave him more than he ever had before he understood how high school teachers slipped every once in a while he never said word one about that to susan he didnt want to give her ideas either if he had he knew what she would have given him a piece of her mind and a sharpedged one at that world history struck him as an exercise in political correctness every ethnic group made its contributionits important contribution its wonderful contributionto the way things ended up working out kalmuks papua new guineans you betcha and youd better be able to give them back on the test female kalmuks gay lesbian and bisexual papua new guineans of course thered be a question about them two questions more likely maybe history courses had been all about dead white males once upon a time no certainly they had world history was supposed to be the antidote to that from time to time bryce wondered if the cure wasnt worse than the disease they were paying him not to wonder about such things no they were paying him to keep his big trap shut if he did wonder about them and keep it shut he didwhere the students and the people who were paying him could hear anyhow susan got an earful though when his cell phone had power so did colin ferguson the police lieutenant laughed his gruff laugh didnt you take hypocrisy in college he said well even if you didnt this is your postgraduate course tell me about it bryce exclaimed is the whole world like this pretty much colin wasnt laughing any more bryce remembered hed been passed over for chief of the san atanasio pd not least because he had the dangerous habit of saying what he thought and i just stuck my foot in my face bryce thought unhappily after a beat colin went on you get used to it after a while most of the time anyhow i guess bryce wasnt nearly sure he wanted to get used to it he wondered if he had any choice no there were always choices socrates had made his sure and look what it got him changing the subject looked like a good idea you ever hear anything from rob and vanessa he asked about his ex with no more than a momentary twinge well rob got shot colin answered shot that was the last thing bryce expected to hear jesus what happened i got a card from him a few days ago he says somebody mistook him for a moose he says he isnt eating that much he says there isnt that much to eat where hes at in maine and he says hes healing up which is the most important part uhhuh bryce nodded not that colin could see him that sounded like rob all right it also sounded quite a bit like colin himself his firstborn would have got pissed off had anyone told him so though bryce tried again and vanessa still on the scavenger circuit she doesnt write much and shes not any place where she can power up her phoneor where she can get bars even if she does i keep reminding myself shes good at landing on her feet you know about that now that you mention it yes bryce tried to sound light and feared he made a hash of it on the way to one of those landings on her feet vanessad kicked him in the teeth the bulgarian judge gave her a for technical ability when she did it too and for artistic merit well what could you do shed walked out of his life four and a half years ago now he couldnt do a damn thing that was what what he ought to do was forget hed ever known her and spend all his time thinking about susan who actually wanted to be with him much as he would have liked to hed long since discovered he couldnt do that either colin still had louise on his mind too even if he wished he didnt no wonder theyd stayed friends no no wonder at all what bryce could do now was grade papers as a matter of fact that was what he had to do and so as soon as he got off the phone with colin he went ahead and did it the late not so great town of fredonia kansas wasnt quite in the middle of nowhere it was in the southeastern part of nowhere or at least of kansas since the supervolcano blew kansas and nowhere had become effectively synonymous as far as vanessa ferguson was concerned kansas and nowhere were synonymous long before the supervolcano blew since shed escaped camp constitution to pick the bones of people whod made the mistake of feeling otherwise she kept quiet on that score fredonia kansas also wasnt in the middle of a marx brothers movie vanessa made the mistake of mentioning it to the rest of the refugees from the refugee camp she worked with they all looked at her as if shed just sprouted an extra head evenno especiallywhen she started singing hail hail fredonia vanessa we already know youre weird merv saunders told her with what sounded like exaggerated patience do you have to go and advertise it oh give me a fucking break she snarled he was close to twenty years older than she was shouldnt that have been enough of a head start to give him some kind of clue about the marx brothers evidently not what really pissed her off wasnt that he didnt have a clue what really pissed her off was that he didnt want a clue he wasnt just a yahoo he was proud to be a yahoo he was the kind of yahoo who didnt know what a yahoo actually was too if he didnt know about groucho harpo chico and hapless margaret dumont he for sure wouldnt know about lemuel gullivers last voyage winter in fredonia wouldnt have been a picnic before the eruption winter in fredonia since the eruption reminded vanessa of what shed heard about fargo or maybe winnipeg sometimes it got up into the twenties sometimes it warmed up to zero and sometimes it didnt fredonia hadnt had a whole lot of trees when the supervolcano was biding its time this was kansas for crying out loud just about all the trees it had had were dead now if the ashfall hadnt done for them those upgraded winters bloody well had so they were barebranched and graying they reminded vanessa of human corpsesyou could tell right away that they wouldnt spring back to life when or nowadays if spring came around again and their gray starkness and that of the rest of the local landscape just made the cell phone relay towers all the more obviousand obtrusive the towers here like the ones in la and denver had been disguised as trees with brown plastic trunks and green plastic leaves they hadnt made what youd call convincing trees neither colors nor shapes were spoton but they looked better than bare aluminum scaffolding and wires and whatever would have because they were only approximations of trees vanessa and her family and friends had noticed them every so often mostly when out driving somebody as a matter of fact it was bryce which vanessa had deleted from her internal hard drive tagged them alien listening devices the name stuck in her little crowd here in drab abandoned fredonia kansas the relay points honest to god did look alien their plastic leaves were still green snowspeckled green right now their plastic trunks still brown sooner or later the sun would fade them with the sun so feeble nowadays it was likely to be later no matter how out of place they seemed their wiring and electronics remained valuable the salvage team methodically cut them down and cut them up wed better be careful vanessa said we dont want the aliens to find out were messing with their stuff she meant it for a joke she was going to explain how her friends had called the relays alien listening devices had the rest of the team liked her better she would have got a laugh but the others disassembling the relay only scowled aliens give me a fucking break one of them said bite me vanessa answered sweetly knock if off both of you saunders sounded weary one of his jobs along with this governmentsponsored graverobbing was putting out little fires in his crew before they turned into big ones nobodyd murdered anybody yet or even assaulted with intent to maim which proved he was good at what he did vanessa wanted to yell he started it how many times had she done that back home with one brother or the other sometimes it worked and sometimes it didnt but it was always worth a try not here merv saunders didnt care whod started it he just wanted it to stop and he had the power to bind and to loose he could kick somebody off the team if you got kicked off you went out of the devastated zone on the next truck that came in to pick up salvageables you didnt get to go off on your own once you left the devastated zone either oh no the powers that be were crueler than that if you got kicked out you went straight back into a refugee camp staying in a camp was punitive the authorities could see that so could anybody whod ever been in one but millions of people remained stuck in them the authorities couldnt see how to put them anywhere else not enough houses not enough money to build them not enough money for anyone to afford them even if they got built either the economy had been rotten before the supervolcano went off with the midwest essentially gone it wasnt just rotten any more the vultures had eaten the meat off its bones and the rest of the poor chilly world wasnt much better off the usa had been the engine that pulled the train well the engine had gone off the rails they slept in the best quarters fredonia offered it wasnt a motel but it might as well have been a motel with no electricity and no running water happy fucking day the bed was more comfortable than a sleeping bag the windows in vanessas room werent broken either so they shielded her from the freezing wind and that was about as much good as she could find to say about the place her father had stayed at a motel when he went to yellowstone she remembered him bitching about it that was back in the days when things still worked though now now she was stuck in this cold miserable place with a bunch of people who couldnt stand her shed blown that national guardsman so she could end up in a place like this no matter what the people with her thought of her she nodded to herself id do it again too she thought next to camp constitution this wasnt half bad there was a judgment for you nodding again she rolled over and fell asleep xii colin ferguson took his left hand off the bicycles handlebars and held out his arm with the hand pointing up the signal for a right turn he lived on a small lightly traveled street but he was getting into the habit of using hand signals all the time the way hed hit the flickydoodle in his car whenever he changed lanes or turned he swung into his driveway the taurus still waited there so did kellys old honda marshalls little toyota sat by the curb they all ran colin thought they did anyhow none got used much even in weather like this whose cars did with a sigh of relief he swung off the bike and walked it onto the porch he stood there a few seconds letting the rainwater drip from his slicker he slipped off his galoshes hed never worried about galoshes before the supervolcano who had in socal people did now by god before he could open the door kelly did it from the inside they kissed briefly how are you she said as he brought the bike into the front hall hers already stood there parked on old towels he lowered the kickstand on his and put it next to hers ive had days i liked better he walked back into the kitchen and pulled a green bottle out of the pantry after he poured himself a fair knock he asked kelly want some thats okay you know mefar as im concerned laphroaig is kermits last name instead of drinking scotch kelly popped the cap on a red trolley ale she clinked the bottle against his glass sympathies thanks he let smoky fire run down his throat shed improved his taste in beer but hed never been able to persuade her that scotch tasted like anything but medicine more for me he thought what went wrong she asked stupid judge let a perp off not enough evidence to keep him he said the video didnt quite show his fingerprints so we had no grounds for the arrest my ass kelly said helpfully when he stalled yeah that it was a good bust honest to god it was that jerk in a robe he the complaint dissolved into a disgusted growl colin drank more laphroaig how are you bettern that i hope me im tired long way to dominguez on a bike they say the buses are supposed to get more fuel next week but ill believe it when i see it mrmm colin made a different kind of unhappy noise were getting low on gas ourselves what we hijacked from lapd is pretty much gone and we arent getting as much as we still want to use pitcavage isnt what youd call happy about it he drained the glass and filled it again kelly raised an eyebrow you dont do that very often not as often as i did before i started hanging around with you and you can take that to the bank despite what he said colin drank from the refill youve got no idea how wrecked i was the morning we met in yellowstoneand that was after the aspirins and the coffee kicked in but i dont need it so much now good im doing something right anyhow kelly wasnt halfway down her beer yet she liked the taste and a little buzz colin didnt think hed ever seen her smashed though the reverse the reverse wasnt quite true darn right you are he said i wish you were chief and doing things right in that chair pitcavage some of the beat cops called their big boss shitcabbage colin hadnt heard any of the detectives use that particular endearment but they had others for the chief and they had their reasons for using them too what now kelly knew there were things he hadnt said yet his worthless kid colin answered i mean you try to make it easy on em i never busted mine for smoking dope and god knows i could have a million times you never busted me either kelly pointed out you never smoked it in front of me to get my goat no she agreed quietly i knew you didnt like it and it never was that big a deal for me i dont miss itbeers fine okay good even colin said if youd thrown it in my face the way my kids did i dont suppose i wouldve busted you either but i wouldntve wanted to marry you or i dont think i would i sorta figured that out kelly said quiet still uhhuh youre no dummy colin nodded and made that unhappy noise again darren pitcavage though he took another sip of scotch as if to wash the taste of darren pitcavage out of his mouth my kids arent mean mm vanessa is sometimes i guess but shes snarky mean not barbrawl mean if the chief hadnt done some fancy talking thereve been a couple of times his precious flesh and blood mightve found out more about the inside of a jail than he ever wanted to know ah okay now i know where youre coming from kelly said this just happened again too right it did colin agreed theres a bunch of bars and strip joints on hesperus up near braxton bragg and darren thinks its cool to hang out in em maybe he picks up the girls maybe he just watches i dunno but the people who run those places they sure know who he isand who his old man is does he get free drinks ya think kelly said sarcastically yeah like that and the bouncers cut him slack for all i know some of the girls give him a throw to keep him happy but not everybody who goes to those joints knows who lord darren pitcavage is or cares kelly said or cares thats right colin said some of those guys theyd want to rack him up good if they did know this latest fight he got into wasnt like that he was drunk and so was the other fellow the guy said something and darren coldcocked him hes got a nasty left hookhe knocked out two teeth and broke another one let me guessthey called it selfdefense kelly asked right the first time colin said heavily but if that mexicand hit darren then it would have been assault with intent to maim bet your sweet wazoo it would he gulped down the second drink kelly reached into the refrigeratorwhich was like most peoples these days halffull of ice to keep things fresh when the power was out she grabbed some steaks here ill panbroil these thatll help get the taste of today out of your mouth she does know how i work colin thought the power wasnt on right now which meant the stoves fancy electronic brain was useless but natural gas still flowed when kelly turned the knob she started it with a match not elegant but it worked till the gas stopped coming if it did when it did marshall must have had some radar that told him when supper was ready he walked in the front door right when kelly took the pan off the fire smells good he said sure it doesits food isnt it colin said you can drag up a rock and help us eat it and you can tell us how your little brothers doing morbid curiosity probably but he had it morbid or not and it gave him and marshall something to talk about fathers whose grown sons lived their own lives understood how important that could be the rock in question was a chair at the dining room table hes like at the age where everything is no all the time marshall said as he planted his hindquarters on it i mean everything you want to take a nap no you want me to read a book no you want to play outside no you want to turn into a centipede and crawl up the wall no i remember those days colin said realizing hed probably see them again himself at least if he hadnt started firing blanks you all went through em vanessa especially why am i not surprised marshall said with a crooked grin anyway before he could get to anyway kelly broke in did you really ask him if he wanted to turn into a centipede sure marshall answered colin believed him his youngest would never set the world on fire when it came to foreign languages but he was the one whod translated an elephant is eating the beach into spanish in high school he had that surreal turn of thoughtor else he was just flaky he might be cut out to make a writer after all when vanessa had it worst colin said reminiscently i went and asked her if she wanted a cookie no she said the way she did for everything for a couple of months there then what i said sank in and she started to bawl after more than a quarter of a century he could call up the expression of absolute dismay that had filled her face youre mean kelly exclaimed plopping steaks and green beans onto plates but she was fighting laughter fighting and losing as she set his supper in front of him she added you ended up giving her the cookie didnt you who me he returned she started to stare at him as if he were ebenezer scrooge in the flesh even without bushy victorian side whiskers then she realized he was having her on youre impossible she said more fondly than not well i try he replied not without pride if he hadnt fed vanessa that longago vanilla wafer would his cruelty have warped her for life left her sour and embittered and suspicious for instance you never could tell people went off the rails some kind of way and half the time parents and priests and shrinks had no idea why more than half the time but he had given her the goddamn cookie shed wound up sour and embittered and suspicious any which way sometimes you couldnt win hell sometimes you werent sure what game you were playing or even whether you were playing a game at all he washed dishes while kelly dried getting stuff clean with cold water took elbow grease in his wisdom hed got an electric water heater here it had been pretty new when the supervolcano erupted now when it worked they saved the hot water for bathing a gas one would have been better or maybe not these days everything had some kind of electronic controls and when the power went out that probably would have fouled up the whole unit marshall went upstairs to his room it got quiet in there he had a batterypowered lamp with leds that used next to no electricity and he was writing in longhand when the juice was off colin wondered if he could scare up a typewriter from somewhere for the kid he lit a candle you could get those without too much trouble he wouldnt have wanted to write or read or even play cards by candlelight but it was enough to keep you from barking your shin on a table or tripping over a footstool and breaking your fool neck kelly came and sat down beside him on the couch he put his arm around her she snuggled against him for companionship and no doubt for warmth as well the heating system was gas but again the thermostat had a builtin computer chip the people whod designed all this stuff had assumed thered be electricity well colin had assumed the same thing which only went to show that you never could tell and that assuming wasnt always smart i tried to use a manual typewriter in the library at dominguez hills on a paper the other day kelly said echoing his thought of a little while before they put them out where the lights good so people can you know but i dont have the touch for it youve got to hit the keys so hard i felt like a rhino tapdancing on the keyboard ever mess with one before colin asked she shook her head he felt the motion against his shoulder he went on i didi had one when i was a kid but i didnt miss em a bit when computers came in typewriters arentwaddayacallit userfriendly thats it no shit they arent kelly burst out colin gave forth with a startled laugh he wouldnt have said that himself not where she could hear it though he wouldntve hesitated for a second if the intended ear belonged to gabe sanchez or to chief pitcavage she laughed too but the amusement quickly left her face she went on the worlds not userfriendly any more you know colin started to laugh again this time the laugh didnt pass his lips gasoline was a kings ransom a gallon when you could get any most of the time you couldnt not for money or for love sex was a different story the vice unit had closed out a pimps stable of hookers whod been turning tricks to keep his lincoln navigators tank full power came on when it felt like coming on which seemed less and less often day by day not much tv not much internet cell phone connections rare and spotty even good oldfashioned radio took electricity for crying out loud well weve still got books colin said his arm tightened around her and weve got each other and maybe in a while well have a baby to keep us too busy to worry about all the stuff we dont have marshalls probably writing now she said want to go upstairs and see what we can do about that the wench grows bold colin said and squeezed her again up the stairs they went he closed the door to the master bedroom behind them every once in a while these days you read a newspaper story about somebody who killed himself because he couldnt write on his facebook wall or tweet any more im cut off from the whole world so why stay one guys last note read the story said that particular suicider was all of nineteen years old the reporter quoted john donnes no man is an island entire to himself and went on to talk about how in the aftermath of the supervolcano eruption we were all cast back on our individual resources in ways we couldnt have imagined before first yellowstone and then the whole country fell in on themselves actually before the supervolcano went off marshall ferguson wouldnt have been caught dead reading a newspaper that was something else he left to his father and other antiques if he needed news or anything else he got it off the net with his laptop or his smartphone hed got a lot of his fun in the virtual world too he hadnt spent all his free time playing world of warcraft with buddies scattered cross the world but he had spent quite a bit of it in front of a monitor now those choices were mostly closed off even when he had power the wow servers often didnt he had the game on his hard drive of course but playing solo was to the massively multipersonal variant very much as masturbation was to sex better than nothing yeah but nowhere near so good as the real thing when the net was up seeing yesterdays story in tomorrows times just reminded you how pathetic a paper was but it was yesterdays story only if youd found out about it yesterday when you read it for the first time as it ran in the newspaper it seemed new to you sports broadcasters doing the olympics had called some of their shows plausibly live the times these days was plausibly live and seemed authentically live because its competitors which should have been really live were in fact too often dead and damned if marshall didnt find a substitutewell a substitute of sortsfor his mmrpg one of his friends dads dug a beatup maroon box out of the back of a closet and presented it to lucas the game was called diplomacy the board was a map of europe with funky boundaries the way things had looked before world war i rearranged political geography fighting world war i was the point of the game you could negotiate before you moved you had to write down your orders no fancy graphics or anything but it turned out to be a pretty good way for a bunch of guys to kill a saturday afternoon and evening they finished up by candlelight gotta hand it to my old man lucas said after austriahungarys red pieces had conquered a majority of the supply centers on the board and therefore won thats not half bad pretty good in fact marshall agreed thinking his own father would probably get off on it too another question occurred to him how long has your dad had this anyway i mean dig itthe pieces are wood man when was the last time you saw that dad told me he played it when he was in high school lucas answered that put it back in medieval times or maybe further lucas father was paunchy and bald and graying he might not actually have more miles on his odometer than marshalls father did but he sure looked older its a hella good game marshall said and all the players gathered around the board nodded judiciously marshall went on about the only thing wrong with it i can see is how often can we get seven people together and like blow off a whole day more nods from his comrades in skulduggery you didnt have to tell the truth while you were negotiatingonly your final written orders counted a guy named tim with whom marshall had gone to high school and who didnt seem to have done much since eyed the board and the other players when you wargame online theres lots of other people all the time he observed or there used to be when the power worked all the time here its just us yknow people nodded yet again with more or less patience depending on their own personalities tim was fun to hang out with but hed never be the brightest led in the flashlight he was the kind of guy who ordered pie a la mode with ice cream on it he had no clue that hed just said the same thing marshall came out with a little while before tim had no clue about quite a few things but hed done a better than decent job of playing italy in the game winning with italy wasnt impossible but marshall could see it wouldnt be easy either lucas said it may not be as tough as you guys are making it out to be i mean we arent all stuck in ninetofives his mouth twisted no matter how much we wish we were he was living with his dad the same way marshall was living at his old family house three of the others shared an apartment that would have been about right for one of them tim had lived out of his car for a while till gas got too scarce and too expensive to make that practical now he was just kind of around maybe he crashed on one girlfriend or another or on one girlfriend and another marshall didnt know the details these days with so many people from sea to shining sea scuffling asking a whole bunch of questions was the worst kind of bad form well try marshall said what else can we do louise ferguson fidgeted while she waited for the bus it wassurprise late again when cities had trouble getting enough fuel for public transit and police cars you knew the world was going to hell in a handbasket it wouldnt be going to hell in anything requiring gasoline that was for sure like most cars hers sat in the garage under her condo almost all the time a monument to the way things had been before the supervolcano erupted she hoped mr nobashi would understand he still drove in to the ramen works two or three times a week but then he was a fancy executive not an administrative assistant and he got his pay straight from the home office in hiroshima with the way the dollar had nosedived against the yen since the eruption that made his salary go a lot further too here came the bus at last it left a black plume of diesel fumes behind it as it rumbled north on sword beach it wasnt supposed to do that it was supposed to be clean and not stinky god only knew the last time anyoned serviced that overworked engine before the eruption even people who didnt think of themselves as green would have had conniptions about that smokebelching bus not today josephine anything that dumped co into the air and helped fight the supervolcanos big chill was wonderful even if it smelled nasty the bus stopped louise handed the driver a buck and a half like a lot of socal towns san atanasio had stopped using computerized bus passes when the computers didnt run all the time you couldnt rely on them the way people had for so long you had to make do with simpler things mr nobashi for instance had brought an abacus into the ramen works it wasnt just for show either the way his fingers flicked the beads was a sight to behold patty from the farm belt called it a caution he was about as fast and accurate with the abacus as louise was with a calculator next thing you knew hed dredge up a slide rule from somewhere only a few cars shared sword beach with the bus most of the traffic was bicycles with occasional fullsized trikes and skateboards from what the papers said random street crime except for bike thefts was way down getting away was harder than it had been and people were more willing to chase you the world was less impersonal less withdrawn then it had been when the automobile was king the bus stopped at sword beach and braxton bragg boulevard louise got out there because it turned the wrong way on braxton bragg back in the day she wouldve grumbled at walking a couple of blocks from the bus stop to her workplace when everybody did it it was no big deal no big deal when it wasnt raining anyhow right this minute it wasnt the spring sun the sun that the supervolcano eruption had turned pale and watery was shining as brightly as it ever did these days louise had stuck an umbrella in her purse just the same no guarantee it wouldnt be raining when she came out this afternoon and wasnt that a hell of a thing if you couldnt trust socal weather what could you trust nothing nothing and nobody louises mouth thinned to a bloodless line she made herself relax because otherwise shed screw up the lipstick shed so carefully applied before she left but if having james henry hadnt taught her that lesson once and for all she couldnt imagine what would do the trick here was ramen central the sliding security gate was open the only connection between the property and the outside world steel fencing topped by razor wire protected the rest of the perimeter for that matter razor wire topped the gate too despite fence and wire theyd still had stuff disappear from parked cars that was why they had a fulltime armed security guard he touched the brim of his drillsergeant hat in what was almost but not quite a salute mornin mrs ferguson he said good morning steve she said shed given up trying to get the big hispanic guy to call her louise hed served a long hitch in the army hed fought in afghanistan and he had a strong sense of rank and hierarchy sometimes all you could do was roll with things she remembered having that thought before she went into the building the power was on which made everything seem almost the way it was before the supervolcano threw things for a loop almost but as with steves touch of the hat brim not quite before the supervolcano she wouldnt have heard anybody here burst into tears which she did right as the door closed behind her it wasnt just anybody either it was patty whod been here since dirt and who as far as louise could tell had a soul machined from the kind of steel that went into armor plate for tanks these werent little sniffly tears either she was weeping and wailing as if shed just found out her oldest son had been eaten by bears hoping patty hadnt found out something too much like that louise rushed toward the older womans office she almost ran into mr nobashi who was coming out the salaryman looked upset too not only because patty was crying but also louise judged on account of what had made her cry whatever it was he must have told it to patty and the telling must have set her off oh mrs ferguson he said he wasnt terrific with english what he did to her name usually made her want to snicker not this morning and what he did next scared the crap out of her he bowed low the bow of inferior to superior and went on so sorry i am so sorry so sorry for what what happened louise managed pattyd told gruesome stories about the manager from japan whod worked here before mr nobashi the guyd thought the rules here were the same as they were on the other side of the pacific hed gone home in a hurry and the company got hit with a big juicy sexualharassment suit mr nobashi had to know about that in all the time louise had worked here shed never heard that hed fallen off the path of virtue and if he chose now to do it would he come on to patty she was about as sexy as a snapping turtle and had the same kind of wattle under her chin wouldnt mr nobashi decide to try and butter his biscuits with somebody younger and cuter but louise turned out to be wasting her time worrying about that particular misfortune hiroshima call me just now mr nobashi said oh jeeesus christ how i can tell you home office say with times so hard we not profitable enough in america they close this office they send me home you people he gave that humiliated bowthat had to be the kind it wasagain so sorry close this office the words sounded as strange as wrong coming from louises lips as they had when she heard them from her boss the ramen companys corporate headquarters in the usa had been here on braxton bragg boulevard since the s wouldnt closing it deprive college students yet unborn of the chance to harden their arteries with cheap shrimp chicken beef and oriental noodles more to the point wouldnt closing it pound one more nail into the coffin of san atanasios economy most to the point wouldnt closing it cost one louise ferguson her job at a time when people swarmed like so many starving locusts on any work that appeared too often that was about what they were hai please believe me i do everything i know how to do to stop this mr nobashi said miserably he spread his hands palms up i fail patty came out of her office her face looked like the mask of tragedy with runny mascara streaks i been here twentysix years she said maybe to mr nobashi maybe to louise maybe only to herself twentysix years she repeated what am i gonna do without this place mr nobashi bowed to her the same way hed bowed to louise or it might have been even deeper please excuse me he said i am so sorry oh jeeesus christ i am so goddamn sorry for the first time louise heard him spice up his english the way he did his japanese he went on like i tell you before i do all i can to keep this location open i think company make big mistake to close it but i cannot stop them its not my fault that was what he was trying to say no doubt it was the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth it cut no ice with patty youre closing this place she said in jaccuse tones that made it sound as if mr nobashi would be out front in person nailing boards across the doorway what am i supposed to do for work now it was a good questiona hell of a good question in fact it was the good question uppermost in louises mind too mr nobashi had the grace to look distressed and well he might they were sending him back to hiroshima they werent firing him laying him off downsizing him shitcanning him call it whatever you pleased but they werent doing it to him whereas the ramen works american employees before i leave this country i write you most excellent letter of recommendation mr nobashi said and you also mrs ferguson before either woman could interrupt to tear him a new asshole he rushed on i know this is not enough please understand i know very goddamn well but it is the only thing i can do now he sounded like somebody throwing old clothes in a trash bag to give to the red cross after an earthquakeor after a supervolcano eruption yes he was doing what he could that wasnt anywhere near enough though not if you had the misfortune to be on the receiving end my husbands outa work now too patty said and started crying again howre we sposed to make the mortgage payments if were both collecting unemployment huh were neither one of us spring chickens any more gettin somethin new wouldnt be easy even if times was good when timesre this shitty were screwed that was the word all right louise had enough trouble making payments as things were she had no one to fall back on now two unemployment checks were bound to be better than one her cell phone chose that moment to go off in her purse she reached in to kill it shed get the voice mail later onunless the power died again which wouldnt affect her phone but would affect the networks ability to reach it and be reached with power failures so frequent the youmusttakecareofitrightthissecondifnotsooner fixation of the years before the eruption was fading later would do because later often had to do what about steve and the other guards she asked she was thinking what about me but pattyd already taken care of that it is most unfortunate situation for all concerned mr nobashi said which meant the security guards were screwed along with everybody else well almost everybody else youve still got a job mr nobashi patty said bluntly you may have to go back to japan to do it now but youve still got it please excuse me mr nobashi got out of there at top speed perhaps to spread the good news to the rest of the building that rotten nogood pissant patty usually talked loud now she had no reason on gods green earth to care if mr nobashi heard her i oughta pinch his little head off tell me about it louise said i gave this lousy company the best years of my life patty went on as if she hadnt spoken tell me about it louise said again patty sounded the way she had herself when she talked about leaving colin substituting only company for man it had been true for louise it was just as true for patty and it did neither of them one single solitary goddamn bit of good i oughta burn this stinking place down patty shook her head nah if i do the fucking noodle peopled collect insurance theyd laugh well fuck em all she went back into the office that had been hers and soon would belong to nobody fuck em all the fired persons motto all through historyand that did no one any good either alone there in the hallway louise fished out her phone might as well see what the message was it was from colin louise ground her teeth loud enough to make any dentist who heard her sure hed be sending his kids to harvard just what she needed right now she almost deleted it without listening to it almost but not quite shaking her head she held the phone to her ear hello louise the familiar onceloved voice said wanted to let you know we found out for sure kellys pregnant sorry but im afraid that means i wont be able to keep sending you little bits and pieces for your kid any more way things are and the way our bills will shoot through the roof were gonna have to hang on to every nickel weve got the ramen place doesnt pay too bad i bet so youll be fine as long as you kinda watch it well take care bye you son of a bitch louise snarled you fucking son of a bitch that was what colin was all right with a few quick savage pokes she did scrub the message but she couldnt get it out of her head so easily youll be fine as long as you kinda watch it watch what she had exactly nothing to watch now here or from her exhusband how long could she make nothing last how much severance would she get how soon could she start collecting unemployment how much would it be she had no idea shed have to find out though and in a hurry she didnt even know where the closest unemployment office was well as long as this crappy joint had power she could google that and find out what would mr nobashi do if he caught her fire her laughing a wild laugh she hustled back to her computer xiii kelly broke a couple of eggs into a measuring cup they were going to go into a meatloaf the store had had ground beef for the first time in quite a while they sat there side by side in the bottom of the pyrex cup to kelly it looked as if they were two big baleful eyes staring up at her she gulped then she did more than gulp she ran for the bathroom she made it in the nick of time scope got rid of some of the revolting tastesome but not enough the horrible stuff had gone up her nose that meant she would keep tasting it all night they called it morning sickness but they lied they did for her at least she could toss her cookies any old time shed found out more about vomiting these past few weeks than shed ever known before colin walked in just as she was lying down on the couch dont kiss me she warned all the scope in the world wouldnt be enough to make him happy if he did what happened he asked not whats the matter he didnt need to be a cop to figure out what was up with that she pointed feebly toward the kitchen the eggs they were looking at me you want dinner you make it okay he said and did the meatloaf came out ever so slightly scorched on the bottom and blander than she would have fixed it but it was plenty edible colin cooked well enough hed never be great neither his skills nor his repertoire reached far enough for that at the moment kelly wouldnt fuss she was just glad the meat loaf seemed inclined to stay down maybe the blandness even helped better now colin asked uhhuh she nodded thanks you never can tell when itll get me i sure cant anyway she washed the dishes after colin had cooked supper that seemed only fair marshall was out doing something with his friends what and with whom she didnt know marshall was an adult and she didnt pry whatever it was she hoped it didnt involve too much money colins ex had fired her son right after ramen headquarters shuttered if she had to stay home herself she saw no point in paying him which made sense but making sense didnt mean it did marshall any good colin was not happy to have his younger son out of work kelly tried to soften it times are tough everywhere its not like hes the only one i know colin growled but hes the only one here hes still writing kelly said he sure isnt selling much colin answered which was also true kelly had learned to recognize the sases marshall included with his manuscripts when they came back every time her stepson picked one up he looked disgusted but he kept sending his stories out over and over by snailmail and email if anything would let him escape from his current dead end they were it but would anything marshall didnt want anyone but editors looking at what he wrote again kelly didnt pry she wouldnt have wanted anyone prying into what she was up to if she were in marshalls nikes eitherdo unto others and all that good stuff hes gonna need to get himself a real job now a job job colin paused then tempered that ever so slightly or at least find another kid who needs babysitting but kelly left it right there because she didnt know where else she could go with it it wasnt that there were no real jobs some work still got done in spite of everything that had happened to the country damn few new ones turned up though and next to none of the ones that did were for kids just out of college with a degree in creative writing as for babysitting the only reason marshall had done so much of that was that james henry ferguson was his halfbrother sure louise would give him a good reference but so what rug rat minder wasnt his chosen career path which wasnt the only complication if colin felt like locking horns with his son kelly didnt know what she should do play peacemaker stand clear and let them go at it whatever she did or didnt do she saw ways to wind up in trouble with the greatest of ease that was one part of marrying somebody with grown kids she hadnt thought about enough colin chuckled it wasnt a cheerful chuckle more the sort he might have given after spotting the drivers license that dumbass bank robber left behind if he doesnt find anything in the next few months he can start making money taking care of his legitimate halfsib thats true kelly knew she sounded surprised she hadnt looked so far ahead she would have bet marshall hadnt either she added dont rub his nose in it right now please its not what he wants to do i know colin said but you do what youve got to do not what you want to do a lot of people havent figured that one out yet even with the supervolcano yelling in their faces they still try and do whatever they want and then they get mad when it doesnt work the way it used to yup kelly nodded i wonder what id be doing if my chairman didnt know the head of the geology department at dominguez youdve made it colin said with great certainty youre the kind who does you wouldntve stuck it out for your thesis and your degree and everything if you werent the kind of person who tended to business you wouldntve been out there in the cold with your darn seismograph for me to make a jerk of myself over if you didnt take care of business this time his chuckle was selfconsciousnot the kind of noise he usually made best chilly morning in yellowstone i ever had kelly answered that made him smile he needed reassurance he was okay with women in general and with her in particular having louise dump him that way left him more deeply scarred than he showed anybody but her chances were it left him more deeply scarred than he wanted to show himself reading by candlelight was possible but it left a lot to be desired they went up to bed before too long marshall hadnt come in yet kelly figured he eventually would and she was right she had to get up to pee in the middle of the night the powerd come back on too she saw light around the edges of marshalls door and heard him clicking away at the mac even if it cost her a reliable babysitter she hoped he made it as a writer yes you did what you had to do colin was dead right about that but if what you had to do could also be what you wanted to do you were looking at something as close to happiness as you were likely to find in this old world she went back to bed she fell asleep again as soon as her head hit the pillow that was one more thing the baby was doing to her she would have liked it better if she didnt have so much trouble getting started in the morning coffee tasted so horrible she couldnt stomach it that was juniors fault too she would have been grumpier if shed stayed awake longer bryce miller had got his share of rejection slips for things hed written he was resigned to that when you wrote poems modeled after ancient greek efforts from poets long dead by the time of christ you needed to get used to rejection but he was getting different rejections these days he kept sending out poems and he also kept sending out applications to every college and university that had a job opening even faintly related to the kinds of things he could do some of them just ignored him others cared enough to tell him they wanted nothing to do with him it was a compliment of sorts he would have liked a compliment of the sort that came with paychecks attached it wasnt that he hated what he was doing at junipero high he could still have been back at the dwp for instancenow that had been a crazymaking job at least for him he felt all throttled back though he was teaching so many classes and so many kids that he had no time or energy for anything that looked like scholarship he also got tired of teaching nothing but the basics of what he knew sure that was what high school was all about he understood the problem he got tired just the same so he cast his curriculum vitae upon the waters and waited to see what he would find after god knew how many days the institutions of higher learning that did deign to answera bit more than halfwere politely apologetic no they were politely hopeless they had no openings they were contracting not expanding theyd been contracting even before the supervolcano made classics and history seem even less relevant than they had back in the good times at least i can do most of this by email when the powers on he told susan it doesnt cost me as much in postage as it would have thirty years ago he grinned crookedly and the ones who do answer tell me no a fuck of a lot faster than they couldve in the old days funny bryce hardeeharhar see im laughing she was just finishing her own dissertation she knew everything there was to know about frederick ii the holy roman emperor who was called stupor mundi the stunner of the world the world unfortunately had a new stunner now her chances for landing an academic job might have been better than bryces but that sure didnt make them good hey youll do it whether i manage or not i can be your kept man bryce said right whatever youre smoking let me have some too she answered i wonder if your high school needs two latin teachers who can do world history too before he could say anything she quickly added yes im kidding youre lucky junipero needs one person in that slot lucky uhhuh but bryce didnt push it as things went these days he was lucky he had work as long as he stayed careful and lucky it let him pay the rent eat and put aside a widows mite for the day after tomorrow if susan added even a little something to the pot after they got married theyd kinda get along maybe things would come back to normal by the time they hit middle age geologists and climatologists were still hashing that out bryce got distant possibly distorted echoes of the argument from colin kelly was one of the people doing the arguing right now the answer seemed to be nobody knows for sure but it doesnt look so good or so hot if your taste ran to oldfashioned slang and bad puns its not fair susan burst out bryce nodded nope its not but i dont know what to do about it hon fair or not were stuck with it shit she said when rome fell it fell an inch at a time and the romans kicked and bit and clawed as hard as they could mother nature didnt whack em upside the head with a shillelagh and youre not even irish he said she made as if to whack him upside the head luckily she wasnt carrying a concealed shillelagh two days later bryce looked forward to getting back to his apartment and pouring down a beer trying to explain the ablative absolute was as foredoomed as the charge of the light brigade high school kids just didnt get a language that used cases not prepositions and word order for its special effectsand the ablative absolute was some of latins pixar splendor hed explained till he was blue in the face but they didnt see it well olga smyslovskysashas younger sisterdid but she spoke a language with more cases than latin when she went home from school like sasha she had trouble with latin vocabulary but the grammar was a piece of cake for her nice to know it was for somebody bryce wondered why he bothered opening his mailbox he didnt expect any bills junk mail was way down since the eruption paper was scarce and expensive and so was everything else businesses hunkered down the same as the people who mostly didnt patronize them whats this he wondered out loud plucking an envelope from the box it was from wayne state wayne state he read on the printed return address was in wayne nebraska one more screw you very much for your interest letter bryce thought he was damned if he remembered sending any kind of application to wayne state maybe it was a preventive rejectiondont you dare try to land a job with us were there such things he wouldnt have been surprised not even a little bit he took it upstairs he wouldnt even be bummed when he got one more are you kidding us he was hardened to those by now nobody else would be there to pay any attention to him anyhow another gaudy sunset poured carnivalglass light into his living room when he opened the curtain he hardly noticed it which only went to show you could get used to anything the first thing he did after opening the curtain was to try a lamp it lit he nodded to himselfhed be able to nuke some leftovers tonight power had been on when he left junipero but that didnt mean it was bound to stay on he turned off the lamp the redgold sunset was enough to read by for the moment so hed use it the power company made up for being out of action half the time by jacking up the rates when it actually worked that endeared it to everybody as if it cared the envelope bryce said as if he were in a tux handing out academy awards yeah as if he opened it out came a sheet ofsurprise wayne state letterhead he unfolded it and read the laserprinted missive inside dear dr miller the letter said we would be most interested in considering you for the assistant professorship position opening this coming fall as you may be aware professor smetana who had held this position recently passed away due to lung disease caused by the supervolcano eruption we do have statemandated funding for the position and are anxious to fill it as quickly as possible i look forward to your prompt response sincerelyand the department chairs signature fuck me bryce said softly why had the lightning struck him that was sure what it felt like two answers sprang to mind either or both might be true if they didnt fill the slot in a hurry their statemandated funding was liable to dry up and blow away and they probably figured hed work cheap they were probably right too his eye went back to the middle of the paragraph professor smetana recently passed away due to lung disease caused by the supervolcano eruption wayne state nebraska uhhuh how far was wayne from the ashfall state historical park a longago supervolcano blast had buried rhinos in ash hed seen some of their remains in lincoln after barely surviving this latest explosion paleontologists had shown that theyd suffered from ashinduced lung troubles too those were back bigtime maries disease otherwise known to broadcasters as hpo the acronym for a cumbersome medical term poor professor smetana had a lot of company bryce went into the bedroom and turned on his computer hed send an email right away and follow it up with a snailmail letter in case it didnt get through he wrote the email to the address under the signature then he googled wayne states web site he clicked on the link that server is temporarily unavailable he swore at the error message and tried again he got it again then he realized that while he had power wayne state might not where the hell was wayne nebraska a little more googling showed him it was about a hundred miles from omaha north and a bit west wayne state had about students the town of waynenamed after revolutionary general mad anthony wikipedia explainedhad more do i really want to move there bryce wondered la made every other place in the world except maybe new york city london and paris seem like the boonies by comparison wayne was the boonies the terminal boonies if you wanted to get technical youd have to make your own fun boy would you ever and what were winters there like la had got snow every winter since the eruption quite a few places these days were getting snow in summertime midwestern winters hadnt been fun before the supervolcano went off not if you were a california kid they hadnt did wayne do its best impression of preeruption winnipeg nowadays how hed handle winter wasnt the only thing he needed to worry about what would susan think would wayne state have a job for her too it didnt seem likely how would she feel about that after thinking about susanquite a bit after thinking about herbryce remembered his mother barbara miller hadnt been thrilled when he moved up to the valley what would she say if he went two thousand miles away i want you to be happy thats what she would say sure as god made greek irregular verbs and shed be lying through her teeth that was what the math guys called intuitively obvious one thing at a time bryce muttered fishing his phone out of his pocket first step was finding out what susan thought his stomach rumbled loud enough to startle his cat if only hed had one he stuck the phone back where hed got it no first step was dealing with those leftovers whatever susan thought wouldnt change a hell of a lot in the next half hour yes people were animals better not to be a hungry animal he headed for the kitchen if there was a drearier place in the world than the torrance office of the california employment development department louise ferguson couldnt imagine what it might be the way things looked to her satan would have had a tough time devising a drearier place in hell she sat on a hard uncomfortable plastic chair of dispirited grayish blue in the waiting area water ran from her umbrella and puddled on the dispirited grayish brown linoleum under her feet shed had to walk several blocks from the bus stop to the edd office three people on the bus were sneezing their heads off she hoped she wouldnt come down sick somebody a couple of rows behind her in the waiting area coughed as if hed smoked four packs a day for the past thirty years the chill and the rain made people get sick more easily than southern californians were used to doing when they werent sneezing and hacking they bitched about it louise wished san atanasio had an edd office but torrance was the biggest south bay city so such things aggregated here she had to make the long bus trip instead of a short one if she did catch something because of that would the edd care it was to laugh the waiting area was packed she counted herself lucky to have a chair whites africanamericans hispanics east asians south asians samoans the crowd was as diverse as la county people chattered in english spanish japanese korean something guttural that might have been arabic or farsi or armenian for all of her and in a language or two she couldnt come even that close to identifying she smelled stale sweat stale booze tobacco smoke clinging to clothes you got in big trouble for trying to smoke in here and assorted colognes and hair goops a middleaged woman with a long lined face and pulledback hair who looked like an escapee from a s elementary schoolteachers lounge stood up and used a bullhorn to cut through the buzz of talk ninethirty appointments take your places in the lines ninethirty appointments people stood up and hustled to get into the lines that eventually put you facetoface with an edd clerk a baby whod been soundand soundlesslyasleep while mommy sat started screaming when mommy got up mommy tried to comfort the kid but didnt have much luck louise sat tight she was a ten oclock appointment shed got here early because that was how the bus schedule worked trying to jump the lines was an even worse sin than lighting a cigarette you got an official black mark on your record a couple of those would cost you a weeks benefits men and women whod been standing took the chairs of those whod risen to get in line the waiting area didnt empty out new people kept coming in all the time the socal economy sucked the whole countrys economy sucked jesus h christ so did the whole worlds but the usa was screwed worse than everybody else if the government didnt keep printing dollars and handing them out no one would have any if the government did keep printing them and handing them out pretty soon they wouldnt be worth anything that was well on the way to happening the prices these days but washington seemed to have decided that inflation at least put a bandaid on disaster even though louise had major doubts that that was wise she grabbed everything the law said she was entitled to if she lost the condo she had no idea what shed do if she lost the condo live in her car with james henry beg money or a room in the old house from colin if it were just her she would sooner have jumped off a high building and ended things in a hurry but you couldnt do that when you had a little guy to worry about she couldnt anyhow the refugee from whacking kids on the knuckles with a ruler raised the bullhorn to her mouth again ten oclock appointments she blared take your places in the lines ten oclock appointments louise jumped up all the lines were long but one she particularly wanted to avoid a chunky woman named mariaanglo not hispanicproved that the edd didnt discriminate in hiring on the basis of race gender religion national origin sexual orientation or competence she always took twice as long to accomplish half as much as any of the other clerks some of the rest were better some worse but only fools and newbies got into the line that led to maria it was the shortest of them alland with good reason only a couple of minutes before ten now so said the clock on the wall it worked whether the power was on or not it was this morning which meant it ran on batteries you got to try for your appointment at the scheduled time you got it when you got it slowly she moved toward the window the edd wasnt so heavily fortified as the post office on reynoso drive but the windows were barred like the ones in an oldfashioned bank the twentysomething guy in front of her wore a stingybrim fedora that would have been ridiculously out of date when he was born but had turned hip again with the passage of the years he also had on a loud houndstooth jacket as far as louise was concerned that went beyond hip to tacky from one of the jackets inside pockets he pulled out an airlinedrinksized bottle of vodka he drained it in a quick gulp then stuck it back in there again that was one way to make time in line go by bringing booze into the edd office was against the rules too but louise wouldnt say anything unless the man in front of her got loud and rowdy he didnt seem likely to he just wanted to numb the world a little how could you blame him shed got to within three people of the front of the line when the asian woman at the window turned out not to have some bit of paper she needed she didnt savvy much english the clerk a prim white man with a neat gray mustache knew not word one of whatever language she spoke the hipster in front of louise performed a theatrical half turn give me a fucking break he said and then faintly embarrassed sorry about that dont worry about it she answered we could all use one he grinned at her yeah after what seemed like much too long the clerk got a rush of brains to the head and asked if any of his fellow civil servants could communicate with the asian woman the edd personnel were as diverse as the people whose employment they were supposed to be developing sure as hell somebody proved able to talk with her then they had to figure out what to do about the paper she didnt have louise didnt know what they decided they still werent speaking english but the woman left the window by the unhappy look on her face louise guessed shed have to come back when she found whatever the hell it was with a loud sigh of relief the blocky hispanic guy behind her stepped up he better have his shit together the man with the stingybrim muttered darkly louise found herself nodding evidently the hispanic fellow did he stepped away from the window folding his check and sticking it in the right front pocket of his jeans youd better have your shit together too louise thought as the hipster took his place he must have because he collected his check and got out of there in jig time name and social the clerk with the gray mustache intoned as louise took mr stingybrims place louise ferguson she gave him her social security number too he entered them on his computer keyboard next to it sat a mechanical gadget that let him issue checks even when the power went out it had to date from the seventies maybe earlier it must have gone into a box as soon as the edd computerized that nobodyd thrown away the box and that someone had known where to find it again impressed and horrified louise at the same time all right ms ferguson now i need to see the evidence that youve been actively seeking employment during the past fortnightly period the clerk said could anyone who didnt work for the edd bring out things like actively seeking employment or fortnightly period as if they actually belonged to the english language louise wouldnt have bet six inches of used dental floss on it none of which had anything to do with the price of beer high like the price of everything else louise pulled out application letters from her purse and shoved them at the clerk they were genuine all right she would have done anything short of turning tricks to escape the edds clutches christ on a crutch who wouldnt the only trouble was nobody wanted to hire her or by appearances anyone else he shuffled through them and noted them in her computer file then he did the same thing on her file card more boxes that must have been exhumed from storage grudgingly he said this appears satisfactory good answered louise who would have hit the ceiling in seventeen different places if hed tried telling her anything else he poked one more key the printer on a shelf by his monitor hummed and spat out a check that would let her eatnot well but eatand pay some of what she owed on the condo some of what she owed would come out of what shed saved while she worked at ramen central sooner or later her savings would run dry what shed do thenshe didnt want to think about now she put her applications and the check into the purse then she got out of there as fast as she could who hung around the edd one second longer than they had to nobody that was who it was still raining it was raining harder than it had when she got there in fact up went the umbrella she splashed toward the bus stop it was nothing but a benchno roof or anything not many socal bus stops boasted roofs how often did you need to keep off the rain here often now the retarded transit district needed to improve the stops like this one and where would the money for that come from local government agencies needed to do a million other things even more they didnt have the money for those either back in the day they might have got it from sacramento or washington but sacramento had been broke before the eruption and washington was even broker than sacramento if that wasnt a measure of how screwed washington was nothing ever could be a hispanic woman came up to stand beside louise she had an umbrella too pretty soon theyd both be soaking wet from midthigh down bumbershoots helped only so much i wonder how late the goddamn bus is gonna be the hispanic gal said late louise heard the doleful certainty in her own voice if some modern mussolini promised to make the buses run on time hed get elected in a landslide and then hed break his promise sure as hell money was scarce fuel was scarcer spare parts were damn near extinct and nobody seemed to be making or buying more you got that right the other woman took a pack of cigarettes out of her purse extracted a cigarette from the pack and lit it all without getting wetter than she was already louise admired the dexterity as much as she wished she werent getting the secondhand smoke the cigarette did do one thing though it made the bus come the hispanic woman had to drop it only half done on the sidewalk to board serious fines backed up the rules against smoking on public transportation far more bicycles than cars used the streets some pedalers wore raincoats that reached down to their ankles somethe dumb ones as far as louise was concernedtried to manage umbrellas some just said the devil with it and got wet the bus had to go slowly to keep from mashing them every so often the driver honked his horn to remind the people on bikes that he was thereand to make them clear out in front of him he didnt have much luck with that the pedalers not only didnt clear out they slowed down to piss him off some of them flipped the bus the bird if louise had sat behind the big steering wheel she knew she would have wanted to run over two or three of them to encourage the others to get some sense the driver clutched the wheel tight enough to make his knuckles whiten so maybe he was fighting the same temptation people got on people got off before the eruption only the poor rode the bus in la if you could afford a car you drove one who could afford a car now hardly anyone which meant the bus attracted a higher class of passenger than it had once upon a time im on it for instance louise thought quite without irony she got off at the stop closest to her condo the walk back got her wetter and did nothing to improve her temper she checked her mailbox the mail wasnt there yet shed have to come down through the rain again to get it and what would it be bills and ads what else came these days mommy james henry squealed when she walked through the door he ran to her she was the best thing that had ever happened to him that was what that run said was he good she asked marshall good enough james henrys halfbrother answered listen mom ive got to go now that youre finally back not my fault the trip took so long louise said the bus was impossible and those selfish idiots on bikes only made things worse marshalls eyes glinted hed ridden his bike over here to babysit was he one of the people who diddled buses for the fun of it if he was louise didnt want to hear about it he did say itll cost you an extra twenty bucks his voice was almost as hard and flat as colins twenty louise spluttered indignantly youre late late late late and youre lucky im not saying fifty sharper than a serpents tooth ran through louises head but she paid him somebody who wasnt related to her by blood would have squeezed an extra fifty out of her she couldnt afford it but she didnt want to take james henry to the unemployment office in the rain either you couldnt win you couldnt even come close that twenty of course came on top of what shed to pay him to watch james henry for as long as shed thought she would be gone shed just spent a fair part of her unemployment check did marshall care yeah right out the door and into the rain he went louise sighed she knew shed call him the next time she had to go to the edd office if she could call him if her phone had power if the cell towers had powers sometimes these days even oldfashioned landlines didnt work not that she had one mommy james henry said again were together again at last he meant hi kid louise answered her own voice sounded hard and flat in her ears too xiv colin sat in an interrogation room with gabe sanchez waiting to grill an armedrobbery suspect named cedric curtis i was here when the uniformed guys brought him in gabe said we got him out of his regular clothes and into the jail suit yknow oh sure colin answered inmates in the san atanasio city jail wore orange jumpsuits that made them look like animated carrots sanchez wrinkled his nose dude had the stinkiest feet in the world man thats what we made him put his shoes back on a uniformed cop brought in cedric curtis he was twentytwo now and looked as if he might have been a linebacker in high school his head was shaved he wore a goatee and had a nasty scar on one cheek he hadnt bothered with a mask when he knocked over the circle k which was a big reason he was here now we are filming this interview colin pointed up to a surveillance camera in one corner of the interrogation room do you understand that mr curtis i hear ya the suspect answered indifferently do you understand gabe growled he was playing bad cop today you gotta answer yes or no not like you dont know that not like youve never been here before so do you curtis looked as if he was thinking about a smartass comeback whatever he saw in gabes face and in colins made him change his mind i understand he admitted in grudging tones okay now were getting somewhere colin went through the miranda warnings against selfincrimination he could have been shaken awake at three in the morning and delivered them perfectly the way a priest treated so rudely would have come out with a flawless hail mary and our father do you understand that too cedric curtis nodded yeah okay colin said do you want to talk with us do you want an attorney present before you do ill talk with you why not fuck you got me dont you curtis said maybe itll be easy for a change thatd be nice colin thought aloud he said are you confessing you robbed the convenience store and threatened mr leghari with a pistol the raghead guy in there yeah i done that curtis nodded werent no bullets in the gun though maybe that was true and maybe it wasnt if it was the kid had a few loose screws or more than a few an awful lot of conveniencestore clerks packed heat of their own commonly in a drawer under the register either cedric had got the drop on ahmed leghari or he was one lucky fellow well either way this did look like an easy one would you care to tell us why you knocked over the circle k mr curtis colin asked by the way curtis looked at him he was the dummy on account of i didnt have no money he said thank you willie sutton ran through colins mind he didnt bring it out cedric curtis wouldnt know willie sutton from a hole in the ground he did say plenty of ways to get money where you dont end up talking with us like what curtis was openly scornful they call them jobs gabe sanchez said dryly colin shot him a warning glance even that might be skating close to the edge you never could tell what a gungho defense attorney could build from a crack like that look at the racist cop disrespecting my client hed thunder but curtis wasnt offended he threw back his head and guffawed jobs for me you gotta be jivin man aint no jobs for me aint no jobs for nobody like me werent no jobs for nobody like me even before that fuckin thing blew up only got worse since so i can deal rockan youll bust me or i can do this shitan youll bust me you dont look like youve missed a lot of meals gabe said which was true enough i got two kids to feed i got an old lady too curtis replied whether she was his childrens mother he didnt say like i told you gotta get benjamins some kinda way law or no law a gungho lawyer could make something out of that too especially with things the way they were nowadays plenty of potential jurors might be out of work themselves even ones who werent would have cousins or brothersinlaw who were in tough times they might not want to come down hard on a guy who stuck a gunan unloaded gun the lawyer would insistin a scared clerks face so he could feed his little children well that wasnt colins worry or not very much of it he had the arrest now he had a confession to go with it the da would carry the ball from here in the meantime he nailed things down as tight as he could he asked cedric curtis to describe the crime curtis did with almost as much detail as the circle k surveillance camera showed whatever a defense lawyer did he wouldnt be able to claim his client hadnt done it when curtis finished gabe said odds are youll do some time thatll keep you fed anyway even if prison rations arent anything to write home about i know about jail food curtis said theres enough of it no matter how shitty it is no he hadnt worried about getting caught okay gabe said so youll have three squares and a cot for a while but what about your kids what about your girlfriend whos gonna take care of them while youre in the pokey cedric curtis looked astonished as if that had never occurred to him probably never did colin thought sadly it wasnt as if he hadnt seen reactions like that way too many times before one of the things that made criminals what they were was an inability to look ahead everything that happened after they did what they did came as a complete surprise to them even after they got busted did time got out and pulled another one they were amazed all over again when they quickly turned into twotime losers aw fuck curtis said softly maybe he could learn after all but what lesson would he draw from this dont knock over convenience stores or dont get caught after you knock over a convenience store colin couldnt be sure he knew what how hed guess and didnt like it well cedric wouldnt be his problem for a while the uniformed cop came back and took the robber away nothing left of this one but the paperwork gabe said yeah colin wished he soundedand werehappier lighten up gabe told him he will do time if hed lifted canned goods unhunh but no jurys gonna buy that he stuck a gun in a guys face just so he could buy groceries for his brats i mean juries are dumb but not that dumb you hope we hope colin said honest to god they arent gabe insisted me im going outside to celebrate with a cigarette he grinned wryly way to party down huh if you say so colin went back to his desk he stolidly started working on cedric curtis file the more you did now the less you had to do later but he hadnt got far when his phone rang he picked it up ferguson say what are you sure awfudge okay whats the address right ill get there soon as i can bye he slammed the phone down gabe sanchez was just coming back from his nicotine fix when colin stood up his face must have been all over thunderclouds because gabe blurted jesus what hit the fan now your family okay huh yeah theyre fine colin answered but theres a little old lady dead over on th street and the cop who found her says it sure looks like the strangler got her im on my way there now wanna ride along shit im dying to gabe answered but he walked out to the parking lot with colin colin had known he would they wasted a couple of minutes filling out the required forms for getting a car like a lot of southern california towns san atanasio had really tightened up as gas got scarce and expensive but no one would say boo to this trip not when colin scribbled south bay strangler on the line labeled reason for utilization of automotive vehicle the sun shone as brightly as it ever did since the eruption the sky tried to be blue but didnt quite seem to remember how it was somewhere in the high sixties seattle summer it could have been worse it had been last week and no doubt it would be again before too long north on hesperus to braxton bragg east on braxton bragg to sword beach left onto sword beach then a right at the next light and onto th the corner there had a liquor store and a seafood restaurant that charged too much for some of the most mediocre dinners colin had ever regretted ordering once you turned the corner and headed up th you fell back in time most of the houses on the little street had gone up not long after the war to give the kids of the baby boom bedrooms of their own some were even older they looked like adobe even if they were stucco and had roofs of spanish well spanishstyle tiles theyd been moved here when the harbor freeway pushed through to san pedro at the start of the sixties back then san atanasio had been white and japanese oh a few mexicanamericans but from families that had been in the states for generations colins secretary josie linares came from a family like that now there were whites and blacks and mexicans and salvadorans the cubans in san atanasio mostly lived farther south and east and koreans and vietnamese the japanese had moved south to torrance and palos verdes when the blacks started coming in and everything under the sun what there wasnt was a lot of money not in this part of town the cars that sat in driveways and on the streetand here and there on lawnslooked as if theyd been sitting a long time even before the supervolcano did its number on gas prices a couple of them were up on blocks the rust they showed argued theyd been on blocks quite a while too a blackandwhite with its light bar flashing was parked in front of west th a heavyset black woman and a skinnier hispanic woman both getting close to middle age descended on colin as he got out did that lousy son of a bitch do for old mrs mandelbaum the black woman demanded fiercely i dont know yet maam colin said i got here from the station as fast as i could when the call came in that was ten minutes ago fifteen tops they ever catch that bastard they oughta hang him up by the nuts the hispanic woman said privately colin agreed with her he wouldnt say so publicly gabe sanchez would that sounds goddamn good to me how come you aint caught him the africanamerican woman asked you shoulda done it a long time ago you wanna know what i think colin agreed with her there too all he could say though was were doing our best believe me and now i need to see what weve got here he started up the driveway to the house the lawn was green that meant less than it would have before the supervolcano blew no more brown neglected lawns in la these days not with all the rain that came down but it was also neatly mowed and edged well keptup that was the phrase just about all the south bay stranglers victims who lived in houses had kept them up well for a split second colin wondered if that meant anything then he saw a guy in a blue sweatshirta filipino was his first guessstanding on the front porch and forgot about that who are you what are you doing there he barked my name is oscar flores sir filipino sure enough name looks and accent all told the same story i had not seen mrs mandelbaum for several days so i flagged down the police car when it came by the officers they had to break down the front doorwhich stood open behind himand they told me not to go in after them but i am afraid there is no good news inside the house colin was afraid of the same thing the sicksweet odor welling out through the door might have been stronger but there was no mistaking it something in there had died a while ago and he could make a good guess about what it was maybe its natural causes gabe sanchez grabbed for whatever straws he could find nah grimly colin shook his head they wouldntve called for us if it was natural they just wouldve sent for the meat wagon and that wouldve been that gabes heavyfeatured face fell colin had got one step ahead of him into the house with another warning to mr flores not to follow colin didnt know what he expected overstuffed victorian furniture probably that was the kind of stuff you figured a little old lady would have what he saw instead was fifties or sixties modern almost as outdated but in a very different way sharp angles plastic a low chair that looked as if no little old lady who wasnt also a gymnast would ever be able to escape it an abstract clock on the wall meet george jetson gabe muttered which wasnt far wrong colin was reminded of the spidery building in the middle of lax that had been planned as the control tower but ended up as a restaurant that didnt do much business because it was so hard to get to that pieces of concrete started falling off it a few years before the eruption didnt help either one of the uniformed cops came back into the living room she looked green around the gills who would blame her that smell was stronger in here and shed just been with what caused it she managed a nod lieutenant sergeant shes back here a gulp punctuated the short sentence thanks jodie colin said as gently as he could the hallway between the living room and the bedroom had dozens of pictures on the wall mrs mandelbaum and her children and grandchildren and maybe greatgrandchildren there were even a couple of old blackandwhites showing somebody whod likely been mr mandelbaum in the bedroom lay the old womans earthly remains near them stood the other officer from the blackandwhite a strapping exmarine named albert strapping exmarine or not he looked greener than jodie had he managed the pale ghost of a smile almost as if he were the sun outside sorry to bring you out for another one lieutenant if it is i mean oh it is colin said or else its a copycat which would be about as bador a little worse depending on how you look at things his hands folded into fists maybe he slipped up this time maybe we catch a break how often had he said something like that as often as the strangler murdered someone in san atanasio plus a few more times when he was talking about dead old ladies in other south bay towns how many times had he been right the next would be the first out in the living room jodie started talking to somebody colin spun on his heel and hurried up that iconfilled hallway if oscar flores had got snoopy tearing him a new asshole would make colin feel a little better it was the one thing he could think of that might only it wasnt the neighbor whod worried about poor mrs mandelbaum it was dr ishikawa and mike pitcavage with a dna technician trailing the coroner nodding towards ishikawa pitcavage said i hitched a ride on the ambulance when i heard it might be another strangler case i wanted to see it for myself as soon as i could okay colin said more an acknowledgment than anything resembling thanks that the police chief rode in the ambulance and not in his own car spoke unhappy volumes about what the supervolcano eruption had done to fuel supplies and san atanasios sorry economy pointing back to the hallway jodie said this woman had a lot of family theyll be screaming when they find out chief pitcavages mouth twisted why didnt they call her and notice she didnt call back then how much do they care well find out when we get in touch with them colin said chances are well find out in stereo notifying next of kin might have been the part of the job he disliked most lets have a look at the body and see if we can determine whether it is a strangler case dr ishikawa said the media will be most interested in learning about that of course lucy is the one who will make absolutely certain lucy chen the dna tech reminded colin of a chinese version of his wife they were about the same age and they both had the same air of unhurried competence but lucy was an expert on the double helix not on the behavior and misbehavior of magma happy day colin said lucys presence and jodies kept him from adding some stronger opinions as far as he was concerned the one good thing about the eternalseeming power and gas shortages was that the blowdried dimbulbs with the expensive clothes took longer to get to a crime scene if they wouldnt have shown up at all that would have pleased him even more some things though were too much to hope for itll be back here i bet ill follow my nose mike pitcavage said he found mrs mandelbaums bedroom with no trouble at all he was younger than colin but hed been a cop even longer because he hadnt gone into the service before putting on the blue uniform how many tract homes had he walked through enough so dozens of different floor plans seemed as familiar as the house he lived in no doubt the coroner squatted by the corpse his nose wrinkled the smell in the bedroom was pretty bad all right what do you think colin asked keeping his voice as neutral as he could he knew what he thought but that wasnt what he was trying to find out if the dna does not show this to be a strangler case i will be very much surprised ishikawa replied lucy chen nodded after a pause for breath and after his face announced how much he wished he didnt need to breathe in there the coroner added most of the victims are discovered in a less advanced state of putrefaction you got that right doc pitcavage said i just hope the stink comes out of my suit colin hadnt worried about that like most people he wore more wool than he had before the eruption it was warmer than the synthetics but the chief also in wool remembered that it also trapped odors better albert stuck his head into the bedroom sorry to bother you sir he said addressing his words to chief pitcavage but the first news truck just pulled up oh well the vultures hadnt taken much longer than usual to start spiraling down to a story colin wasnt sorry the chief had come otherwise he would have had the dubious privilege of enlightening the men and women of the fourth estate then pitcavage said i think ill duck out the back door colin you can handle the ghouls today colins face might have been somethingall the cops lucy and even the staid dr ishikawa started laughing the chief thumped him on the shoulder im kidding i really am youd better be by the way colin said it everybody else thought the joke was a hell of a lot funnier than he did he said it that way because that was how he felt i am im here im stuck with it ill deal with them pitcavage walked out to face the reporters christians might have gone to face lions with that same exalted determination but dealing with the media was more like getting trampled by a herd with mad cow disease colin thought so anyhow suddenly calling the next of kin didnt seem half bad oklahoma city reminded vanessa ferguson of schrodingers cat even the locals seemed unsure about whether their town was dead or alive denver now denver was definitively deceased same with salt lake city but both those places were only a few hundred miles from what had been yellowstone national park in happier times and was currently the worlds biggest redhot hole in the ground there were something like miles between the supervolcano caldera and oklahoma city that didnt mean ashfall hadnt reached the city oh no oklahoma city in fact had taken a bigger hit than places like los angeles if not so bad as the towns and farms up in kansas where vanessa had been excavating as with the kansas prairies prevailing winds had dumped lots of ash and dust on oklahoma citys head the eruption had been a while ago to vanessas way of thinking oklahoma city should have picked itself up dusted itself offliterally and metaphoricallyand got on with its life maybe it should have but it hadnt little by little she started to see why the countryside was in worse shape than the town none of that was her worry though shed made it to oklahoma city shed escaped from the graverobbing crew that was picking through the mortal remains of kansas shes had as much of that as she could take and more besides she wasnt supposed to be in oklahoma city right now she was supposed to be back with the crew had she been in the army they would have called it going awol she wasnt in the army no matter how hard they tried to make her feel as if she were as far as she was concerned shed informally resigned she had cash in the pockets of her jeans too some of it came from what theyd paid her to make like a ghoul that was a startling wad at least by preeruption standards it wasnt as if shed had anything to spend it on while she was scavenging too damn bad the galloping inflation made it worth so much less than it would have been before things hit the fan the same sadly held true for the greenbacks shed come by in unofficial ways she felt guilty about that private graverobbing but not very guilty it wasnt as if she were the only one oh nonot even close some of the card games the scavengers got into that much cash wouldnt have paid off the national debt but it sure would have made some vegas blackjack dealers raise an eyebrow so here she was she could eat for a while she could stay at a super motel that seemed pathetically eager to get her business and she could shop for a clunker at usedcar lots whose salesmen made the super desk clerks seemed stoic by comparison yes maam i would be deelighted to sell you a vee hickle said one fellow whose plaid jacket was plainly made from the skin of a particularly gaudy s sofa and he explained why he would be so deelighted too business aint been what youd call brisk lately i believe that vanessa tried to sound as cutting as she couldwhich was saying a good deal she assumed any and all usedcar salesmen were there to shaft her she waved at the lot your cars are sitting there gathering dust that was the exact truth red cars blue cars green cars black cars white cars nothey were all grayish brown cars some of them showed hints of their original color none showed more than hints you know how it is maam the salesman spread his hands in resigned embarrassment we clean em off an then we get more wind outa the north or the west still an awful lot of that horrible dust he wasnt wrong having spent so long closer to the eruption site than this vanessa knew as much she was damned if shed admit it though give a salesman an inch and hed take your wallet her mouth twisted into a sneer chances are you dont clean them because this way you can hide a lot of whats wrong with them he clasped both hands over his heart as if hed just taken a mortal wound now maam that just aint fair not even slightly it aint let me show you this here ford honest to pete its as good as the day it was made or even better how many recalls has that model been through vanessa retorted and the salesman looked wounded again he tried for a comeback that particular veehickle i happen to know has been supervolcanoized vanessa had never quite made up her mind whether she hated the language of hucksterism worse than the language of bureaucracy or the other way round she withered the man in the bad jacket with a glance oh cut the crap why dont you if its got a heavyduty air filter just say so for christs sake i dont speak of our lord and savior that way he said stiffly i told you to cut the crap vanessa said you need me worse than i need you but you wont get me she walked off that lot two days later she found a toyota a few years newer than the one that had perished in her escape from denver the salesman there didnt speak of jesus at all he wore a corduroy coat that hadnt been stylish for a long time but wasnt aggressively ugly the toyota was more expensive than she liked but not impossibly so i think weve got a deal he said at last ill need to see some id before we finish the formalities here you go she showed him her license from colorado he looked at it miz ferguson this expired three months ago well so what vanessa said if you expect me to go back to denver and renew it youre out of luck she didnt say shit out of luck and patted herself on the back for her restraint he sighed he might have been showing restraint too i cant sell a car to anybody with an expired license the second you drive it onto the street youre in violation of the law he spread his hands you see my problem i see it all right what the hell am i supposed to do about it vanessas tone took on a certain edge shed traded favors for favors before she hated herself every time she did ithow could you not but she wanted wheels she needed wheels if she had to do it one more time maybe she could turn off her mind and not think about it while it was going on shed sure tried to do that with micah husak afterwards she could worry about that well afterwards instead of pulling down the venetian blinds in his miserable little office the salesman said you wait right here ive got to go talk to my manager vanessa sat there and fumed if he thinks ill take care of them both hes got another think coming she told herself no way i do gang bangs god damn men and their horny souls to hell but the salesmans manager turned out to be a woman she was about fifty she didnt try to hide it she was shorthaired and looked tough her pinched mouth said she was used to beating men in their own ballpark it also said she didnt especially enjoy winningor anything else carl tells me you dont have a current license she said thats right vanessa answered i got to camp constitution with the clothes on my back ive been there or in a scavenging detail since right after the eruption i wasnt really worried about renewing the damn thing you know theres got to be some kind of way you can sell me a car its not like this outfit doesnt need my money by the way carls eyebrows lifted shed nailed that one the managers face never changed vanessa wouldnt have wanted to play poker against her even for nickels you could get a license from the oklahoma department of motor vehicles the gal said you might be able to anyhow it would take some time i dont know if theyd want to issue you one with only that to show for id or vanessa said cmon theres got to be an or its not like i dont have this years license because im a fuckup i dont have this years license cause theres nothing left of colorado i understand that its not like we dont know about the supervolcano here either the manager clicked a fingernail against the arm of her chair considering how would this be well charge you an additional outofstate identityconfirmation fee of say a thousand dollars in exchange for that we will overlook your lack of documentation and we will try to contact colorado authorities to make sure you are the person your expired license says you are chances were those colorado authorities were dead dead and buried under volcanic ash the knowing gleam in the womans hard gray eyes said she knew as much shes making this up vanessa realized its an excuse to screw an extra grand out of me thats all even with inflation making the dollar leak value the way a blownout tire leaked air a grand was still a fair chunk of change how about making your fee five hundred vanessa said the manager smiled no one would ever accuse her of owning a sweet smile no it was more like a piranhas a thousand she said flatly vanessa realized something else this wasnt the first time shed played this game more like the eleventyfirst or the hundred and eleventyfirst sure as hell the woman went on you can take it down the street if you want to you wont get off cheaper anywhere else and youll end up with a crappier car than that toyota at least fill the gas tank all the way to the top vanessa said throwing in the sponge i think we can do that much carl said the manager sent him a flinty stare vanessad won back something over ten percent of the bribe anyhow she got the strong strong feeling not many people did so well against this gal would the cost of the fillup all come from carls share vanessa wouldnt have been a bit surprised that was carls problem though not hers the mountain of forms you had to fill out to buy a car in oklahoma was every bit as tall as the one california made you climb vanessa signed on a great many dotted lines carl drove the toyota off the lot and came back a few minutes later with a pained expression and presumably a full tank vanessa laid out the cash including the thousanddollar fee nowhere shed noticed was it mentioned in all that paperwork one more surprisenot she got into the car and headed south she hadnt been behind a wheel for years but she still knew how and she was on her way at last xv if you went barefoot in the park in guilford maine youd get frostbite and in a hurry too rob ferguson didnt much care he had rubber overshoes on over his new balances he wore a fur cap with earflaps and a red star it was ratty but he didnt careit kept his ears warm all of him was warm enough in fact except his nose he didnt think his nose would ever be warm again as long as it didnt turn black and fall off hed have to be content kids slid down toward the river on sleds kids on ice skates spun on the frozen piscataquis the river had a deep stonehard crust even though it was past the alleged first day of spring and well on its way to tax day robd tried ice skates a few times he was convinced the devil had invented them to punish sinners ankles they sure punished his if you werent iceskating by the time you were two youd never get the hang of it that was his theory and he was sticking to it he refused to abandon it even though both biff and charlie could propel themselves pretty well on skates with blades they were no threat for olympic gold theyd never hoist the stanley cup but they could get from hither to yon without going ass over teakettle and neither one had ever strapped on skates before coming to guilford it didnt seem fair a snowball flew past rob not quite close enough to make him duck everybody from age four on up threw them all the time one angry town meeting had resulted in an ordinance against using a rock core a good many people had wanted an ordinance banning any and all snowballflinging that failedtoo many folks enjoyed it the failure helped make the meeting angry rob enjoyed snowballs there went jim farrell with his charcoalgray fedorathe most recognizable one perhaps since fiorello la guardiasjust aching to be knocked off to scoop up snow in mittened fingers took only a few seconds to let fly seemed to take no time at all the snowball flew straight and true it paffed into the side of farrells hat there it exploded the hat ended up at farrells feet his own hair wasnt much lighter than the snow through which he walked he stooped to retrieve the fedora carefully brushing what was left of the snowball from it before setting it back on his head at the proper jaunty angle only then did he look around to see which miscreant might have assailed him he looked no farther than rob oh you he might have found half of rob in his apple why am i not surprised why professor farrell sir whatever could you be talking about rob exuded innocence the way an epa toxicwaste site exuded dioxin so you deny it do you farrell rumbled he stooped again when he came up he came up firing the snowball caught rob dead center the retired history professor beamed thatll teach you you rapscallion i couldnt have done better with a catapult instead of reretaliating rob clapped his hands in muffled admiration ive been called a lot of things but never one of those before sounds like a hiphop onion you know farrell made a face more at the music than at the pun loud obscenity never appealed to me even with a heavy bass line well not to me either rob admitted if youre white and you arent eminem youve got no business rapping no one has any business rapping farrell said firmly he sighed vapor gushed from his mouth and nose i have always taken it as an article of faith that the founders knew what they were doing when they added the first amendment to the constitution but some of whats passed for music the past twenty years does make me wonder rob bowed which made him need to grab his cap to keep it from falling off at your service professor farrell shook his head i wasnt referring to you and your fellow demented darwinian amphibians i truly wasnt youre amusing even clevernot something i say lightly i know thanks rob bowed again more sincerely than hed expected a compliment from farrell was praise indeed not least because the old man didnt give forth with them very often and you dont seem to feel obligated to blow out every eardrum within a furlong farrell added that depends rob said judiciously since we got to guilford the power hasnt been on much around here hard to knock crows out of the sky with acoustic guitars you would if you could youre telling me jim farrell sighed again at my advanced age and state of decrepitude i didnt think i could be so easily despoiled of one of my few remaining illusions yeah right now tell me another one rob couldnt match farrells syntax or vocabulary and sensibly didnt try were going to come through this winter with the greatest of ease the de facto boss of maine north and west of the interstate threw back his head almost far enough to make that trademark fedora fall off again he laughed to show he was telling another one he put enough vinegar in the laugh to show he didnt expect to be taken seriously yeah right rob repeated he hadnt come through this winter with the greatest of ease himself not with that bullet grazing his leg he hadnt but that wasnt what the professor was talking about and they both knew it farrell adjusted the hat his extravagant eyebrows twitched this past winter was colder than the one before it fool that i am i hadnt dreamt it could be those who are alleged to know about such things claim the one ahead will be harder yet one of the people alleged to know about such things was the stepmother rob still hadnt met he wondered not for the first time if this wasnt the right moment to make tracks for the opposite corner of the country things in socal werent so bad what came out of his mouth though was as long as weve got firewood and meese and mres well get by why anyone would want reagans attorney general farrell held up a gloved finger he was a fat fellowi give you that tubbier than i am which isnt easy render him down for oil and he could likely keep the lamps burning quite a while rob hadnt been talking about the meese called ed and knew farrell knew as much the professor enjoyed even reveled in being difficult rob eyed him youve dropped a good bit of weight since i first met you he said truthfully so have you so has everybody in these parts farrell replied what twisted his mouth wasnt a smile even if it tried to be were eating less and working harder once upon a time large parts of the world had so very much that even poor people could become obese and commonly did as recently as a hundred years ago that would have been unimaginable my greeks and romans would never have believed it huh rob said farrell was good at teasing or sometimes startling thoughtful noises out of people hadnt looked at it that way but youre not wrong when the illegal immigrants who mowed lawns in la sported double chins and potbelliesand a lot of them hadthe traditional meaning of poor needed revising well the supervolcano had gone and revised it all right it sure as hell had once upon a time i said farrell sounded as academically mournful as if he were discussing the fall of rome no more not around here they say we may be able to plant the midwest again in a few years but if the weather keeps getting worse how much will grow even if we can we are still working through our preeruption surplus and sooner or latersooner now i fearwell come to the bottom of that weve got the mooses rob tossed out another possible plural the word wasnt so bad as mongoose but it came close weve barely had enough to feed us this time till warmer weather comes again farrell gestured with that index finger once more nota bene i do not say warm weather this benighted part of the world wont see warm weather till long after im dead and buriedor perhaps i should be cremated if i ever aim to warm up in this world but i digress you do im shocked professor shocked i tell you rob hadnt seen casablanca for nothing if digression was good enough for herodotus its good enough for me farrell said and he digressed some more there are two kinds of modern historians of the ancient world you know now that you mention it rob said i didnt he slowed jim farrell down not a jot there are those who like herodotus and there are those who like thucydides theyre easy to tell apart the ones who like thucydides are the ones with the tight assholes rob didnt know what hed thought farrell would come out with whatever it was that wasnt it he barked surprised laughter then he said i thought we were talking about moose maybe doing it right would keep the professor on track no we were talking about the absence of moose farrell said with relentless precision maybe doing it right wouldnt too and more and more of them are absent too unless im very much mistaken were hunting them far faster than they can breed were having to go farther and farther afield for firewood too that rob knew maine had abundant secondgrowth woods not many people had farmed its stony soil in the second half of the twentieth century or in the twentyfirst and trees reclaimed fields by the multiple square mile an awful lot of those trees though had gone up in smoke the past few winters many more would burn when the weather worsened again sooner or later the woods would get logged out sooner or later the ground would be bare and smooth as a babys backsideonly much colder or maybe all the people would give up and move away before that happened from what rob had seen of mainers he doubted that they would hang in there till a glacier grinding down out of the north drove them away even then theyd dynamite the leading edge of the ice as long as they could the wind picked up farrell stuck his hands into the pockets of his overcoat after a moment rob followed suit that glacier didnt feel very far away at all on my way home the words chimed inside vanessa they should have had four exclamation points to say nothing of a heavenly choir singing hosannas california here i come she caroled not exactly in tune but with great sincerity every mile she drove took her farther south farther from oklahoma city farther from the supervolcano those miles didnt take her all the way out of the ashfall zone though shed have to go way the hell down into mexico to manage that she would sooner have gone to hell for real not that she had anything enormous against mexico but she was all done with detours she hoped so anyhow the toyota didnt sound as smooth as it had when she drove it off the lot and she wasnt even out of oklahoma yet would it keep running all the way to la you fucker youll keep running if i have to push you across texas she told the machine it kept running she supposedshe hopedthat meant it got the message southern oklahoma didnt look too bad it mostly wasnt coated in volcanic dust and ash if it had been right after the eruption rain and wind had got rid of the bulk of the shit people were trying to grow crops here which would have been unimaginable up in kansas but what you could see wasnt always what you got it wasnt all of what you got either how much invisible crud still fouled the breeze how much was getting sucked into her air filter jesus christ on a pogo stick how much was getting sucked through the air filter and into her engines innards if she got into trouble what was she supposed to do get a tow back to oklahoma city and complain to carl and the tough broad who told him what to do that was pretty goddamn funny wasnt it she had no aaa what point to keeping it up in camp constitution or while she was playing vulture in kansas she didnt have plastic eitherjust the cash in her billfold shed cut up her wells fargo visa when she moved to denver wells fargo was wounded all the big banks were with the new mortgage shock that screwed whole states but wells fargo kept breathing wounded or not which was a damn sight more than she could say for her colorado credit union down i she rolled somewhere near fort worth shed get on i which would take her southwest to i i she knew or at least the part of it that ran through los angeles there it went by the santa monica freeway or the san bernardino depending on whether you were west or east of downtown yes it ran all the way across the country but shed rarely needed to worry about the miles or so that werent in her own back yard driving on i could have been driving on the interstate any place out in the boonies the landscape was flat and boring but she wasnt there to sightsee she just wanted to make miles when she remembered she was driving on an expired license she slowed down a little a ticket was the last thing she wanted when she forgot she put the pedal to the metal again she had to slow down not long after she got into texas because she met up with a hellacious rainstorm even though she cranked the wipers up to high she couldnt see farther than six inches past the end of her hood that didnt worry everybody several cars roared past her shed long been convinced that most people were assholes here they were proving the point for her one more time then everybody slowed down even the assholes vanessa feared she knew what that meant somewhere up ahead was a fenderbender or worse she hit the seek button on her radio again and again trying to find a station that gave traffic reports in la it would have been easy in la she would have known where on the dial to look but she didnt think of that here she went through a shitkicker station someone explaining how the supervolcano was connected to the blood of the lamb somebody singing mournfully in spanish to the accompaniment of accordions and electric guitars an earnest woman talking about posteruption agricultural issues and several other things she had less than no interest in listening to she swore at the radio that didnt help her get the traffic news but it made her feel a little better anyhow the rain drummed down on the toyotas roof she wondered if it would leak she remembered her old man talking about a car hed had that was as wet inside as it was outside the toyota stayed dry at least in the passenger compartment that was one technology theyd managed to improve she crawled along at last through the curtains of rain she saw copsor were they texas rangers in slickers doing something with a truck and trailer on this side of the road that closed it down to a single very cramped lane a little farther on a vw beetlea new postmodern one not an ancient funky beaterlay on its back looking too much like an oversized dead bug the roof was partly smashed she couldnt see who if anyone was still inside that might have been just as well because of the downpour and the wreck she didnt make it to the i the first day the way shed hoped she would she pulled off the interstate in cisco still on the fort worth side of abilene there she discovered the texas institution called the access road the street full of motels and restaurants and gas stations paralleling the highway with ramps leading on and off they didnt have those in la or denver she found a place about on the level of the super shed had in oklahoma city and pushed greenbacks at the desk clerk as she paid she asked do they know when the storms supposed to stop tomorrow the day after the black woman answered whenever it does its in the lords hands honey terrific vanessa muttered shed hoped the lord might keep her from getting soaked when she walked across the parking lot to the applebees next door but he didnt seem cooperative and he wasnt umbrella or no umbrella she got good and wet by the time she reached the restaurant she ordered a double gin and tonic to improve her attitude the waitress carded her from a guy that might have been flattering here it just pissed her off showing the deceased colorado license alarmed her too but the waitress cared only about the birthdate she went away she came back with booze what more could you want vanessa chose chicken fajitas from the menu if i never see another mre as long as i live thatll still be too soon she told the gal you were in one of them camps the waitress asked by her drawl shed never gone farther than a long piss from this miserable little hole in the ground afraid so vanessa said lotsa folks are stuck in em and they aint supposed to be real nice the waitress said youre lucky you got out tell me about it vanessa said with feeling what did they call luck the residue of design that was what it sounded impressive and as if it ought to mean something odds were it was nothing but bullshit the way most impressivesounding slogans were her luck was the residue of not being too fussy about whom she blew and shed tried her best not to think about it since she did it well ill take your order to the kitchen the waitress hustled away she was perky and built a guy probably would have watched her ass vanessa concentrated on the level of gin in the glass to her that was a hell of a lot more interesting if you expected grand cuisine applebees was the wrong place for you better than mres it definitely was vanessa got outside of the fajitas faster than shed imagined she could she got outside of another double gin and tonic too she lurched when she went back to the motel she got wetter than she had on the way over to the restaurant but she cared less next morning the motel had donuts and granola bars and coffee in the lobby the spread wasnt exciting but it was free it was also fast vanessa wanted to get on the interstate and make more miles she hurried to the car it was still raining hard at least it wasnt snowing she hadnt had enough practice with the white stuff to feel easy about driving in it i was full of eighteenwheelers every time one of them growled past her it threw more water onto her windshield than her wipers could handle for a few scary seconds shed go next to blind then the wipers would catch up shed be able to see till the next honking big truck came along she wondered why a noaccount stretch of interstate through the middle of texas was as truckpacked as the long beach freeway coming up from the harbor and then all of a sudden she quit wondering these swarms of diesel monsters were heading for los angeles just like her without them la would starve to say nothing of running out of everything it needed besides food somewhere a little farther along in west texas this highway would join i and i would take her home till she moved to denver to be with hagop shed spent her whole life in san atanasio ifno whenshe made it home she vowed she wouldnt live outside the city limits ever again either miles more miles still more miles she couldnt go as fast as she wanted to because of the rain and because of the accidents people who went as fast as they pleased to in spite of the rain got into she snarled at those blockheads as she crawled past the smashed vehicles theyd infested some of the blockheads stood glumly on the asphalt staring at the havoc theyd wreaked when she finally inched past one horrendous pileup she saw her snarls there were wasted some of the people whod caused that wreck would never cause another one she wasnt sorry the rain kept her from getting a good look at the bodies she had no trouble imagining what theyd look like theyd look like the photos in her dads cop books the ones rob had used to gross her out when she was little hed got his butt warmed for that which didnt do squat to stop her nightmares and then just when she started getting close to the i things slowed down again vanessa said something that should have turned all the rain pouring down on the whole state to superheated steam that improved her attitude but not the traffic in dueno in overduecourse she discovered this slowdown didnt spring from an accident instead an electric signboard sat on the shoulder it said i checkpoint ahead prepare to stop then it blinked out and then it said the same thing again blink message blink message vanessa lost track of how many times she read it before she rolled past the signboard at last what she said about stopping for a checkpointwhat she said about preparing to stop for a checkpointmade what shed said about the earlier wrecks seem an endearment by comparison then she said some things about the idea of checkpoints too what did they need them for whoever they were wasnt this the united states wasnt it a free country if it was what business did it have checking on who drove to california you couldnt hijack a state and fly it into a skyscraper or a government building she got her answer to that when she came up to the checkpoint status evaluation controlsupervolcano emergency authorization act the sign there announced as far as she knew the supervolcano was unauthorized the act authorized things like camp constitution and its many unpleasant siblings the scavenger programs in the midwest and maybe this status evaluation control thingy too an unnatural act is what it is she thought trucks breezed through their reasons for heading west were obvious enough even for government functionaries to grasp people in cars though people in cars got the same friendly greetings taliban terrorists toting aks would have earned going through airport security a fellow in a uniform vanessa didnt recognize scowled at her expired colorado license not because it was expired but because it was from colorado why are you going to los angeles he demanded because i lived there my whole life till i went to denver she answered which was nothing but the truth truth or not it didnt impress him have you got any family there can they vouch for you what if i say no vanessa was tempted to her attitude towards authoritys pushes had always been to push back as hard as she could she was able to learn from experience though she didnt always but she could this guys humorless face said any answer he didnt like would keep her off the i and so feigning meekness she didnt feel she answered my father is a police lieutenant in san atanasio hed never heard of her old stomping grounds amazing how a face all slabs and angles could show such eloquent disbelief quickly she explained its not far from laxa little south and a little east thats what you say anyhow he answered his voice as stony as his eyes he pulled out a cell phone i dont suppose youve got a number where i can contact this individual vanessa could have taken the cop shops number off her own phone she could have but she didnt need to dads work number had been ingrained in her head since she was a kid she needed to add an area code to it now and she did as she rattled it off at the uniformed mans annoyed glower she repeated it more slowly he punched the number into his phone turning his back and stepping away so she couldnt follow his conversation he didnt look so souror rather he looked sour in a different wayas he stuck the phone in his pocket and swung toward her again you appear to have been telling the truth he said sounding quite humanly surprised of course i was vanessa yipped she was surprised herself and furious that he should doubt her she prided herself on her honesty she said what she meant even when keeping her mouth shut would do more good hunh her father couldnt have snorted better than this guy did you listen to the bullshit we hear here you wouldnt go of course you sound like a cop all right vanessa said yeah well youd know wouldnt you can i go on then vanessa itched to floor the gas pedal if she drove fast enough maybe she could get back to la before this piece of junk crapped out on her maybe i suppose so the uniformed man answered reluctantly if you havent got a place to stay and a job to look forward to though youre a damn fool for heading that way the last place i had to stay was camp fucking constitution vanessa said through clenched teeth whatever i end up with in laeven if i sleep under a goddamn freeway overpass and dumpsterdive for dinnerit cant be worse than that nfw hunh the guy said again even more dubiously than before but he stepped back and jerked a thumb to the west go ahead then youll find out vanessa didnt waste time thanking him she mashed the accelerator with her foot smoke spurted from the toyotas tailpipe so what she thought and burst into more verses of song nobody but her could hear california here i come right back where i started from had anybody from stephen foster to irving berlin to john lennon to bob dylan to stephen sondheim ever penned a finer lyric she didnt believe it not even for a minute she sang it again louder yet it wasnt as if marshall had never seen a typewriter before he had old people kept them around as souvenirs of bygone days a few offices even had electric ones for dealing with carboncopy forms but hed never expected to discover one on his desk next to the imac found it in a pawnshop on san atanasio boulevard his father said not without pride youve been bitching about how you have trouble writing when the power goes out well now you can yippee skip marshall said ummost places these days want you to submit your stuff in word or rtf how am i supposed to get those out of thisthing it was a royal manual portable what a college student might have used in a s dorm room dad exhaled through his nose which meant he was bent out of shapehe mustve thought marshall would fall on the ancient machine with a glad cry he sounded hyperpatient as he answered you can get words out of it right maybe if marshall seemed dubious well he was he poked one of the keys it went down partway then stoppedhed taken up the slack or whatever he poked again quite a bit harder clack the key hit the black rolling pin he supposed it had a real name but what that was he didnt know the carriage advanced a space for somebody used to effortless computer keyboards i dunno dad its got a monster touch youll get used to that his father said though how he knew it or whether he knew it marshall couldnt have guessed and you can get words out of it people got words out of them for more than a hundred years words yeah but not microsuck word dad waved that aside incompetent irrelevant and immaterial he said like a lawyer objecting in court so you send somebody a hardcopy manuscript if he likes it and hes got power he can scan it to ocr and get his own word file and if he doesnt have power he wont be able to do anything with word or rtf files any which way marshall opened his mouth then he closed it again he couldnt think of anything to say to that after a moment he tried suppose i get something halfway done on the computer while weve got electricity but i do the rest on thisthing then you scan it and clean it up and do your twentyfirstcentury thing on it dad had all the answers he also had all the reasons but you cant use the powers out again for an excuse so you dont write if youve got to you can use legal tablets and a ballpoint youre shitting me marshalls experiments along those lines had not been happy ones hed tried yeah but he thought writing by hand was as primitive as branding some people thought branding was coolone step past tats they called it he couldnt imagine anyone finding writing by hand cool but dad just shook his head nope pen and paper were good enough for shakespeare and abe lincoln and dudes like that i know they arent in your league as a literary artist but oh give me a fucking break marshall knew when he was whupped look ill try the tripewriter okay there you happy now dancing in the daisies if dad was his face and his voice hadnt found out about it he glanced east hed been doing that a lot lately marshall didnt think he realized how much he did say why though your sister will be back in town in a few days yeah how about that the last time marshalld seen vanessa was when hed helped load her uhaul so she could move to colorado to be with her rug merchant old hagop hadnt worked out any better than bryce miller did before him shed been goddamn luckyand goddamn quick which went with itto get out of denver alive when the supervolcano blew too hundreds of thousands of people hadnt her father coughed god knows how long shell need to land work not a lot of it around she may have to stay here for a while how about that marshall repeated tonelessly vanessa would quarrel with dadthey were too much alike not to marshall knew shed quarrel with him too she always bossed him around and he wasnt going to take it the way he had when he was a kid he tried a question of his own hows kelly like the idea shes not jumping up and down about it dad allowed marshall would have bet she wasnt he didnt think his stepmom had ever actually met his sister vanessa would quarrel with her too maybe vanessa didnt quarrel with everybody but she came pretty close sighing dad went on we dont always do what we want to do sometimes we do what weve got to do right marshall left it there since he had no steady work and was living here he didnt see how he could claim having vanessa do the same thing wouldnt fly but he sure thought so it will work out his father insisted if that wasnt the triumph of hope over experience then marshall didnt know what the hell it was a ham sandwich maybe dad lumbered out of his room shaking his head like a bear bedeviled by bees for lack of anything better to do marshall fiddled with the typewriter when he ran in a sheet of paper it came up crooked he messed with the little chromed levers till he found the one that loosened things and let him straighten it he started typing christ the thing was noisy clack clack clacketyclack and you had to punch every key hard with his index fingers he managed okay right away his pinkies though should have done more barbell work he had to make himself mash them down when he goofed he couldnt just run the cursor back and retype he had to fix the mistake somewheremaybe at the pawnshop where hed found the typewriterdad had come up with a little bottle of correction fluid the stuff smelled as if it ought to get you high the fine print on the label swore it was nonaddictive with a stink like that it was missing a hell of a chance if it was marshall finished a page and then to his surprise another one this antiquated gadget wasnt what he was used to but it might not be so bad it was kind of like diplomacy compared to world of warcraft bells and whistles fuhgeddaboutit but you could manage without them if you didnt already know about them you wouldnt even miss them fuck me marshall said softly and scribbled a note to himself there might be a story in thathowever he wound up writing it xvi las cruces behind vanessa snow on the mountains ahead of her they werent great big mountainsnothing like the rockies when you saw them from denverand didnt look as if they ought to have snow so far down them this was only a little north of the mexican border after all and it was allegedly spring no matter what the season they had snow halfway down them on the other half streaked and patchy now but still there lay the graybrown of volcanic ash a color she knew much too well and hated much too much a red light on her dashboard flashed to life alarm flamed in herflamed and then faded this one was shaped like a gas pump and warned her of nothing worse than that she was getting low she already knew that shed been sending the fuel gauge baleful looks since well before she rolled through las cruces here came an offramp with a truck stop by it vanessa pulled off i shed get gas for the car and shed buy some lunch with the kind of food you could find at places like this shed probably get gas for herself too shed never had anything to do with truck stops till she drove the uhaul from la to denver on the way there shed discovered they were less awful than shed always thought not great necessarily but less awful nowadays you took whatever you could get because too goddamn often you couldnt get anything at all this truck stop looked quite a bit like that one in nevadaor had she already got to utah by then nowheresville usa any which way a convenience store a broad expanse of asphalt filling stations a garage restaurants yup a truck stop oh and trucks lots and lots of trucks mostly eighteenwheelers but plenty of smaller ones too there was one difference here a couple of bradley fighting vehicles in desert camo trained their cannon on the stop a soldier or national guardsman or whatever strolling back toward them from the convenience store paused to light a cigarette the feds were bigtime serious about not letting anything that even looked like trouble start on the lifeline to los angeles vanessa pulled into a chevron station it had as many pumps for diesel as for gasoline prices werewell what went a couple of steps past appalling the country was fucked hell the whole world was fucked and who paid for it the poor bastard who needed a fillup and some stomach ballast that was who me in other words vanessa thought she drove over and parked near the dennys it wouldnt be great but it wouldnt be terrible either she didnt feel like surprises right now most of the business they did would be with truckersthere werent many ordinary cars here she counted herself lucky that that officious asshole had finally deigned to let her travel the interstate at all mens eyes pawed her when she walked into the joint any woman between fifteen and forty who wasnt buttugly had to get used to that feeling vanessa wasntnowhere nearand she had which didnt mean she liked it it always made her feel like a warm piece of meat with some convenient holes and it was a lot stronger than usual here because there were so many guys of the annoying age and so few other women to help defuse it a couple of soldiers were damn near salivating she ignored them to her they were only horny puppies they reminded her of bryce even though he was a year older than she was hed always be a puppy no matter how old he got thank god she hadnt gone and married him she sat down at the counter fewer guys would be bold enough to bother her here right in front of the scurrying waitresses and the cooks she could hope so anyhow whatll it be dear one of the waitresses paused in front of her pad in hand she was past fifty wrinkled and tiredlooking even if her eyes were friendly men wouldnt bug hernot too often anyhow cheeseburger and coffee please fries or coleslaw with your burger uh coleslaw you got it ill bring the coffee right away the other stuff is made from scratch so itll take a few minutes sure vanessa said the explanation had to be for people whod never gone to anything fancier than a burger king in their whole lives people for whom dennys was a major step up were there really people like that by the way the waitress delivered the warning there were plenty of them and what did that say it said the countryd been fucked or at least fucked up long before the supervolcano blew when the food came the patty in the cheeseburger looked like a patty the bun the bun looked more like a hockey puck cut in half horizontally than anything else vanessa could think of she pointed at it what went into that she asked distaste clotting her voice she didnt faze the waitress a bit rye flour oat flour a little bit of wheat flour so it rises some anyhow what we could get the middleaged woman answered try it sweetie its bettern it looks how could it miss but vanessa did try it shed had worse it was tastier than an mre no doubt of that talk about praising with faint damn the coleslaw was nothing to write home about either she was resignedly working through the meal when a man sat down beside her she glared at himit wasnt as if there werent plenty of other seats at the long counter christ she hated testosterone and the way it made half the species stupid but the guy didnt bother her he was about forty maybe a year or two past it he had a long pale face he looked a little like nicolas cage only rougher just how much he looked like the actor vanessa couldnt be surehe wore the thickest beard shed ever seen on a man it might have been a pelt like his hair it was black as shoe polish only it had a few white threads on either side of his chin hallo yvonne he said to the waitress how are you today he had some kind of accent not at all thick but noticeable hey bron im okay howre you she said so he was some kind of regular ill do he shrugged he had wide shoulders and a narrow waist he wore jeans and a tshirt which in this weather was an invitation to pneumonia muscles slid smoothly under the skin of his arms they were nearly as hairy as his cheeks except for a big pink nastylooking scara burn on his left forearm on the back of his right hand where the hair was thinner he had a tattoo a cross with a c above and below the right bar and a backwards c above and below the left bar whatll it be the waitressyvonneasked he pointed to vanessas plate give me what shes having it doesnt look too bad hey this is a highclass joint the waitress said for all the world as if she were really and truly affronted yes and they let you work here even so bron returned that would have pissed vanessa off but the waitress just cackled bron paid attention to vanessa for the first time how bad is it could be worse she saida line from a book shed liked when she was a very small kid you were supposed to sound like a little old man when you said it that was how dad had always read it anyway but she didnt go that far he shrugged again i wouldnt be surprised if it could be better too he had a distinct odor vanessa hadnt been used to noticing that before the eruption except for slobs and the occasional unfortunates who couldnt help it since hot water was harder to come by now especially in places like camp constitution shed inured herself to stinky people but he wasnt stinky or not exactly he smelled like himself she supposed to her surprise she rather liked it that might have been what made her answer him instead of going back to pretending the seat beside her was still empty everything could be better these days you know she said true he rolled the r when he said it after a moment he went on we could be in minnesota or maine or some other place where it gets really cold thisthis is nothing much not with that fur youve got to keep you warm but vanessa swallowed the crack even if he practically invited it by coming in here with nothing over that tshirt she chose another tack ive got a brother up in maine i think hes still up there anyhow i havent heard from him in quite a while if he is in such a place he may not have power for his phone up there many areas have had no power at all for a long time in such a place the phrase stuck in vanessas ear as the waitress set a plate in front of bron few englishspeakers would say anything like that you might write it but you wouldnt say it bron fell to he ate with wolfish directness his teeth were very white or that black black beard and mustache made them seem so he paused halfway through the burger to remark yes could be worse or better in the middle uhhuh what came out of vanessas mouth next amazed her i like your beard that got his complete attention he looked her up and down for once it didnt feel like a groping she knew shed invited it his eyes were a lighter brown than shed thought at first a snipers eyes went through her mindthey had that careful but aggressive directness to them he held back half a beat before answering i like your you the little pause seemed to give the handful of ordinary words extra weight careful something in vanessas mind warned but she didnt feel like being careful shed been careful since the eruption not that shed come across anybody she gave a rats ass about since then and how much trouble could you get into at a dennys formica counter thanks she said im vanessavanessa ferguson hallo vanessa ferguson he said gravely i am bronislav nedic those watchful eyes flicked to find yvonne she was over by the register talking with another younger waitress even so he lowered his voice a little before going on people who have trouble pronouncing bronislav call me bron i can say bronislav vanessa had a good ear even so she could tell her o wasnt just like his and she had as much trouble with his r as he did with an american one he smiled just the same you can he agreed good for you i am glad where are you going she asked him she assumed he had to be going somewhere not even lunatics would stay at this miserable truck stop only soldiers who had to follow orders got stuck doing that i have outside a truck full of chicken legs bronislav answered i take them to a freezingno a frozenwarehouse in los angeles he raised an eyebrow his were dark and thick like all of his hair they didnt quite meet above his long sharp nose but they came close and you im heading for la too vanessa surprised herself with how glad she was to hear he was westbound if hed been going the other way they would have been passing ships now well who the hell knew about now i was born there i lived there till a little before the eruption so im heading home born in los angeles he shook his head in slow wonder people are you know vanessa said with a touch of irritation outsiders often assumed anyone who lived in california came from somewhere else it never failed to annoy the genuine natives i am sure it must be so bronislav nedic said shaking his head again it still seems very strange to me experimentally vanessa gave a light touch to the tattoo on the back of his hand his flesh seemed half a degree hotter than hers that was a good sign she didnt know where attraction came from or why she recognized it when it did though to cover what she was thinking what she was feeling she asked does this mean something or is it just a design she got more than shed bargained for that is the ocilima the four ss with the cross bronislav answered his voice as solemn as if he were intoning prayers in church they look like cs to you i know but the serb alphabet is like the russianits c is s in yours they stand for samo sloga srbina spasava only unity will save the serbs his mouth twisted into a sour wistful smile which made him look more like nicolas cage than ever since vanessa liked nicolas cage that wasnt so bad he added i was not born in los angeles you will figure out i was born in yugoslavia a country that is not a country any more oh vanessa said and not another word she supposed she could have found yugoslavia on a mapback in the days when yugoslavia was on the mapbut that was as much as she knew or cared about it bronislav didnt notice her indifference his eyes were far away from the new mexico dennys he was seeing other mountains than the ones here other times i fought for the serbs against the terrorist bosnians and the nazi croats i fought but we did not win and so i sit at this counter here next to you and my country is broken all in pieces is that where you uh hurt your arm vanessa didnt want to touch the scar the way shed touched the tat he nodded mournfully it is and i was lucky if you want to call it luck the rpg caught the fellow standing beside me square they never found enough of poor vlade to bury oh vanessa said again on a different note this time being her fathers daughter made her know from a very early age that human beings could do horrible things to one another shed seen more since the eruption but you were in a war that she hadnt seen i was in a war yes and now i have that truck full of chicken pieces to take to california life does strange things bronislav set money on the counter then he said if you have a number where i can call you when i am in los angeles maybe we see what strange things life does to us or maybe i decide this was just a way to waste time in a nowhere dennys but vanessa gave him her cell number instead of making one up he entered it in his own phone and he gave her that number which she took in turnmating rituals of the twentyfirst century she paid for her own lunch bronislav tipped better than she did but then chances were he would stop here again she wouldnt not unless god had an even more twisted sense of humor than hed already shown vanessa slid into her car she half expected it to crap out right there just to show her what kind of sense of humor god had it started okay though back onto the interstate into the fast lane past the trucks arizona ahead then california home who woulda thunk it and if bronislav calledno when because he wouldshed figure out what she wanted to do maybe shed have other things that needed taking care of shampooing her tortoise or something maybe she wouldnt too she hadnt wanted anybody even a little bit for a long time it made her feel more alive she drove on toward la happier than she remembered being since the eruption louise ferguson glumly studied her bank statement and her three creditcard bills all of which had chosen the same day to arrive if that didnt prove misery loved company she was damned if she knew what would shed been robbing peter to pay paul ever since the ramen works let her go and robbing james to pay peter and robbing mark to pay james and robbing luke to pay mark too she was running low on saints and apostles even more to the point she was running low on money shit she said softly the perfect oneword summary of the situation it wasnt as if she hadnt been looking for work since she got laid off the california employment development department had no possible complaints on that score she sent out applications online whenever the condo had power when it didnt she rode the bus all over the south bay she talked to personnel officers cooks petstore owners anybody whod listen to her and pay her more than unemployment doled out no one wanted to hire her she was on the wrong side of fiftynot far on the wrong side but she was only a few movie stars managed to stay hotlooking at her age she wasnt badshe knew as muchbut not bad didnt cut it she had some office skills but she wasnt a computer whiz either and even if she were hot and a computer whiz chances were it wouldnt have mattered nobody was hiring anybody much when a job did open up it was guaranteed to have a zillion people clamoring for it somebody in that zillion would always be better qualified or cuter or younger or more male or whatever than louise which meant shit she muttered again she looked back over her shoulder at james henry little pitchers had big ears big mouths too whatever they heard they came out with but he was busy with duplos and toy cars and so she fished her phone out of her purse she wondered if shed have to give it up landlines were cheaper with power so spotty they might even be more reliable regardless of whether they were less convenient for now though she called colins cell she hoped she wouldnt get his voice mail that would be a pain he would call her back he was nothing if not reliable reliable to a fault shed thought back in the day even so returning her call would give him one more edge as if he didnt have enough already yeah as if but he answered after the second ring hello louise whats up as usual he didnt waste time beating around the bush colin i need to borrow five hundred dollars she wasnt normally so direct herself desperation did terrible things to people a long pause on the other end of the line then he said you need me to give you five hundred dollars you mean louise felt the blood mount to her cheeks and ears it wasnt quite so bad as a hot flash but it came close ill pay you back as soon as i can she said hating to beg and knowing she had no choice as soon as i get work that sounded better this isnt the first time he said heavily i know believe me i wouldnt be doing it unless i had to louise answered as long as i had a job i didnt yeah in her mind she saw him grudge a nod admitting she was right about that much but then he said its not so easy for me right now either i know kellys going to have the baby louise didnt quite gloat over the word he wouldnt have to work so hard playing dad to the little brat as she had being single mom with james henry but he was no youngster himself hed feel it oh would he ever its not just that colin said vanessas back in town yes i know louise broke in she called me were going to get together for lunch in a couple of days god only knew when shed see vanessa again after that theyd got along spikily even before she divorced colin there werent too many people vanessa didnt get along with spikily let me finish colin said in his imholdingontomypatience voice shes staying here right now till she finds her own placeand till she finds some way to pay for a place of her own oh hows that working out louise asked with more interest than shed expected to show it had so many intriguing possibilities well another longish pause from her ex at last he said i havent told her to take her show on the road anyhow not yet i havent hows she doing with kelly i havent told her to take her show on the road yet colin repeated louise ill write you the darn check okay the line went dead she put the phone back in her purse yes that was interesting wasnt it hed rather give her money and quit talking to her than tell her how things with vanessa and his new wife were going louise nodded thoughtfully she could paint her own pictures she could and she did having painted them she slowly smiled what she wouldnt have given to be a fly on the wall at the old house james henry chose that exact moment to look up from his own mayhem the duplos and cars had turned into something very much like a demolitionderby course mommy he said what is it dear how come you were talking to uncle colin that was what james henry called him it wasnt accurate but there was no accurate name for what colin was to james henry nothing shorter than father of my halfbrothers and halfsister anyhow how do you know i was louise answered one question with another cause you were talking about money oh that was more a sound of pain than a word he was big enough to notice what was going on around him all right too many questions there and all of them too pointed louise had always believed in being straight with children she did her best now hes going to loan me some money do you know what loan means you have to give it back her son sounded doubtful louise nodded thats right when i get some more of my own and i can afford to ill pay it back she believed it when she said it no this wasnt the first time shed had to hit colin up she didnt like to think about paying it all back and so most of the time she didnt james henry found another question with sharp teeth how come marshall doesnt come around and watch me any more hes silly he is silly louise agreed he doesnt watch you so much any more because he did that while i went to my job i havent been able to do that for a while now why james henry askedthe little kids favorite comeback because the company i worked for wasnt making as much money as it wanted to and so it didnt need as many people as it had before and i was one of the ones it let go why he asked again i dont know louise answered which was the lords truth how much of all this he understood was liable to be a different question altogether talking about money with a preschooler was much too much like getting up on a stump in peru and spouting estonian sure as hell he just looked at herlooked at her with teos dark eyes she was his mother she was mommy of course she knew everything that was a law of nature same as the sun coming up every morning and going down every evening it was a law of nature if you hadnt started kindergarten yet anyhow tears stung louises eyes if only the world really worked that way mmhmm if only when you looked at it from the far side of fifty you wondered if you truly understood even one single goddamn thing and the older you got the less likely it seemed shed been sure about colin then shed been sure about teo then at least then shed had a job for christs sake now now she wasnt sure of anything and she didnt have a job or much else shit her lips shaped the word againsilently she thought james henry giggled anyhow either she hadnt been silent enough or he could read lips both possibilities made her want to go shit one more time but she didnt she fixed herself a drink instead kellyd got past the worst part of the pregnancy she didnt fall asleep if you looked at her sideways she didnt work at random times any more either they called it morning sickness but what did they know it had got her whenever it felt like getting her as when those egg yolks started staring up at her so malevolently she wasnt quite out to there yet either out to where she just wanted to have the kid and get it over with it was going to be a girl she and colin were going to name it deborah you couldnt go far wrong with a name from the biblewell not unless you picked something like jezebel or habakkuk so thought kelly who didnt have that kind of name and colin hadnt argued with her they didnt argue much which kelly took as one more good sign she should have been happy in other words and she had been happy right up till that dusty toyota pulled up in front of the house and vanessa got out she wont stay for long kelly told herself she kept telling herself over and over she wont stay for long vanessa prided herself on making her own way she couldnt make her own way out of here soon enough to suit kelly she didnt know what the trouble was between the two of them she believed that the first time it crossed her mind anyhow the first time yes not the second by then shed worked out what was going onnot what to do about it but what it was she was a dog and vanessa was a cat it was about that simple kelly liked cats but when you werent one and when you ran into somebody who was life got more interesting than you really wanted it to vanessa was younger than she was prettier than she was more graceful than she was shed been on the road for a while she was grubby and looked tired as she walked up to the door kelly opened it vanessa looked at her and said oh you must be kelly in another tone of voice or without that flat oh it would have been fine as things were kellys hackles rose she still didnt know what they were but whatever they were up they went all right uhhuh she said her own voice colder than posteruption winter at the south pole come in she had to make herself get out of the way so vanessa could once past the front foyer vanessa looked around its different she said as if that should have been a hanging offense on the off chance it wasnt yes it is kelly hadnt known she could sound any chillier she surprised herself because she had no trouble at all the decor everywhere but in colins study had still been louises when she started hanging out with him the front room didnt look like a rummage sale in a russian orthodox monastery any more well vanessa had said and then its better than camp constitution anyhow by the way she said it it wasnt one hell of a lot better than the enormous refugee camp thanks kellyd answered if it doesnt suit you im sure you can find a motel she knew that was a mistake as soon as the words were out of her mouth too late then of course things would have been bad enough even without a formal declaration of hostilities now now theyd be worse than bad enough where will you put me vanessa had asked it wasnt no fucking way im going to a motel lady but it might as well have been one of the upstairs bedrooms colin says it used to be yours a long time ago stressing the last four words kellyd hit back oh boy back to high school vanessa had muttered if they hadnt already got on bad terms kelly would have forgiven her that one having to move back into your parents house was every grown american childs nightmare as things were kelly wasnt in a slackcutting mood come on up why dont you shed asked tonelessly marshall was clacking away down the hall behind a closed door eyeing the yellow tape on the doorpolice line do not cross vanessad curled her lip my god hasnt he changed at all shed said youd know better than i would kelly had knocked on marshalls door the clacking stopped what marshall had sounded irritable or as irritable as he ever sounded he didnt like getting interrupted while he was writing this was a special occasion though or kelly thought it was your sisters home shed answered after a few seconds marshall had said cool hed started typing again kelly wondered if he was ripped she didnt smell weed in the hallway as far as she knew he didnt smoke much while he was working he saved it for other times vanessad looked ready to detonate again even not liking her much kellyd had trouble blaming her for that but after a sentencetwo at the mostthe typing had stopped once more out came marshall hed nodded to kelly then and only then to vanessa hey he said to his sister hello you big lunk it is good to see you vanessa answered so you finally graduated did you fraid so marshall admitted ruefully hed staved off the evil day as long as he could till uc santa barbara requirements and colins unwillingness to write any more tuition checks at last conspired to cast him forth into the real world and vanessad asked kelly was impressed at how much snark she could pack into a single word by the way marshalls eyebrow had twitched so was he and not favorably either and so im back in san atanasio instead of up at ucsb hed replied with a certain snarkiness of his own hed added youre here too only till i find somewhere else vanessa declared job markets a little tough around here right now marshall said ask mom if you dont believe me half the time mom doesnt know enough to grab her ass with both hands vanessa said scornfully marshall lobbed a grenade didnt see her moving to denver vanessa reddened kelly remembered wondering if she ought to run for a bomb shelter and where she might find one she sure wouldnt have wanted that look aimed her way but all vanessa said was listen do you use that stupid noisy typewriter in the middle of the night my rooms right on the other wide of the wall you know i use it whenever i feel like it marshall had answered if the lights were on at night there would be power for his imac too he still preferred the computer and it was a lot quieter by the gleam in his eye though the royal portable from the pawnshop was liable to get some workouts in the wee smalls excuse me kelly said im going downstairs to check on the rabbits the kitchen wasnt a bomb shelter but it might do for one in a pinch is that what i smell marshall said whered they come from your dad traded some brandy to another cop for them she said i think that guy raises them bunnys not bad marshall sounded surprised that that was so better than mres anythings better than mres vanessa spoke with great conviction kelly had been basting the rabbits when colin came in is that vanessas car out front hed asked after he kissed her yup kelly said and not one word more hows she doing he inquired shes here again kelly kept things as concise as she could colin grunted he chuckled not in any enormously cheerful way yeah were all here one big happy family right if you say so kellyd replied i just did course because i say it that doesnt make it true colin sighed be an awful lot simpler if it did yknow kelly didnt say anything at all that time but she did nod xvii the frozen tundra that was what packer fans called lambeau field in december and january even before the supervolcano erupted teams from warmer climes teams that played in airconditioned domes on groundup tires dyed green often turned up their toes when they had to play in cold and snow on dead grass also sometimes dyed green they still stubbornly defiantly played outdoor football in midwinter in green bay bryce miller remembered hearing that one fan froze to death in a playoff game the year before no matter how much antifreeze hed poured down the big squawk wasnt about his untimely passingit was about who would inherit his season tickets green bay lay some distance east of wayne nebraska but less than a hundred miles farther north bryce had discovered more about frozen tundra than hed ever wanted to know it was barely autumn but much of the campus already answered to that description all you had to do was cross the street from the student union building and there you were out in the middle of icy whiteness waiting for jack london to mush past in a sled pulled by white fang and buck frozen tundra oh yeah the soccer pitch was frozen tundra with nets the baseball field was frozen tundra surrounded by fences with dugouts and bleachers on the sides the softball field was a smaller version of the same thing out beyond them was a walking path that skirted a golf coursestill more tundra with skeletal trees sticking up out of the snow and making it drift against their trunks past the golf course past the campus gently rolling nebraska farm country stretched as far as the eye could see before the eruption it had yielded bumper crops of wheat and corn and soybeans cattle had grazed on green grass and fattened in feed lots again bryce remembered the exhibit at the university of nebraska museum in lincoln ashfall state park lay west of wayne he didnt need to think of all the rhinos done in years ago by that earlier supervolcano blast most of the livestock and an awful lot of the people across the modern midwest had already died of hpo just like those poor extinct rhinoceroses except for the small town of wayne and the anything but enormous wayne state campus there was nothing but frozen tundra for miles and miles in every direction bryces breath smoked as if he were a threepackaday guy in spite of long johns jeans and a heavy coat that came down to his knees he felt sure he was freezing his balls off for this you left junipero high for this you left socal he asked himself not for the first time since he unquestionably had he asked himself a couple of more questions why were you out of your everloving mind he shook his head in spite of everything he didnt think so hed spent a lot of time and a lot of effort making himself as much at home in the hellenistic world as anyone could who happened to be born years too late to see it in person that thought made him laugh so his breath smoked even more vanessas brothers band had that song called came along too late about not being able to watch alexander conquer the persian empire squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles did all kinds of strange things that one hit bryce where he lived a crow cawed harshly there it was on the crust of the snow a lump of coal with wings not even posteruption winter was enough to drive away the crows a couple of others walked along purposefully a good bit farther away mice maybe the cold wasnt enough to do in the mice either they found this and that under the snow and dug tunnels through it every so often one would pop out for a look aroundand some lucky crow would cash in a meal ticket bryce wondered if he ought to cash in a meal ticket himself back at the cafeteria in the student union he was going to teach his class on ancient greece in an hour he sometimes thought the cafeteria specialized in ancient grease itself more crows flew up calling in alarm as he walked back toward the student union building they ate what students threw away but they were also more wary than they had been in these hard times eating crow wasnt always just a figure of speech some of what the crows and the people who fed them got to eat potatoes lots of potatoes potatoes grew in cold climates turnips and parsnips grew even better in socal before the eruption bryce had sometimes eaten sweetpotato fries instead of regular spuds the cafeteria in wayne often served turnip and parsnip fries the parsnip fries turned out to be pretty decent bryce didnt think you could do anything to a turnip that would make it exciting if frenchfrying didnt turn the trick what would he went inside it was warmer in there than outsideall the way up into the low fifties everybody around here should have been cold all the time in the clothes bryce had on though the feeble heating felt tropical a guy walked by in a tshirt midwest bravado he did have a sweatshirt and a jacket on his arm go outside in a tshirt and you were asking the coroner to call thank you the gal in charge of such things said when he handed her his faculty meal ticket she looked like every other oldish woman hed seen in school cafeterias since kindergarten there was probably a factory in elbonia or somewhere that manufactured them preaged bryce grabbed a tray and approached the food the rule was that you could take what you wanted but you got only one pass the powers that be decreed that that cut down on waste potatoes turnips parsnips rye and oat flour beets coleslawcabbage and carrots didnt need long growing seasons sauerkraut kimchi well nebraska kimchi anyhow though bryce didnt think it would have been anywhere near potent enough for real koreans he got some chow they had what they called pizza the crust was dark enough to show it was mostly rye the cheese was thinly spread with so many cows dead people had stopped taking milk for granted theyd had to the sausage there wasnt much of it either and it looked funny pointing to a round of it bryce asked the student dishing stuff out do i want to know what goes into that its meat she answered what else do you need to know nothing he said after a barely perceptible pause for thought let me have a slice please you got it she put it on a plastic plate and handed it to him he found a place sat down and ate the coleslaw was actually pretty good the french fries had been sitting under a heat lamp too long but that could happen at a real fastfood joint too as for the pizza well hed had worse he didnt think hed ever had stranger though if finns had invented the stuff instead of italians it might have come out like this the sausage was definitely mystery meat as the girl had suggested some mysteries were better left unsolved bryce had read shogunhed raced through it in three or four days in fact because hed liked it so much hed got taipan and king rat too taipan was pretty good not so good as shogun but still pretty good king rat was nothing like the other two but also pretty good right this minute remembering what the pows in king rat had chowed down on bryce wished hed never found it no matter how good it was he dumped his trash and stowed his tray dishes and flatware on the rotating shelves that delivered them to the dishwashers then he put his knit cap back on pulled it down so it covered his ears and headed out into the cold again to go teach his class the peloponnesian war today or the start of it hed done big chunks of thucydides in the original now it paid off what the kids at wayne state thought of things like the melian dialogue he wasnt sure some of them got it and saw that that kind of thing applied to any situation where people tried to govern themselves responsibly more he feared didntwhich was the kind of problem people who tried to govern themselves responsibly had to deal with or to duck washington these days reminded him of a brokenbacked mans brain it still sent out frantic messagesorders evenbut not all of them got through he finished the lecture and headed for the bus stop wayne and wayne state were better off than a lot of places the power here stayed on better than it did in los angeles natural gas got through there wasnt a lot of gasoline and what there was was hideously expensive but that was worse in socal too things here didnt depend on the port and on one long highway connecting the coast to the rest of the country then again this was wayne nebraska the frozen tundra as hed thought before along with fast food it had a chinese place and a pizza place that also did spaghetti no takeout thai no peruvian no pupusas from el salvador no sushi no korean barbecue no persian no israeli no moroccan no no nothin except for chinese and sortakinda italian here came the bus it had studded snow tires and chains over them too that struck bryce as suspenders and belt but what did he know about snow and coping with it not much he knew he wouldnt have wanted to walk or bike back to his place in town not in weather like this and he knew he wasnt rich enough to keep driving back and forth even for short hauls body heat warmed the inside of the bus someenough to prove that some of the bodies warming it hadnt been washed for a while one more constant of the new era you did what you could and you did what you could afford and you said the hell with the rest not much traffic on the road back to town bryce guessed thered never been a whole lot there just werent enough people in these parts to create much traffic to someone whod squandered countless irreplaceable hours crawling along the because of a wreck five miles ahead that was a prodigy bryce got out near the center of wayne nothing was more than three or four stories high a lot of the buildings were of red or brown brick to someone from a state where quakes were an everyday worry that was a prodigy too but not such a good one the main drags were plowed that was how the bus had come this far bryce walked a block in the street he had to watch for oncoming carsnot too big a worry with gas so scarce and so expensiveand he had to be careful not to slip and fall on his ass then he had to climb up onto the drifts to go the rest of the way to the apartment he and susan shared even this recently after the end of summer it had been cold enough long enough for the snow to have a good solid crust the drifts bore his weight most of the time anyhow falling through into the snow and then struggling to pull himself out again wasnt the most enjoyable thing hed ever done and he didnt want a repeat performance so he watched where he put his feet once had been an experiment twice would definitely be perversion he made it back to the building without going into the deep freeze the little rectangular mailboxjust the kind youd also see in socal apartment buildingswas empty when he turned the key in its lock either susan had already got whatever there was or the mailman or mailwoman if you needed a word with a builtin oxymoron hadnt managed to mush through the snow the usps took its adaptation of herodotus version of the pledge of the persian empires couriers less seriously than it had once upon a time he clumped up the stairs a secondfloor unit was better than one down below you didnt have herds of shoes migrating over your head the neighbors on either side of the place werent too noisy either all that could have been worse as he knew from experience susan was tapping away on a laptop at the kitchen table when he came in it wasnt warm inside any more than it had been in the student union or his classroom or the bus but it was warmer so it felt warm and the hug she gave him raised his temp several more degreesor it sure seemed to anyhow hows it going he asked im getting there she answered longdistance thesis writing this way i get snarky emailssometimes even snarky letters i can barely read when the power in la goes for a whileinstead of facetoface snark im glad stuff stays on most of the time here i couldnt finish without the net the wayne state library tries it really does but it doesnt have most of what i need bryce nodded i know that song the classical holdings here were severely limited too sure she smiled at him if you didnt know what i was going through id drive you totally up the wall instead of just threequarters of the way yeah right he answered like im not already upor offthe wall any which way susan thought that was funny bryce wished he could have said it without dredging up uncomfortable memories vanessa had had no idea how crazy hed get when he was studying for his orals how could she have shed never done anything like that shed bailed out of college before she graduated and started working instead that had hassles of its ownbryce discovered some of them laterbut they werent the same hassles the differences had only made for more friction between them he wondered how vanessa was doing hed have to ask colin next time he talked to him or emailed him he hadnt done that as often as he should have since he moved to nebraska hell he hadnt done it as often as he should have after he moved up to the valley and couldnt get over to the ferguson place so easily any more susan had said something she stood there waiting expectantly for him to answer woolgathering about your ex was not a good thing to do not when it made you zone out on your current squeeze sorry bryce spread his hands in what he hoped would be apology enough brain fuzz a likely story susan answered darkly i said how do you want me to make the potatoes tonight i dunno cooking them ought to be good bryce replied she rolled her eyes so did he for different reasons you could do only so much with potatoes whatever you did they were still potatoes when you got through with them he supposed he should have been glad they had enough potatoes and didnt need to worry about going hungry he should have been and in a way he was but he remembered better times so did his whole generation if the climate didnt improve by the time they died off theyd bore the living shit out of the cadre rising behind them by going on and on about the good old days well yeah every generation did that so why should his be any different the difference was for them the good old days really would have been good there was a joint on hesperus a little north of the police station with a name colin ferguson had loved for years heinrichs hofbrau and sushi bar the sign over the door declared it had always drawn a fair number of cops at lunch and dinnertime the way things were these days it was crawling with blue uniforms and offtherack suits you could walk there from the station you could and the policemen and women did as a waiter led colin and gabe sanchez to a table colin remarked i always wished this joint served pizza too oh yeah gabe said how come cause then youd have the whole axis all in one place that got the kind of disgusted snort hed hoped for they sat down the waiter set menus on the table in front of them and went away the menus had two sidesnot column a and column b but german and japanese more soba noodles than ever gabe said eyeing the japanese side sobas buckwheat colin answered kasha if youre jewish sure man hell of a lot of hebes named sanchez mm right colin had to remind himself what he was talking about buckwheats one of those grains that grow quick so you can raise it in the kind of crappy weather weve got nowadays oh is that where you were going with that i gotcha gabe said when the waiter came back he ordered some of the soba noodles colin went teutonic with sauerkraut potatoes and pork the dish proved heavy on the spuds and kraut light on the pork you could raise pigs anywhere on almost anything what meat there was these days was mostly pork some chicken remained though the corn that had fattened hens was mostly a memory beef lamb rare and even more expensive than everything else good fish was scarce too which didnt do the sushi part of this operation any good squid though there was lots of squid by all the signs squid were oceanic cockroaches if you dropped an hbomb on the marianas trench somehow the squid would survive and when youve been squid youve been did colin murmured whats that gabe cupped a hand behind his ear nothing colin said believe me nothing my brains are dribbling out my ears thats all and im supposed to notice this on account of gabe asked who said you were supposed to notice it colin returned gabe let out another snort then he found a question colin had been asking himself a good deal lately too whats it like having your daughter home again itsinteresting anyway colin wished hed ordered a beer with lunch even if department regs frowned on such things and even if barley shortages made beer almost as expensive as gasoline he almost left the answer short and unresponsive but gabe had been his buddy as long as theyd both been on the san atanasio pd if he could vent to anybody gabe was the guy sighing he went on i wish to christ vanessa and kellyd hit it off better thats not good gabe said colin clapped silently applauding the understatement without making everybody in the place stare at him it wouldnt be good even if kelly wasnt expecting since she is its doubleplus ungood its what but then gabes heavy features cleared oh from that book he chuckled selfconsciously dunno if ive even looked at it since sometime in high schoolim pretty sure of that colin had read it more recentlyquite a bit more the politics were out of date nobody could deny that the politics had been out of date well before the cold war went byebye but the thoughts on the way corrupt and narrow politics produced a corrupt and narrow language seemed more important than ever in this age of pious bullshit they did to him at any rate most people by all appearances didnt give a rats ass if he was going to vent he was going to vent not much point to doing things halfway was there with another sigh he said and shes got herself a new boyfriend a punk a gangbanger gabes older daughter was in high school those were the kinds of boyfriends that gave him nightmares but colin shook his head well no oh gabe said again as he had with he remembered slowly but remember he did please jesus not another guy older than you are not that either colin admitted this ones i dunno maybe forty not too bad not for the age she is now gabe said colin nodded this time that was true gabe asked the next logical question so what dont you like about him its not even that i dont like him colin said which was also true to a point huh gabe said as if a perp gave him an unexpected reply in the interrogation room he got a record not any place i can find colin answered he wasnt surprised gabe would assume hed checked he had as soon as hed got bronislav nedics name did that mean he didnt trust his darling daughters taste in men now that you mentioned it yes huh gabe said again what is it then you wanna know what ill tell you whathe scares the crap out of me thats what there colin had said it he sure hadnt said it to vanessa or even to kelly that was one hed kept bottled up ever since hed met bronislav he hoped like hell the big serb hadnt noticed it too he succeeded in surprising gabe anyhow sanchezs graying eyebrows leaped toward his hairline scares you by the way gabe repeated it he could hardly believe his own ears how come i did my hitch in the navyyou know that colin waited for his friend to nod before continuing i never saw combat but i knew some guysnavy and marineswhod been nasty places and done nasty things heap big nasty things if you know what i mean uhhuh gabe nodded again this dude is like that in spades doubled and redoubled colin tried to put what he felt into words those guys whatever they were up to they were doing it cause they had orders to do it whatever it was and maybe things got hairy but they got hairy because that kind of stuff was what they did you with me so far yeah or i think so okay this fella he did that kinda stuff too hes got an ugly old scar to prove it but you dont need the scar to know you just need to see the eyes only i dont think he did whatever he did because those were his orders he did it cause he went looking for it and he found it after another pause for thought gabe said not a german shepherd not a police dog a wolf bingo colin exclaimed thats better than i worked out for myselfa lot better matter of fact you scared hell take it out on vanessa whatever it is it wasnt that kind of vibe or i dont think it was colin said after some thought of his own but i dont think shes got a clue about what shes hanging out with either i dont want her getting hurt gabe laughed a singularly mirthless laugh you fall for somebody man thats the chance you take me and my ex he shuddered he had more than his share of godawful memories to go with the good ones you and yours too and its not like this is vanessas first race around the track right right right right right colin still wished vanessa could have stayed together with bryce miller but she damn well hadnt any more than louise had stayed together with him or gabes thenwife with him if vanessa hadnt gone to denver to stay with that grayhaired rug seller that hadnt lasted even as long as bryce had this one now everything you say makes good sense but im worried just the same well then you dont need to worry about lunch gabe put money on the table come on lets get back to work why not and thanks maybe itll take my mind off things hope so but thats not why i said it i want my cancer fix and ill get it on the way back to the station gabe gave forth with a theatrical sigh hard times for a smoker these days if youre in a building thats not your own house theyll bust you for lighting up i tell you man its almost easier to smoke dope colin kept his mouth shut tight every one of his children used weedvanessa less than her brothers but she did too the only good thing about it he thought as he and gabe tramped along hesperus toward the station was that the smoke smelled better than tobacco gabe wouldnt even have agreed with him about that some people set out to be writers from the time they were small marshall wasnt any of them hed chosen creative writing as a major at ucsb because it would let him stay in school an extra quarter or two hed submitted for the first time because that prof made him do it and hed got accepted because maybe god knew why marshall had no idea hed sold several more stories after the first one too he was good enough to be a professional writer that much seemed plain what also seemed plain unfortunately was that he wasnt good enough or maybe productive enough or maybe just lucky enough to make a living at it that was how come hed wasted so much time babysitting his tiny halfbrother a kid whose very existence weirded him out his father gruffly insisted that time you got paid for wasnt time wasted marshall wasnt convinced dad didnt care the next time dad cared about marshalls opinions would be the first now though mom was out of work herself that meant she had much less need for babysitting services it also meant marshalls income tanked dad did not approve marshall had to care about dads opinions because the house belonged to dad his old man was willingnot eager but willingto feed him and let him keep sleeping there as long as he looked for work and with a cops relentless thoroughness dad checked up on him to make sure he did some of the interrogations were almost as sharp as if he were under suspicion of knocking over a mcdonalds he complained about it once the state unemployment office isnt as tough as you are his father just looked at him somehow dad could make his blunt features do an amazing impression of a snapping turtle the unemployment office doesnt have you sleeping under its roof he said tonelessly i darn well do if you arent happy about the situation youre welcome to pack your bags and go somewhere else marshall shut up without money where was he supposed to go he could sleep in his car yeah right the car he couldnt afford to gas up or he could apartmentsurf among his friends only most of them were in the same boat they were crashing on one another or back with their folks or seeing what sleeping in their cars was like everybody was in that same boat trouble was it was the titanic nowhat was the name of that other liner the one that got torpedoed to marshalls amazement he dredged it up from the depths of us history boredom the lusitania that was it when the supervolcano blew up it torpedoed the whole goddamn economy marshall pointed that out with profane embellishments dad went right on looking as if he were paddling along in the mississippi waiting for a fish to swim by so he could bite it in half i know its hard to find anything he said when marshall ran down but youve got to try vanessas trying she sure is marshall agreed having his big sister home again had not proved an unmixed blessing dad stopped doing reptile impersonations and looked quite humanly pained at the pun shes looking for work he said so there could be no possible misunderstanding shes looking hard too the least you can do is try as hard as she does shes not writing marshall said look son its great that youve sold some things im proud of you for that im bustmybuttons proud his father said but you arent exactly james michener yet i hope not isnt he dead marshall said youre not george carlin either and hes dead too dad said there he surprised his sonmarshall would have bet hed name bill cosby even dead even after a long successful career alive carlin seemed too edgy too freaky to appeal to a cop you never could tell could you dad went on neither one of them died broke though and neither one of them needed to scuffle for an outside job till you dont need to youre gonna scuffle so marshall scuffled every once in a while he got a days work moving stuff off a truck and into a warehouse or out of the back of a store and into a truck that didnt happen very often though most of the guys who got those jobs were browner than he was and spoke spanish the people who did the hiring figured those guys were less likely to piss and moan about doing hard work wouldnt complain about their shitty wages and wouldnt start yelling about workers compensation if they screwed up their backs they were right too they knew it so did marshall and so did the brown spanishspeaking guys who got hired instead of him their part of the deal was to do as they were told and shut up about it he tried to get a job that would let him write by now he had enough sales to put together a decent resume no large american corporation seemed to be looking for anybody who could turn out a respectable short story though no small american business seemed to be looking for anyone with that skill set either jesus h christ no escaped lunatics seemed to be looking for somebody who could crank out a respectable short story well no a few lunatics remained on the loose they ran the epublications and print magazines that occasionallymuch too occasionally as far as marshall was concernedbought the stories he did write he kept sending stuff to playboy and the new yorker you sold something to a market like that it paid noshit eating money of course all the writers in the world who used english knew as much so did some who had to get their stuff translated from japanese or russian or hebrew the top mags could pick and choose they could and they did marshall got rejected over and over again he hated getting rejected he never would have submitted the first story that sold if professor bolger hadnt required it in high school he hadnt dated much because he hated it when girls turned him down this was the same kind of thing and the noes hurt just about as much he had dated eventually he got too horny not to when a girl let him get lucky the reward made up for all the failures that came before it now he felt the same way when an editor let him get lucky here for once hed gone someplace vanessa wouldnt followor wouldnt push ahead of him vanessa could get into a revolving door behind you and come out in front but she said i couldnt stand people telling me no all the goddamn time they dont tell you no all the time marshall said sometimes they tell you yes thats the payoff she shook her head too much of one not enough of the other he didnt want to argue with her so he let it alone arguing was her thing not his shed argue at the drop of a hat and shed drop the hat herself if she needed to but deliberately put herself in a spot where she might get rejected that no of course when she dated she was the one getting the attention not the one giving it she wasnt used to coming on to somebody and getting shot down in flames maybe that had something to do with how she felt or maybe im full of crap marshall thought it wouldnt be for the first time if he was he was a writer he called himself one anyhow the world believed him to the extent that it was willing to give him money for what he wrote it didnt give him as much as he wanted or needed but it gave him some so it did believe him and he had no idea what went on inside his sisters head even if she was somebody hed known his whole life no idea hell half the time he had no idea what went on inside his own head more than half the time it often seemed did other writers real writers writers who honest to god made a living slapping words on paper feel the same way if they didnt how could they know if they did how could they write so well questions came easy he wished he knew where god or whoever stashed the answers xviii winter in maine back before the supervolcano erupted back before squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles found themselves stuck in guilford with the greenville blues again that would have meant norman rockwell paintings or more likely currier and ives prints to rob he would have thought of christmas trees or being the cynical sort he was of pinescented air freshener these days winter in maine brought two things to his mind no three things he told himself starting his own mental python routine they were in no particular order not freezing to death not starving to death and marrying lindsey he knew the third one was coming he had a date and everything hed asked lindsey and shed said yes fool that she was he would have been a lousy marriage bet in ordinary times but then in ordinary times he never would have wound up stuck in guilford and got to know her to begin with jim farrell had already agreedor threatened depending on which way the wind was blowingto perform the ceremony life would go on it would if he to say nothing of the whole region could manage not to freeze and not to starve a hell of a lot of secondgrowth pines had already gone up in smoke so the stubborn souls who wanted to keep living north and west of the interstate wouldnt freeze to death these days people had to cut down trees a lot farther away from the little towns that dotted the countryside then they had to bring them back to the towns to go up in smoke they mostly had to do it without help of the internalcombustion variety life got interesting sometimes not warm but interesting life got hungry too just as there werent so many trees running around nearby these days there also werent so many moose on the loose rob had eaten some things he never would have imagined downing in preeruption los angeles squirrels for instance werent just for cats any more they were surprisingly tasty though there wasnt much meat on a squirrel carcass the same went for robins though the weather had got so nasty that not many robins came this far north any more rob wore snowshoes on his feet he had a rifle in his hands a dayglo orange vest told the worldand more particularly the numskulls also prowling this part of it with riflesthat he wasnt a moose a squirrel or any other refugee from the rocky and bullwinkle show hed been wearing that vest when he got shot did wearing it some more make him an optimist or a fool was there any difference moving on snowshoes was like riding a horse for a while your thigh muscles had to do things they werent used to doing they pissed and moaned about it sometimes loudly then they did it often enough to decide you werent trying to torture them after all so he glumped along between the piscataquis and manhanock pond the river was frozen so was the pondwhich being several miles long would have done for a major lake in socal here it was just one more souvenir of the retreating glaciers like minnesota maine was littered with lakes and ponds and puddles to an la guy so much fresh water sitting around doing nothing seemed perverse at the moment most of manhanock pond was a kingsized ice cube sitting around doing nothing if the weather was any indication the glaciers had just stepped around the corner for lunch and theyd be back any minute scientists loudly insisted the eruption wouldnt trigger a new ice age they couldnt have proved it by rob a crow flew by or maybe it was a raven rob watched it go without moving the rifle even if he could have hit a crow on the wing with a rifle a round would have turned it into no more than an explosion of black feathers against the sky birds were for shotguns with his piece he had to go after bigger game except for the faint crunch of his snowshoes over the drifts it was eerily quiet winters up here were like that get away from town and it was as if you were the only living thing as far as your eye and your ear could reach no not as if very often you were rob was now no cars on the roads that was for sure route to the north and route to the east to say nothing of route to the west which was exactly what route deserved to have said of it were covered with as much snow as the rest of the landscape if you had to travel these days you went by snowshoes or skis or horsedrawn sleighor in a desperate emergency by snowmobile those beasts murdered the silence for miles around off in the distance coming up from the southeast something moved rob was immediately alert it might be a moose he didnt think that was likely there were more towns with more hunters down in the direction of i moose had been scarcer in those parts before the eruption too but while it was unlikely it wasnt impossible he stood very still moose didnt see in color so if this was one it wouldnt be able to tell how hideous his dayglo vest was it might mistake him for a christmas tree or something even if he wasnt loaded down with tinsel and tacky ornaments he needed no more than a few seconds to realize that whatever was coming his way wasnt a moose he needed a little more time but not a lot to figure out what it was a dogsled straight out of the yukon a slow grin spread across his face that was another way to get around in this frozen part of the world at least if you had enough moose meat or kibbles or whatever the hell to keep your huskies happy right behind the first sled came another one rob could pick out the exact moment when the passengers saw himthe dogs of the lead sled swerved in his direction more slowly than he might have he realized he didnt have to keep standing there as if frozen by the weather he waved feeling stupid the people in the dogsleds waved back as the sleds neared rob decided he was glad he had the rifle the huskies seemed no more than a step removed from wolves and a small step at that if they hadnt been hitched to the sleds they might have decided to hunt him when the sleds stopped one of the passengers pushed back the hood of hisno herfurry eskimostyle parka to robs amazement styled blond hair cascaded out hi she said im marie fabianski from cnn can we interview you she spoke slowly with spaces between her words she might have been going into a foreign country where the natives couldnt be expected to speak or understand english very well a cameraman in the second sled aimed his weapon at robs bearded nonetooclean face um okay rob mumbled he wasnt usually thrown for such a loss but hed been away from anything wider than smalltown gossip since not long after the supervolcano blew terrific marie fabianski smiled a multikilowatt smile she had dazzlingly perfect teeth whether on her own or thanks to a talented dentist rob couldnt even begin to guess were here to do a feature to show the rest of the countryto show the rest of the whole wide worldhow the people in these parts are getting along isnt that exciting sure as hell she was treating him like a native and a dimwitted native at that what if wed rather be left alone rob said there wasnt much point to staying on the wrong side of the interstate if you wouldnt rather be left alone so it seemed to rob anyhow marie fabianskis smile never wavered the public has the right to be informed she said in ringing tones it wants to know whats going on in these forgotten corners of the country oh horseshit rob said with luck that would spoil some of the footage the cameraman was getting though they might just bleep over it he went on the american public doesnt give a rats ass about us up here its proved that ever since the supervolcano went off and you know what else we have the right to remain silent he might as well have saved his breath she sure kept on with her spiel as if he hadnt spoken do you know uh then she did pause she had to look down for a second to check her notes nodding to herself she started over do you know professor james farrell former unsuccessful republican candidate for the house yeah i know jim rob answered he is virtually the tsar of this new siberia isnt he marie fabianski rolled on she had all her preconceptions neatly lined up in a row if only they were ducks now that you mention it rob said no do you know where in this frozen wilderness professor farrell is currently residing she asked him wed like to get to the bottom of his extraconstitutional authority when everybody with constitutional authority forgets we exist what are we supposed to do but rob didnt come out with it what was the use what was the point marie fabianski wouldnt listen to him chances were she didnt intend to listen to jim farrell either cnn wouldnt have come up here to listen it was coming up here to talk of course shed never met jim if she had to make sure she got his name right she didnt know much about him the confrontation might prove interesting in the matterantimatter sense of the word and as a matter of fact hes right over there in guilford rob pointed in the direction from which hed set out if you give me a lift back to town ill introduce you that would be wonderful marie fabianski exclaimed which definitely proved she didnt know what she was getting into rob rode with the cameraman and the writer god forbid he should pollute the talent with his touch though both marie and he wore enough layers of clothing to make any contact between them strictly a rumor hed never been in a dogsled before the running huskies pulled it along at an amazing clip they leaned into their harness for all they were worth dogs got off on working no wonder i like cats better rob thought when they stopped in front of the trebor mansion inn the huskies stood there panting pink tongues lolling out of their mouths they were readyhell they were eagerto run some more dick barber came out wearing a navy peacoat and watch cap one corner of his mouth turned up slightly as he said you brought me some summer people rob way to go guilford hadnt seen much in the way of summer people or for that matter summer since the supervolcano erupted rob snickered to a californian the whole idea of summer people had always seemed bizarre to begin with the cnn crew looked blank one of the prerequisites for working in tv had to be a vaccination against irony who ah are your friends barber asked were from cnn marie fabianski said brightly we understand that james farrell is staying here wed like to interview him and learn more about current conditions in this part of the country a maine coon cat studied the huskies from a safe distance the dogs saw it and barked furiously the cat perhaps a coward but for sure not a fool decided somewhere else was a good place to be and departed thither at high speed dick barber seemed as bemused by it as he was by the descent of the media you would he said are you sure would we have come all this way if we werent she returned all this way was a couple of hours drive up from portland in good weather not much of that since the eruption and guilford was indeed a long way from the rest of the world who knows barber said but if he wants to talk to you i wont try to stop him just remember you brought it on yourselves why dont you come into my parlor im not even a spider he didnt say anything about whether marie fabianski was a fly a fire burned in the fireplace there that meant it wasnt frigid it was just cold and just cold in the middle of a posteruption winter felt wonderful to rob while the cameraman photographed the room and set up his tripod and some batterypowered lights across from the couch barber whispered you went out after moose yeah well this is what i found rob said defensively or i mean they found me jim farrell swept into the parlor he was elegant in his trademark fedora and a dark gray topcoat that remained dapper even if it showed it hadnt been new for a while not much clothing north and west of the interstate had been new any time lately an invasion by the fourth estate he boomed in his resonant baritone how quaint how outdated he didnt faze marie fabianski she must have got a double dose of the antisarcasm serum before long they sat side by side on the couch the lights went on so did the little red led on the camera im cnn correspondent marie fabianski speaking to you from the trebor mansion inn in guilford maine with me is retired professor james farrell who some call the de facto dictator of half the state of maine whom dear whom some call the de facto dictator farrell said genially i didnt think you were an english professor she retorted i wasnt but i do prize accuracywhich is more than a lot of people and organizations can claim these days farrell named no names he didnt even name any initials the jab went home even so standing quietly beside rob out of the shot dick barber grinned that mention of the trebor mansion inn would have been worth a lot to him back when there were summer people now it was no more than a mighthavebeen ive heard it said that you are the big boss in this part of the country marie fabianski tried again is that true or isnt it rob expected farrell to come back with something like ive heard it said that cnn hires lady reporters because of how pretty they are is that true or isnt it instead the old man complained a minute ago you said i was a dictator now im only a big boss make up your mind please well are you a dictator she sounded flustered things werent going the way shed expected shed never tried dealing with jim farrell before which had to explain a good deal he beamed at her like your kindly grandfather if your kindly grandfather happened to be a retired history prof and a political gadfly do i look like a dictator dictators can look like he overrode her do i sound like a dictator more to the point do i act like a dictator if i am a dictator wheres my army wheres my harem most important of all where are my tax collectors hard to be a dictator without what i believe the heathens term a revenue stream if youre not a dictator what would you call yourself out of her depth marie fabianski did her best to swim she was game anyhow someone who knows a little something about how to live without the socalled modern conveniences farrell answered someone who didnt go to washington and hole up there unlike a certain congresscritter i could mention someone the people around here trust and im entertaining we mostly cant watch cnn and the other comedy channels any more the poor benighted citizenry has to content itself with me she gaped she gestured to the cameraman he killed the bright lights and the video camera sighing she said i dont think weve got much of a story here i dont think you want your network to look like a pack of fools dick barber said of course she doesnt dick farrell said theyre trying to get by as best they can just like us we dont want to get to the point where we start eating each other and they dont want to lose ratings no matter where you are in the world its not easy it never was even before the eruption before the eruption rob wondered how many times hed said that and thought that in the days since he was starting to take the new harder life for granted but he still remembered the old one he remembered the difference he knew how big it was things wouldnt be the same again probably not till long after he was dead if they ever were that they looked bigger every day a hawthorne cop had got killed in a shootout with a bank robber the robber was also deceased which didnt surprise colin ferguson a bit the police tended not to take prisoners in those situations when the coroner finally released the robbers corpse a few grieving relatives and friends might lay him to rest funerals for officers slain in the line of duty were much bigger affairs cops and politicians from all the surrounding towns came to pay their respects fallen soldiers often didnt get such a fancy sendoff colin hadnt known the dead policeman he was here at chief pitcavages behest as the official representative of the san atanasio pd he hadnt worn his uniform for a while it felt scratchy the navy blue cap with the shiny brim was an unfamiliar weight on his head the casket was closed so he didnt have to go through the macabre ritual of filing past the body from what hed heard the poor bastard in there had stopped a charge of doubleaught buck with his face the undertakers couldnt make him look even halfway presentable and so colin sat on the uncomfortable wooden pew while the minister told the audience and the tv cameras from several local stations what a fine fellow the late office mcclintock had been mcclintock left behind a wife and two boys who were too little to understand what was going on their mother did she sobbed quietly through the eulogy of course the minister did his best to dance around the question of why god had let officer mcclintock stop a shotgun blast with his face if he was such a fine fellow what could you do but dance around that question it had no answer or none colin could see but if it had no answer what was the point of the church maybe the ceremony made the widow feel a little better maybe it just made her remember more and hurt worse he had no answers to that one either he listened to the pious phrases and kept his trap shut more often than not that was the best thing you could do he wasnt here to argue religious questions he was here to show the san atanasio police departments flag or he would have been if only the san atanasio pd had a flag after the eulogy ended he did have to go up and murmur words of condolence to mrs mcclintock im sorry he said im sorrier than i know how to tell you she nodded jerkily behind a black veil her face was paperwhite thank you for coming she whispered her boys stared up at her the older one might have been three he knew something wasnt right what it was hadnt sunk in yet not for him it hadnt anyway he didnt know how lucky he was to be so little the cops milled around talking to people they knew in other departments it was a bad scene they all knew they might have drawn the short straw the same way police work wasnt soldiering but it came as close as anything inside the usa a lean lapd sergeant came up to colin and said youre that ferguson guy right from san atanasio colin nodded guilty um do i know you the other guys face didnt look familiar but the sergeant answered oh weve met all right you bet your sweet ass we have he did lower his voice to make sure the widow couldnt hear that tell me where colin said he was usually good at placing people this time though he drew a blank with a sour chuckle the guy from lapd said at the braxton bragg offramp to the you were gonna have your troops machinegun me if i didnt get the fuck out of the way oh colin chuckled too in mildbut only mildembarrassment we really needed that oil i guess the lapd sergeant exclaimed i promised myself id punch you in the nose if i ever ran into you again well you can try colin unobtrusively shifted his weight he hadnt been in a fistfight since his patrolcar days but if this guy wanted to work out his grudge he didnt or not enough to start something here nah he said you were doing what you thought you had to do ill tell you thoughit rubbed me the wrong way when you made me back down youre lapd youre used to telling the little departments what to do colin said gotta feel funny when the shoes on your foot and not the other fellows itd look that way to you wouldnt it the lapd sergeant said im not talking about how the san atanasio pd made my department back down i dont want to slug the san atanasio pd you made me back down but hell you were just doing your job same as poor damn mcclintock was doing his sometimes youre the windshield sometimes youre the bug thats all mm colin would rather it were department to department not man to man i dont know your name he said knowing itand remembering itmight prove worthwhile im jack winters good to meet you jack for whatever its worth to you it wasnt personal colin held out his hand after a moment winters took it he squeezed with brief controlled strength then let go colin decided he might have been lucky the lapd man didnt feel like brawling take care winters said and walked away before long he was lost in the throng of dark blue uniforms his duty and the departments done colin drove back to the station he had to go slowly because bicyclists made up almost all of the traffic they gave him curious looks as he went past themnot he judged because he was in uniform in an unmarked car but because he had a working automobile he saw only a couple of others on the twentyminute trip there were many more people on skateboards on the sidewalk than drivers nobody was buying new cars either not only was nobody buying them hardly anyone was making them gm had declared bankruptcy again ford had tossed in the sponge toyota and hyundai were shuttering american plants the massive layoffs in the auto business after the eruption only planted another lily on the economys chest when colin got back he walked into mike pitcavages office how was it the chief asked about as gruesome as youd expect colin answered both men grimaced almost identically colin went on the widows stunned thats the only word that fits never gonna be the same for her and those kids they nailed the son of a bitch who shot mcclintock anyhow pitcavage said thats over she wont have to wait for them to try him and convict him and then wait another twenty years till they stick a needle in his arm he made a disgusted noise down deep in his throat yeah colin nodded he felt the same way any cop wouldjustice deferred was justice denied an awful lot of justice was being denied in california these days he didnt want to dwell on that so he told the chief about his encounter with jack winters heh pitcavage said he shouldve swung on you that wouldve given everybody something to talk about besides the sermon it wasnt worth talking about colin replied and the gossip wouldve been about my busted snoot pitcavage waved that aside surewhy wouldnt he it wouldnt have been his ox getting gored or his nose getting punched and his department would have scored the publicity lapd would have got egg on its face if colin had got blood on his when you were a chief maybe you didnt worry about such minor details you had to look at the whole picture right that was what it took to run a department even a small one like san atanasios right mike pitcavage sure seemed convinced it was colin colin had one more reason to count his blessings for not winning the chair mike was sitting in now whenever bronislav drove into the la area he stayed down in san pedro that was partly because he hoped to pick up more hauling work at the port partly because a goodsized serbian community had settled there he could hear his own language and speak it he could eat familiar food he could drink familiar booze it wasnt the old country but it was as reasonable a facsimile as he was likely to find on the shores of the pacific he could introduce vanessa to all those things too and show her off to his friends she rode the bus down there every chance she got when she landed a job she told herself she would drive in the meantime she had better things than gasoline to spend her money on shed fallen in love with a guy she knew in high schoolin love enough for him to pop her cherry anyhow shed been living with him when she met bryce and then in short order shed fallen in love with bryce and was living with him she really had thought that would last for a while she had for a while it had too she remembered telling him if i cant make it with you i cant make it with anybody but she couldnt make it with him how on earth could you get excited about or even interested in poetry written a million years ago in a dead language when he did make brief forays into the real world all he wanted to do was screw he didnt want to go out to dinner he didnt want to go shopping at the mall he didnt care about movies he didnt dance he did go to the occasional baseball game he approached baseball the same way he approached his ancient poetry as an archaeological problem vanessas interest in sports was almost as great as her interest in spiders sohagop she hadnt fallen in love with him no matter how much shed tried to tell herself she had he was a lifeline when she got sick of boring bryce if only she hadnt followed him to denver well now she was starting to think even that might have been worthwhile if she hadnt gone to denver she wouldnt have been coming back to la from the east and stopped in at that dennys outside las cruces she never would have met bronislav nedic and that obviously would have been the biggest tragedy since shakespeare hung up his quill pen bronislav made her happy in ways she hadnt even imagined before they met she wasnt used to being happy she still complained but her heart wasnt always in it in selfdefense shed learned bits and pieces about hellenistic poetry shed learned bits and pieces about the rug business toomostly about how everybody who had anything to do with it was the biggest robber not currently residing in san quentin and she learned from bronislav too they were walking along a street not far from the harbor when she saw a restaurant with way too many consonants in the name nobody from the former yugoslavia seemed to have heard of vanna white is that place any good she asked pointing his expressive eyebrows came down and pushed together in the center i dont know he said plainly he didnt care for the question vanessa couldnt see why he didnt like it shall we find out then she said no bronislav picked up his pace to hurry past the restaurant vanessa had to almost trot to catch up with him his legs were longer than hers why not she demanded when they were level again he stopped shortso short that she took an extra step and a half past him and had to turn back feeling foolish he was angry no he was furious she needed a couple of seconds to realize how furious he was unlike hers his rage burned cold the people who run that place they are not serbs they are croats he said by the way the last three words came out they might as well have been they are babybutchering carrioneating filth vanessa didnt get it so she said she knew just enough about the old deceased yugoslavia to recall that almost everybody in it had spoken a language called serbocroatian if both groups had used itand they must have or they wouldnt have given it their nameshow different could they be she proceeded to ask bronislav that very question he stared at her for close to half a minute with those disconcertingly sharp eyes at last he said you are an american he spoke softly and with great care as if reminding himself vanessa got the feeling that that was just what he was doing it pissed her off because the way he said it meant you dont know jack shit you are too she reminded himhed already told her more than once that he was a us citizen and that he was proud of it whats so awful about croats he patted his left arm with his right hand they gave me this then he stretched out his right arm so his crossandfourcs tattoo came all the way out from under his sleeve if i go in there and they see thishe tapped the tat with his left forefinger maybe we just fight or maybe they kill me or i kill them he spoke as matteroffactly as if he were talking about the chances of rain tomorrow that made what he was saying more scary not less why vanessa asked she wasnt used to feeling out of her depth but she sure did now bronislav gave her why in great detail he hated croats with the bitter passion someone could only feel for a close relative she tried to imagine hating her little halfbrother that way tried and felt herself failing bronislav had no trouble at all he hated the croats because he was orthodox and they were catholic he hated them because they used the roman alphabet and he used the cyrillic he hated them because he used hard vowels while they used soft ones say what vanessa askedthat one meant nothing to her not as a reason to hate and not at all nothing zilch for milk they say mleeyehko bronislav said the word very slowly and looked as if he wanted to wash his mouth out with soap while he did it we say mlehko you see the difference you hear i mean yes but he talked through her answer mleeyehko peh he spat on the sidewalk in disgust it is how fairies talk that was even less pc than her old man then bronislav talked about how during the war the croats had jumped into bed with hitler with open legs theyd tried to murder everybody they could reach who wasnt a croat and theyd done a damn good job of it if you listened to bronislav the croat irregulars the ustasha had been vicious enough to horrify the gestapo and the croats they still have ustasha today bronislav said they are as bad as their grandfathers were too i fightfoughtthem in eastern slavonia it is part of the serb homeland that the croats stole when they ran out of yugoslavia they always steal everything they can grab croats what would they say about serbs vanessa asked perhaps incautiously with great dignity bronislav replied i do not know i do not care whatever it is it would be a lie they didnt eat at the croatrun restaurant where there was one though there were bound to be more vanessa wondered if shed already seen some and assumed they belonged to serbs did all the serbs and croats in san pedro feel about each other the way bronislav felt about the people from the other side of the tracks or the border or whatever you wanted to call it she didnt ask him she didnt think she wanted to know badly enough to put up with another frozen explosion and hed intimidated her she didnt realize that till she was riding home on the bus the next morning even after she did realize it she didnt want to admit it to herself but it was true xix even these days sometimes you really wanted a car if you could possibly get hold of one colin didnt care to think about taking kelly to san atanasio memorial on his bike when she went into labor bringing the baby back that way didnt seem any too practical either the bus also wasnt the best bet talk about jumping on the kids immune system with both feet and so he made damn sure the taurus was in decent working order well before the due date as it had when he went to officer mcclintocks funeral the mere act of driving felt funny it wasnt that hed forgotten how or anything he hadnt but it wasnt part of his routine any more i dont take it for granted the way i did once upon a time he told kelly when he pulled into the driveway after taking the car to jiffy lube for a tuneup then he nodded to himself that was a big part of the change hed noticed all right kelly nodded with him she knew what he was talking about it wasnt as if shed driven to csudh every day before she went on maternity leave i bet they were glad to see you when you rolled in she remarked oh boy were they ever colin said they sure dont do the kind of business they used to we thought gas was expensive before the eruption lord what did we know who can afford it now except for something special kelly agreed she set one hand on the shelf of her belly she had quite a shelf to set it on it wouldnt be much longer i was shooting the breeze with the manager while they were working on the car colin said probably lucky i went in when i did their parent company is talking about filing for bankruptcy how many more people will that throw out of work she asked i dont know manager wasnt happy about it ill tell you that i guess hed be one of them san atanasio memorial by contrast was part of one of the few industries the supervolcano hadnt ruined people got sick and broke bones and had babies after the eruption just as they had before if anything they got sick more often than they had before thanks to extra lung problems and more hunger and colder weather coupled with less heat unlike most of america the hospital had power all the time it was heated to sixtyfive degrees which felt tropical to colin such extravagance cost of course he thanked heaven for the good medical plan that went along with his line of work without it without it he might have been filing for bankruptcy along with jiffy lube hed stayed with louise when all three of their children were born now he tried to coach kelly through the breathing exercises shed practiced getting ready for the day he hadnt told her that theyd done louise no good he could see everybody was different they were supposed to help some women have an easier time it wasnt fun for her he hadnt figured it would be they called it labor for a reason louise had been younger than kelly was now when marshall was born then again shed had james henry too and she was quite a bit older then it could be done done it was after nine tough hours in the process kelly called colin some things he hadnt suspected she knew how to say as things turned serious she also yelled im shitting a goddamn bowling ball that one cracked up the maternityward nurses who evidently hadnt heard everything after all the bowling ball turned out to weigh eight pounds one ounce and measure twentyone and a half inches colin cut the umbilical cord after the doctor tied it off hed done that with his older children too the feel of the surgical scissors slicing through that fingerthick cord was like nothing else hed ever known hed always thought that that cut ought to hurt the mother or the baby or maybe both of them but it never seemed to deborah michelle ferguson rooted at kellys breast when the nurse set her there after she went on the scale how are you babe colin asked hammered she answered even though it wasnt warm in the delivery room greasy sweat made her face shine under the fluorescent lights and matted her hair i want to sleep for a month her mouth twisted into a wry weary grin i knowgood luck well i wasnt gonna say that colin told her no but you were thinking it kellys gaze traveled down to the little pink critter in the crook of her left elbow ive got milk how about that me and elsie the borden cow elsies got milk a nurse said for the next couple of days youve got colostrum thats what the baby needs right now uhhuh kelly said the supervolcano probably took care of elsie anyway didnt quite get me elsies still around shell last as long as she moves milk and cheese and glue and whatever colin said after that shes short ribs short ribs oh my god i just realized how hungry i am thats hard work to do on an empty stomach kellys eyes swung toward the nurse in appeal what can i eat when can i eat it well bring you a tray after we take you back to your room dinner tonight is sliced chicken breast boiled potatoes and gravy and stewed carrots and raisins jello for dessert the nurse answered colin thought that sounded much too much like hospital food kelly exclaimed wow it sounds wonderful she was ready to eat a horse and chase the guy whod been riding it im gonna call marshall and vanessa and your folks colin said he leaned down and kissed kelly on the forehead she tasted sweaty too he also kissed his new daughter who paid no attention to him whatsoever mazel tov stan birnbaum said when he heard the news kellys father relayed it to her mother colin could hear miriam birnbaum burst into tears before she got on the line awesome was marshalls comment which would do for an english rendering of mazel tov tell kelly ill spoil the little brat rotten woohoo vanessa sounded more restrained than her brother congratulations dad theyre both all right they sure are he answered proudly and the old father isnt doing too bad right now either okay she said if he was on cloud nine she was on cloud threethree and a half tops she got off the phone fast enough to annoy him what was she doing waiting for an important call instead to her right now the serbian hit man or whatever the hell he was would probably qualify sighing colin called gabe sanchez youre a lucky bastard you know that gabe said as soon as he heard that mother and daughter were doing well thought had crossed my mind colin admitted im jealous is what i am gabe was bound to be kidding on the square his own love life hadnt been nearly so fortunate as colins since his divorce and the divorce itself was nastier than the one colin went through they said it couldnt be done colin thought but what the hell did they know gabe went on ill let the rest of the troops know thanks buddy colin told him he went back to the room kelly was sharing with a gal who was about to have twin boys the mere idea was plenty to make him cringe he pulled the curtain around kellys bed to give them the illusion of privacy no sooner had he got there than an asian gal from the kitchen carried in a tray food kelly cried like stout cortez or balboa or whoever it really was discovering the pacific only the conquistador didnt make the ocean disappear the way kelly inhaled the hospital dinner was a sight to behold she gulped the apple juice that went with it too then she delivered her verdict that was the best lousy meal ive ever had colin actually knew what she meant he didnt tell her so for fear she wouldnt believe him but hard work and crappy chow in his navy days made him understand a nurse brought in the baby wrapped in a pink blanket you can have it sleep by you tonight if you want she said or we can just bring it in when it needs feeding do that please kelly said shed been all for keeping the kid by her side through the night till colin talked her out of it with tales of how frazzled louise had been after doing that with rob okeydoke the nurse said now might as well get what sleep you can dear right kelly said after the nurse went away she muttered if i get any sleep at all on this miserable hospital mattress she punctuated that with a yawn if i cant sleep on it tonight i never will hope you do colin said tonight tomorrow night then i go home and the fun really starts kelly said well manage colin told her you already know what youre doing youve done it before for me itll all be onthejob training kelly rolled her eyes christ marshall knows more about taking care of babies than i do hes sure had more practice well manage colin said again and youll do great he believed that right down to his toes kelly wasnt as aggressively organized in everything she took on as he was but whatever she tried she did a good job at it he couldnt imagine motherhood being any different louise ferguson and james henry walked into the carrows on reynoso drive hello said the smiling young woman who seated people one and a high chair two and a high chair louise answered looking around were meeting somebody but i dont see her yet okay come this way please the young woman took her and james henry to a table is this all right sure louise lied shed sat at this table when she told him she was pregnant with james henry right after teo skipped on her she couldnt remember a less pleasant lunchtime even if the blt had been pretty good but ingrained politeness kept her from asking to sit somewhere else death before being difficult might have appeared as the motto on her family crest she held her son on her lap till a hispanic kid brought the high chair she wondered if he was legal and how closely carrows checked just closely enough to keep from getting into hot water with immigration odds were a waitress brought a menu for her and a childrens menu for james henry she also doled out a couple of crayons so he could color on it thank you he said gravely the waitress blinked then grinned youre welcome youre a good boy he is louise agreed it was true no matter how much hed complicated her life her own smile faded when she looked at the prices she hadnt been here for a whilenot since she lost her job at the ramen works its just carrows for crying out loud not wolfgang puck she thought but when groceries were hideously expensive and energy even further through the roof what could you expect even if it brought back those bad memories the blt was one of the cheaper things she could get pork hadnt gone up as much as beef and lamb plenty but not as much on the kids menu chicken nuggets were also less outrageous than the cheeseburger outrageous yeah but less so nowwhere had vanessa got to louise hadnt seen her since she got back to southern california vanessa had a habit of running late louise had had that habit too but colin cured her of it a cop had to stay on time and he made her do the same thing she hadnt slipped too badly since leaving him are you ready to order maam the waitress asked not for me not yet but could you get him the nuggets and fries and apple juice to go with em ill do that the waitress hurried away louise wondered why the place wasnt crowded were there any crowded restaurants left in the whole country if what carrows had to charge was any indication there wouldnt be louise also wondered if she would even recognize vanessa she hadnt seen her daughter since before the eruption she hadnt seen rob in even longer but neither had colin so that didnt count the same way the waitress delivered the nuggets and fries and juice james henry started slaughtering them he wasnt neatwhat little kid is but he wasnt fussy either all of louises other kids had been maybe this straightforward voracity came from teo it would be nice if something good did here was vanessa across the grassy strip in front of the restaurant shed cut her hair short it didnt fall past her shoulders the way shed always worn it before maybe that was what made her look harder tougher than louise remembered when vanessa walked into the carrows louise waved her daughter waved back and came over to the table louise decided the haircut wasnt what made her look tougher after all it was something in the line of her jaw and even more something in her eyes no matter what it was louise got up and hugged her good to see you she said good to be seen vanessa answered that was such a colin thing to come out with it cooled half of louises pleasure at the meeting but then vanessa added hi mom and you couldnt go very far wrong with that she eyed james henry so this is the new kid huh this is james henry louise agreed as vanessa sat down louise went on james henry do you know who this is a lady her son said a fry twitching at the corner of his mouth the way a cigarette would have in gabe sanchezs shes not just any lady shes vanessa your big big sister the way marshall is your big big brother oh james henry digested thatand more of the french fry is she gonna babysit me too well i dont know well have to wait and see louise answered this is all too bizarre vanessa said i come back to socal and ive got a little brother and a tiny sister i mean bizarre thats right kelly had her baby louise said how is she kellys okay vanessa answered the baby is noisy like a yowling cat only more annoying so were you dear before louise could even think about saying it the waitress came back louise did order the blt in memory of lost time that was the name of a book a book she hadnt read she didnt suppose she was likely to start it now either vanessa unburdened by memories of sitting at this table before chose the fried chicken in the end louise did ask and how are you getting along with colins new wife okay i guess by the way vanessas mouth narrowed it wasnt all that okay she went on shes pretty boring if you want to know what i think i mean unless youre talking about geology or something and geology doesnt get my rocks offnot even close louise needed a second to realize that was a pun she sent vanessa a reproachful look the kids got that kind of bad joke from their father too did that mean james henry wouldnt do such horrible things when he got bigger she could hope so anyhow when the food came she discovered that the blt wasnt just like the one shed had on that bad day with her ex that one had been on wheat before wheat got very scarce indeed this one came on rye and not the kind of rye theyd had before the eruption it was more like chewy flatbread than slices off a proper loaf it wasnt terrible but it was definitely different hows yours she asked vanessathe batter coating on the fried chicken wasnt the color it would have been in the good old days either but her daughter answered hey its fresh food im not gonna complain after all the mres ive eaten i bet ive got more preservatives in me than the stuffed animals at the museum isnt that something louise said to cover her own surprise in her experience vanessa could always complain about something or somebody maybe the time shed spent in camp constitution had done her some good after all louise knew better than to say anything like that vanessa would only indignantly deny it vanessa was always sure she was fine the way she was thankyouverymuch so louise tried had any luck finding a job she confidently expected to hear a no she sure hadnt had any luck herself then they could commiserate and piss and moan about the miserable state of the world but vanessa answered i think so looks as though nick gorczany wants me back at his widget works she added something else too low for louise to catch im sorry what was that louise cupped a hand behind her ear sure as hell her hearing was starting to go she hated that it was one more sign she was getting old and off gods warranty vanessas eyes flicked to james henry hed scarfed down his lunch and was busy coloring some more he couldnt have cared less vanessa repeated herself a little louder this time i said i didnt even have to screw him to get him to offer me the job oh vanessa sounded uncomfortable and she was said one way that would have been the kind of sour joke women made when they talked about the pains of living in a world with men in it but vanessa hadnt said it that way or louise didnt think she had hesitantly louise asked youre not kidding are you christ i wish i were her daughter said vanessa stabbed at the chicken thigh on her plate as if she were imagining a bigger sharper knife piercing a different flesh she chewed savagely and gulped ice water just when louise decided she didnt intend to go on she did you do what youve gotta do thats all we didnt know how good we had it before the supervolcano erupted and you can sing that in church mom life sucks now yeah life sucks and sometimes weve got to do the same goddamn thing she looked away her eyes full of rage do you want to talk about it to get in touch with your feelings louise had always believed getting in touch with your feelings was the best thing you could possibly do she sure hadnt been in touch with hers through most of her marriage to colin once she was she got away she got free she found brandnew love brandnew delight she also found single parenthood in middle age there sat james henry happily coloring away well anything you did in this old world was liable to have consequences and wasnt that the sad and sorry truth vanessa shook her head sharply enough to make louise sure that gesture like the way her daughter cut the chicken was full of suppressed violence no i dont want to talk about it vanessa answered and even if i did you wouldnt want to hear about it trust me on that one what i want is to forget it ever happened but you cant always get what you want can you louise thought of the stones song it was an oldie to her to vanessa it would be from as deep in the past as stardust or camptown races from before she was born what could be deeper in the past than that well what do you want to talk about louise asked her daughters features softened a little ive got a new boyfriend vanessa said this may be the real deal tell me about him louise urged vanessa had been sure hagop was the real deal sure enough to go to colorado to be with him before that shed been just as sure about bryce since bryce and colin had stayed friends louise was anything but sure about him and before bryce shed gone on and on about how she was going to have her high school boyfriends babies what was his handle peter that was it louise hadnt thought about him in years colin hadnt been able to stand him which made louise recall him more kindly now his name is bronislavbron if you have trouble with it hes been in the states for close to twenty years he still has an accent but his english is really good hes got amazing eyes eyes like a saints in a painting all big and brown vanessa said what does he do louise asked st bronislav she wondered but only to herself vanessa had never talked about any of the other men in her life in those termsfor sure she hadnt hes a longhaul trucker here but back in yugoslavia he was a freedom fighter her daughter said a freedom fighter is a terrorist we like louise could hear colins voice inside her head hed probably been talking back to some politician or other jerk on the tv when he said that she didnt quote him to vanessa for one thing she would rather have passed a kidney stone for another even if she had wanted to do any such thing her daughter wouldnt have listened she didnt need to be henry kissinger to understand that much about diplomacy he really was vanessa said as if louise had spoken up the croats over there they were a bunch of filthy fascist thugs and the bosnians were just like the taliban louise knew little about the woes of the exyugoslavia and cared less she did wonder what the whozits and the waddayacallems would have said about bronislavs causebut not enough to antagonize vanessa by inquiring some questions were more trouble than the answers were worth and you know what else vanessa added no what louise said had vanessa announced that her new squeeze had a necklace of human ears hed brought from the old country she wouldnt have been surprised when vanessa said hes a terrific cook thats what she wassurprised enough to burst into laughter vanessa looked irate im sorry louise said she meant it good manners mattered to her but i wasnt expecting that well he is vanessa insisted as if louise had tried to deny it he makes better stuff than the chefs at the serb places down in san pedro if you say so louise hadnt known there were serb places down there she couldnt remember the last time shed gone to speedro to shop at ports of call village before the eruption probably except for ports of call what reason would she have had to go there it wasnt one of las better neighborhoods which was putting things mildly i do vanessa knew what she knew what she knew wasnt always so but she knew it anyway dear i hope youre happy i hope everything works out just the way you want it to louise did hope so shed hoped so every single time vanessa threw herself headlong into life the way she threw herself headlong into all kinds of things and she threw herself out of love as abruptly as she dove in she wasnt made for halfway measures when the waitress brought the check vanessa grabbed it louise squawked her heart wasnt in it but not even the committee that handed out bestactress oscar nominations would have realized as much vanessa didnt listen to her that wasnt rare but the effect this time came out nicer than usual dont worry about it mom she said ive got work lined up for myself and youre still looking when you find something you can take me out to celebrate well thank you very much louise said vanessad even let her down without costing her face what was the world coming to thank you very much james henry agreed looking up from his abstract expressionist masterpiece louise and vanessa both laughed louise ruffled her little sons black hair even vanessas meeting with him had gone off better than shed expected a good day all the way around marshall ferguson and his friends kept getting together to play diplomacy they all had a better idea of what they were doing now than they had when lucas father first brought the box out of the closet today austriahungary and russia were ganging up on turkeyif the ottomans got loose they had a way of metastasizing through the mediterranean germany and france were trying to do the same number on england which could be even more dangerous but marshall who was playing perfidious albion talked italy into stabbing france in the kidneys so he was doing all right for himself tim had turkey this game he found a way to save the sultans bacon that wasnt in the rules just when things looked blackest he pulled out a fat baggie of what looked like killer dope experiments immediately followed it not only looked like killer dope it was killer dope it was such killer dope in fact that everybody stopped caring about who wound up top dog in europe marshall stopped caring about almost everything almost but not quite dude he said languidly whered you score such righteous shit tim giggled giggling was a hazard with what theyd just smoked but marshall wanted to know it wasnt urgentnothing was urgent or would be for a whilebut he did want to when he asked again tim giggled some more cmon man marshall said dope like this is hard to come by these days the supervolcano had done the same number on weed as it had on so many other cash crops climates that had been just right were suddenly too cold and production in areas that went from too hot to just right hadnt ramped up yet so good dope was indeed hard to come by but that turned out not to be why tim was gigglingor not the only reason anyhow he also wasnt giggling just because he was stoned out of his tree although he was you sure you want to know you really truly sure reallyo trulyo sure talk already marshall would have got mad if it didnt seem like too much trouble i dont want the trailer i want the fuckin movie he set everybody laughing tim included okay okay tim said just remember you asked for it you wanna know where i got the shit i got it from darren shitcabbage man how funny is that most of the erstwhile wouldbe masters of early twentiethcentury europe thought it was the funniest thing theyd heard in their entire lives or at least since they got baked lucas damn near wet his pants he thought it was so hysterical the chiefs kid dealing dope he said oh wow that is too much i mean way too much he nudged marshall how come you dont do that marshall smoked dope marshall bought dope it wasnt as if he didnt support his local dealers but hed never had the slightest urge to move into the supply end of the business you started getting into heavy shit when you did that and dealing with some highly unpleasant people from what he knew about chief pitcavages son darren had himself a head start on that his old man wished he would have drawn his line closer to truth justice and the drugs are wicked american way marshall didnt draw it there no matter what his father wished but he did draw a line darren pitcavage didnt seem to marshall fired himself another fatty if he got wasted enough maybe he wouldnt remember any of this tomorrow if he didnt remember it he wouldnt have to figure out what to do about it or whether to do anything at all about it he did remember hed known he would no matter how much he smoked you lost things for a while with weedsometimes anyway but they mostly came back hed never been into drugs that bit chunks out of your life and swallowed them for good if hed liked darren pitcavage better if his father had liked chief pitcavage better he still needed a couple more days to work up his nerve to go dad what his father sounded distracted and washe was changing deborahs diaper umyou know i went to lucas place over the weekend to play diplomacy right yeah howd it go dad had learned the game he and marshall sometimes played a cutthroat twoman version with a much newer copy of the game than the one lucas dad had resurrected each of them controlled three countries with weak sister italy vacant no real diplomacy in that variant but it was great for testing board maneuvers we mm kind of got sidetracked after a while tim marshall had to stop while dad snorted and snickered dad never had been able to take tim seriously not even for a minute licking his lips marshall made himself go on tim brought out some weed some fine weed and now tell me something i didnt know his father broke in your clothes smelled like a hemp farm outside of veracruz how dad knew what a hemp farm outside of veracruz smelled like was a question for another day and he hadnt even squeaked about the way marshalls clothes smelled till marshall raised the subject discretion from my old man marshall wouldnt have believed it if he hadnt seen it with his own eyes but there it was dad there was something in shakespeare that marshall couldnt quite recall about doing it quickly if you were gonna do it he brought the words out in a rush dad he bought the shit off darren pitcavage marshalls father held deborah in the crook of his elbow even so all at once it wasnt dad standing there any more it was lieutenant colin ferguson in full cop mode tell me that again i want to make sure i heard it straight most unhappily marshall repeated himself his father took a few seconds to work things through his face as expressionless as a computer monitor while the cpu crunched numbers on a big spreadsheet then he asked how much dope are we talking about here tim had like i dunno a few ounces marshall answered like enough to get us loaded but not enough to go into business for himself okay his father said to marshalls amazement and relief it did seem okay dad wasnt going to give him the sermon out of reefer madness instead his father went on did tim say whether darren pitcavage was in business for himself or was this one friend selling some to another friend marshall had to think back um tim didnt say one way or the other but i know for a fact hes not tight with darren or anything he was like cracking up on account of he was buying dope from the police chiefs kid uhhuh his father said the grim finality in that almostword made alarms blare in marshalls head dad he said urgently for gods sake dont drop on him if you do hell know i talked to you and he didnthe couldntgo on for a wonder he didnt have to draw his father a picture nobody loves a snitch dad said marshall managed a nod dad continued but when somebody knows something important and he keeps quiet about it a lot of the time thats worse he waited marshall nodded againnot with any great enthusiasm but he did dad set a hand on his shoulder and dad was anything but a touchyfeely guy this may be that kind of important i dont know for sure that it is but i think id better find out try not to drag tims name into it marshall said again and he stopped short once more try not to drag yours in too his father finished for him yeah marshall hated the dull embarrassment in his own voice darren pitcavage is a nasty piece of work no matter what his father does for a living dad said if it werent for his father i think we wouldve taken him off the streets a while ago well maybe better late than never if you say so marshall wasnt sure of that or of anything else xx colin ferguson contemplated ways and means of busting his boss son without making it look like a coup detat inside the san atanasio police department the more he contemplated the gloomier he got the case would have to be deadbang one hundred percent airtight and it would have to get made without mike pitcavages finding out it was even cooking because if the chief did find out something else would cook instead colin knew what too his own goose if of course there was a case if darren had sold tim a few ounces and that was the only time hed ever seen that side of the business that was one thing but if hed sold a few ounces to a good many tims dicks and harrys that was something else again that was a serious felony was what it was if marshall didnt know for certain maybe tim didnt know for certain colin suspected tim didnt know anything for certain the alphabet very possibly included but the vibe was that darren pitcavage was doing some real dealing do i want to put my neck on the block because of the vibe yes that was the question much more than to be or not to be or colin thought it was at first then he realized they were one and the same only his version wasnt in iambic pentameter it was well before noon when he walked over to gabe sanchezs desk and said lets go code seven gabe blinked early he remarked but then he patted his midsection hey i can always eat where you wanna go how about the verona colin suggested kind of a ways gabe said and it wasthe oldfashioned italian place was closer to colins house than to the station that was why he wanted to go there he didnt want other cops overhearing him he couldnt very well say that here a clenched jaw and a raised eyebrow got some kind of message acrossgabe stood up with no more argument well im game whats it doing outside well both find out it was chilly and cloudy but not raining gabe lit a cigarette they climbed onto their bicycles and pedaled off colin did a good deal of talking on the way no one except gabe could hear him then he finished just before they got to the verona what do you think he asked holy shit gabe said colin chucklednot in any happy way yeah i figured that out for myself matter of fact i bet you did gabe exclaimed you better watch who you talk to too word gets back and youre walking around without your nuts that also crossed my mind colin said they went inside the verona was a refugee from the s with redchecked tablecloths candles stuck in chianti bottles often useful now not just for show and posters of the leaning tower of pisa and the colosseum on the walls they made spaghetti and meatballs lasagna raviolistuff like that and they had a woodfired pizza oven so they stayed open even when the power went out colin and gabe decided to split a medium sausage pizza the dough would be odd by preeruption standards so would the cheese the sausage would be pork or maybe chicken by now colin made such adjustments almost automatically almost ill tell you who to go to gabe said when the pizza got there talk to rodney man he hates dealers with a passion and he wont screw you even if it turns out to be nothing colin said even then gabe took a bite from a slice of pizza he chewed thoughtfully could be worse could be better too sure could colin agreed after a bite of his own but he ate with more enthusiasm than hed expected the black detective had been on the mental list he was making tooand by the nature of things that list wasnt very long he paid the tab the cops unlocked their bikes from the little curbside trees to which theyd been chained gabe smoked another cigarette on the way back to the station it started drizzling just as they got there they hurried inside chief pitcavage was gabbing with the uniformed officer at the front desk he nodded amiably to colin and gabe hey guys wet outside just a little like it doesnt know whether to piss or get off the pot gabe answered colin was glad to let him do the talking dammit he didnt have anything against mike pitcavageexcept for raising a worthless kid and letting him decide he would get away with anything because his father was a bigwig in this town pitcavage wouldnt think like that of course hed think it was because he got the chiefs badge and colin didnt were things reversed between them it would have been too colin was positive of that he quietly checked which cases rodney ellis was working on then ambled over to his desk want to talk with you about the witnesses to the robbery at that checkcashing place last saturday he said as casually as he could well okay rodney answered that wasnt colins usual style but it wasnt too far out of line either drag up a rock he pointed to the beatup chair by his desk lets do it in one of the interrogation rooms colin said coupla things i want to bounce off you however you want rodney got to his feet he was solidly built but moved as smoothly as the point guard hed been in high school they walked into one of the rooms colin closed the door behind them and glanced up at the camera near the ceiling to make sure the red light under the lens was off he hadnt even sat down when the africanamerican detective asked whats really going on man ive got a problem colin said maybe you can give me a hand with it im listening ellis showed no cards well neither had colin but he had to now he had to if he was going to go anywhere with this anyhow he told rodney what hed heard from marshallwhat marshall had heard from tim in other words he named no names though he was glumly aware rodney would work out at least one of them without a hell of a lot of trouble when he finished rodney didnt say anything for close to a minute then very softly the other cop went aw shit man colin nodded couldnt have put it better myself it wasnt your kid who bought from pitcavage junior sure as anything ellis could walk barefoot through the obvious no a friend of his ive known uh himcolin almost said timsince they were in high school they kinda stopped handing out brains before the guy got to the front of the line but im pretty sure he wouldnt make up something like that for the fun of it the way marshall tells it his buddy thought it was a big old joke a joke uhhuh rodney didnt sound like somebody who was going to rofl you believe this happened because your boys friend says it did you believe darling darrens dealing those werent questions not the way he came out with them fraid so colin nodded again he would rather have gone to kellys dentist father for a root canal without novocaine but he did would i be talking about it with you if i didnt believe it not fuckin likely ellis answered which was also the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth he eyed colin what do you want to do about it that was the question all right colin had been thinking of little else since his son gave him the unwelcome news sighing he said seems to me weve got to find out how deep darrens in if this was a onetime thing if he scored more than he could use for a while and was selling some then i guess we shine it on but if hes dealing dealing if you know what i mean then we got to drop on him rodney didnt ask that eitherhe said it colin made his head go up and down one more time rodney went on and whatever we do we got to do it so chief mike doesnt know were doin it probably a good plan colin agreed so dryly the other cop guffawed i trot over to the chiefs office now man youre fucked the africanamerican detective said yeah i know colin left it right there ellis stared up at the acoustic tiles on the ceiling he let out a sigh of his own and if i dont go to pitcavage if i start working this like its a case and he finds out im fucked too im sorry shit im sorry all kinds of ways colin said if you want to make like this entire conversation never happened hey i can see why you would long as you dont rat me out i wont hold it against you wanna know something weird colin i believe you rodney said anybody else in the whole wide worldd be blowin smoke up my ass pitcavage sure would lord knows but you i believe doesnt matter any which way though on account of im in if darrens dealing hes got to pay the price same as anybody else wasnt for his daddy he woulda paid some prices a while ago by now bout time he finds out the rules dont have except for you in em anywhere looks that way to me too colin said he hadnt been so relieved since since when since kellyd said shed marry himthat was the only answer that crossed his mind thanks man he added a moment later hed never been one for big shows of gratitude its cool colin yes rodneyd known him long enough to have a notion of how he ticked anybody who deals he aint no friend of mine he peered up at the ceiling again as if trying to extract wisdom from the random patterns of holes in the tiles talk about friends though we end up busting the chiefs kid this whole goddamn departmentll go off like a grenade that did occur to me yeah colin said be careful while youre working on it be careful who you pick to help you too you know the old linethree guys can keep a secret as long as two of em are dead i didnt but i like it thoughtfully ellis continued not the only reason to be careful darren hell make a lot of cops a couple of the brothers who havent been here since dirt maybe not lets hope hes one of the white guys who figure all black folks look alike thats a bunch of bull too colin said you dont look one damn bit like halle berry rodney laughed well you got that right anyway long as were here you wanna really talk about the robbery sure lets do it colin said so they did deborah started to nurse kelly felt her milk let down that was a sensation shed never knownnever even imaginedtill she had the baby well so was labor but this was a lot more pleasant than that deborah sucked and gulped sucked and gulped then she tried to gulp when she should have been sucking or something because she choked and swallowed wrong the first time that happened it had horrified kelly now she got that it wouldnt kill her firstborn daughter she pulled deborah off the breast and hauled her up onto her own shoulder patting her on the back till she could breathe easily again it didnt take long then the baby went back to supper kellyd just switched her to the other side when her eyelids started to sag up on the shoulder she went once more kelly wanted to get a burp out of her before she crashed she also checked the babys diaper deborah was dry that was good okay kid you can sack out now kelly said rocking in the recliner with luck deborah would stay sleep long enough for kelly to make dinner perhaps even long enough to let her eat it that was bound to be against the babies union regulations but the local hadnt come down on deborah yet the front door opened somebody was back from work colin or vanessa dont sl wham too late deborah jerked and yelled shit kelly muttered vanessa sauntered into the front room from the foyer aw did i wake her yeah you did thanks a bunch kelly was too frazzled to stay cool maybe that horseshit aw had something to do with it no for sure it did i tried to tell you not to slam the goddamn door but did you listen fat chance vanessa blinked kellyd done her best to play the easygoing stepmomtill now well excuse me ms highandmighty vanessa said can i kiss your ring you can kiss my ass vanessa kelly said meanwhile rocking to try to calm deborah down again now that somebodys been dumb enough to hire you the sooner you get the hell out of here the happier everybody else will be fuck you too vanessa snarled she stomped up the stairs and slammed the door to her bedroom too kellys stomach churned she didnt like fights she didnt do them very well or she didnt think she did and she was damn glad shed already nursed deborah because if she hadnt the baby would be chowing down on sour milk right this minute deborah was just going back to sleep when colin walked in on the off chance that she might be he closed the door quietly when he walked into the front room he stopped short good god in the foothills he said ive seen guys we tased who didnt look so ready to bite holes in things what did i do whatever it is im sorry you didnt do anything kelly said and not another word uhoh colin didnt need any fancy dna analysis to work out what must have happened you and vanessa fired away huh yeah we did kelly sighed she wasnt proud of it not even slightly what went on do i want to know she told him it didnt take long she finished you go upstairs youll hear a different version though i bet uhhuh hearing a bunch of different stories comes with being a cop so does deciding which one you believe or whether you believe any of them colin said the corners of his mouth turning down i already have a notion about that but i am gonna go upstairs and he did more slowly than vanessa had he knocked on her door she said something kelly couldnt make out what but colin answered its me so she must have asked who was there the door opened then closed again rocking deborah kelly could hear colins voice and vanessas but once more she couldnt follow what they were saying by their tones she counted herself lucky there then vanessa was in the classic nixonian phrase perfectly clear get out of here everybody hates me if shed been thirteen that kind of thing would have come with the territory kelly remembered screeching the same words in the same tone but since vanessa was more than twice thirteen the door to her room opened and closed again colin came down the stairs his face held no expression at all kelly got to her own feet as fast as she could without bothering deborah the baby muttered but her eyes stayed shut im sorry kelly said not your fault colin went into the kitchen kelly followed him he got the laphroaig bottle down from the top shelf of the pantry and poured himself three fingers worth im gonna put her in the crib fix me one too would you not quite that much kelly said he gave her a surprised look you dont drink this stuff tonight i do deborah went into the crib with another mutter but no more kelly hurried back to the kitchen colin handed her the dose of scotch that was how she thought of it all right they clinked glasses she drank she still didnt see how he could enjoy the taste but she wasnt drinking it for the taste she was drinking it for the booze how was the rest of your day she asked better than this i hope not so youd notice colin answered darren pitcavage deals everything this side of real estate and old buicks setting up a buy is gonna be a piece of cake looks like not just a felony busta bigtime felony bust im sorry kelly felt the inadequacy of words yeah me too colins eyes slid toward the stairway but im not sorry vanessa doesnt know thing one about this way she is right now if she did shed probably get hold of darren and let him know we were looking at him she wouldnt do that kelly exclaimed oh i think she might colin said but thats illegal isnt it sure if you get caught lots of things are illegal if you get caught mm kelly said uh does marshall know not to talk with her about this well i havent told him not to colin answered but i dont think he wants to talk about it with anybody he wants to make like it never happened and he never had anything to do with it and he doesnt talk to vanessa any more than he has to in case you didnt notice i did kelly said i wondered if you had shows what i know doesnt it she will get a place of her own pretty soon colin replied which might or might not have been a non sequitur well all be happier once she does too shes okay in small dosesand shell decide were okay in small doses too im sorry kelly said once more he shrugged nothing to be done about it yeah shes prickly but shes honest as the day is long i dont have to worry that mikes getting ready to come after her the way im going after darren thats so kelly said which was as much praise as she felt like giving vanessa just then she changed the subject or at any rate deflected it a little what will mike do after you grab his son im not looking forward to that by the way colin set his jaw he really wasnt looking forward to it he went on when darren got in trouble before mike always dickered it down to a misdemeanor five gets you ten he tries it again but i dont care how hard he tries not a chance in church the da will play along not this time can he stay chief if his son gets arrested for something like this kelly asked under that question lay another one one she left unspoken if he does have to step down will they offer you the job will you want it if they do i dont know i dont think theres any rule that would make him quit but it wouldnt be easy for him to go on like nothing was wrong colin also heard the underlying question which surprised kelly very little he went on if he does resign i wouldnt take the slot on a bet no way not after i went and knocked him off his perch besides i dont want it any more hed told kelly the same thing before and more than once but when hed told her before hed had about as much chance of being elected pope as of being named chief of the san atanasio pd if mike pitcavage did have to resign now in offspringinduced disgrace the city council and the da and the other people who ran san atanasio might well want to put him in charge of the department for a while so he could straighten it out and get it back on its feet and she could see how with his strong sense of duty and responsibility hed be tempted to accept the job at least as a caretaker but his reasons for steering clear looked good to her there was also one he hadnt mentioned if they did name you chief youd start telling them to piss up a rope in about three days or if you didnt youd want to so bad youd explode like the supervolcano i wouldnt tell em to do that in three days colin affected righteous indignationbrief righteous indignation id hold out for a week easy a week and a half if everything went good laughing and liking him very much in that moment she gave him a hug think so do you darn right i do he laughed tooagain though not for long mike he can tell those people what they want to hear what they need to hear the way they need to hear it thats an art honest to god it is ive watched him do it and ive watched him get what he needs cause he can do it when i realized he could and i cantand youre dead right i cant not for beansthat was when i figured out i was barking up the wrong tree when i put in for chief to begin with youre fine the way you are better than fine kelly said id rather have you than somebody who pats me on the back so he can feel where the best place to stick the knife is well im glad you think so not everybody doesyou dont believe me all youve got to do is ask louise colin let out another sharp short chuckle and i make a pretty fair cop if i do say so myself but if youre gonna be chief you have to know how to handle all the political stuff i cant and mike pitcavage can if hes got to step down on account of his rotten kid theyd better pick somebody a lot like him to take his place kelly listened hard she couldnt hear any rancor or bitterness she thought she would have if they were there colin could hold things in but only by keeping quiet about them when he did talk he meant what he said i am sorry i had the row with vanessa kelly said unlike her husband she wasnt altogether blind to the power of positive hypocrisy i wish it hadnt happened that much was true the rest maybe not quite if she wants to give you a hard time thats between her and you meeting my new wife and getting along with her it cant be easy for a grown kid colin said marshall hasnt had any trouble ive seen kelly said tartly marshalls marshall he doesnt get himself in an uproar about stuff vanessa does shell go to war over commas makes her a darn good editor makes her kind of a pain too and shes a woman and so are you colin set a fond hand on the curve of her hip but then he said thats not where i was going with this where were you going then kelly asked if she gives you a hard time thats her business hers and yours colin said but if she gives a little tiny baby a hard time thats a whole different ball game thats being mean for the sake of being mean she knew what she was doing when she slammed the front door all right i called her on it too she didnt like that very much he hadnt raised his voice kelly would have heard if he had no vanessa was the one whod started yelling but colin didnt need to make a lot of noise to get his message across kellyd known that as long as shed known him vanessa wouldnt have cared for his opinion even delivered quietly as long as it happens just the once ill forget about it kelly said sounds about right there colins agreement seemed reluctant he went on since she has landed a job she will want a place of her own shell want one and shell get one and if she had some notsodiscreet encouragement from her father to speed her on her way that wouldnt bother kelly a bit not even half a bit kelly thought as she started fixing dinner dick barber eyed rob in mock reproach as they came up to the episcopal church snow swirled through the air it was one of the months with a vowel in it so of course snow swirled the things some people will do to get out of climbing a ladder every time they want to go to bed barber said dont listen to him rob justin nachman said now that youre officially moving out of the tower im gonna sublet it ill be rich man rich he chortled unwholesomely and rubbed his mittened hands together in gloating anticipation a ham shylock would have envied i wasnt listening to him you dont need to worry about that rob answered of course i wasnt listening to you either hey there you go charlie storer said equalopportunity discrimination rob waited for the next smartass crack to come from biff thorvald but biff was less into them than his bandmates and the proprietor of the trebor mansion inn and he had more distractions he was making sure his little son walter didnt trip on the rough sidewalk he was also shepherding cindy along his wifes belly bulged again that made her balance less sure but she at least knew enough to be careful walter wanted to go running all over creation it wasnt as if he even walked very well because he didnt toddlers always wanted to do more than they possibly could though and this makes them different from other people how rob wondered others going into the church waved to him and called congratulations some were people he knew in guilford othersmoretaught or worked at piscataquis community secondary school with lindsey when was the last time you were in a church and it wasnt for a town meeting or something like that barber asked oh wow rob had to think about it like most of his family he thought freedom of religion implied freedom from religion mom drifted from one new age almostfaith to another but rob like his father and sister and brother pretty much did without then a memory came back my senior year in college i went to a wedding at an old mission north of santa barbara dont jinx methat one didnt last this isnt a church wedding anyway even if its in a church charlie said that was also true they went into the church standing up at the front instead of a minister in his clerical vestments was jim farrell in his decidedly secular ones the fedora and furtrimmed topcoat set him apart from the crowd at least as well as a white dog collar would have the wedding was the event of the winter social season from lack of competition as rob knew perfectly well lindseys mother had come over from doverfoxcroft to attend her father had come down from greenvilleeven fartherwith his girlfriend said girlfriend was a smashing brunette and was about lindseys age whether shed caused the breakup between lindseys folk or come along afterwards rob didnt know maybe ill get the chance to ask later on he thought for the moment the atmosphere was what the diplomats called correct with luck it would stay that way having winter guests in guilford from such distant towns doverfoxcroft was ten or fifteen miles away greenville about twentyfive brought home to rob how tightly his mental horizon had contracted since he came here guilford and its immediate environs were all that concerned him from day to day news from other places north and west of the interstate trickled in every so often it was well out of date by the time it did he cared no more than the people whose families had lived here for generations when it did trickle in it was news to him what else mattered when most of the snow melted and the roads cleared during maines short stretch of alleged summer news from the great big wide world came in along with canned goods sacks of flour gasoline condoms and other vital supplies once upon a time rob had been a news junkie now hey it was a long way away and it had happened a while ago he couldnt do anything about it so why get excited for this performance dick barber was playing the role of his fathernowhere near the worst casting in the world justin was his best man charlie and biff his groomsmen lindseys principal who looked like a pit bull with goldframed glasses but actually seemed pretty nice did duty as the matron of honor her bridesmaids were a couple of teachers shed told rob her dads new arm candy had tried to volunteer for one of those slots but was more or less politely discouraged next thing rob knew he was standing in front of farrell he couldnt quite recall how hed crossed the intervening space teleportation seemed unlikely but he couldnt rule it out lindsey stood beside him so everything else receded into the background her dress was white if not exactly a wedding gown hed borrowed a blue blazer and tie from dick barber weddings funerals and gunpointyes this was one of the happier reasons to don a tie jim farrell beamed at the two of them i have the honor to be standing in this place by virtue of authority invested in me as the law west of the pecosor at least west and north of i if i say youre married youre as married as youre ever going to be in these parts have you got that rob managed a nod next to him lindsey did too her eyes sparkled rob doubted he would have got on with her so well if she didnt think jim was one of the funnier critters on two legs along with marrying you im supposed to stuff you with good advice like forcefed geese farrell went on thats a hot one isnt it i never tied the knot myself and i stopped caring about the amusement value of the fair sex a few years ago so youre thinking well what the devil does he know we might as well be at a town meeting hey this time rob didnt nod but he came close laughs and chuckles rippled through the pews but i am an escapedexcuse me a retiredhistorian so i may possibly have learned a little something possibly jim farrell said people do seem to get along better when theyre willing to put up with each others foibles if youre convinced you have the one right answerrob heard the capital letters thump into placegood luck with the rest of the human race if you think youre going to impose it on everybody else no matter whatmore loud capseven good luck wont help amen dick barber said quietly pious agreement to a secular thought oh farrell raised a gloved forefinger as if at an afterthought he liked people have been screwing each other for as long as thereve been people you should probably do some of that too more laughter came from the audience rob had all he could do not to snicker out loud lindsey did squeak you can laugh but you cant hide farrell said with mock severity since you arent even trying you must want to go through with this rob do you take lindsey as your wife for richer and poorer in sickness and in health and for as long as you both shall live he might have been thinking or until one of you reaches for a lawyer but he didnt say it i do rob answered official it was yes lindsey do you likewise and likewise respectively and for just as long i do she said yes it was very official then i do toopronounce you man and wife that is farrell said mr ferguson you may kiss mrs ferguson rob did lindsey still hadnt decided whether shed take his last name or keep kincaid rob wasnt about to commit litcrit though hed got a ring on a trip of his own to doverfoxcroft he slipped it onto lindseys finger that was another way to make things official and there was one more but that would have to wait till after the reception moose meat roast goose stewed squirrel a homesmoked ham potatoes parsnips pickled mushrooms sauerkraut moonshine vodka and applejack storebought whiskey somebodyd been saving for a snowy day squirt frog and the evolving tadpoles provided the dance music with a local kid filling in for rob the kid wasnt terrible but rob didnt think he needed to worry about getting booted out of the band on the dance floor he was no threat to the ghosts of michael jackson and fred astaire he didnt worry about that either the reception was a success everyone had plenty to eat nobody punched anybody else no one groped lindseys dads hot girlfriend or if anyone did she didnt squawk about it what more could you want jim farrell laid on his sleigh to take the newlyweds back to lindseys apartment how about that rob said as she unlocked the door were really married he picked her up and carried her over the threshold darn right we are she agreed and what do you propose to do about it mister i already proposed he pointed out why dont we go back to the bedroom huh i expect ill think of something they did and he did xxi louise ferguson hadnt heard from her eldest son more than a handful of times since the supervolcano erupted he seemed content to stay up there in maine that struck her as somewhere along the range between masochism and madness but it was his life the postcard she found in her mailbox today bore a picture of the business end of a mosquito silhouetted against the sun beneath it was the legend the state bird of maine she grunted laughter that was the kind of thing hed send all right she would have recognized the style even if she hadnt recognized the spiky script on the back by the time you read this ill be a married man he wrote her name is lindsey kincaid she teaches at the high school in town so maybe one of these days youll have grandkids running around under the snow here say hello to anyone you happen to run intorob from the postmark the card had taken almost three weeks to cross the country the usps was one more outfit that had been in big trouble even before the supervolcano erupted trying to cope with all the insanity since the eruption hadnt made it run better or more efficiently what could you do the postcard had eventually got here she wished some of her bills would come so slowly and that the bastards who sent them out would take the post office sucks as an excuse when her own payments ran late the longer she stayed out of work the later some of them got too she would have been out in the street with her worldly goods piled on the curb if so many other people didnt have the same problems for the same reasons they werent too big to failthe classic phrase from the recession before the eruption a recession that now looked like pretty goddamn good times but they were too numerous to evict even if they had failed pay what you can when you can was rapidly ousting e pluribus unum as the national motto louise expected shed start seeing it on coins and bills any day now if she wanted to keep collecting her divorced single moms mite from the california edd she had to keep looking for work when she could she did it on the net and with her phone when she couldnt she gritted her teeth forked over some of her unemployment check to marshall and climbed aboard the bus for new adventures in jobseekersland she had no enormous hope hope was not one of jobseekerslands natural resourcescertainly not since yellowstone blew up but you had to go through the motions and to be able to document that you were going through the motions or your edd checks would dry up going out to look for work was a pain in the ass losing the unemployment checks would be a supervolcano eruption in your own life and so glumly louise walked into van slyke pharmacy at the corner of van slyke and reynoso drive it was a momandpop place not part of a chain along with the usual patent medicines and shampoos and school supplies and whatnot it sold brightly painted pottery artifacts that might be decorative if you were tasteless enough stuffed animals that looked sort of but not quite like famous cartoon characters and a bunch of secondhand books the pharmacists bad haircut and funky glasses frames warned that he might actually enjoy the ceramic tumors he was trying to unload the badge he wore on his pastel polyester shirt said his name was jared louise wanted to giggle to her jared was a singing smiley on her computer that butchered ballads in spanish complete with wretched guitar accompaniment help you he asked his lenses made his eyes seem enormous well im looking for work she said resignedly one more humiliation then on to the next but instead of going sorry or not today or we dont need anybody jared said i was going to post on craigslist when the power comes back on if it ever does what was your last job i was an administrative assistant at the ramen companys headquarters on braxton bragg louise answered in astonishment why did you leave i didnt have much choice they closed down their american operation thats rightthey did i remember hearing about that the pharmacist nodded you can answer the phone you can type you can handle an inventory spreadsheet when there is power louise managed a dazed nod i can do all that im not exactly an excel whiz but i can cope if its not too complicated ill give you a try then jared said briskly i had to let someone go last week i feel bad about it but she just couldnt do the work if you cant i wont keep you either but if you can ill be glad to have you i cant do all that stuff and run the place too not if i want to sleep i cant louise could hardly believe her ears what kind of money are we talking about he told her it was less than the ramen works had paid but it whaled the tar out of unemployment medical after six months he added its not a terrific plan but its better than nothing when do i start she asked if she couldnt stand it shed start looking for something else something better the best time to look for work was when you already had some monday morning ten oclock sharp he said ill have paperwork for you to fill out then cant do anything without the paperwork better yours than the edds louise said from the bottom of her heart thats a good way to look at things jared said tell me your name why dont you me im jared watt pleased to meet you mr watt louise gave her own name youve got no idea how pleased i am to meet you oh i just might mrs ferguson its miz louise said okay ms ferguson jared watt repeated it perhaps to help himself remember like i say i just might you arent the only one whos had a tough time the past three four years i feel great now louise meant every word of it an indifferent job in a business that didnt look to be thriving with a boss who definitely seemed peculiar hey it was work no wonder she meant every word if i never see that torrance unemployment office again itll be too soon well all right the pharmacist said if i cant drive you loopy i dont expect anyone can im not even worried about it louise meant that too whether shed mean it by closing time a week from friday might be another story altogether itll be a week with a paycheck anyhow she thought they dont make weeks any better than those colin ferguson looked at his watch it was only twentyfive past two he would have bet it was four oclock time flies when youre having fun he thought and then yeah as if he hadnt been this nervous since well the last time he was this nervous and that was probably when hed asked kelly to marry him a while ago in other words he looked at his watch again it was he made himself not look at it or at the clock on the copshop wall the bust would go off the way it was supposed to or it wouldnt whichever hed pick up the pieces and go on what else could you do at by the clock on the wall his cell phone rang he hauled it out of his jacket pocket ferguson we have ourselves a bust lieutenantbest damn bust since beyonce rodney sounded happy as a sheep in clover and well he might have he went on weed meth coke h possession with intent to sell oh and a automatic which he had sense enough not to pull when we dropped on him we grabbed his laptop toosee what kind of good shit hes got on the hard drive and where that leads us okay that all sounds good colin couldnt decide whether to be delighted or mournful he went both ways at once and felt torn to pieces on account of it tim had known what he was talking about after all there was never any guarantee of that not even when you asked him something as basic as his name lucky for him he didnt go for the colin went on bringing himself back to the matter directly at hand yeah that wouldve been the last dumb thing he ever tried rodney agreed this way hell get some more chances whenever they finally decide to turn him loose wanted to let you know everything went smooth were gonna bring him in now good job man thanks bye colin stowed the phone nobody involved in taking darren pitcavage down had put anything into the san atanasio pds computer system nobodyd said anything over the departments radio net what chief pitcavage didnt see or hear he couldnt warn his son about well they didnt have to worry about that any more mike pitcavage would hear now colin couldnt imagine that that would do himor darrenany good though would he try to bargain this bust down to a misdemeanor too good luck colin thought if the da went along with a deal like that he deserved to be out on the street and sleeping in a park five minutes later for that matter the chief would deserve to be out there sleeping alongside him if he had the gall to propose something like that didnt he so it seemed to colin anyway he had no trouble picking up just when people not in the know at the station found out what had happened the buzz of conversation in the big open office suddenly picked up volume and changed tone yes that was what amazement sounded like sure as hell gabe sanchez also picked up on it right away he of course wasnt a person not in the know he caught colins eye and looked a question at him colin nodded back gabe grinned and gave him a thumbsup the next interesting question was how long mike pitcavage would take to start blowing gaskets in a way there should have been a pool on that colin knew he would have put down some money when he got into the super bowl pool every year no way he could stay out of this one but a pool would have turned people not in the know into people in the know too damn soon besides the chief wouldve wanted to get into it which would have been awkward pitcavage always joined the super bowl pool too by the clock on the wall the chief left his exalted private office and burst into the big central one exactly four minutes and forty seconds after rodney called for once pitcavages armani suit flapped on him like an ordinary cops threadbare threads from sears or mens wearhouse for once he didnt look like the ceo of a successful mediumsized corporation he looked like any poor bastard whod just found out his one and only son was arrested on serious drug charges he looked like hell in other words his blindly staring eyes caught and held colins ferguson he croaked i need to talk to you how much did he know how much did he suspect or was colin just the first spar he saw and grabbed after his yacht ripped its belly out on the rocks colin heaved himself to his feet whats up he wouldnt be able to hide knowing for very long nor did he intend to but he didnt want to do a sack dance over pitcavages fallen frame either the chief gestured follow me colin did out of the big office up the hall and outside one glimpse of mike pitcavages ravaged face was plenty to scare away a couple of curious smokers theyve arrested darren pitcavage said he had the dazed look of a man whod just staggered free of a bad car crash and didnt quite realize yet he had only a few cuts and bruises himself arrested drug possession drug dealing felony oh my god im sorry mike colin said that had the advantage of being nothing but the truth truth or not he might as well have saved his breath locked in some personal hell the chief went on as if he hadnt spoken a felony rap hard time theyll take dna samples jesus wept he isnt running on all cylindersnowhere near colin thought with rough sympathy hard time was well hard time it wasnt designed to be fun for anybody it might end up even harder for a police chiefs kid because theyd have to segregate him from most of the rest of the prisoners to keep him safe but a swab on the inside of his cheek was the least the absolute very least of darren pitcavages worries mike pitcavage seized colins arm and squeezed hard he might be stuck behind a desk but he was still one hell of a strong man ive got to talk to the arresting officer talk to the da get it down to something possible something reasonable pitcavage said squeezing squeezing if he kept that up pretty soon colin wouldnt have any circulation in his left hand drug dealing a felony no way ill fix it up no he didnt have all his oars in the pond mike colin said as gently as he could i dont think that will do you any good or darren either think it through youre liable to make things worse not better what if the reporters get hold of it cant you see the headlines man chief scores cushy plea deal for his son film at eleven he did his best to imitate a pompous tv talking head hes my kid colin ive got to try dna samples my god this will kill caroline pitcavage might even have been right about that whether he was or he wasnt though had nothing to do with the price of lemonade you wont help him mike colin said doing his best to get through to the other man youll make things worse the da wont listen to you he cant and if you piss him off hell probably find some new counts to throw at darren they cant charge him with a felony they cant pitcavage wouldnt listen in colins experience saying what they could or couldnt do was usually a bad plan telling them to their faces that they couldnt do this that or the other thing was even worse as soon as you told them theyd go ahead and do it anyhow just to show you a thing or three he tried his best to spell that out for the chief youre against me too i might have known pitcavage yelled loud enough to make the smokers spin toward him to see what was going on chief pitcavage stormed back into the station shoulders hunched head pushed forward hands thrust into trouser pockets colin stared after him hed known it would be bad he hadnt imagined it would be as bad as this whats eating him one of the smokers asked the other or colin or possibly god hed been out here polluting his lungs when the news broke one more reason not to smoke colin thought and didnt enlighten the guy hed find out soon enough the whole department would know before the sun went down vanessa surveyed her new apartment with something less than delight it was a standard socal pattern for a small onebedroom front room going back to dinette with cramped kitchen to one side of the eating area bedroom through a door in the frontroom wall opposite the couch bathroom behind the bedroom and next to the kitchen so the builder could save money by running the pipes for both off the same main line the rug was one small step up from outdoor carpeting the linoleum in the kitchen and the bathroom had seen better decades the furniture was old and ratty coffee table end table dinette table and nightstand and dresser in the bedroom all had identical tops of very fake wood she didnt want to think about how many people had fucked on the mattress before she moved in her own furniture was back in denver scavengers wouldnt have got there yet one of these years by then ash and rain probably would have made the roof cave in gone well the whole midwest was gone her old room in her fathers place had been more comfortable than this well the physical arrangements had but everybody there took everything she said the wrong way and there was her new halfsister screeching at odd hours that drove vanessa straight up the wall did it ever you couldnt ignore a crying baby no matter how much you wanted to evolution had designed those noises to stab your head like an ice pick you had to do something about them so the little monster would shut up vanessa knew what she wanted to do but punting an infant got you talked about in this effete age moving out seemed the better choice or it would have if she hadnt been all but run out by kelly she was colin fergusons daughter goddammit just because this chunky stranger was hauling her old mans ashes did that give the bitch the right to put on airs and boss her around kelly sure seemed to think so so did vanessas dad marshall marshall shut himself in the room with the stupid police tape on the door and clattered away on that horrible antique of a typewriter it was almost as annoying as deborah and he turned out silly saccharine stories full of erratic grammar and punctuation shed told him so when he asked her to read one she hadnt seen any more after that of course his prose looked like edward gibbons when you compared it to the subliterate garbage nick gorczany cranked out vanessa had forgotten how very delightful life at the widget works was before she headed for colorado maybe gorczany had forgotten too when she set a memo on his desk heavily edited in red hed looked from it to her and back so good to have you on the job again vanessa hed murmured so good to be back shed answered and walked out of his office with her head held high if he was going to get snide shed get snide right back yes she needed work but she needed her selfrespect even more the one thing wrong with selfrespect was it wouldnt buy groceries or pay the rent the job would more or less nick gorczany hadnt got himself that big old house in palos verdes estates by overpaying his employees if you didnt like what he gave you you could always go out and find yourself betterpaying work ha vanessa said chopping cabbage in the crowded kitchen of the small onebedroom in san atanasio about as far from the boss palos verdes estates estate as you could get and still stay in the south bay ha ha ha ha ha it didnt get any funnier even if she made more laughy noises laughy she nodded to herself it bore the same relation to laugh as truthy did to truth it wouldnt go into the oed any time soon but it filled a need it did for her anyhow she counted herself lucky nick gorczany had remembered she knew what she was doing when it came to translating bureaucratic horseshit into english her father and kelly might have given her the bums rush even if she hadnt snagged a job they have expelled you from what is yours by right bronislav said the first time he saw her apartment his big hands folded into fists if it were not your father i would make him pay for dispossessing you we serbs we know too much about being wrongly dispossessed dont do anything like that dont you hear me vanessa exclaimed bronislav was ready to turn a family squabble into an international incident vanessa had started learning what she could about exyugoslavia she didnt want him to call her american any more not the way he had in front of the croat eatery in san pedro from everything she could see serbs did that kind of thing a lot she was sure gavrilo princip would have agreed so would archduke franz ferdinand these days the namesake of a band almost as quirky as the one her brother played in and rob was married up there in the glacial wilderness of maine he hadnt bothered to let vanessa know not firsthand but hed sent cards to dad and mom whod both told her vanessa had trouble imagining a woman rash enough to want to tie the knot with her big brother but there you were here she was all right dont she said one more time she didnt want bronislav turning dads car into an ied or anything like that she wasnt sure he knew how to do such things but he was liable to he was liable to want to show off for her too that was how he would think of it anyhow all right he said now did he sound sulky like a kid deprived of his favorite toy damn straight he did so she found something else for him to do and he did with the same kind of enthusiasm hed probably shown for guerrilla warfare while yugoslavia was falling apart but bedroom explosions had aftermaths much more enjoyable than those involving plastique some of the things he did where did you learn that she asked her heart still thumping i am a serb it is in my blood bronislav replied with dignity and maybe that was true and maybe hed picked it up from a jowly hooker in barstow or phoenix or las cruces or one of the other towns on the route that fed los angeles how could you know for sure simple you couldnt but vanessa chose to believe him choosing to believe was part of what love was all about so was forgetting you even had a choice vanessa tried her best to do that too when the phone rings at am its never good news if youve won the nobel prize or in the lottery theyre always considerate enough to let you sleep in before they tell you when the phone goes off in the wee smalls like a grenade on your nightstand theyre calling to let you know something is wrecked or somebodys hurt or somebodys deadif youre really lucky all of the above colin knew it was because the glowing hands on the windup clock by the phone told him so when power started erratically going in and out the san atanasio pd issued one to every cop on the force the bean counters hadnt squawked about that you didnt want people especially people who worked the evening and night shifts not showing up because their electric clocks crapped out on them the power was out now without the glowing hands it would have been absolutely dark in the bedroom not just almost absolutely dark colin fumbled for the phone he snagged it in the middle of the third ringand in the middle of kellys groggy what the fuck ferguson he said sounding at least something like his ordinary self lieutenant this is neil schneider at the station all right it was a police emergency not a family disaster that was better or maybe it wasthe sergeant didnt sound even remotely ordinary he might have been trying to get back up on his feet after taking a sucker punch in a bar fight and what he said next explained why he sounded that way chief pitcavage is dead lieutenant oh sweet jesus colin blurted ice and fire chased each other along his nerves he wasnt sleepy any more he both was and wasnt astonished what happened he managed after a moment he ate his gun was what he expected mike pitcavage had definitely freaked at darrens arrest colin had known that would be bad hed had no idea it would be as bad as it was caroline just found himtheyve got separate bedrooms you know sergeant schneider said like an idiot colin found himself nodding there in the dark as if schneideror anyone elsecould see him do it he did know the chief and his wife slept apart mike was liable to get called out at odd hours and he didnt want to bother caroline any more than he had to the cop at the station went on she went in there with a flashlight dunno why maybe she thought she heard a noise and wanted to get him whatever she found him on the bed with a bottle of pills next to him and a plastic bag over his head and fastened tight around his neck hed been gone for a whilehe was getting cold jesus colin said again so mike hadnt shot himself maybe he hadnt wanted to leave a mess behind for caroline to have to clean up well when you killed yourself you left a mess behind whether you wanted to or not colin found the next obvious question was there a note if there was i dont know anything about it i dont think caroline said anything about one but i cant tell you for sure i didnt catch the call sergeant schneider replied okay colin said it wasntnowhere closebut he was starting to see what the picture looked like uh lieutenant is there any way you could come in for a while schneider asked hesitantly i mean his voice trailed away be there fast as i can the plea didnt surprise colin much as he wished it did with captain miyoshi on the shelf after stomachcancer surgery he was the most senior man available and people would know hed orchestrated darren pitcavages arrest without a note from mike they wouldnt be able to prove that was why hed done himself in but it sure looked like the way to bet thank you lieutenant neil schneider said thanks very much yeah colin hung up he pulled the nightstand drawer open and groped for the flashlight that lived in there he imagined caroline doing the same thing a couple of miles away no one could see his grimace but he felt it what happened kelly asked just as his fingers closed around it somebody committed suicide who why mike pitcavage dont know why yet but its gonna be a hell of a mess colin had already flicked on the light and was squinting against the beam when he realized hed cussed in front of his wife well too goddamn bad this was already a mess it called for cussing or praying one it probably called for both but colin had not even a nodding acquaintance with prayer my god kelly said she jumped to the same conclusion people at the cop shop had to be reaching is it because you busted his worthless kid dont know colin repeated as stolidly as he could if it is he didnt take that any further if the chief had killed himself because of darrens arrest colin was anything but sure he could go on at the san atanasio police department how many people there would blame him for mikes suicide enough to make him persona bigtime non grata he had the bad feeling the answer to that one couldnt be anything but yes he was a long way from sure he didnt blame himself when you got right down to it that would be awful colin kelly exclaimed so she could see it too well it wasnt anything complicated worse luck by the flashlights white glare he put on jeans a sweatshirt and his beatup old denim jacket the middle of the night wasnt the time to worry about suit and tie he looked a lot like the way he had when he first met kelly at the late ever so lamented yellowstone ill be back when i can he told her brushing his lips across hers try and grab some more zs any other time id tell you you were out of your mind she said the way deborah runs me ragged i may have a chance of doing it he hurried downstairs he started to roll his bike out of the foyer and onto the porch but shook his head went outside on foot and got into the taurus instead sometimes speed mattered to his relief the car started the streets were eerily empty he drove past two people showing bike lights and one moron who wasnt crunching the fool would have been just what he needed now but he swerved and missed having the guy appear out of nowhere in his headlights startled him so much he didnt even honk when he pulled into the lot he had no trouble finding a space most of them went begging most of the timewho drove to work these days he hurried inside the lights were on the station had its own generator and for the moment the generator had fuel here he is somebody said as he came through the doors that wasnt relief it sounded more like a headsup to alert people who hadnt seen him yet the looks the cops and clerical staff gave him had that same feeling neil schneider came up to him sorry to roust you lieutenant but the droopy graying blond mustache the sergeant wore gave him a mournful aspect even when he was happy when he had something to be unhappy about as now im here all right colin said has anybody told darren yet by the way the rest of the cops looked at one another he knew nobody had we thought you ought to be here schneider said we thought you ought to do it he meant colin sighed okay get him out of his cell bring him to interrogation room two ill handle it in there if he was top dog for the moment they could damn well follow his lead he didnt have to wait long in the interrogation roomthe jail was right next to the station two policemen led in darren pitcavage he wore a bright blue jumpsuit with san atanasio city jail stenciled on the chest and back in white his hands were cuffed behind him whats going on he demanded when he saw colin he was bigger than his father and looked a lot like him but with little of the older mans polished hardness scowling he went on my popll eat you without salt when he hears you hauled me outa my cell in the middle of the night for the third degree we didnt bring you out for anything of the kind colin said wearily he wished he were home in bed or anywhere else at all but here and your father your father wont do anything like that either im afraid huh the fuck he wont man darren spoke with the certainty of someone whod rarely heard no in his life you guys try and screw me over you think dadll let you get away with that shit mike pitcavage alive wouldnt have let them do anything to his son not if he could help it colin wondered if he wasnt alive for no better reason than the humiliation he felt at not being able to help it he took a deep miserable breath darren your father wont do anything to stop us your father cant do anything to stop us what are you talkin about darren said of course he can hes yknow the chief no he cant no he isnt colin said your father is dead darren he killed himself earlier tonight or thats what it looks like thats what we took you out of jail to tell you im sorry if it means anything to you darren pitcavage gaped at him no no fuckin way he shook his head dadd never do anything like that youre bullshitting me trying to soften me up or something i wish to god i were colin replied which was the exact and literal truth if you dont believe me ask some of the other people here its not like you dont know most of em he hadnt known all of them or he wouldnt be wearing that jumpsuit nowand his father probably wouldnt be dead colin made himself go on i know you know neil schneider ask neil hes the one who phoned me with the news i dont need to ask anybody i know you assholes are all in it together but darren didnt sound so sure any more he was starting to get that poleaxed look the look anybody gets on hearing a loved one has unexpectedly died he blinked a couple of timesblinked back tears colin guessed from the way his eyes brightened under the fluorescents when he spoke again the bluster had drained from his voice whatwhat happened man briefly and baldly colin told him finishing thats just the way i got it from sergeant schneider now you know as much as i do i am sorry i wish like anything i didnt have to give you news like this dad oh my god dad darren believed him now all right tears ran down his face whats mom gonna do now what am i gonna do now colin had no idea what caroline pitcavage would do darren pitcavage would probably do seven to ten with time off for good behavior and prison overcrowding that he didnt say darren would have to find out for himself xxii when bryce miller waited at the campus bus stop for the ride back into the town of wayne it was twentyone below zero it was the late afternoon to be fair the days high hadnt been anywhere near so frigid it had only been eleven below then not much snow was falling the air couldnt hold much moisture when it got this cold but every flake that touched his cheeks and nosethe only skin he showedburned as if it were dipped in battery acid hope the bus comes said a woman standing there with him cant wait around real long in this gotta go inside and warm up it wouldnt be hot inside either it would be above freezing though no matter how many layers you had on youd turn into an icicle pretty damn quick in this bryce had known it would be cold here when he left socal he hadnt dreamt it could get this cold he was thinking hard about retreating to a building when the bus grumbled up extra blankets on the seats the driver said she was using one bryce gratefully swaddled himself as the bus pulled away from the curb it helpeda little nothing could help much not in this hellfire probably included he didnt want to unwrap and get out when the bus got to his stop in downtown wayne such as downtown wayne was only a couple of blocks to his apartment he counted himself lucky not to be devoured by a polar bear before he made it it was above freezing in the apartment not a lot but it was susan wore almost as many clothes as he had on brr he said thats just brutal out there she hugged him and kissed him when they both had on so many layers the hug seemed hardly more than virtual the kiss was fine though then susan said colin ferguson still works for the san atanasio police department doesnt he sure bryce said how come it wasnt as if susan brought up vanessas dad very oftenor at all if she could help it because the chief of the san atanasio pd just killed himself it was on cnn michael pit pitsomething something weird pitcavage bryce said and susan nodded he went on thats awful did they say why colin didnt like him a whole bunch but you wouldnt wish that on anybody they said his sons in jail on drugdealing charges but they dont know if thats what made him do it or not it sounds like they dont know he didnt leave a note they said holy crap bryce said and then do you mind if i call colin after this of course not its not like youre calling to dish about vanessa susan said bryce chuckled uneasily she knew he wasnt a hundred percent over his ex she knew he wouldnt be any time soon either too as long as she also knew he had zero intention of doing anything about it assuming vanessa wasnt over him which she totally was that was pretty much okay with her he got out his cell and pulled up colins number on the second ring the familiar voice said hey bryce in his ear after a beat colin went on so you heard even back there huh fraid so bryce answered im sorry me too everybodys saying that a lot today listen let me call you back in five minutes okay i want to walk out into the parking lot sure bye bryce said colin wanted to talk without fifty people listening in on his end but he didnt want to say so while they were listening in whats going on susan asked when he took the phone away from his ear he explained hed just finished when the opening chords of came along too late came from the phone hey how many hellenistic ring tones could you find im here he said raising it again yeah and im here which is more than mike pitcavage can tell you right now colin replied i always knew he cut his rotten kid too much slack if mike hadnt darren never wouldve turned into a dealer and he damn well did the evidence weve got not even the dumbest jury in the worldll acquit him and thats saying something but jesus h christ on a pogo stick bryce i never dreamt mike would go and do anything like that i believe you bryce said colin sounded plaintive almost pleading those were notes his voice almost never struck the last time bryce could remember hearing them was when louise left him colin had never dreamt she would go and do anything like that either of course bryce wasnt sure how reliable his own memories of that time were vanessa had just traded him in on a newno actually on an oldermodel so he also hadnt been at his own dynamic best i know you do it means a lot to me colin hesitated then went on means a lot to me right now that anybody believes me some of the people here its like they think i drove mike to it on purpose when i set it up so we went after darren and dropped on him oh lord bryce hadnt thought of that he realized he should have talk about blaming the messenger yeah well thats how it looks to me too colin sighed but it sure doesnt look that way to everybody funeralll be in three four daysafter the coroners office finishes the autopsy and releases the body all the crap you have to go through to make sure what looks like a suicide isnt a homicide this one looks as cutanddried as they ever do but you still have to connect the dots sure bryce said the hellenistic kingdoms had had their bureaucratic rituals too colin sighed again not too long before you called my landline rang and it was caroline pitcavage she uninvited medisinvited me whatever the hellfrom the funeral said she was sorry and everything but seeing me there would only remind her of what id done to their family ouch bryce wished he could have found something more consoling than that but it was the best he could do ouch is right this time bryce judged colins pause was for a nod ive known caroline pitcavage gotta be twenty years now yeah mike beat me out for chief doesnt mean i want to see him dead doesnt mean id try to make him dead either shes known me twenty years too if she doesnt get that shes never known me at all plaintive was the word sure as the devil she cant be thinking straight right this minute coming up with that made bryce feel a little better he hoped it helped colin some too whether it did or not it was bound to be the truth i know she cant i understand it in my head i understand it colin said heavily in my gut she might as wellve kicked me in the gut when she said that and shes not the only one who feels that way either i dont know what i can do about it i dont know if i can do anything this side of quitting the force dont bryce exclaimed if you do they win i know but if i dont theyre liable to win anyway too damn many of em happy day huh listen good to talk to you and everything but ive got to go back in there and make like im useful colin said take care bryce started to answer but found himself talking to a dead line a skeleton crew of uniformed cops patrolled the streets of san atanasio some rode blackandwhites more pedaled bicycles there was talk of buying horses the glut of rain in the la basin had produced a glut of grass feeding them would be cheap it would certainly be cheaper than buying gas for the police cars but then what wouldnt and another skeleton crew of cops and clerical personnel kept the station open the rest of the san atanasio pd along with the city council and the mayor had gone to pay mike pitcavage their final respects colin ferguson sat at his desk he wished he were at the funeral even if caroline and most of the other cops on the force screamed abuse at him there that at least would be out in the open he could have stood there and taken it or he could have screamed back at them what he really wanted to do was scream at darren pitcavage whod got out of his cell to attend the services instead he had to stay here by himself and be miserable well almost by himself his secretary was one of the handful of clerical people whod stayed behind to catch phone calls and do whatever else needed doing josefina linares practically radiated indignation its not fair lieutenant the way they treat you she said its not even close to fair thanks josie i appreciate that colin meant every word of it but its the way things are is it your fault chief mike had a kid whos a dope pusher i dont think so josie said darren shoulda got in trouble a long time ago he mightve known not to be such a jerk then but chief mike kept going to bat for him so he decided he could get away with anything im here to tell you though the world doesnt work that way i dont think it does either youre right colin said with some hispanics he might have made that last tienes razon he spoke spanishnot well and with a horrible anglo accent but he did it would only have annoyed josie though she was american american as she would tell you at any excuse or none she had less sympathy for illegal immigrants than colin did and was more likely to call them wetbacks but when chief mike had to see what kind of little shit he raised when he couldnt stick his head in the sand any more he got too ashamed to live thats what happened its not your fault josie sounded positive that was how it looked to colin too that was how he hoped it was but he was less sure than josie seemed mike pitcavage hadnt left behind any reason for killing himself hed just gone ahead and done it damn him that left plenty of room for people to blame colin and people starting with pitcavages widow were blaming him josie didnt notice he hadnt answered it will blow over lieutenant you wait and see have faith thats all if his having faith was a prerequisite it would never blow over after working with colin so long josie had to know as much she said it anyway she had faith maybe that would do when she saw colin didnt feel like talking she shrugged and walked away he might sit there moping her attitude declared but she had work to do it was getting toward noon when rodney ellis came over to colins desk want to go to heinrichs for lunch the black detective asked caroline had also called to invite him to stay away from the funeral he was getting the same kind of almost silent treatment colin was too if anything he was getting it worse hed run the darren pitcavage bust and he was black which sure didnt make his life any easier hey why not im accomplishing so much here colin grabbed his slicker it had been raining when he pedaled in this morning the minister would probably say the heavens were weeping for mike pitcavage ministers said that kind of stuff just because they said it didnt make it so it was still rainingdrizzling anyhow luckily the hofbrau and sushi bar was close on the way rodney asked so how do you like being a nigger man say what colin wondered if hed heard that right how do you like being a nigger rodney repeated he laughed harshly yeah i knowif you called me that id clock you but its sure as hell how theyre treating you since mike decided to punch out for good they leave you out of everything they do their best to pretend you arent around even when you are thats what being a nigger in a white mans world is all about or part of what its about anyway welcome to the club dude he held out a hand colin shook it thanks thanks a bunch if it wasnt for the honor of the thing id rather walk if you had to be a restaurant these days a japanesegerman restaurant was the right kind you could still get raw fish or squid and octopus if you couldnt and german cuisine ran to the kinds of things people raised in a cold country potatoes turnips pork if you happened to have a pig it might not be exciting food but it was there they took a long lunch when they got back the station had filled up the cops and clerks and secretaries had returned from the memorial park how was it colin asked gabe sanchezsomehow caroline had left him off her wedontwanthiskindhere list not so good gabe hesitated then went on better you hear it from me than from somebody else i guess the preacher didnt quite come out and say you put the rubber band around mikes neck to hold the bag in place not quitebut he might as well have christ just what i need colin said let me guessa bunch of people bought it starting with caroline and darren right the first time gabe nodded unhappily im sorry man im sorry as hell no good deed goes unpunished is what they say yeah thats what they say all right colin agreed the conventional wisdom wasnt worth a pitcher of warm piss most of the time this once the multiheaded they monster had hit the nail right on the thumb marshall ferguson had told his father what he knew because he had one man was in jail and another man was dead when you were sort of on the edge of making your living as a writer you thought you knew how powerful words could be they could make people think they could make people feel and there you were at the strings as if you had a violin or a guitar words could make people die hed never imagined that if he hadnt talked to his dad mike pitcavage would still be wearing fancy suits and getting expensive haircuts it wasnt as if marshall had had any great liking for the chief or his son getting darren busted didnt break his heart he wouldnt have been bummed if mike had resigned in disgrace he might even have been proud though he never would have shown it but when mike pitcavage killed himself marshall wasnt proud of that hed always pretty much skated through life the worst things that ever happened to him were grandparents passing away and his folks breaking up hed been little when his grandparents died one by one and they hadnt been young hed grieved yes but not enormously and while the breakup hurt like hell he knew more people with divorced parents than with fathers and mothers whod stayed together he didnt know anybody else whod driven someone to suicide vanessa might have wanted to to show what a femme fatale she was that was different though for one thing it was bullshit for another even if it werent dying for unrequited love was a long way from dying because your son was looking at a felony rap no way could he talk to his friends about any of this if they found out the chiefs suicide had rocked him they would also have to find out why he didnt want them knowing hed talked to his father he couldnt talk about it with dad either if anything dad was hurting worse than he was a lot of the cops seemed to have decided it was his fault mike pitcavage no longer occupied the big office with the window this really sucks you know marshall said to kelly he could talk to her after a fashion but she was bound to be hearing it from his father too getting it in stereo was the last thing she needed especially when she was taking care of deborah too it totally sucks she agreed id like to go to the cop shop and bash their stupid heads together you know yeah he nodded like we expected pitcavage to do that or wanted him to no way when he said we he meant i for a wonder she got that you did the right thing marshall you deborah chose that moment to wake up with a yowl one moment please kelly said like an oldtime telephone operator she came back with the baby and started nursing her for modestys sake she covered her breast with a blanket it didnt bother her but shed discovered it did bother marshall for a bigger wonder she remembered what shed been saying when she got interrupted and picked up where shed left off you did the right thing you cant help it if mike pitcavage did a back flip into an empty pool on account of it thats not your fault marshall desperately wanted to believe it wasnt but he couldnt help asking whose fault is it then his or darrens for dealing drugs to begin with or nobodys sometimes stuff just happens the supervolcano wasnt anyones fault it just happened people arent like that though i dont think they are anyhow marshall believed in free will but if he was predestined to believe in it how much good would that do him well i dont either kelly admitted would turning it into a story make it any clearer in your own mind or i guess i mean would that make it any better for you i know youve got some of your story ideas by taking off from things you went through she paid enough attention to him to notice something like that the only other person who did was his father and dad paid such close attention that half the time marshall wished he wouldnt right now he felt like that about the whole thing with the pitcavages which didnt answer her question slowly marshall said when i do that i like file the serial numbers off first know what i mean i dont see any way to do that with this one and it doesnt look like the kind of story thats got a happy ending for anybody no it doesnt does it kelly nodded stories dont have to though no they dont but the ones that dont are a lot harder to sell marshall wouldnt have thought of it in those terms if not for the lessons from his stillstruggling career hed sent out a couple of pieces hed been proud of to have them come back over and over with rejections that said something on the order of wed like to see more from you only not so gloomy next time kelly raised an eyebrow i hadnt looked at it like that you dont see many tragedies on tv either part of it i guess is that most peoples lives are pretty miserable a lot of the time they dont need stories to remind them about itor editors sure dont think they do marshall said thats always been so i bet but its got worse since the supervolcano blew everythings got worse since the supervolcano blew after two or three seconds kelly corrected herself almost everything im married to your father now and i wasnt before and weve got this little portable airraid siren here now too she grabbed one of deborahs pajamaed feet the baby hardly knew she had feet yet marshall remembered john henry discovering his tiny people could be pretty goddamn funny that was bound to be one of the things that kept their parents from booting them you know what i think she looks like you marshall said talking about his halfsister was one way not to dwell on the bigger problems of life the universe and everything babies look like babies is what babies look like but kelly went on you really think so i do marshall said dads face is kinda squarer than yours and a kid with his nose would already have a bigger one than shes got take a look at vanessas baby pictures if you dont believe me he takes after dad more than rob or me well kelly rob realized belatedly didnt want to look at vanessas baby photo she slid deborah out from under the light blanket and raised her to a shoulder i sort of thought the same thing but i wasnt sure i know my folks think she does but they arent exactly objective no huh marshall said they both laughed kelly quickly sobered though i hope this story has a happy ending its eating up your father too so much for babies so much for distraction yeah i know marshall said hed be even worse if it wasnt for you thanks thats one of the sweetest things anybody ever told me kelly said i just wish i could do more i wish anybody could do more deborah burped lustily then spat up babies could be distracting in all kinds of ways colin ferguson chained his bike to the rack outside the san atanasio police station some people made a point of greeting him as he walked to his desk more made a point of pretending he didnt exist it had been like that ever since caroline pitcavage found her husbands body he kept hoping things would loosen upa hope looking more forlorn by the day good morning lieutenant his secretary said loudly she left no doubt about whose side she was on hey josie colin answered at a much lower volume he wished there were no sides to be on his wish seemed no more likely to be granted than his hope on his desk was a report about a homeinvasion robbery from two nights before at an old tract house near sword beach and th street the bad guys hadnt shot anybody but theyd had guns jesus villarobles the homeowner was still at san atanasio memorial with a concussion from the pistolwhipping theyd given him he turned the page had they left fingerprints behind things would be easier if they had before he could find out his phone rang he picked it up colin ferguson san atanasio pd hello lieutenant this is lucy chen over in the lab could i see you for a few minutes please sure colin said thinking nice anybody wants to whats cooking id rather talk about it here than over the phone if thats all right okay be right over colin didnt scratch his head but he wanted to he felt eyeballs boring into his back as he got up and walked out of the big communal office he might have been doing nothing more dramatic than taking a leak those eyeballs skewered him anyway the lab was down the hall a couple of doors past the mens room the air inside it held a faint chemical odor it wasnt unpleasant but it was always there whats going on colin asked lucy whatever it was he felt sure it would be something he needed to know about and no one else did the dna tech didnt get excited without a good reason or sometimes even with oneyet another reason she reminded colin of his wife this is a dna analysis i ran last night lucy chen said handing him a printout tell me what you make of it colin wasnt a dna expert he wasnt a fingerprint expert either but he made a pretty fair amateur he made a pretty fair amateur at dna patterns too also because his line of work had turned him into one and the pattern on the printout looked familiar hed seen it or one much like it way too many times he whistled softly lucy if this isnt the south bay stranglers dna its mighty darn close it isnt she took another printout off the countertop and gave it to him this one is from the strangler he held one in each hand excitement tingled through him they were close a break at last a break after so many years a break if you had a relatives dna you at least knew who the perps relative was which put you a hell of a lot closer to grabbing him too he hefted the printout that didnt come from the strangler so who does this belong to she looked at it she looked at him darren pitcavage she answered youre kidding he said automatically one look at her face told him she wasnt he floundered but thats crazy its impossible if that ones from darren who he ran out of words but waved the other printout it may be crazy it is not impossible we did the autopsy on the chief just a few days ago so i had easy access to a dna sample from him lucy handed colin one more printout this is from darrens father he examined it he examined the stranglers pattern no he wasnt a dna expert but he was a pretty fair amateur he was plenty good enough to understand what he was seeing theyre the same he said dully mike pitcavages dna and the south bay stranglers dna are the same thats right lucy chens mouth twisted as her head bobbed up and down i didnt want to believe it either i still dont want to believe it but thats what the evidence shows unless the chief has an identical twin i dont know about he doesnt almost blindly colin reached for the countertop he needed something to steady himself who wouldnt with the underpinnings of his world knocked out from under him yes cops went bad that was why police departments needed internalaffairs units but bad like this jesus he choked out are you all right lucy sounded genuinely alarmed what did he look like how gray had he gone he wasnt just palehe was sure of that and he wasnt all right eithernowhere closeso he answered no before lucy could ease him down into a chair or start cpr or do whatever else she thought he needed he made haste to add but its nothing you can do anything about its nothing anybody can do anything about not any more no not any more the dna tech agreed almost in spite of itself colins mind started working again things that hadnt added up before suddenly made a lot more sense well now we know why he killed himself he ground out that also occurred to me lucy said no arrest no trial no jail cell no waiting for them to stick the needle in his arm if they ever get around to it he took the easy way out he sure did colin said grimly and now i understand why he always worked so hard to keep darren from catching a felony rap he wasnt just playing softhearted daddy you get arrested for a felony you have to give your dna sample and that would have pointed at him along with his worthless kid no wonder he went off the deep end when darren landed in trouble too deep for daddy to get him off he totally flipped outat me mostly i heard something about that lucy said colin wasnt surprised a police department was like any other small town news got around fast the cops smoking in the parking lot had heard mike pitcavage melt down their stories wouldnt have shrunk in the telling once colins brain started grinding away it didnt want to stop remember how when we were at poor mrs mandelbaums house he knew his way around like hed been there before he uh darn well had i do remember lucy chen exclaimed i didnt think much of it then but i do i just thought hed been in a hundred places like it so hed kind of know where all the rooms were uhhuh exactly what i figured too colin said he was a cop for a long time of course hed seen places like that before right he sure had hadnt he though lucy clicked her tongue between her teeth where where do we go from here colin didnt answer directly not right away who else knows besides you and me as soon as i was sure i told dr ishikawa and showed him the results she said he told me to call you i owe the coroner one colin thought yes ishikawa would have told lucy to call him because hed been chasing the south bay strangler so long but colin judged that wasnt the only reason ishikawa would also know what was going on in the department nobody could blame colin for the chiefs sudden shuffling off this mortal coil now he made himself come back to the business immediately at hand okay good even he said but this will have to get out not just to usto all the other departments whove been after the strangler he let out a long regretful sigh itll have to get out to the tv and the papers too the suicide already has san atanasios gonna be in the news for a while so will i and so will you im afraid get used to it lucy winced can i go on vacation for about the next three years you wish colin said by her expression lucy did you didnt go into her racket because you wanted your mug on tv you didnt go into geology for the media exposure either kellyd survived it back when the supervolcano was warming up for the big show colin was sure lucy also would he went on for now though give me enough time to get back to my desk then call neil schneider and ask him to come in im not gonna say boo let somebody else get the word out okay she sent him a shrewd look hes one of the people who arent real happy with you right now isnt he yup colin didnt waste time pretending he didnt know what she was talking about i dont even know whether hed believe it hearing it from me he will from you though hed better all right lieutenant ill do that then lucy spread her hands this is gonna be pretty horrible isnt it it wont be anywhere near that good he answered she laughed as if he were joking they both knew too well he wasnt as soon as he came back into the central office the dueling cones of overdone greetings and angry silence surrounded him again he sat down at his desk and tried to do some useful work on the homeinvasion robbery the clock on the wall insisted hed been in the lab less than twenty minutes it only felt like years sergeant schneiders phone rang he talked for a moment then got up and headed for the door colin had just used colin watched him out of the corner of his eye as far as he could tell he was the only one who did when he himself moved around everybodys gaze followed him maybe he could shed that too for now he waited when schneider came back in he looked like someone whod taken a left hook right on the button he headed straight for colins desk that made people stare at him all right talking with the enemy was he he was he sat down onsank down ontothe chair by the desk like a spooked horses his eyes showed white all around the iris my god he said yeah colin nodded he saw no point in gloating he didnt want to gloat he wanted to cry and he couldnt do that either he wondered if caroline pitcavage would be able to cry when she found out that would be for later more collateral damage he thought miserably lieutenant ive been kind of mad at you since since well you know since when schneider said im sorry im sorry as hell it wasnt your fault not in any bad way he held out a hesitant hand colin took it thanks neil dont worry about it i know how you felt lord i felt the same way myself half the time i did his voice hardened but i sure dont any more i hope not neither do i neither will anybody once i talk to a few people and they talk to some people too but i wanted to come to you first well thanks some of them wont want to believe you you know hey i didnt want to believe lucy either who would but theres the dna uhhuh theres the dna i still dont want to believe it it all fits together too well not to though colin said it does doesnt it with some effort schneider got to his feet as hed said he would he started talking to people some of them did believe him some stormed off to the lab to see if he was making it up some whod been angry at colin came over to his desk to apologizesome but not all well in a world full of human beings that was as much as you could hope for not quite half an hour after sergeant schneider started spreading the word colins phone rang grab that for me will you josie he calledhe was talking with two cops and a secretary sure thing she answered proudly shed been on the right side all along a moment later she said lieutenant its a reporter from channel two he wants to talk to you right away he says by her expression she was trying to tell him it wasnt her fault colin knew thatnot that it would help he sighed one more time thanks josie put him through yes it was beginning
