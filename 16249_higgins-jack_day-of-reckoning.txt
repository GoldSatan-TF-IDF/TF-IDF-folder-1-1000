jack higgins day of reckoning sean dillon it was the rat in a way which brought blake johnson not only awake but back to life sitting on the stone seat in the darkness up to his waist in water it was astonishing that hed drifted into sleep at all and then hed come awake aware of something on his neck and had sat up the light in the grilled entrance behind him gave enough illumination for him to see what it was that slid from his left shoulder it splashed into the water surfaced and turned to look at him nose pointing eyes unwinking it took blake back more than twentyfive years to when hed been a young special forces sergeant at the end of the vietnam war up to his neck in a tidal swamp in the mekong delta trying to avoid sudden death at the hands of the vietcong there had been rats there too especially because of the bodies no bodies here just the grille entrance with the faint light showing through the rough stone walls of the tunnel the strong dank sewer smell and the grille forty yards the other way the grille that meant there was nowhere to go as hed found when they had first put him into this place the rat floated watching him strangely friendly blake said softly now you behave yourself be off with you he stirred the water and the rat fled he leaned back intensely cold and tried to think straight he remembered coming to a kind of halflife in the range rover the effects of the drugs wearing off theyd come over a hill in heavy rain some sort of storm and then in the lightning hed seen cliffs below a cruel sea and above the cliffs a castle like something out of a fairy tale by the brothers grimm when blake had groaned and tried to sit up falcone the one sitting beside the driver had turned and smiled there you are back in the land of the living and blake trying hard to return to some kind of reality had said where am i and falcone had smiled the end of the world my friend theres nowhere else but the atlantic ocean all the way to america hellsmouth thats what they call this place hed started to laugh as blake lapsed back into semiconsciousness time really had no meaning his bandaged right shoulder hurt as he sat on the seat arms tightly folded to try and preserve some kind of body heat and yet his senses were alert and strangely sharp so that when there was a clang behind him and the grille opened he sat up hey there you are dottore still with us falcone said and fuck you too blake managed excellent signs of life i like that out you come falcone got a hand on the collar of blakes shirt and pulled blake went through the opening and landed on his hands and knees in the corridor russo was there a smile on his ugly face he dont look too good well he sure as hell stinks wash him down there was a hose fastened to a brass tap in the wall russo turned it on and directed the spray all over blakes body it was ice cold and he fought for breath russo finally switched off and draped a blanket round blakes shoulders the boss wants to see you so be good sure hell be good falcone said just like that nice little wife of his in brooklyn was good blake pulled the blanket around him and looked up you did that hey business is business ill kill you for that dont be stupid youre on borrowed time as it is lets move it the mans waiting and he pushed blake along the corridor they climbed two sets of stone steps and finally reached a black oak door bound in iron russo opened it and falcone pushed blake through into a baronial hall stoneflagged with a staircase to the left and a log fire burning on a stone hearth suits of armour and ancient banners hung from poles there was a slightly unreal touch to things like a bad film set what happened to dracula blake asked russo frowned dracula what is this never mind two men were lounging by the fire rossi and cameci hed seen their faces on the computer more solazzo family hoods falcone pushed blake forward hey im with you christopher lee was the best i loved those hammer movies russo opened another black oak door inside was a room with a high ceiling another log fire on a stone hearth candlelight and shadows and behind a large desk shrouded in darkness a shadowy figure bring mr johnson in aldo by the fire he must be cold falcone took blake to the fire and pulled a chair forward sit the man in the shadows said brandy i think a large one would seem to be in order blake sat there while russo went to a side table and poured brandy from a decanter and brought it to him it burned all the way down and blake coughed now give him a cigarette aldo like all of us mr johnson is trying to stop but life is short art long and experiment perilous theres latin for that but i forget how it goes oh didnt they teach you that at harvard law school blake took the cigarette and light from falcone asa matter of fact no but clever of you you obviously know who i am hell why carry on like this of course i know who you are jack fox pride of the solazzo family so why dont you turn up the light a moment passed and it did go up and fox sat there the dark hair the devils wedge of a face the mocking smile he took a cigarette from a silver case and lit it and i know you blake johnson you came out of vietnam with a chestful of medals joined the fbi and saved president jake cazalet from assassination when he was still a senator shot two bad guys and took a bullet now you run the basement downstairs at the white house as a kind of private hit force for the president but unfortunately blake he paused to take a puff i dont think cazalet can save you now blake snapped two fingers at falcone another brandy he turned to fox theres an old sicilian saying which you might appreciate since i know you have a sicilian mother when you have sinned grievously the devil is waiting fox laughed would your devil be you or sean dillon take your pick but god help you if its dillon blake told him fox leaned closer let me tell you something johnson i hope its dillon ive been waiting a long time to put a bullet in his brain and in yours blake said you killed my wife your exwife fox said but it wasnt personal she got too close thats all i wish you could have understood thatfox shook his head youve caused me a lot of grief now youll have to pay for it fox smiled i hope dillon is stupid enough to come then ill have you both or well have you fox said to falcone take him back he turned down the light and russo punched blake in the belly blake doubled over and they took him out between them feet dragging new york in the beginning it was a wet march evening in manhattan when the lincoln stopped at trump tower the snow long gone but replaced by heavy relentless rain jack fox sat in the rear russo at the wheel falcone beside him they pulled in at the kerb and falcone got out with an umbrella fox said youre okay for a couple of hours he took a hundred dollar bill from his pocket you two go and eat ill call you on my mobile when i need you sure falcone walked him to the entrance please convey my respects to don solazzo fox patted him on the shoulder hey aldo he knows he has your loyalty he turned and went in the maid who admitted him to the top floor apartment was very italian small and demure in black dress and stockings she didnt say a word but simply took him through to the enormous sitting room with its incredible view of manhattan where he found his uncle sitting by the fire reading truth magazine don marco solazzo was seventyfive years of age a heavyweight in a loosefitting linen suit his face very calm and his eyes expressionless a walking stick with an ivory handle lay on the floor beside him hey jack come in his nephew went forward and gave him a kiss on each cheek uncle you look good so do you the don offered him the magazine i read the piece you look nice jack very pretty savile row suits big smile they talk about the hero stuff decorated in the gulf war thats all good but then they have to mention the other stuff that in spite of a name like fox your mother was maria solazzo the niece of don marco solazzo god rest her and your father that isnt good fox waved his hand its innocuous stuff everybody knows im related to you but they think im legit you think so this journalist this katherine johnson you think innocuous stuff is all shes after dont delude yourself she knows who we are in spite of our wall street interests so were respectable property manufacturing finance but were still mafia thats what gives us our power that side is not for people such as her no shes after something and you youre a good boy youve done well but im not a fool i know beside the family business that you have this factory in brooklyn the one that processes cheap whisky for the clubs uncle please fox said the don waved his hand a young man wanting to make an extra buck i understand but sometimes youre greedy theres nothing i dont know your dealings with the ira in ireland for instance that underground dump they have for the weapons they wont hand over the weapons you supply them your trips to london to the colosseum thats our flagship casino uncle sure but while youre there you organize armed robberies with our london connection over a million pounds cash two months ago from a security van the don waved him back dont annoy me by denying it jack uncle fox tried to sound contrite just remember your true purpose the drug business is no longer growing in america you have to encourage its rise in russia and the eastern european countries thats where growth lies prostitution leave to our russian and chinese friends just take a percentage as you say uncle anything else is okay but jack no more doing things behind my back yes uncle and this reporter this johnson have you gone to bed with her the truth now fox hesitated no it hasnt been like that then like what why should she be interested in making you look good shes in it for more im telling you shes hiding something this piece its not so bad all right but whats next whats behind the front the don shook his head she flattered you jack and you fell for it you better find out what she really wants what would you advise uncle turn over her apartment see what you can find he reached for a pitcher have a martini and then well eat terry mount was very ordinarylooking small and wiry the kind of youngster who could have been a delivery boy for some deli he was in fact a highly accomplished burglar and boasted that there was no lock he couldnt open hed served time only once and that was as a juvenile his very ordinariness had saved his hide on many occasions a nice touch two nights before had netted him fifteen thousand dollars which hed just picked up from his fence so he was feeling good sitting in a bar relishing the whisky sour the barman was creating and then a heavy hand touched his shoulder terry turned and his stomach churned falcone smiled terry you look good russo leaned against the bar his usual dreadful self and terry took a deep breath aldo you want something not me but the solazzo family would like a favour you would never say no to the don would you terry of course not terry gabbled reached for the whisky sour and swallowed it in one gulp only in this case its jack fox who wants the favour which was enough to almost give terry a bowel movement anything i can do that goes without saying falcone patted his cheek and said to the barman who was looking wary give him another hes going to need it the barman said now look i dont want any trouble in here russo leaned over the bar his ugly face full of menace make him the fucking drink and shut up okay hurriedly the barman did as he was told his hands shaking jack fox was in the sitting room of his park avenue townhouse on the second floor enjoying a light lunch of champagne and smoked salmon sandwiches when falcone brought terry mount in why terry you look worried fox told him now why should that be he bit into another sandwich then falcone took a wad of money from his pocket aldo have you won the lottery or something no signore but i think terry has theres fifteen grand here fox nodded to the champagne bucket and falcone poured him another glass terry i think youve been a naughty boy again please mr fox im just trying to make a buck and so you shall fox smiled two grand terry terrys eyes rolled and what do i have to do for that what you do best fox pushed a piece of paper across that had been lying on the table katherine johnson ten barrow street just on the edge of the village youll toss her place this afternoon but that doesnt give me time to prepare for what fox said coldly its a small townhouse she wont be there you boast that you can break in anywhere terry licked his lips what do i do shes a magazine reporter so youll probably find an office a computer a vcr all that stuff bring whatever disks you find bring the videos on her business shelf terry said people keep videos all the time i mean do i bring all of them be sensible terry fox said patiently im not looking for dirty harry or she wore a yellow ribbon just use your brain such as it is the boys will take you theyll wait and bring you back anything youve got i want by five oclock im sure you wont disappoint me terrys feet hardly touched the ground as falcone pushed him outside he went to barrow street wearing a bomber jacket that said smith electronics on the back he didnt bother with the front door after three rings got no reply but went down to the basement there were double deadlocks but they both responded to his touch he found himself in a laundry room and moved upstairs to the entrance hall there was a parlour dining room and kitchen so he tried the stairs the only sound disturbing the quiet the grandfather dock ticking in the hall the first door he tried was the study he saw shelves crammed with books and videos a computer next to two video and disk machines and a multiple tape recorder he switched them all on and removed everything he found in them placing his haul in the carry bag that hung from his left shoulder he opened drawers and found more disks and cassettes which he also took the rest really was frustrating rows of movies on video rows of instructional tapes he was sweating now and swung at the shelves and scattered videotapes across the floor okay so hed done what fox wanted time to go there were some bottles on a side table and glasses he poured some bourbon savoured it and left by the same route locking the basement door before returning to falcone and russo when they arrived at the park avenue townhouse fox was waiting eagerly he took the disks and tapes terry mount offered and said to russo look after him he turned to falcone you stay it could be bad then its bad for both of us signore they had been friends since boyhood fox started checking the disks mostly work notes letters accounts and quickly discarded them then he started on the tapes mount had found in the tape recorder and on the second struck pure gold at first the sounds were of an innocuous conversation about family business and so on the womans voice was very pleasant and intimate and the mans falcone said jesus maria signore thats you there were restaurant sounds in the background a little music fox said she was recording us suddenly the tape changed now the woman was clearly making notes to herself there can be little doubt that jack fox in spite of the war hero and wall street image is nothing less than the new face of the solazzo family and the new mafia ill lull him to sleep with the first article in truth and then hit him hard with the rest there might even be a special on the truth channel in this ive just got to take it easy and flatter him his vanity should take care of the rest fox switched off the machine the bitch so it would appear signore what should we do fox got up went to the sideboard and poured a glass of scotch he turned i think you know old friend he went to the telephone and punched in a number katherine johnson please hello kate jack fox would you be free for dinner tonight i was thinking about that piece and what the hell theres some more you might be interested in you are terrific listen dont bother going home ill send a car you come on over to park avenue and pick me up weve just bought this new restaurant in brooklyn and id like to check it out will you help great ill send falcone to pick you up he put the phone down surprised at the genuine regret he felt in that evening of dreary rain darkness already descending she sat in the rear of the lincoln a small pretty woman of forty with dark hair and an intelligent face russo was at the wheel and falcone beside him they reached the park avenue house and falcone called fox on his mobile hey signore were here he turned hell be right down she smiled and took out a marlboro falcone gave her a light thank you prego signora he dosed the glass divide between them and a moment later fox arrived wearing a black overcoat he scrambled in and kissed her on the cheek kate you look good the lincoln took off you look pretty good yourself he smiled amiably well heres to a good night at that precise moment terry mount was swallowing another whisky sour in a downtown bar aware of the bulge that seventeen thousand dollars now made in his right hand breast pocket he went out into the street drew up his collar as rain dashed in his face started along the pavement and sensed someone move in behind him and then a needlepoint going through his clothes just turn right into the alley he did as he was told and d himself shoved against a wall a hand searched hey seventeen grand you were right who are you im a big black mother named henry and you wouldnt want to meet me in the showers on rikers island terry was terrified i just did what i was told which means you know too much regards from the solazzos the knife went up through the breast bone and found the heart and terry mount slid down the wall it was early evening and march dark on columbia street brooklyn as the lincoln turned right and pulled on to a pier where a few coastal ships were tied up russo switched off the engine suddenly alarmed katherine johnson said what is this where are we jack this is the end of the line signora you sure played me for a sucker she managed a smile come on jack come on nothing ive had your house searched found your little tape recordings of us not that i said anything but you sure did just take it easy and flatter me huh you shouldnt have done that to me for gods sake jack youve got to listen to me no im done listening and talking a limousine pulled up behind fox got out and said to falcone aldo you make this good at your order signore fox got in the rear limousine and was driven away katherine tried to open the door but russo was there his great hand raised falcone cried leave it i dont want bruising he found her neck and yanked her forward on her knees on the rear seat her skirt rose up go on get on with it he held her as she struggled russo took a box from his pocket opened it and produced a hypodermic youll like this girlie best heroin on the market he jabbed her left thigh then injected her again this time in the right buttock there you go she cried out and slumped forward russo patted her hey shes not bad looking maybe i could do myself a little good here he turned reaching for his zipper and falcone gave him a shove you stupid bastard thatll blow the whole thing come on give me a hand grumbling russo picked up her feet while falcone took her arms and they carried her to the edge of the pier easy now and she was in the water come on lets go get a drink they walked back to the lincoln and a minute later they drove away neither of them noticed katherine johnsons purse where it had fallen out of the car in the shadows beside a packing case the following morning at six oclock rain drove in across the east river rattling the windows of the old precinct househarryparker brought out of bed only an hour before drank coffee from a machine and made a face as a woman detective sergeant named helen abruzzi came in this is disgusting parker told her reminds me of why i switched to tea okay what have we got this kid is called charlene wilson she was working a strip bar not far from here and doing business on the side im afraid so what happened a man called paul moody took her home when we found her shed been raped orally halfstrangled her wrists tied parker frowned that sounds like those two murders in battery park thats what i thought captain and thats why i phoned you to come here charlene got away because he got drunk and fell asleep and she managed to loosen her hands parker nodded okay let me know when the lineups ready she went out and parker went to the window the rain driving against it and found a marlboro having long since stopped pretending to have quit he lit it and looked out at the river morosely a huge black man who had started life in harlem earned a law degree at columbia and then decided to join the police rather than a law firm hed never minded seventyhour weeks although his wife had and had divorced him for it for three years now hed been captain in charge of a special homicide unit based at one police plaza sometimes he got depressed dealing with one killing after another in a neverending series and when you were close to fifty you began to wonder if there was something better to do he wondered if blake had really meant what hed said that there might be room for him in that special intelligence unit of his in washington the door opened and helen abruzzi called show time captain the girl in the viewing room was in a bad way a blanket around her shoulders her face swollen one eye black bruise marks on her neck helen stood behind her a hand on her shoulder while parker read the file he finished nodded and she pressed a buzzer a light flared and five men appeared on the other side the girl cried out number three thats him she said and then she broke down compassion didnt come easy at six oclock in the morning on the east river but parker put an arm around her hey take a deep breath i know it isnt easy but ill make you a promise im going to take this fuck out he squeezed her shoulder and nodded to abruzzi take her away then bring that bastard in he stood at the window looking down at the water and after a while the door opened and helen abruzzi came in followed by paul moody cuffed between two police officers and who the hell are you moody demanded captain harry parker sergeant abruzzis got quite a list of charges against you moody beginning with aggravated sexual assault hey the bitch wanted it she was into sadomasochism all kinds of stuff i mean i was shocked man im sure you were and i was forgetting physical assault on a minor there was silence moody said whats this minor crap didnt sergeant abruzzi tell you the girl charlene wilson was fifteen two weeks ago moodys face paled now look i didnt know that well you do now helen abruzzi told him another thing parker said thereve been two killings in battery park within the last three months using the same technique you prefer moody girls tied up abused beaten and young you cant pin those on me i dont need to we have good dna samples retrieved from charlene wilson weve got the dna of the battery park killer id bet my pension well have a match fuck you nigger bastard moody lunged at him and the two officers restrained him parker said why paul you should conserve your energy youre going to need it to keep you going for the next forty years in prison he nodded to the officers get this piece of shit out of here he turned to the window as the door closed helen abruzzi said its a bad one sir theyre all bad sergeant he turned i need air ill take a walk if you can find me an umbrella ill come back to sign the papers later fine sir he smiled and suddenly looked charming youve been doing a good job here sergeant ive been noticing theres an inspectors job coming up if youd like a posting to police plaza you deserve it i cant promise mind you i know sir fine ill see you later but ring the front desk and get me that umbrella it was raining hard on the waterfront parker had borrowed a police raincoat with gaped shoulders and carried the umbrella abruzzi had organized the rain actually made him feel good cleared the head he lit another cigarette and then an old man was running toward him in a panic parker got his hand up what is it whats your problem i need the police youve found them whats the problem my names richardson im a night watchman at the old darmer warehouse there i was coming off shift and i went to the edge of the pier to toss my butt in the water and and theres a woman in the water okay show me said parker and pushed him forward katherine johnson was a couple of feet under dark green ter her arms floated to each side her legs were open eyes stared into eternity there was a look of surprise on her face and she was achingly beautiful in death harry parker took out his mobile and called the precinct this is captain parker ive got a jane doe in the water only three hundred yards from you lets get an ambulance and backup out here he stood there holding his mobile phone then handed it to richardson and took off his raincoat hang on to those he went down a flight of stone steps waist deep in water and reached for her it was stupid because that was the recovery teams job but he couldnt leave her there in a strange way it was personal she was covered for a moment by flotsam and he went chest deep and pulled her in and above his head above him he heard the sound of vehicles grinding to a halt as the recovery team arrived parker went home changed had breakfast at his corner coffee shop eggs bacon english breakfast tea and returned to his office but the dead womans face the open eyes wouldnt go away as he phoned abruzzi whats happening with the jane doe i found shes at the morgue theyve brought in the chief medical examiner i believe hes doing the postmortem himself later this morning ill be down tell him im coming when harry parker arrived at the office of the chief medical examiner dr george romano was eating a sandwich and drinking coffee harry my man whats new this jane doe from the river i took her out so youre feeling personal about it right something like that im about to finish the postmortem i was just taking a break what do you want to know did she fall or was she pushed something like that okay harry join me cause this one stinks romano drained his coffee and led the way out they went into the postmortem room where two technicnians waited suitably gowned romano held up his arms and vne of them helped him into a robe he went and scrubbed vt the sink there she is all yours harry katherine johnson lay on a slanting steel operating table her head on a wooden block she was naked the y cut of the preliminary vivid against her pale skin romano held up his hands and one of the technicians pulled on surgical gloves for him there was a cart loaded with instruments and a tv video recorder on a swivel romano said tuesday march resuming postmortem mrs katherine johnson barrow street greenwich village hey what is this parker demanded didnt you know romano looked surprised the guy found her richardson he was hanging around and discovered her purse she must have dropped it when she over the pier plenty of id okay fine lets get on with it why did you say this stinks shes a nice lady well nourished good condition about forty years of age so so she died of a massive heroin overdose enough to kill her twice over it doesnt fit someone like her in her condition plus someone on that stuff at a high level would have needle sores all over she only had two the recent ones one in the left thigh the other in the right buttock and what was she doing in the water accidentally overdosed and fell in maybe but i doubt it like i said she wasnt an addict and another thing her medical insurance card was in her purse and i checked it out she was a lefty so harry with the greatest will in the world i cant see a lefthanded person injecting herself in the side of the right buttock its possible but unlikely he reached for a de soutter vibratory saw so youre saying she was stiffed by someone harry like you ive spent years in the death business you get a smell for it yes id say someone wasted her which means ive got a murder case on my hands id say so now im about to take off the skullcap so if youre not too happy about that id leave excellent advice ill take it said harry parker and he turned and left he found his way to abruzzis office she was seated at r desk working away i hear you turned up id on the jane doe he said let me see itts an interesting one shes a reporter for truth magazine named katherine johnson i did a computer printout divorced no children her husband was a guy called blake johnson fbi parkers mouth went dry blake johnson thats right you know him weve worked together except he isnt fbi anymore he works for the president jesus is this a hot one captain id say as hot as they come you zip your mouth tightsergeant if you say so jesus he said again he looked at her you wouldnt happen to have a bottle of anything here would you sergeant she hesitated then took a halfbottle of irish whiskey from a drawer in her desk for medicinal purposes she said and sometimes we need it sergeant youre working for me now ill take care of things with your lieutenant the first thing i want you to do is call the white house and ask for a woman named alice quarmby got that thats johnsons assistant i need to talk to her he turned to the window stared out and took swig another from the bottle abruzzi called to him he turned and the phone alice harry parker is blake there hes with the president harry damn there was a pause is it important so he told her in the oval office president jake cazalet sat at his desk blake johnson on the other side as they reviewed the latest intelligence reports on the irish peace process the presidents favourite secret service man clancy smith a tall black gulf veteran stood by the door the phone rang and cazalet picked it up alice quarmby mr president hello alice you want blake no mr president i need you he straightened aware from the tone of her voice that something was very badly wrong tell me alice she did and a minute later he replaced the phone and turned to blake genuine pain on his face for this was a man he liked more than most a man who had helped save his beloved daughters life who had saved the president himself from assassination blake sitting there in shirtsleeves papers in front of him said whats the problem mr president what did alice say cazalet stood up and walked to the window watching the rain drifting across capitol hill he summoned up all his strength and turned blake youre a true friend and one of the finest men ive known and im going to hurt you now in the most terribleway at least thank god its me blake looked puzzled mr president and cazalet gave him the dreadful news when he was done he ordered whisky clancy a large one clancy was at the sideboard at once and back within seconds with a crystal glass halffilled with bourbon he handed it to blake who stared at it frowning then swallowed it whole he put the glass down on the desk im sorry mr president this is quite a shock although my wife and i were divorced weve always stayed close and now i may i phone alice back of course use the anteroom for privacy then well talk thank you clancy opened the door and blake went out clancy cazalet said i need a cigarette clancy found a pack shook one out and gave it to him mr president cazalet inhaled deeply these got me through vietnam clancy blake too i suspect what about you in the gulf long days of boredom broken by moments of sheer terror yes sir a cigarette came in handy now and then cazalet nodded old soldiers the three of us he sighed he doesnt deserve this clancy if theres anything we can do for him id appreciate it my privilege mr president twenty minutes later blake returned his face grey eyes burning is there anything i can do to help blake no mr president except with your permission i need to get to new york now cazalet turned to clancy smith make the call and get the gulfstream ready to take blake to new york immediately you got it mr president and clancy went out fast cazalet turned to blake my friend do you have any kind of idea what happened no mr president blake pulled on his jacketbut i intend to find out and with harry parker helping me thats just what ill do he held out his hand many thanks mr president for your understanding he turned and went out in parkers office at one police plaza blake listened to the whole story when the police captain was finished blake nodded id like to hear what romano said from his own mouth then id like to see where it happened be my guest parker picked up the telephone have my car at the front entrance in five minutes shortly thereafter still in the rain that bad march weather they stood on the edge of the pier with umbrellas and looked down into the water covered with scum and flotsam she was there by the steps parker told him the night watchman saw her i happened to be walking along and you pulled her in i couldnt leave her blake nodded lets go and see romano he turned and walked away at the morgue romano was in the chief medical examiners office drinking minestrone soup from a plastic cup and eating french bread parker made the introductions romano said im really sorry just tell me what you told harry romano did so she was murdered in my opinion and for what its worth yes but why parker demanded and what would a nice middleclass lady with an apartment in the village be doing in brooklyn under these circumstances they sat silent for a moment you never had any children did you blake no blake shrugged it wasnt possible she was sterile so she concentrated on her career and i concentrated on mine we just kind of drifted apart but though we got divorced we never lost touch we were always concerned friends he turned to romano id like to see the body no you wouldnt yes i damn well would at that moment blake looked every inch the vietnam veteran parker put a hand on romanos shoulder george id say we should indulge the man okay let me phone down she lay on one of the tables under the hard white light there were enormous stitched scars where romano had opened her up the same scar around the skull blake felt incredibly detached this creature had been the love of his life his wife his support in many bad times and now he said i was never all that religious but human beings are pretty remarkable einstein fleming shakespeare dickens is this what it ends up as wheres kate this isnt her i cant give you an answer romano told him the essence the life force it just goes thats all i can say blake nodded slowly ill tell you one thing she deserved better and someone should pay for this his smile was the most terrible thing parker had ever seen when he said and im going to see that they do back at parkers office there was a message for him to phone helen abruzzi whats new parker asked well we checked out katherine johnsons house and its been burgled damn parker said okay well be right there he turned to blake and explained blake said lets take a look helen abruzzi was already there ahead of them when they arrived theres no sign of forced entry but the study upstairs has been ransacked its hard to tell whats been taken she led the way opened the study door and entered thes cene of devastation was evident videotapes scattered all over the place parker said anything in the machinery not a thing no disks no tapes no copies nothing in the computer that smells for starters blake said somebody was after something harry thats obvious and probably found it the thing is what and why he turned to abruzzi have the crime scene people finished here she nodded then could you get your people to look at these tapes littering the floor sergeant you never know you might turn up something ill see to it sir blake started down the stairs and parker said now where truth magazine i want to see kates editor find out what she was working on you dont have to come youve got other cases on your hands harry i can handle this on my own like hell you will harry parker told him lets get going the editor of truth magazine rupert odowd was the kind of middleaged journalist whod seen it all been there and done that and he had little residual faith in human nature nevertheless sitting in his office in shirtsleeves he reacted with horror to the suggestion that katherine johnson had been murdered please tell me what can i do to help you can tell us what shed been involved in latelyjohnson said was she working on anything special anything dangerous odowd hesitated well theres a question of journalistic ethics here and theres the question of my wife being murdered by the administration of a massive heroin dose mr odowd so dont play around or ill make you wish youd never been born odowd put up a hand okay okay you dont have to come down hard he took a deep breath she was working on a big mafia expose there was silence parker said isnt that old stuff only because the mafia wants you to think that let me explain the ruling power in the mafia the commission right it called a halt to mob killings in new york in because of the bad publicity so so they started again last year five stiffed in palermo a month ago three in new york four in london but its all different all backroom stuff you cant connect to them theyve gone legit they dont figure in forbes magazine but theyre easily the biggest company structure in europe the drug market in america is saturated so theyve moved to eastern europe and russia but now they do it behind an elaborate facade so what are you saying blake asked that the days of men in gold chains have gone now they wear good suits and sit next to you in the four seasons or the piano bar at the dorchester in london they are into construction property development leisure tv you name it they do it there was a pause blake said so where did my wife fit in to all this as i indicated these days the new image is everything the most influential mafia group right now is the solazzo family don marco is the old devil who runs things but he has an extraordinary nephew named jack fox foxs mother was don marcos niece so the good jack is half and half though he sounds very anglosaxon he was a young marine in the gulf a decorated war hero harvard law school and now hes the respectable face of the solazzos and how does this affect katherine she managed to get into a relationship with fox she was intending to produce a devastating series not only for truth magazine but also for our tv side there was silence then odowd said she wanted to get behind that acceptable face of the mafia and expose it which meant showing the reality behind fox parker said and he couldnt have that blake nodded so now we know he stood up and said to odowd play this down trust me give us time and youll get the story kate wanted he held out his hand a bargain it sure as hell is on the way downstairs parkers mobile rang he answered and nodded well be there he turned to blake abruzzi shes sorted out the videotapes wondered if youd like a look why not blake said the study at barrow street was much more ordered now the videotapes arranged neatly on the shelves helen abruzzi said ive put the movies on the top two shelves the language courses and selfhelp tapes on the bottom two shelves she turned to blake there is one that refers to you sir thats what i thought youd want to know blake said what do you mean the label says blakes parents blake was silent for a moment my parents died when i was very young i never knew them and my wife knew that better than anyone id appreciate you turning that tape on sergeant he sat down parker stood behind him and the screen flickered this is just a failsafe blake my darling in case anything goes wrong as someone who was the pride of the fbi and whatever you get up to there at the white house i know youll find this one way or the other she smiled at him these are bad people that im trying to expose the solazzo family don marcos like brando resurrected for godfather iv cold calm and businesslike even while he seems like your favourite grandfather jesus harry parker said but don marco is oldschool jack fox is different the genuine allamerican hero and wall street golden boyyoud think he was some boston blue blood but instead hes a coldblooded psychopath the worst of them all get in his way and youre dead well im going to get him lull him to sleep with the first article then wham hell never know what hit him blake hammered a clenched fist on a coffee table and helen abruzzi stopped the tape what in the hell are you doing im giving you a chance to breathe deeply im also finding you a drink trust me sir parker put a hand on his shoulder shes right blake helen abruzzi returned with a glass vodka its all i could find it was in the freezer thats what she liked cold vodka blake drank it down okay lets get on with it the screen flickered again i was real lucky i found a guy called sammy goff who used to do accounting work for jack fox nice guy very gay and very ill aids which is why fox threw him out i was having lunch with fox in manhattan one day he left early and goff came up to me you look like a nice lady he said so watch it hes not good for you a telephone sounded in the background and she went to answer it and returned okay goff was dying and bitter i cultivated him and with three martinis in him he sounded off good and what he told me was special heres the lead fox is front man for the family smart very clever but hes always pushing for more hes played the market with family money and lostparticularly with the asian crisis how much the don knows about this is unknown to me hes getting by because hes responsible for the solazzo flagship casino in london the colosseum the cash flow from that is critical to him he cant milk the familys large interests the drug market in eastern europe and russia for example but he has personal cash flow that helps keep him afloat theres a warehouse in brooklyn called hadleys depository the one thing they store there is whisky cheap liquor the booze is watered down and then sold to the clubs at a huge profit margin parker said i cant believe the don doesnt know blake waved a hand and katherine continued another sideline in london is hes been involved with some heavy gangsters called the jago brothers armed robbery that kind of stuff sammy goff said always a source of instant cash foxs bad investments in the far east are draining him more serious hes been into arms dealing too specifically for the ira he helped somebody called brendan murphy a real hardliner who didnt like the peace process not only to buy arms but to build a concrete bunker in county louth in the irish republic theres everything there from mortars to the kind of machine gun that can shoot down an army helicopter oh and lots of semtex my god helen abruzzi said softly goff told me there was also some link with beirut via murphy arms for saddam that sort of thing he didnt have many details on that the other thing he told me was that fox doesnt own a london house he usually stays in a suite at the dorchester but he does have an indulgence an old castle and estate in cornwall in england very rural very remote believe it or not its called hellsmouth somewhere near lands end a telephone sounded in the background again there was some confusion she was offscreen then back quickly its a hell of a story thanks to sammy goff however although id like to expose it blake life is uncertain and the other day poor dying drunken sammy was the victim of a hitandrun driver now was that an accident i dont think so he just knew too much the screen seemed to jump and her voice scrambled for a moment things returned to normal she smiled brightly so there you are my darling blake id like to believe the good guys win but life can be such a bitch if youre watching this that probably means that the bad guys won this time the smile slipped for a moment then came back a little more tentative this time take care and remember in spite of everything ive always loved you helen abruzzi switched off blake sat there eyes dark id appreciate you running that back sergeant its evidence sir just get the man a copy parker told her blake got up and walked to the window after a moment he turned okay harry arrange a meeting with the bastard ill have to check with the district attorney try the pope if you like but i want to face jack fox maybe you should take time sir abruzzi told him blake took a document from an inside pocket and unfolded it youve never seen one of these sergeant harry has its a presidential warrant you belong to me not nypd and so does he now lets get moving it was the following morning when parker picked up the buick at the plaza hotel the woman in the rear of the police car was very personable around forty and smartly dressed a briefcase on the floor beside her blake sat in front and parker said assistant district attorney madge mcguire she shook hands as they drove away i understand youre fbi mr johnson used to be he turned to parker did you tell her how could i blake took out his presidential warrant and passed it across madge mcguire read it jesus christ she handed it back and blake put it in his pocket so what do you think were wasting our time dammit mr johnson we all know the reality but we cant prove it youll see fox will be all sweetness and light any way he can help he will but when we finish well be no better off than when we started his attorney carter whelan will be there by the way that one is a serpent fine by me okay im bound by that warrant but let me do my job mr johnson be my guest when they got there fox was sitting behind a desk wearing an excellent navy blue suit his hair swept back from his handsome face the man who sat beside him carter whelan was small balding and wore a black suit im madge mcguire assistant district attorney and this is captain harry parker pleased to meet you miss mcguire im sure you know my attorney carter whelan and you are aware im sure that im an attorney myself may i ask who this other gentleman is blake johnson also an attorney blake told him i believe you knew my wife whelan said hes no right to be here fox cut in ive no objection i was distressed to know of katherine johnsons untimely end you have my sympathy parker said evidence would suggest that mrs johnsons death was no accident could you assist us in that matter sir whelan said jack you dont need to answer any of this why not fox shrugged ive nothing to hide i knew katherine johnson gave her interviews and she did an article about me for truth magazine its in the latest edition quite flattering actually except for the references to the solazzo family just how well did you know her sir parker asked fox said i knew her well how well fox seemed to struggle with himself all right we had a brief affair it only lasted a few weeks and i didnt want to mention it because i didnt want to damage her reputation in any way for gods sake the lady is dead it was an impressive performance madge mcguire said did you ever know her to use heroin fox struggled with himself again got up went to the window turned face working yes once i caught her at her apartment i was shocked tried to remonstrate she said shed only just started and promised to stop but i guess she didnt whelan said she was obviously not very practised with it and must have accidentally given herself too much or had a particularly lethal batch still there are certain anomalies parker told him which have nothing to do with my client whelan turned to madge mcguire are we finished here yes madge said thatll do for now thank you for your cooperation she stood up and fox said hasnt mr johnson anything to say blake stood up face pale eyes very dark not really its all pretty clear and he turned and walked out in the car madge said theres no case people its not even worth trying to bring one he just gave the explanation for the lack of track marks shed just started shooting and didnt know what she was doing but if shed shot up before wouldnt there be some tracks if it was only a few times not necessarily whelan would laugh it out of court mr johnson theres evil here and we dont know the half of it but theres nothing we can do madge told him it gets harder the older i get parker shook his head ive been a cop long enough to know when something stinks and this surely does blake lit a cigarette and leaned back but what about justice what do you mean madge asked what happens if it isnt done and the law doesnt work is someone entitled to take the law into his own hands well i know one thing parker told him it wouldnt be the law they were taking i suppose not what will you do blake go back to washington see the president arrange a funeral the car pulled in at the plaza he shook hands with parker and turned to madge many thanks miss mcguire he got out and went up the steps to the hotel as the car moved away madge said are you thinking what i am harry if you mean god help jack fox yes at the office fox waited for a computer printout hed ordered on blake johnson it finally appeared and he was reading through it when there was a knock on the door and falcone entered just checking signore is there anything i can do fox passed him the printout falcone read it quite a record it sure as hell is war hero fbi took a bullet saving the president but theres a block there whats he been doing lately ill have to get my top people to work on it is he a threat of course he is he didnt believe me for a moment about his wife aldo ive stared at the face of the enemy in iraq and i know what i saw in blake johnsons eyes there was no rage in them only revenge hell be coming and we must be ready always signore falcone went out and fox went to the window as a flurry of sleet brushed across manhattan strange he wasnt afraid he was excited fox had an impeccable source when it came to computeraccessing an ageing lady named maud jackson who was a retired professor in communication sciences at mit seventy years old and a confirmed gambler a nice jewish widow who lived in crown heights she was always chronically short of money because she was an easy mark and liked the game anyway fox met her in a local bar by appointment she sat there sucking on a cigarette and drinking chablis while he told her about blake johnson the thing is theres a block on the guy like any roadblock jack its made to be gone around exactly and who better than you to do it flattery will get you everywhere but if this guy used to be fbi and theres a block this is serious stuff she took out another cigarette and he gave her a light revolted by the thinning dyed red hair the cunning old eyes but she was a genius okay maud ill pay you twenty thousand dollars twentyfive jack and happy to oblige he nodded done theres only one problem i want it like yesterday no problem she swallowed her chablis and stood up and nodded to falcone now if this big ape will take me home ill get on with it falcone smiled amiably my pleasure signora it took her no more than three hours of devious double play to make her breakthrough and there it was blake johnson exfbi now director of the basement for the president and what a treasure house that turned out to be the presidents personal hit squad and such an interesting crossreference to london it seemed that johnson was very cosy with the british prime ministers personal intelligence outfit led by one brigadier charles ferguson its muscle supplied by an exira enforcer named sean dillon it was all there past exploits addresses homes and phones she telephoned fox and asked to be put through jack its maud have you got something jack i dont know whats going on but what ive got is pure dynamite so dont screw with me just send falcone round with thirty thousand in cash our deal was for twentyfive maud jack this is better than the midnight movie believe me its worth the extra five all right ill have him there in an hour and jack no rough stuff dont be stupid youre too important an hour and a half later falcone returned with the printout what fox didnt know was that falcone had stopped on the way and had the printout copied fox read the printout johnsons background the london end of things ferguson dillon the computer photos and shook his head my god trouble signore no just rather startling information the old bitch did well read it falcone already had but pretended to again he nodded and handed the printout back face impassive interesting fox laughed you could say that this dillon he shook his head what a sweetheart still its always useful to know what youre up against of course good you can go pick me up at eight for dinner falcone left and was at don marcos apartment at trump tower half an hour later where the old man read the copy of the printout with interest and checked the photos youve done well aldo thank you don marco anything else you find out tell me at once he held out his hand and falcone kissed it as always brigadier charles fergusons office was on the third floor of the ministry of defence overlooking horse guards avenue in london he sat at his desk a large untidy man in a crumpled suit and guards tie working his way through a mass of papers the buzzer rang and he pressed a button is dillon here a womans voice said yes sir good come in the door opened the woman who entered was perhaps thirty wore a fawn trouser suit and hornrimmed glasses and had cropped red hair she was detective superintendent hannah bernstein of special branch and allocated to ferguson as his assistant many people had underestimated her because of her looks and theyd come to regret it shed killed four times in the line of duty the man behind her sean dillon was no more than five feet four or five with fair hair almost white he wore an old leather jacket dark cords and a white scarf his eyes held no colour but his mouth was lifted with a perpetual smile that said he didnt take life too seriously once an actor and later the most feared enforcer the ira had ever had he had been working for what had become known as the prime ministers private army for several years anyone heard anything ferguson asked we keep getting rumours about secret ira gun caches but no specifics sean not a peep dillon told him so whats next sir hannah bernstein asked the phone rang on fergusons desk he answered it and his face showed considerable surprise yes sir of course well would you like to talk with him directly hes right here just one moment he held the phone out dillon president cazalet would like a word dillon frowned in surprise and took the phone mr president this is a bad one my fine irish friend involving blake johnson just listen a few minutes later dillon relayed the news to ferguson and hannah bernstein he walked to the window looked out and turned the funerals the day after tomorrow im going brigadier ferguson raised a hand sean the three of us have all been to hell and back with blake johnson well all go we owe him that he turned to hannah order the plane katherine johnsons funeral at the crematorium two days later was singularly unimpressive taped and fakesounding religious music played and a minister who looked as if hed hired his costume from a tv wardrobe company threw out platitudes ferguson dillon and hannah arrived halfway through the ceremony just in time to see the coffin slide through the plastic curtains the only other people there were the funeral staff and a couple of people from truth blake distributed dollars turned and found his friends his face said it all hannah bernstein embraced him ferguson shook hands only dillon stood back very calm he inclined his head and walked out they stood on the step the rain driving in and dillon lit a cigarette ive heard what the president had to say now i want it from you youve saved my life on a number of occasions and ive saved yours there are no secrets between us blake no sean no secrets so lets collect the brigadier and hannah and go and sit in the limousine and we can all hear the worst blake told them everything including all that katherine had relayed to them on the videotape afterwards they all sat silent for a moment from my point of view the armsdealing with the ira the brendan murphy business thats the worst said ferguson shaking his head and the beirut connection working for saddam weve got to do something about that he turned to hannah what are your thoughts superintendent that fox has problems hes skimmed money from the commission hes fiddling from the london casino the colosseum beirut and ireland are desperate attempts to make cash and those hits with the jago brothers are even more desperate dillon said do you know them ferguson asked no but im sure harry salter does salter hannah said you know him sir a london gangster and smuggler owns a pub at wapping called the dark man ah i remember now ferguson said hes into warehouse developments by the thames also running booze and cigarettes from europe but no drugs and no prostitution dillon reminded her yes an oldfashioned gangster how very nice he only shoots his rivals when absolutely necessary dillon shrugged well they shouldnt have become gangsters then im sure hell help us with the jago brothers and with fox though he has a good team his nephew billy salter joe baxter sam hall dillon these people are real villains hannah said compared to jack fox theyre sweetness and light and then dillon smiled except that if you push them hard theyll be foxs worst nightmare there was a pause ferguson said yes well well see well talk about it more on the way back to london dillon said not me brigadier i havent had a vacation in two years i think its about time i took one ferguson said sean youre not getting into one of your moods are you now do i look that kind of fella brigadier he kissed hannah on the cheek off you go ill see you in london ill drive back with blake she frowned now look sean just do it he said turned and walked toward blake johnsons limousine driving back to manhattan dillon dosed the sliding window partition i take it were going to take jack fox to the cleaners you say we dont mess with me blake if youre in im in for more reasons than we need to state nobody should die like she did sean can you imagine a dark rainy night on the waterfront forced into taking that massive overdose he shook his head ill see fox in hell and dont talk to me about the law and all that kind of crap im going to take him down in whatever way i have to so my advice to you is to stay out of it dillon pulled open the panel and said to the driver pull over for five minutes and pass the umbrella the man did as he was told and dillon got out and opened the huge golfing umbrella as blake joined him they stood by the wall and looked out at the east river dillon lit a cigarette listen blake youre one of lifes good guys and jack fox is one of lifes bad guys and you sean what are you dillon turned his eyes blank face wiped of all emotion oh im his worst nightmare blake i was engaged in what i saw as war for twentyfive years with the brits and the ira fox and his fucking mafia think theyre big stuff well let me tell you something they wouldnt last five minutes in belfast so what are you saying we take this animal out only we do it my way its too easy to shoot him on the street i want this to be slow and painful we destroy his miserable little empire bit by bit until he has nothing left and then we destroy him blake smiled slowly now that i would like where do we begin well according to katherine theres this place called hadleys depository in brooklyn where they process cheap liquor so so lets take it out you mean that sure just the two of us blakes face was pale with excitement you really mean this its a start me old son then youre on by god hadleys depository was beside a pier close to clark street on the river in brooklyn it was eleven oclock that night black rods of march rain falling as dillon and blake drove up in an old ford panel truck and parked at the side of the road they stood by a wall and dillon lit a cigarette as they looked the place over this shouldnt be hard he said you me and no one else an inandout job theres just one thing sean i dont want any victims here no problem if theres a night shift we leave it if theres just security well handle them therell be only one victim here blake jack fox and his income from the booze business he laughed and hit blake on the shoulder hey trust me itll work the following day blake went through files and accessed city and police records to find out everything he could about the hadley depository when he saw dillon for lunch at a small italian family restaurant he was quite strong again probably because he had an end in view its funny but this place has no record not even a hint with the police so fox is a clever bastard do you have any details on how it operates i know the security firm who handles it two men guard the place on the other hand since the warehouse is not what it seems to be who knows they could have a night shift well see dillon smiled looking like the devil himself no waiting blake we go in and stiff the place give fox something to think about when tonight for gods sake blake said youre right to hell with him it was midnight when they drove up to hadleys depository in the old ford blake was driving and pulled into a side turning both he and dillon wore dark pants and sweaters now as they sat there they pulled on ski masks and dillon took a browning out of a handbag and stuffed it into the waistband of his pants at the rear bring the other bag he told blake the semtex pencils lets move it there was a ninefoot wall he cupped his hands helped blake over then passed the bag reached for an outstretched hand and scrambled over himself they crouched on the other side as it started to rain okay lets do it dillon said there were indeed two security guards in a small lighted office off a courtyard dillon and blake moved in through factory doors which surprisingly had been left open inside the main building they saw an extensive range of equipment obviously all of importance to the racket that was going on there great vats stacks of bottles many with exotic labels dillon pulled one up highland pride old scots whisky believe that youll believe anything blake told him okay so lets get on with it dillon opened the bag that hung from his shoulder he took out several semtex primer pencils blake had obtained for him ran round the main area and placed them how long blake asked ten minutes lets get those guards out and move on the two security guards were playing trivial pursuit when the door opened and the men in hoods slipped in dillon relieved them of their guns if you want to live move fast and make it to the street they didnt argue did exactly as they were told and a few moments later were out of the front gate just after that the semtex timers exploded and the whisky in the vats caught fire dillon caught the nearest guard by the collar listen heres a message it isnt for the police its for jack fox tell him this is just the beginning for katherine johnson got that okay now run for it which they did dillon and blake drove some little distance away and parked watching the flames and waiting for the fire department blake said funny but i didnt feel guilty why should you fox is a murdering bastard i work for the president sean you work for the prime minister i dont care about that one way or another fox goes down the following morning jack fox was at trump tower summoned there by a phone call from don marco the old man sipped coffee by the fire a bad night i hear jack fox hesitated then decided that at least some sort of truth was the best way to handle it yes uncle the whole place was destroyed by fire thank god there is the insurance but only the equipment jack not on a couple of million in booze the don shook his head its very unfortunate still these things happen have you anything to add anything you wish to tell me fox hesitated then said no uncle fine ill see you again fox went out after a while falcone looked in don marco has he gone yes good bring the security guard in my nephew failed to mention him aldo a matter to be regretted signore but you did aldo and im grateful he poured another cup of coffee and a moment later falcone brought in the security guard your name don marco asked mirabella signore good a fellow countryman now tell me what happened which mirabella did don marco said tell me again what he said the man in the hood mirabella clutched his cap in his hands he said this isnt for the police tell jack fox its just the beginning for katherine johnson good thank you don marco looked at falcone take care of him then come back perhaps twenty minutes later falcone returned the don stood at the window fingering a cuban cigar falcone offered a light don marco smiled youre a good boy aldo your father was one of my most trusted people until those virelli swine murdered him on that palermo trip he was always loyal and loyalty is everything absolutely don marco so where does loyalty lie you and my nephew you were boyhood friends please don marco falcone held up a hand my loyalty is to you above everything else don marco patted his chest youre a great comfort to me you will attend to jacks requirements that goes without saying but you will tell me everything that goes on wont you aldo always signore good now be on your way jack fox in the grill room of the four seasons sat with the great and the good and the notsogood drank champagne and tried to come to terms with what had happened the previous night the interview with mirabelli had been particularly unnerving and he hadnt mentioned it to his uncle for obvious reasons falcone and russo stood against the wall a waiter appeared sir your guests are here my guests fox looked up and dillon and blake appeared falcone stepped forward and fox waved him away they sat down and dillon reached for the champagne bottle he sampled it shook his head and said to blake the man has no taste fox said okay get on with it i know who you are youre blake johnson and you work for the white house and youre sean dillon you used to be ira but now you work for the prime minister okay my you are well informed blake said thats because i can access anything the trouble with computers is that all you need is the right kind of genius to break into them and i have mine so you fuck with me and youll wish youd never been born and well return the favour to don solazzo dillon shrugged and by the way no one used to be ira once in never out im really bad news son you know why because i dont care whether i live or die maybe i can do something about that the british army and the sas couldnt catch him in twenty years blake said so i doubt youll have much luck in fact youre already running out of luck arent you jack we know you front for the solazzo empire but you also have a personal sideline a cheap liquor still in brooklyn or at least you used to hey dillon said isnt that the place that got blown up last night what a coincidence he smiled beautifully well that isnt going to help the cash flow fox said i dont know what youre talking about that had nothing to do with me oh i believe it did blake told him and then theres all that family money you lost in the asian banking collapse money you didnt have the right to invest unless don marco knew and approved of it all which i doubt fox said calmly what are you getting at that youre in deep shit with don marco unless you come up with some very considerable cash very soon dillon smiled and we intend to see that you dont get it fox turned to falcone aldo break this little bastards right arm for me falcone moved forward and dillons left foot flicked as he kicked the sicilian under his right kneecap at the same moment blake took a walther from under his jacket and laid it on the table falcone was down on one knee grabbed for the table and pulled himself up russo had a hand on the gun under his left shoulder is this what you want blake asked a gunfight at the ok corral not really fox said lets leave it to a more appropriate time just go our pleasure blake stood up and dillon rose beside him i have a line for you that i remember from some old movie i saw on television to our next merry meeting in hell i look forward to it fox told him they turned and went out falcone said they knew about the depository so did a lot of people it was an open secret how many clubs did we deal with a secrets only a secret when one person knows it you dont think they know about anything else no they were just bluffing come on we have to leave for london soon fox drained the champagne in his glass and made a face you know that little bastard was right this stuff is bad in the bar at the plaza dillon and blake were sharing a pot of tea and irish whiskeys when ferguson and hannah bernstein appeared my goodness ferguson said here you two sit enjoying yourselves when according to captain harry parker somebody torched up mr jack foxs illegal liquor still last night do you tell me dillon shook his head isnt that dreadful are you coming home dillon why not i think im done with business here for the moment i would point out that when i saved you from the serbs and took you on board i offered to dear your rather terrible slate so you did but on the other hand you still havent learned to behave yourself thats the irish for you ferguson said sean you still work for me use your judgement but please keep me informed jesus brigadier i wont let you down theres only one thing and what would that be i intend to totally destroy jack fox and the solazzo family in ireland london beirut wherever it takes me dillon turned to blake is that okay with you it sure as hell is ill see the president tomorrow and retire if i have to dillon turned and smiled at ferguson there it is charles ferguson smiled wonderful absolutely delicious he smiled then didnt in this case i actually approve of what youre up to you will use superintendent bernstein as your connection the full facilities of the department will be available he stood up and dillon said its the grand man you are brigadier well i am half irish ill get on with it then all the way finish fox and the family consider it done there is one thing its disturbing that fox knows so much about us what was it he said you can access anything with the right kind of genius thats right well i know such a genius in london hannah bernstein smiled roper sir exactly see that the introductions are made at the right time will you superintendent she nodded good well he stood up time to go well see you later superintendent they left dillon turned to blake you didnt figure much in that what happens now ive got to clear myself with the president then what lets hit the bastard in london sounds good to me cazalet had gone down to his old family house on nantucket blake couldnt wait for his return so he ordered a helicopter on departmental authority and flew down the president was walking the beach with his beloved flatcoat retriever murchison followed by clancy smith the surf roared the sky was grey a little rain drifted in and the president read for the fifth time the fax hed received from harry parker there was a roaring in the distance clancy had a hand to his ear and mumbled into his mouthpiece he looked up helicopter mr president its blake good lets go back to the house they were halfway there when blake appeared give us a little space clancy the president said they walked along the edge of the surf murchison running in and out cazalet said idiot ill have to hose him down i know sea water isnt good for his skin cazalet waved to clancy who lit a marlboro away from the wind and handed it over cazalet passed the fax to blake im afraid i leaned on your friend harry parker i asked what was happening with this whole unhappy business and he told you blake smiled well he would after all i placed him under presidential warrant so you know everything mr president yes a bad business but its wonderful that brigadier ferguson and superintendent bernstein flew over to support you and sean dillon as always cazalet smiled you know its a remarkable coincidence that fire destroying foxs warehouse like that mr president no blake let me speak youve been looking tired lately i think you need a break lets see what a month does you should travel get to london europe see some sights hmmm any departmental facilities you need are yours what can i say mr president cazalet said face hard nothing at all if you and dillon can take those bastards down then itll be better for all of us he smiled crookedly however it would seriously inconvenience me if you didnt return from your vacation in one piece yes mr president ill see to it good cazalet flicked his cigarette into the surf now come back to the house for lunch and then on your way at don marcos apartment at trump tower the old man listened as falcone related what had happened at the four seasons don marco nodded what does my nephew intend were going to london landing at heathrow hes using the gulfstream yes signore falcone hesitated you dont know this oh im sure hell tell me when hes ready you have my coded mobile number keep me informed i wish to know what hes up to at all times he held out his hand falcone kissed it and withdrew don marco rose went to the piano and picked up a photo of jack fox the war hero in his marine uniform what a pity he said softly all the virtues as well as vanity and stupidity he replaced the photo on the piano and went out london the following morning fergusons plane landed at farley field with the usual pilots flight lieutenants lacey and parry in the cockpit a flight sergeant madoc had also been on board to see to the passengers wants it was march weather again the rain driving in towards the waiting daimler madoc produced an umbrella as the four of them ferguson dillon bernstein and johnson went down the steps and led the way they scrambled into the daimler and ferguson leaned out to the two pilots it could be a busy time ahead so dont make plans they both smiled excellent sir lacey said just one thing lacey i do think you should wear correct uniform lacey was staggered brigadier check the promotions list out today i put you up for squadron leader and for once the ministry of defence has acted sensibly in addition in view of recent hazardous pursuits at my behest youve both been awarded the air force cross they stared at him good god sir parry said sincere thanks nonsense go and have a drink on it ferguson closed the door and the chauffeur drove away dillon said i always knew it at heart youre a sentimentalist dont be stupid dillon theyve earned it ferguson turned to hannah well drop these two off at dillons house then carry on to my place in cavendish square i suggest you contact roper as soon as possible to arrange a meeting blake said could someone tell me about this roper guy well you recall the white house connection and lady helen grant she wanted to know how to work the computer field in a nefarious wayhannah told him she asked the london branch of her organization for help and they sent roper a remarkable man ferguson said he was a captain in the royal engineers a bomb disposal expert awarded the military cross and the george cross and then he got careless a silly little car bomb in belfast ended him up in a wheelchair computers became a whole new career for himand he proved to have a real genius for them as lady helen grant found out blake was silent remembering lady helen and the white house connection case that had so nearly ended in disaster so roper had been her computer man i look forward to meeting him blake said the daimler turned into stable mews and dillon and blake got out hannah said ill contact roper straight away blake carried the bags and dillon unlocked the door at the mews house and led the way in it was small victorian with turkish carpet runners and wood block floors the living room was delightful sofa and chairs in black leather placed among scattered rugs a superb painting over the fireplace my god thats fabulous blake said a great victorian painter atkinson grimshaw liam devlin gave it to me remember him how could i forget he saved our bacon is he still around ninety years old and pretending to be seventyfive come on ill show you your room then well go to the kings head on the other side of the square for what we call great pub grub in england sean i know what great pub grub is its usually the best food in london so lead the way as they were sitting in the kings head drinking guinness and eating shepherds pie dillons coded mobile rang faintly hannah said ive contacted roper he lives on regency square only half a mile from you shall we go round no he said he prefers the exercise he operates one of those stateoftheart electric wheelchairs he hates being regarded as a cripple i hear what youre saying dear girl hell see you at stable mews at twothirty well be there another thing i put out a search on the special branch computer guess whos arriving at gatwick this evening jack fox aldo falcone and giovanni russo as ferguson would say quite delicious this should prove interesting he put the phone down turned to blake and filled him in an hour later at stable mews it was blake who happened to be at the sitting room window and looking out into the street when he witnessed the arrival of the strange young man in the electric wheelchair the man wore a navy blue reefer coat a white scarf at his throat when blake went into the hall dillon already had the door open ah mr dillon ive seen your face on my computer ropers the name he had hair to his shoulders hollow cheeks and very blue eyes his face was a taut mask of scar tissue the kind you only got from burns come in dillon said cheerfully only if you help me over the step its the one thing these gadgets cant manage dillon obliged then pushed him along the hall into the kitchen blake following roper said what i could really do with is a nice cup of tea he turned to blake lieutenant blake smiled should i say sir of course i outrank you fortyfive miles later theyd filled him in on everything they needed from him roper said fine ill go into everything the solazzo family jack fox the colosseum operation these jago brothers oh and this brendan murphy i remember the name from my irish service a hard man as i recall no a fanatic brendan dillon said i had dealings with him in the old days hates the peace process and now we hear hes into arms dumps and possibly worse this hint of an involvement with saddam in beirut so ill access army hq at lisburn the ruc the garda in dublin maybe the security services you can do that dillon asked dillon i can even access your lot and ferguson probably knows that im the hand of god so leave it with me okay blake said but in case you dont know fox turns up in london this evening plus his two minders falcone and russo roper smiled tranquilly mafia hard men ireland was my business for eleven years and terrorists were my enemy but in a strange way you can empathize with your enemy both ira and loyalists these two wouldnt last half an hour in derry or belfast so what happens now blake asked well from what ive been told you want to see the colosseum severely damaged exactly good then wheel me out into the street and ill go home and organize it blake said youll be able to do it then roper nodded no problem god wouldnt have given some people brains if hed wanted the scum to inherit the earth he turned to dillon ill see you at six at my place in regency square you will then put into operation what i tell you to is that acceptable bloody cheek said dillon but then he smiled im sure it will be so lets get on with it and dillon wheeled him out ropers apartment in regency square was on the ground floor with a slope to the front door for his wheelchair everything from the bathroom to the kitchen had been designed for a handicapped person in what would have been the sitting room was a kind of computer laboratory with every kind of equipment on view on a workbench he answered the door when dillon blake and hannah bernstein arrived ah there you are he led the way through to the sitting room here we are then he tapped a keyboard and the screen started to fill colosseum casino smith street general manager angelo mori minders francesco cameci tino rossi photos appeared after a while he tapped again and ground plans came up lots of security blake said not if you know your way in so what would be the point dillon asked a top casino stands on its reputation the slightest hint of scandal and the gaming act enters into it and the place can be dosed down there was silence dillon said and how do we achieve that tonight will tell you if you do what i say and go in hard you mean go in feloniously captain hannah said that sums it up you want this bastard we go for the throat dillon said that suits me and as the superintendent knows ive been guaranteed the full cooperation of the department by brigadier ferguson so lets hear what you have in mind its very simple whats one of the oldest games of chance in the world they loved it at the height of the roman empire they still love it blake smiled craps exactly you simply throw the dice and pray the right number comes up people cant resist dillon said so what do you want dice old boy steal me some dice why blake asked because every casino has its own made to order unique of course once i have them at my workbench i make a slight adjustment put a spot of lead inside and they become whats known in the trade as loaded dice now if the house is using loaded dice the punters are bound to lose but how do you make the house actually use the loaded dice blake asked thats the whole point about having house dice you or dillon join the crowd making a wager when your turn comes and the dealer gives you the dice you palm them and use the ones ive doctored theyll have the house logo on them so everyone will assume theyre the real thing of course it will be necessary to bring this unfortunate situation to the attention of the other gamblers the results could be devastating for the casino you wicked man you dillon said you or blake i think should be the ones i wouldnt dream of asking the superintendent he smiled at hannah i happen to know youre jewish orthodox with a rabbi for a grandfather she smiled my grandfather might surprise you his poker is deadly dillon said sounds good to me so whats the plan at ten oclock that evening jack fox arrived at the colosseum backed by falcone and russo he was stopped at the door by a large man in evening dress membership card sir i dont need one i own this casino very funny the bouncer put a hand on foxs shoulder and russo said you want me to break your right arm you just made the biggest mistake of your life signor fox what a pleasure a voice called and angelo mori the general manager rushed down the stairs followed by his two minders is there a problem hell no fox said and smiled at the bouncer whats your name henry sir he looked very worried youre doing a good job henry fox took out his wallet extracted a fiftypound note and slipped it into henrys breast pocket in fact youre doing a great job anyone else comes in and says they own the joint kick them in the balls there was sweat on henrys forehead yes sir anything you say inside the main room was crowded every kind of game in progress fox nodded approvingly looks good hows the cash flow terrific fox turned to moris minders cameci and rossi you two behaving yourselves he used italian absolutely rossi told him don marco is well if this seemed overly familiar it wasnt rossi came from the same village as the solazzo family close to corleone in sicily he is very well fox continued in italian and i appreciate your concern he turned to mori we just flew in and im starving the restaurant is still open i trust for you it never closes signore fifty tony answered harold said shut your mouth and turned back to fox ill read the file but i can tell you now were in jack leave the team to me good man fox smiled now lets have a bottle of champagne on it the casino dosed at two in the morning by three all was quiet with only a security guard in the office by the main entrance watching tv along the street beside the basement entrance was a grey british telecom van the rear door opened and blake johnson wearing a hard hat and yellow oilskins got out carrying two grappling hooks and lifted a manhole cover in the pavement dillon passed him an inspection lamp and a red warning light saying danger men at work he then passed some canvas screens and an awning against the rain there was an army of wires and switches blake tried to take an interest inside the van roper in a wheelchair sat opposite a very simplelooking computer setup dillon in black tee shirt and jeans crouched beside him roper punched the keys hows it looking dillon asked so far so good dont worry the great roper is never wrong there was the sound of a car slowing outside and he raised a hand wait blake looked out from under the awning the rain pitiless the police patrol car slowed the driver leaned out what a bloody way to make a living at this time in the morning you too blake told him putting on his best british accent the policeman smiled and drove away dillon said lets do it fine as i told you i can screw the entire security system but only for fifteen minutes so youll need to be fast hell ive been all over those ground plans you showed me i know where im going you better had im starting now so count to ten and get down to that basement door various lights flickered on the screen reds and greens there came a faint sound and then dillon was out of there past blake and down to the basement pulling up his hood he had a small flashlight but really didnt need it for there were subdued security lights everywhere he had no worries about cameras as roper had told him they were frozen too remembering the ground plans from the computer screen he went up the steps fast passed through the kitchens and emerged by the entrance to the restaurant he could see into the glass office by the main door the security guard was fiddling with the tv which had gone off dillon slipped through the shadows into the main gambling room and round the right table there was a tray of dice on the table all very neat but he left them alone and instead dropped to one knee by the righthand side of the table where the dealer stood there was a stack of dice there he took six no more and put them into his pocket turned and went out fast the security guard was still arguing with the tv dillon slipped through the shadow went down the steps and speeded into the basement closing the door behind him he stepped past blake gave him a thumbsup and went into the van he took the six dice from his pocket and put them on the bench in front of roper there you go thirteen minutes roper said you did well he tapped the keys and sat back everything normal again now what we clear up and get out of here dillon removed his hood and went out to blake it worked i got what he wanted so lets get moving ill help you okay blake said dillon collapsed the screens and awning and put them into the truck while blake replaced the manhole cover a few moments later they drove away dillon at the wheel at ropers place in regency square they sat and watched him at the bench examining the dice with an eyeglass will it be okay blake asked of course it will old boy being a perfectionist however i prefer solitude when engaged in sensitive work so be good and dear off you wont be able to use these things until tomorrow night anyway so ive got all the time in the world dillon nodded to blake and they stood up well check in tomorrow then you do that roper said ignoring them completely as he picked up a tiny electric drill of the kind used by jewellers the following morning at eight dillons phone rang and ferguson said as ive had no intimations of disaster you must have pulled it off last night absolutely were in ropers hands now what are you and blake up to were going to the kings head for a full english breakfast i cant wait to join you which he did half an hour later accompanied by hannah bernstein they all ordered and ferguson said you havent checked with roper yet give him a chance sir hannah said as the waiter arrived with the breakfasts on a large tray dillon said pass your bacon to me hannah i wouldnt want to put your fine jewish principles under siege youre so kind dillon and then the door opened with a bang and roper surged in smells great he turned to the waiter the same for me i must say you look astonishingly well ferguson said you mean for a cripple who hasnt been to bed all night roper asked and took the six dice from his pocket and rolled them on the table they all came up ones snake eyes he turned to blake isnt that what you call them in vegas it sure as hell is excellent god help jack fox and the colosseum this evening i think ill go and watch you have to be a member hannah bernstein said which thanks to my computer i am in fact you all are the waiter appeared with his breakfast my god this looks good he picked up a knife and fork and got to work i assume it had occurred to you that if dillon and blake wanted to create mayhem in the colosseum tonight they also needed to be members of course it did ferguson smiled and i knew youd take care of it itll be an interesting night ahead of us i think you can sure as hell say that blake agreed excellent god help jack fox and the colosseum this evening i think ill go and watch you have to be a member hannah bernstein said which thanks to my computer i am in fact you all are the waiter appeared with his breakfast my god this looks good he picked up a knife and fork and got to work i assume it had occurred to you that if dillon and blake wanted to create mayhem in the colosseum tonight they also needed to be members of course it did ferguson smiled and i knew youd take care of it itll be an interesting night ahead of us i think you can sure as hell say that blake agreed ropers expertise produced plastic membership cards for all of them plus photos of rossi and cameci the restaurants minders to add to those of falcone and russo and that evening at eight oclock they were passed through the door at the colosseum by henry roper in a light collapsible wheelchair pushed by dillon the main room was already busy waitresses in minuscule skirts moving through the crowd offering champagne dillon took a glass and looked up any good blake asked if you like sparkling wine but champagne its not ah well fox will be into profit margins ferguson observed they stood in a small group by the bar and hannah said there are a couple of villains youre interested in sir the jago brothers harold and tony at the end of the bar the others took a look ferguson said very unsavoury yes well we can sort them out later dillon said the thing is whos going to start the ball rolling well actually ive had another of my ideas ferguson said we have six dice so why not two each brigadier i can see why you achieved high command blake told him agreed sean why not dillon turned to roper here we go showtime roper passed the dice across and dillon gave the others theirs there you go into action then ferguson said lets get on with it and turned for the dice table oh and palm your dice smoothly gentlemen in the restaurant fox enjoyed his scrambled eggs and smoked salmon again and tried a little krug champagne great stuff this he said to falcone but not the vintage its the nonvintage thats really special different grapes russo appeared theres a problem signore you remember those two from the four seasons in new york dillon and johnson yes theyre here now in the main room really fox emptied his glass well lets take a look falcone pulled back the chair and fox stood up and walked out into the most active part of the casino russo said over there signore next to some woman and another man in the striped suit see fox snorted that some woman russo is detective superintendent hannah bernstein of scotland yards special branch and that another man is brigadier general ferguson head of a special intelligence unit for the prime minister an absolutely devious old bastard i guarantee you theyre not here for a friendly game of cards so what do we do signore falcone asked move them out dont be stupid fox said this is one of the most prestigious gambling clubs in london scandal is the last thing we want you expect me to expel a brigadier general and his friends no we wait and see what theyre up to the dice table was a popular one every inch taken up by the crowd standing around ferguson said to hannah would you like to have a go superintendent no sir i dont know craps its not one of my vices well its one of mine blake said lets do it he had to wait ten minutes for his chance then took the offered dice and started strangely enough he did quite well for the first three throws actually won money then he palmed the dice and tossed two of ropers snake eyes there was a groan from the crowd the dealer passed the dice to dillon who palmed them for the real article and made two successful throws then just when he had everything riding on the toss snake eyes hey he said ruefully bad luck i understand but this is diabolical ferguson moved in let me try old boy mind you these dice do seem to have lost their edge he turned to the croupier let me have a new pair the croupier complied ferguson rolled and immediately came up with snake eyes he turned to a militarylooking man with a stiff moustache next to him how strange he laughed we all keep getting the same thing yes the militarylooking man said slowly the croupiers rake reached out but the militarylooking man said not so fast and grabbed the dice the croupier said i hope monsieur isnt suggesting there could be something wrong lets see the man rolled the dice and threw them the length of the table again snake eyes the croupiers rake reached out and the military gentleman beat him to it oh no you dont thats snake eyes too many times these dice are loaded there was a sudden murmur from the crowd and he turned to an ageing gentleman see for yourself pair of ones guaranteed the man threw and the result was clear the outrage in the crowd was plain to see and mori hurried down the steps ladies and gentlemen please a misunderstanding are you the manager ferguson demanded yes mori replied then oblige us by throwing those dice mori hesitated people in the crowd shouted get on with it mori threw the dice rolled snake eyes the crowd roared in anger the militarylooking man said that settles it loaded dice and ive lost a bundle here in the last few weeks we need the police ladies and gentlemen please mori called fox falcone and russo stayed well to the rear hannah bernstein moved forward and said to mori the dice sir ill have them and who the devil are you he was so upset he asked her in italian hannah replied with fluency in the same language detective superintendent bernstein special branch she looked at the dice she picked up i notice that in accordance with the gaming act these carry the clubs registered mark do you agree well yes mori said lamely then added someone must have substituted false ones the militarylooking man said dont be stupid what on earth would be the point of a player substituting for the real dice a pair that would make him lose there was a roar from the crowd mori sagged across the table and hannah said in accordance with the statutory provisions of the gaming act sir i must issue an order closing you down until such time as westminster magistrates court can consider the matter i believe you also own twelve betting shops in the city of london is that so yes mori told her im afraid they must close also any infringement of this order means a fine of one hundred thousand pounds with further penalties thereafter of course mori raised his voice shakily ladies and gentlemen im afraid we must close by order of the police please leave now dont forget your things the crowd faded and at the rear were ferguson bernstein dillon blake and roper in his wheelchair at the door dillon turned and waved to fox hey there you are old buddy have a good night they went out fox turned to falcone i want to know where they go there must be a couple of young punks available not rossi or comeci russo said theres borsalino and salvatore in the kitchen get them now i know who most of them are but not the one in the wheelchair then follow him to hell they took roper from his wheelchair eased him into the daimler and then followed him after folding his wheelchair now what blake asked we wait for fox to react dillon said shall we eat ferguson asked not me brigadier roper told him i want to check out the computer again take me home then you lot go and enjoy yourselves but already following the daimler was a very ordinary ford car driven by a young man named paolo borsalino with his friend alex salvatore sitting beside him in sicilian terms they were piccioti youngsters gaining respect doing the odd killing climbing up the ladder borsalino had acted as executioner three times and salvatore twice and they were eager to do more the daimler stopped in regency square and dillon got out set up ropers wheelchair and helped him into it they all got out and dillon took ropers key and opened his door ferguson said well speak tomorrow excellent job captain we aim to please brigadier dillon pushed roper up the ramp into the hall youre a hell of a fella roper well considering your background i take that as a compliment dillon closed the door and went back to the others now what fredos its round the corner from cavendish square a nice italian restaurant ferguson said we can have a look at whats next the daimler drove away and borsalino and salvatore parked at the end of the square watched them go salvatore said now what you watch the car borsalino said ill be back he walked to the other side of the square and found a corner shop the kind that stayed open until midnight the man behind the counter was indian borsalino asked for two packs of marlboros you know i saw this guy earlier getting out of a taxi in the square in a wheelchair i thought i knew him but im not sure that would be mr roper the indian said he was a captain in the royal engineers blown up in ireland oh well ive got it wrong thanks anyway borsalino returned to the ford called fox on the mobile and relayed the information also telling him where they were fox said stay there ill be back at that point he was still in moris office at the casino he picked up the telephone and called maud jackson in new york it was late afternoon there and she was enjoying a pot of tea and cookies fox said maud im having serious problems here in london with ferguson and company theres a wild card a british royal engineers captain in a wheelchair blown up in ireland name of roper id like to know who he is right away where are you im going back to the dorchester we had problems at the colosseum sounds like a bad night give me an hour at the dorchester in the oliver messel suite fox drank krug champagne and looked across the wonderful london view by night from the terrace russo was down in the suite he and falcone were sharing but falcone was standing by as usual more trouble signore well see aldo the phone rang and he answered it maud jackson said boy do i have a good one for you this roper was blown up by the ira all right and now hes a legend in computers jack if hes into your affairs youve got serious trouble thanks maud youre an angel yeah well dont forget to send a cheque fox put down the phone and said to falcone take him out me personally signore of course not get over to regency square see borsalino and salvatore give them their instructions have them get rid of him i smell big trouble where hes concerned at your orders signore falcone said ill leave russo here he used foxs mercedes limousine driven by foxs italian driver fabio closed the screen and called don marco on his mobile and brought him up to date this isnt good don marco said im beginning to smell trouble here myself keep me informed aldo falcone found borsalino and salvatore in the ford parked in the square very close to ropers place they were of course all attention stay here for the moment this guy in the wheelchair you take him out but make it look like an accident you wait if it takes all night you wait if it takes until tomorrow but hes finished capisce anything you say borsalino told him falcone left then went back to the daimler fabio said back to the dorchester no im hungry find somewhere close by where we can get something simple you know a bacon and egg sandwich i know just the place signore good then well come back and see what the situation is at the computer bank roper trawled all the way through from jack fox to brendan murphy the pride of the provisional ira there were some fascinating facts there then he tried the jago brothers and found a litany of crime on a dickensian level he sat back excellent he checked his watch eleven oclock and he felt hungry which was okay because ryans irish restaurant on the far side of the square stayed open until one and knew him well he eased himself into a raincoat and then transferred to his electric wheelchair and made for the front door rain bounced down he raised a small telescopic umbrella as he went down the ramp and started along the pavement falcone sitting in the mercedes saw him go fabio said signore lets leave it to the boys roper coasted along his umbrella raised a slightly incongruous figure in the ford borsalino and salvatore saw him now what salvatore demanded we take him out borsalino said come on he was out of the ford in a second salvatore on his heels and ran after the wheelchair hey signore you need a hand roper knew trouble when he saw it but said no thanks im fine salvatore was on one side of the chair borsalino the other borsalino said no really i think you need some help like into traffic what do you think about that that really would be unfortunate roper said falcone watching from the mercedes said to fabio youve been around the family for a long time what do you think that it stinks signore where do they find these kids i agree just coast along and lets see what happens the end of the square before the main road was dark and at that moment deserted borsalino said shit theres no traffic here what are we going to do salvatore said roll him down the block well find it you having a good time my friend depends on your point of view ropers hand came out of the righthand side pocket of his wheelchair holding a walther ppk with a carswell silencer on the end he jammed it into the back of salvatores left knee and pulled the trigger there was a muted cough and the italian cried out and stumbled into the gutter roper turned slightly in the chair the gun raised and borsalino jumped back you really wouldnt have got by in belfast old son roper said not for a minute and as borsalino turned to run shot him in the back of the right thigh they lay together on the pavement roper paused and looked down he took out a mobile phone and dialled nine nine nine when the operator answered he said there are two men down on the pavement in regency square looks like a shooting your name sir dont be stupid he switched off his coded mobile and moved on in the mercedes fabio said my god signore what do we do already in the distance they could hear the sound of a police siren nothing falcone told him we do nothing he watched the two men trying to get up just get out of here as they left the square a police car turned in and as they moved up the main road an ambulance appeared in ryans restaurant roper ordered irish stew and a pint of guinness phoned ferguson on his mobile and gave him the bad news where are you ferguson asked and roper told him all right stay where you are well come for you ferguson put down the phone at his cavendish square flat and turned to hannah dillon and blake that was roper he went out for a late meal and two men of italian persuasion had a go told him theyd push him into the latenight traffic what happened sir hannah asked he shot them in the legs ferguson said would you believe that left them on the pavement frankly i dont have the slightest difficulty in believing it dillon told him jack fox moved fast so now what blake asked ferguson turned to hannah superintendent i doubt theyll talk sir not if they value their lives and i doubt that this will be the last attempt that jack fox makes youre right said ferguson well move roper to the holland park safe house anything he wants you know all his gadgets and so on make sure he gets i think well need him will you take care of that superintendent as you say sir hannah went out blake turned to dillon all right weve taken care of the casino what do we hit next blake turned to dillon the jago brothers the army dump beirut lets get roper into the safe house once hes got his equipment in order well see at the dorchester fox listened to falcones account of what had happened in regency square he actually laughed you mean this fuck in the wheelchair shot them both in the legs something like that signore fox shook his head mind you with what ive learned about him im not surprised you can check if hes at his house but if hes not there leave it weve got other things to do like what signore i spoke to mori the colosseum will remain closed as well as the betting shops until the police and the director of public prosecutions decide what to do which could take months we concentrate on other matters theres the lebanon connection that murphy arranged beirut signore no al shariz to the south i believe murphy is due in beirut next week well meet and agree on the goods were supplying forget the casino theres a fortune to be made there aldo and he pays in gold ill see you in the morning falcone left went to his room and phoned don marco the don said hes digging himself in deeper isnt he do you want me to do anything no just stay in touch of course don marco the holland park safe house was an edwardian town house in an acre of gardens surrounded by huge walls the notice by the gate said pine grove nursing home which it definitely wasnt roper was picked up by a contingency squad hannah had arranged mostly ordinarylooking young men and women who were actually special branch and always available to fergusons demands two female sergeants packed ropers clothes and three men moved equipment according to his instructions by one oclock in the morning he was in residence at pine grove his various gadgets and computers plugged into sockets in what had been the sitting room the police departed and a small very pleasant woman said is everything satisfactory major roper was puzzled captain oh no sir brigadier ferguson said major and who might you be helen black sir royal military police sergeant major good god roper said thats an armani suit well my father left me rather well off i smell oxford here no cambridge new hall i worked for the fourteenth intel undercover in derry you were a bit of a legend look where its got me a bloody wheelchair my bits and pieces damaged courage never goes out of fashion sir in a wheelchair or not as far as im concerned youre one of the bravest men ive ever met now youre probably peckish ill arrange for some sandwiches tell me sergeant major are you my bodyguard because there are some pretty bad people out there looking for me im aware of that sir she opened her jacket and revealed a holstered colt automatic twentyfive millimetre with hollowpoint bullets well that should do it she smiled and went out roper phoned ferguson in spite of the hour and when the brigadier answered said whats this major thing well youre still on the army list i thought it would give you a bit more authority to promote you youre established at holland park yes with the redoubtable sergeant major black redoubtable is right inherited money you know so shes fairly independentminded her husbands a major in the blues and royals refused a commission herself one of the few women to hold the military cross shot two provos in derry youre in good hands roper whistled id say so so whats my next move ill put dillon on there was a pause and dillon said billy the kid is that who you are now hey these guys didnt want to play nice so i figured stuff them im with you there so what do you want me to do whos next well weve got two choices the jagos and brendan murphy what do you know about the jagos not much they like to knock off security vans really oldtime stuff sawnoff shotguns like some british gangster movie the thing is finding out about the future plans of such people is difficult roper went on unless fox committed his plans to the computer how would i know its all a question of inside information dillon said and where do you get that the jagos are gangsters right and what does that prove set a gangster to catch a gangster what in the hell are you talking about harry salter hes a legendary name in london criminal circles did seven years for bank robbery in the seventies never been inside since he has warehouse developments property pleasure boats on the thames still owns his first buy a pub called the dark man at wapping by the river you sound as if you like him well hes saved me in the past and ive saved him hes a dinosaur but a very wealthy dinosaur even the cops have given up on him works with his nephew billy and a couple of minders baxter and hall all the rest are accountants so youll go and see him thats my plan fine keep me posted meantime ill check out mr murphy roper smiled i like to keep occupied see you sometime tomorrow roper sat there thinking then the door opened and helen black came in with two toasted bacon sandwiches will these do cant wait are you tired not particularly good then would you like me to show you just how effective a computer can be if you know what youre doing whats the object of the exercise to hunt down a particularly obnoxious piece of provisional ira crap called brendan murphy just a minute i remember him derry ninetyfour and years before that roper tried a sandwich excellent now follow my instructions and ill show you what to do they all came together at fergusons office the following morning when they were all settled ferguson said bring me up to date superintendent the attackers were a couple of smalltime hoods employed at the kitchens at the colosseum named borsalino and salvatore theyre at westminster hospital under supervision salvatore has lost his left kneecap and borsalino has a bullet wound in one thigh my goodness major roper doesnt play patty fingers does he well he wouldnt would he sir she said whats their story they told the officers in charge of the case that they were attacked by two very large black muggers as they walked through the square there was a struggle the rest you know nobodys safe from crime today it seems ferguson turned to dillon now what blake and i are going to see harry salter ill put him on to the jagos see if he can come up with anything if theres a big tickle being organized salter will get wind of it he owes me a favour in fact he owes blake a favour we saved his bacon on a pleasure boat called the lynda jones downriver from wapping when the hooker mob were going to waste him yes i recall some such thing ferguson said good but meantime what about brendan murphy thats much more worrying ropers been working on it hannah said but he says itd be a lot easier if he had some more information to go on is there any way to find out more well i do have a suggestion dillon said while blake and i go and see salter why dont you phone liam devlin in kilrea good god ferguson said is he still with us he certainly is devlin is ageless he liked you hannah when you met tell him the whole story the works ask him to find out what he can about brendan murphy hes still the living legend of the ira and the best source of information about anything regarding them hannah turned to ferguson brigadier it makes sense i have just one suggestion dont phone him do it face to face get yourself to dublin today if you say so sir yes i do so people lets get on with it hannah went back to her office with blake and dillon she picked up the phone spoke to farley field and booked the plane dillon said you watch yourself over there woman peace process or no peace process its still the war zone dont be patronizing dillon there are people there whod shoot your eyes out if they could she took a deep breath youre right im sorry yes well make sure youre carrying i will well leave you to it he and blake left she took her personal notebook from her purse found devlins phone number in the village of kilrea outside dublin it was answered instantly and who would that be disturbing my morning hannah bernstein jesus girl and whats all this i hear youve made superintendent mr devlin we have a big problem and we need your assistance wheres dillon employed elsewhere together with blake johnson is that the fbi man dillon and i went down to tullamore with to save dermot rileys hide a good man all right give when can i expect you im leaving

so harrys still working the rackets oh sure its in his blood but like i was saying its all smuggling booze diamonds that kind of thing no drugs hes an oldfashioned family man in values anyway arent we all they reached wapping and pulled up outside the dark man it was a typical london pub the painted sign showed a sinister individual in a black cloak it was early for the drink trade noon an hour and a half away but it was open they went into the main bar which was very victorian the bottles ranged against mirrors an enormous mahogany bar smelling of polish the porcelain beer handles waiting for action three men were in the corner booth drinking tea and reading newspapers billy salter harrys nephew and joe baxter and sam hall whats this a thieves kitchen dillon asked billy looked up and a delighted smile appeared on his wicked face dear god its you dillon and our american friend mr johnson we remember you baxter and hall laughed and billy said well were not in the nick and i suppose

refurbished his pride and joy ill show you lets take a walk they went along the wharf passing a few boats one or two old barges sunk into the water it started to rain as they reached the boat harry salter was sitting at a table under an awning reading the times dora the chief barmaid from the dark man was pouring tea he patted her ample rear ive said it before dora youve got a great arse now isnt that the poet in him dillon said such a majestic choice of language salter looked up and took off his reading glasses christ dillon its you he glanced at blake and the bleeding yank again here whats going on the blue eyes hardened in the welllined face trouble well lets put it this way you owe me and this is payback time youd have been dead meat when the hooker mob had you if blake and i hadnt stuck an oar in no problem i always pay my debts anyway i like you dillon you remind me of billy here i mean you dont give a stuff mad as a hatter seeking death you mean dillon asked thats it

jagos were there and we know fox needs a big tickle eyes and ears harry see what you can find out we certainly will salter rubbed his hands together life suddenly becomes interesting again eh billy billy looked wolfish it certainly does he turned to dillon im reading this paperback on philosophy pinched it from the hairdresser better than a novel this guy heidegger have you heard of him dillon german a great favourite of heinrich himmler i believe never mind that this heidegger says that life is action and passion and that a man fails to take part in the action and passion of his times at the peril of being judged not to have lived thats really very erudite billy dont take the piss out of me dillon i didnt get much schooling and i know im a tearaway but ive got a brain i like books and i know what erudite means which is that im a clever bastard i never doubted it dillon took out a card and scribbled numbers my house my mobile ferguson at his cavendish square flat do what you can harry sure will my old son dillon and blake went to the gangplank and dillon noticed some air bottles hey billy youre still at the scuba diving master diver now billy said are you a master diver as a matter of fact i am oh go and stuff yourself dillon well be in touch and billy went back to his uncle the gulfstream did not carry raf roundels so when it landed at dublin airport it was simply directed to an area that handled private planes flight sergeant madoc got the door open like lacey and parry he wore the kind of navy blue uniform used by flight crews throughout the world he put an umbrella up against the driving rain theres a limousine by the hangar madoc said and led the way towards a black mercedes but there was another vehicle waiting there a garda police car a uniformed officer at the wheel a large man in a fawn burberry trenchcoat and tweed cap sitting beside him he got out smiling dan malone special branch chief superintendent weve never met ah you outrank me sir heard theyve put you up to super i bet the boys at special branch at scotland yard didnt like that malone thats a good irish name we have a detective sergeant terry malone in special branch my nephew english mother born in london can we have words away from the pride of the raf here they moved out of the rain into the hangar and he took a cigarette from a crumpled pack do you use these things no good for you youll live longer than me listen were all together these days what with europe and the peace process and i know all about you superintendent just like most of dublin special branch your reputation precedes you fergusons and dillons too what are you trying to say that were not looking the other way where the ira is concerned on the other hand if fergusons sent you over somethings up ill be honest with you i leaned on your driver who told me he was to take you to kilrea and that means only one thing youre going to see liam devlin the old sod ah you like him too yes damn you i do so is there something i should know about im seeking information is this a hot one it could be she took a chance then one cop to another one cop to another does brendan murphy mean anything to you that bastard dear god is he in this he frowned but he wouldnt be in this jurisdiction hes always stayed north of the border what is this this is just a rumour right now could be an arms dump in county louth could be an arab terrorist connection in lebanon so thats why youve come to see devlin thats right if anyone will have heard a whisper itll be him no doubt about that malone frowned youll keep me informed of course we might even need your good offices fine ill hear from you then he walked her back to thelimousine and opened the door and watch your back peace or no peace what peace she asked got in the limousine and closed the door it was just after noon when she reached devlins victorian cottage next to the convent in kilrea village she told the driver to wait went up the path and knocked on the door it opened and he stood there an ageless figure in black armani slacks and shirt his hair silver his eyes very blue a man who still held literary seminars as a visiting professor at trinity college but also a lifetime member of the ira who had killed many times jesus girl you look wonderful he embraced her you look grand come away in youre not looking too bad yourself he led her to the sitting room he turned would you like a drink or something no id like to get on with it she sat down and he took the opposite chair get on with it then do you know a man called brendan murphy his face hardened is that dog in this a bad one as bad as they come he took a cigarette from the old silver case and lit it youd better tell me when she was finished he sat there frowning yes that sounds like murphy i was thinking where would murphy get the kind of money hed need to pay for an underground arms bunker and weaponry drugs protection this early release of prisoners the governments been doing has handed ulster back to the godfathers on both sides loyalist and catholic have you any information on what murphy could be up to only in general the word is that he did time in libya not only in training but also working for various arab outfits hell be the one supplying the contacts for fox in this lebanon business nothing more specific he shook his head then his eyes narrowed however i might know somebody who could help but i want your words as regards confidentiality ira exactly she nodded my hand on it he reached for the phone lets see in dublin michael leary was just pulling on his raincoat to go out when the phone rang leary he said michael my old son liam devlin jesus liam my hearts sinking already because that can only mean you want something and dont i always ill meet you at the irish hussar for a snack and ill have a special branch superintendent with me what the garda i dont need no this is the scotland yard variety name of bernstein a woman with brains and beauty michael works with sean dillon my god leary groaned i dont want to know youll love it son see you soon and devlin put the phone down in hannahs limousine on the way to dublin a short while later devlin pulled the glass screen across and filled her in on michael leary a nice lad he went to queens university belfast read english literature taught for a while and then took up the glorious cause he had his reasons but an educated man taking up guns and bombs you mean all members of the ira should be off a building site and wear hobnailed boots hannah after the second world war the jews who fought to create israel the members of irgun and the stern gang used guns and bombs and many of them had been to the finest universities in europe point taken he found a cigarette and opened his window to let the smoke blow away i might also mention with my usual modesty that i was educated by jesuits myself and took a first class honours degree at trinity all right i surrender i cant talk ive killed people myself it is just that i dont like bombs and neither do i so more about leary michael was on the active list for years we worked together except that he liked the bombs more than you or i do he was running one in a truck over the border to ulster and it went off killed the two men with him and took off half of his left leg the good news was he was still in the republic so he didnt end up in the maze prison so his active career was over oh he ran the dublin intelligence section for the chief of staff but once the peace process started hed had enough he knows dillon well from derry in the old days when they were facing soldiers and now what he writes thrillers the kind you see on the stalls at airports and doing well good god she frowned will he help lets put it this way hes like a lot of people these days big for peace well see devlin directed the driver to a quay on the river liffey where they parked outside the irish hussar its a favourite with good republicans and sinn fein supporters and the food is excellent devlin told her the bar was very oldfashioned with mahogany and mirrors bottles offering every kind of drink it was busy people sampling good simple pub food leary sat in a booth in the far corner he had a pint of guinness at his right hand a plate of irish stew in front of him dont getup devlin told him this is my friend hannah so lets start with that leary looked at her a goodlooking man of fortyfive black hair streaked with silver he hesitated then held out his hand hannah also hesitated then took it sit down the stew looks good she said as a waitress appeared i think id like to sample that and you professor devlin the waitress asked ah now youre stroking me he turned to hannah eileens a student at trinity for her sins she comes to my occasional seminars nonsense youre the best everyone knows that eileen said which gets you an a for your next essay an allday breakfast for me a grand old playwright and novelist called somerset maugham once said that to dine well in england you should eat breakfast three times a day bushmills whiskey for me my love a mineral water would do fine for me hannah said still writing through the night michael the leg liam hurts like hell at night so i cant sleep and i refuse to take the morphine id stick to the bushmills if i were you eileen brought the drinks and departed leary went back to his stew so whats it about brendan murphy friend of yours nobodys friend that one as far as im concerned hes a gangster a disgrace to the movement would the chief of staff share your view certainly all the old hands want peace to work liam except for people like murphy who have a vested interest in keeping things going hannah said exactly splinter groups like the continuity ira the real ira they all have other agendas the breakfast and the irish stew arrived and they started to eat and where would murphy be now hannah asked god knows superintendent leary pulled up short as you must know better than most these days in the republic ulster and the uk theyre letting them out not locking them up murphy can come and go as he pleases hes only in trouble if he crosses the line with the provisional ira would he be dealt with certainly no question were an army hannah with rules and regulations now whats all this about and why should i help because fifteen years ago i saved your life in county down after you were shot got you over the border liam i paid off on that one when you dillon and that yank were after dermot riley and i told you he was back and probably at the farm at tullamore and down you went and you told the chief of staff who sent bell and barry down two walking ape men they tortured bridget riley with cigarette burns on the face and dillon killed bell and you shot barry in the back we got it all from dermot yes disgraceful in a man of my age devlin nodded all right tell him hannah which she did the underground bunker in county louth fox the lebanese connection everything leary sat there frowning then said let me make one thing clear and im speaking for provos in general here we wont give up our arms history has shown that to be an unwise thing to do so youre happy to think that this bunker might exist and murphys in charge no im damn well not and the chief of staff wont be pleased youll tell him hannah asked i have no choice ah well for once youve got something in common you two devlin said so what can you do michael we can trawl county louth but its a hell of a lot of county and murphy has a lot of hardline friends there so im not hopeful he frowned suddenly ive just thought of something sean regan remember him liam from derry devlin said shot a military policeman and cleared off to america as i recall the peeler recovered that was two years ago regan came back and was working with murphy in europe apparently he was on a plane from paris to dublin three weeks ago that was diverted to heathrow because of fog his name came up on the computer security check and he was lifted i wonder why i dont know about this hannah frowned well according to my information the secret intelligence service picked him up at heathrow on one of their special warrants and spirited him away id have thought youd have known that dont your departments share information only some of the time devlin turned to hannah what do you think if regans been working for murphy he might well know something frankly its our best lead i cant see that theres anything else i can do devlin said michael here will spill the beans to the chief of staff and if i do get any crumbs from the table ill let you know they got up and walked to the door outside leary shook hannahs hand superintendent it was a sincere pleasure but dont lets make a habit of it and he walked away devlin smiled a decent enough stick anyway back to the airport in that grand limousine of yours ill drop you off and the driver can take me back home leary sat in the parlour of the chief of staffs suburban home and the great man listened while his wife served tea and scones did i do right leary asked of course you did murphys a poisonous animal ive no time for him and neither has the army council so what do we do ill have our people check out things in louth although i dont expect much from that so the chief of staff smiled if fergusons on this case with sean dillon he smiled well for once were on the same side sean can do our dirty work for us at the airport hannahs limousine drove into the hangar where lacey and parry waited the gulfstream was outside in the rain as hannah and devlin got out the garda police car returned and malone emerged liam you old sod he said and stuff you too devlin said genially and they shook hands malone said anything come up hannah looked uncertain and devlin said go on hes on your side she told him about the meeting with leary malone said so anything murphys involved with certainly isnt official with the ira what about this thing with sean regan she asked not a word and id have known so somebodys playing silly buggers devlin said hannah nodded ill have to sort that out when i get back she held out a hand liam youre a treasure hell you can do better than that girl he kissed her take care and tell sean to watch his back thats something hes good at goodbye superintendent lacey and parry were already inside and flight sergeant madoc gave her a hand up the steps the door closed the engines turned over the gulfstream moved away a hell of a woman malone said you can say that again devlin smiled now you can dismiss your car join me in my luxurious limousine that the good superintendent has loaned me and well return to the irish hussar where you can buy me a very large bushmills me in that hotbed of republican gunmen i seem to recall that your younger brother fergus was one we dont talk about that as i said the irish hussar devlin smiled it will do my reputation no end of good being seen in the company of the police a great comfort to me the gulfstream climbed steadily out over the irish sea and hannah called ferguson on her codex four ah there you are how did it go she brought him up to date regan included so there you are sir we should have been told there is supposed to be interdepartmental cooperation not with the secret intelligence service as long as simon carter is deputy director leave it with me he sat there at his desk thinking about it then picked up the phone and spoke to dillon who was in the outer office with blake get in here ive had the superintendent on the line and we could have a problem dillon and blake listened as ferguson related hannah bernsteins adventures when he was finished blake said this is surely unacceptable one major intelligence department hugging secrets to itself that could be of possible crucial importance to others yes well carters always been good at doing his own thing and to hell with anyone else seems to me its time to remind carter ferguson said that the particular circumstances of my position as head of the prime ministers personal security service give me extraordinary powers including over him that id love to see dillon told him ferguson smiled picked up his phone and dialled a number ah that you carter look somethings come up and i need to see you i want your input on something before i speak to the prime minister yes good ill see you at the grenadier in st jamess in thirty minutes nothing like being decisive blake said well as you yanks say you aint seen nothing yet order the car dillon ill find a warrant or two and well be on our way the grenadier was a pleasant traditional london pub with oldfashioned dark oak booths carter was already there in a corner sipping a glass of sherry a small palefaced man with white hair he reacted angrily at the sight of dillon really ferguson ive told you before i object to this murderous swines presence well take it up with the prime minister he employs him god save your honour dillon said cheerfully its a blessing the grand man like yourself allows me in the same room oh go to hell ferguson said youll remember blake johnson yes the american carter offered a reluctant hand and turned to ferguson so what is this an ira renegade named brendan murphys up to no good and i need to know what it is nonsense thats old hat ferguson murphy isnt a problem any longer not since the peace process overwhelmed the land its the great liar you are dillon told him and turned to blake this is the deputy director of the security services a faceless man who never worked in the field himself damn you you irish swine carter was furious now thats a racist remark dillon said i could take you to the tribunal exactly ferguson agreed and as my sainted mother was irish then as a halfirishman i take it very personally id say youve just insulted his mothers memory blake put in could we get on with it dillon asked you lifted a man named sean regan at heathrow three weeks ago when his plane to dublin was diverted because of fog why dont be stupid dillon he shot a military policeman in londonderry a couple of years ago and fled the policeman nearly died so youre going to stand regan up on trial at the old bailey ferguson asked we might but you wont because of the peace process were letting them out of prison now not banging them up carter was strangely confused come on ferguson were in the hands of our political masters not as far as im concerned were in the hands of the law the truth is youre holding regan to squeeze anything you can out of him in case it may be of future use so what not any more where are you holding him wandsworth carter answered as a reflex not any longer ferguson produced a paper from his inside pocket thats a warrant from me as head of the pms security squad authorizing me to as quaint legal language has it take possession of one sean regan carter was outraged now look here ferguson no you look here the difference is that i did serve in the field i was an eighteenyearold second lieutenant in the hook in korea in fiftytwo and ive seen more villains here than youve had breakfasts so dont argue just countersign the order heres my pen he offered it and carter took it hand shaking and signed the document my turn will come ferguson i dont think so ferguson blew on the ink now go away carter suddenly looked helpless got up and stumbled out blake said why is it i dont feel sorry for him because he isnt worth it ferguson said so gentlemen wandsworth prison next stop ferguson dillon and blake waited in the interview room at wandsworth until the door was opened and the kind of prison officer who looked as if hed been a sergeant in a guards regiment pushed regan in dillon said good man yourself sean he turned to the others always gave us a problem the two of us being sean regan said jesus is that you dillon as ever was come to take you away from your cell and the stench of the lavatory buckets this is brigadier charles ferguson your new boss the other fella is a yank and fbi so watch it what in the hell is going on ferguson turned to the prison officer give us a moment certainly sir the man went out and dillon said brendan murphy we know youve been part of his outfit regan was thrown but tried to brazen it out i havent seen brendan in years so carter didnt manage to wheedle anything out of you ive said i dont know what youre talking about dont waste my time ferguson told him you shot a military policeman in derry two years ago and fled to the states since then youve worked for murphy in europe its a lie dillon said dont be stupid you shot a peeler all right he didnt die but at the old bailey youll pull ten years for attempted murder imagine wandsworth or maybe parkhurst year after year youd be afraid to take a shower no regan was shaken mr carter said if i cooperated i wouldnt do time yes well unfortunately im in charge now ferguson told him now make your mind up a comfortable safe house where youll fill us in on brendan murphys doings or a very unpleasant future regan in despair said brendan would cut me to pieces hes a sadist which is why well have to take good care of you he nodded to dillon who knocked on the door which opened and the prison officer appeared ferguson took his warrant out take this prisoner to his cell allow him to collect his belongings then present this document to the governor authorizing his release into my custody certainly brigadier regan was pushed out and ferguson turned to dillon and blake so we take him to holland park where you dillon will squeeze out the last drop of juice my pleasure brigadier dillon said they delivered regan to holland park and drove in through the electronic gates the security guards wore neat navy blue blazers and flannel slacks nursing home what is this regan asked its a fortress ferguson told him and the gentlemen in blazers are all military police theres no way out of here as youll find for yourself he turned to dillon let helen settle him in and feed him you and blake stay ill be back his daimler drove away they took regan up the steps between them his wrists still manacled the door opened and a very large man appeared mr dillon sir another one for you sergeant miller one sean regan he shot a royal military policeman in derry two years ago that would be fred dalton millers face was like stone he survived but had to take a medical discharge oh ill take good care of you mr regan he reached for regans left shoulder with a hand the size of a meat plate and helen black came down the hall stairs is this the prisoner sergeant miller miller got his feet together yes maam good room ten unpack him then well have sandwiches and tea in the parlour as you say maam regan turned what is this whos she sergeant major black and dont be a male chauvinist regan dillon said she shot two provos in derry and holds the military cross fuck you dillon thats bad language in front of a lady we cant have that can we sergeant he asked miller we certainly cant sir miller squeezed regans left arm very hard up we go theres a good gentleman blake said now what oh they have a canteen a kitchen we wont starve dillon smiled well sort regan out later upstairs regan was astounded he had a decent bedroom a bathroom a view of the garden even if it was through barred windows he even had a fresh shirt blazer and slacks like the guards miller took him downstairs to a small sitting room a gas fire flickering in the hearth there was soup ham sandwiches and a glass of dry white wine miller stood by the wall enigmatic regan slightly euphoric at the difference from wandsworth said could i have another glass of wine of course sir miller poured the glass of chablis and behind the mirror ferguson dillon hannah who had just arrived and helen black watched ferguson said you all know the story by now this is a bad business so we make sure he talks id like you to go in sergeant major and you dillon facts thats what i need certainly sir helen black nodded to sean good guy bad guy suit you sean nothing better takes me back to my days at the national theatre yes you have told us that one before lets do it she led the way out but follow my lead shall i leave maam miller asked as they stepped into the room no i might need you sergeant her voice was different and very hard this is a provisional ira gunman he crippled fred dalton do you think fred was his first i doubt it maam miller said coldly right but id like you to manacle him sergeant once a killer always a killer certainly maam now look here regan protested just hold out your wrists and be a good boy regan was sweating and very very worried hed had three weeks in wandsworth with the lavatory bucket the twiceaweek showers the unwelcome attentions of certain wildeyed prisoners and others basic english criminals who didnt like the ira the contrast of his treatment at the safe house spoke for itself in a way hed thought he was going to be all right but now he had this woman who looked like his elder sister acting like the gestapo she unbuttoned her jacket revealing the holstered colt now then lets get started roper had joined the group on the other side of the mirror shes really very good outstanding blake agreed and still wont take a commission ferguson said you cant buy her sir hannah put in i know ferguson sighed very depressing and then helen black started to work the change was astonishing this pleasant decent englishwoman seemed to take on a new persona ive been fighting people like you for years the bomb and the bullet women and kids you couldnt care less i shot dead two of your bastards in derry they were parking a van with fifty pounds of semtex on board outside a nurses hostel well we couldnt have that could we i took a bullet in the left thigh got the bastard who did it then sat up and got his friend in the back as he ran away regan was terrified for christs sake what kind of woman are you she grabbed his jaw and shook his head painfully from side to side the apache indians used to give their prisoners to their women to go to work on im that kind of woman excellent ferguson said she should be at the national theatre herself you crippled a comrade of mine fred dalton she took out her colt and touched him between the eyes these are hollowpoints you scum i pull this trigger and your brains are on the wall for gods sake no regan cried dillon caught her wrist and turned the gun no sergeant major this isnt the way she turned as if in fury ill be back she walked out regan was shaking dillon said to miller uncuff him sergeant he isnt going anywhere as you say sir miller got out a key and unlocked the manacles dillon opened his old silver cigarette case took out two cigarettes lit them and gave regan one there you go just like in now voyager regan was shaking what in the hell are you talking about never mind sean ive a weakness for old movies now listen me i got smart i could have faced a serb firing squad but ferguson is an extraordinarily powerful man he saved my life and in return i dropped working for the glorious cause and work for him instead which means im alive regan was trembling and dillon turned to miller a large brandy sergeant certainly sir miller opened a cupboard and returned with a glass which regan emptied at one throw he looked up at dillon what do you want whats best for you look fergusons in charge now and you did shoot that fella dalton peace process or not hell make you stand up in court if he wants to on the other side of the mirror ferguson said in you go sergeant major helen black went back into the sitting room a document in one hand all right ive had enough its back to wandsworth for you you bastard regan simply fell apart for gods sake tell me what you want just tell me excellent roper said pure gestapo they used physical abuse much less than people realized didnt need to they just messed with their heads ferguson said to hannah we wont overwhelm him he turned to roper you and blake stay here you come in with me and do your scotland yard bit superintendent ferguson walked in with hannah and said to miller give him another brandy sergeant sir miller did as he was told and regan took the glass with shaking hands and drained it do i have a deal that depends on what you have for me regan looked at dillon who said the brigadiers a hard man sean but a moralist if he says it he means it hannah said mr regan im detective superintendent bernstein of special branch id be interested to know if you can assist us in our inquiries regarding the activities of one brendan murphy regan said what do you want to know i understand theres an underground concrete bunker somewhere in county louth semtex machine guns mortars dillon said enough to start a civil war where is it sean regan said close to kilbeg jesus son there are kilbegs all over ireland well this one is in louth like the superintendent says just south of the border in the republic and south of dundalk bay near dunany point very remote i know that area dillon said you wouldnt last long dillon theyre a funny lot strangers stand out like a sore thumb ferguson said lets be specific when i fled to the states i was helped by a wealthy irish american group who were a bit radical didnt approve of peace i brokered a big financial deal for brendan the idea was to prepare for the future the next war which explains the bunker ferguson said but where did the arms come from dillon asked behind the mirror roper was making notes oh that was a mafia connection brendan had worked with them in europe a fella called jack fox fronting for the solazzo family hannah said well i always figured he was fronting for himself he supplied the arms anything else hannah asked lebanon for example christ is there nothing you dont know get on with it dillon said murphy was trained in libya years ago has strong arab contacts can even get by with the language enough to order a meal anyway so ferguson asked well fox controls the solazzos drug operations in russia so he has big contacts murphy has the arab link which arab link regan hesitated saddam iraq thats nice dillon said whats intended theres a freighter down from the black sea next week called the fortuna if its on time its due at a place called al shariz south of beirut next tuesday dillon took over russian crew no arab all army of god and the cargo regan hesitated come on whats the bloody cargo hammerheads there was a pause and hannah turned to ferguson hammerheads sir the door opened and blake entered sorry brigadier but i know all about those theyre shortrange missiles mounted on a tripod that only take two minutes to erect their range is three hundred miles nucleartipped they wouldnt take out israel or jordan completely but tel aviv wouldnt look too good ferguson turned to regan have you told me the truth told me everything regan hesitated again when the boat gets in the fortuna brendan will be on board fox meets them gets paid in gold five million dollars or pounds dillon asked how the fuck would i know paid on the boat is what i heard because they want to arrange another consignment a month later and all this is true ferguson asked yes damn you ferguson turned to helen black and miller send him back to his room they took regan out between them and roper came in after they left ive had a thought he said ive got details of foxs gulfstream its parked at heathrow as i recall let me check its movements they followed him to his ground floor suite where all his equipment had been set up roper started on the computer fingers deft on the keys he grunted fox has a slot booked out of heathrow for monday morning destination beirut wonderful dillon said regan was telling the truth so what now sir hannah asked ferguson said we cant send in the sas and we do have other business with fox something more subtle is needed hannah said the israelis wouldnt like this brigadier exactly what i was thinking ferguson turned to dillon you went to beirut the other year with the superintendent here stayed at the al bustan how could i forget it it overlooks some excellent roman ruins you remember my man there walid khasan very well lebanese christian he and the superintendent got on rather well which is not surprising considering that he was actually major gideon cohen of mossad lieutenant colonel now had a nice sister anya i remember a lieutenant captain now and there was another one what was his name captain moshe levy major everything goes up in the world dillon yes i think colonel cohen might be interested ill give him a call lieutenant colonel gideon cohen wore uniform only on occasion sitting in his office now at the top of a secluded building in tel aviv he was wearing a white shirt and linen slacks all very unmilitary for a mossad colonel fortynine years of age he had olive skin and hair that was still black and down to his shoulders his sister captain anya shamir sat at a corner desk working a computer shed been a widow since her husbands death on the golan heights in the other corner major moshe levy sat at a second computer he was in uniform because hed had a report to make at army headquarters and wore khaki shirt and slacks paratroopers wings and decorations the phone on gideon cohens desk rang a voice said this is ferguson are you coded i am my dear charles of course i am cohen waved to anya and moshe ferguson from london he pressed the audio button on his telephone charles old boy dont call me old boy just because you went to sandhurst im glad to say i still outrank you something special charles something rotten in the state of lebanon tell me which ferguson did when he was finished cohen said hammerheads we cant have that jerusalem wouldnt look too good after one of those exactly charles i need to consider this what you mean is you need to talk to the general your uncle im afraid so thats no problem but this is a black one gideon keep it close in his penthouse office general arnold cohen head of mossads section one the group with special responsibility for activities in arab areas listened gravely when his nephew was finished he said hammerheads this is very serious so what do we do call an air strike on this boat the fortuna in lebanese waters come on gideon were supposed to be nice at the moment while our british and american cousins castigate saddam and hes going to send hammerhead strikes up our backside his sister anya standing with levy by the window said can i make a point uncle of course you can youve gotten away with murder with me ever since you learned to speak so why should this time be different why dont we use dillon uncle hes hell on wheels that one remember that job with him in beirut the other year he was incredible shes right levy put in whats important here is disposing of this fortuna boat and its cargo with a minimum of fuss right so so we make it a smallscale operation with dillon to call on the three of us anya moshe me can handle it in al shariz the right equipment and we can blow the damn boat to hell hes right gideon cohen said no adverse publicity no air strikes i like it the general said get on with it ferguson said fine gideon ill send over dillon also an american colleague blake johnson who works directly for the president youll find him most useful ill put dillon on a moment later dillon said in bad hebrew how are you you lying dog dillon we seem to have business together they switched into english im not sure how well do this dillon said if were to blow this fortuna out of the water well need mines semtex some scuba equipment well take care of it well keep it lowkey myself levy my sister with you and this american thats five we dont want to draw attention although things have changed since you operated in beirut my friend its not quite the war zone it used to be people are trying to build up the infrastructure again tourism and so on where would fox stay beirut no theres an old moorish palace in al shariz which has been refurbished as a hotel id say hell be there its called the golden house no good for us then no problem well come up on a motor yacht like tourists you and your friends can stay on board we cant exactly sit in the bar at the golden house though we dont want fox to know its us itd be much better if he thought it was an israeli job do you recall my sister anya how could i forget she played a lady of the night better than a lady of the night enough to ensnare this fox dillon laughed enough to ensnare friend fox you and johnson levy and myself well stay on our boat the pamir well out of the way anya can squeeze what she can out of the guy well send the fortuna down when were ready you israelis are such morally committed people dillon said but youll sink that boat crew and all without a flicker not even half a flicker cohen said see you soon dillon hung up and ferguson said so here we go again hannah bernstein said what about me sir not this one superintendent dillon and blake plus our friends from mossad are enough what id like you to do is get a little more basic with friend regan as regards the bunker in county louth he turned to roper im sure the major here will be more than willing to help a pleasure sir roper said sorry hannah ill have to love you and leave you dillon turned to blake and smiled a strange excitement there here we go old buddy back to the war zone again lebanon al shariz brendan murphy leaned over the rail of the small coastal freighter the fortuna and watched the distant lights of syria the ship was italianregistered and had definitely seen better days but under its battered exterior the essential bits the engines were in excellent condition theyd left the black sea two days earlier and had made good time the man who approached him wearing a seamans reefer coat held a cup of coffee in one hand which he passed to him his name was dermot kelly and he had unfashionably irish blond hair and a hard pocked face he lit a cigarette jesus brendan theyre all fugging arabs this crew if i light up in the saloon they glare at me lucky i brought a bottle on board fundamentalists murphy said army of god this lot theyre just waiting for death in the service of allah so they can go to paradise and have eternal pleasure and all those women they must be crazy why you mean were catholics and were right and theyre muslims and theyre wrong come off it dermot an arab in a reefer coat the same as kellys came down a ladder from the bridge he was the captain and his name was abdul sawar hows it going brendan demanded excellent well be on time well thats good sawar said any problems well i miss bacon and eggs for breakfast kelly told him we do our best mr kelly but some things are not possible well youd probably have a problem in reverse in dublin kelly told him exactly sawar went back up the ladder and murphy said dont stir the pot dermot you cant expect good irish bacon on an italian boat crewed by arabic fundamentalists off the coast of syria all right so ill just think of the money the gold dermot the gold speaking of which well check it out he led the way to the stern of the ship and went down a companionway to a rear saloon there were two cargo boxes wrapped in sacking dermot lit a cigarette they look like shire to me five million in gold brendan how do we know because saddam wants another cargo next month so he wont screw around with this one do you think its all going to work like a swiss watch fox will be on a plane well offload the gold and take it to the airport at beirut where the right officials have been bribed the plane is routed to dublin but it puts down at an old air force base in louth on the way we unload our half and fox carries on announcing a midair change of destination where will he go supposedly heathrow but on the way there when the plane is in uncontrolled air space hell put down on this estate nearby in cornwall called hellsmouth theres an raf aerodrome there from the second world war the runways a bit rough but it can take a plane like the gulfstream sounds good to me brendan and me dermot the other man smiled took a half bottle of paddy whiskey from his pocket unscrewed the top and drank deeply he passed it across well heres to irish bacon and eggs soda bread and rain he smiled i miss the rain brendan the good irish rain gideon cohen his sister and moshe levy had left a yachting marina on the coast near haifa in a fortyfoot boat of a kind regularly rented by tourists interested in diving there were stocks of air bottles in the stern bunks for seven people below a good kitchen gallery every convenience cohens passport was british in the name of julian grant his sister and levy had become a mr and mrs frobisher also british their background being impeccable and lebanon desperate for tourist money theyd had no trouble getting the necessary visas and pushed towards al shariz through the late afternoon cohen was at the wheel levy lounging beside him anya looking out of the halfopen window so lets go over it her brother said you and moshe book into the golden palace and do remember moshe this is my sister youre sharing a suite with how could i forget colonel fox is booked in with these two hoods falcone and russo you make yourself available in the bar anya just in case theres information available oh dear she said here i go again stage six at mgm playing the whore her brother smiled and hugged her with his spare arm as he steered no the goodlooking whore he shook his head this is a bad one little sister we cant make a mistake well at least we have dillon he laughed out loud my god yes the poor old fortuna doesnt know whats going to hit it on the plane on the way to beirut dillon said to blake so were interested in establishing an electronics factory a joint angloamerican project jobs for all three days in and out no problems blake asked certainly not theyre still trying to build up the country again while surrounded by people who want to cut each others balls off so we join cohens boat look like recreational scuba divers and send the fortuna to the bottom hammerheads the lot dillon said and the crew murdering fanatics if they didnt want the risk they shouldnt have joined but dillon theres five million pounds in gold on board yes isnt that as ferguson would say delicious it also goes to the bottom a fabulous expression of conspicuous consumption he waved to flight sergeant madoc bring me another bushmills im celebrating imagining how jack fox will feel fox booked into the golden house with falcone and russo he had a nice suite on the first floor marble scattered rugs all very moorish he felt good the colosseum was a bad memory and his lawyers seemed to think they might be able to fix things whether they did or not the gold from the fortuna was a certainty added to that the cash murphy owed him in ireland from irishamerican arms orders would take the pressure right off everything okay signore falcone asked couldnt be better tonights the night aldo gold theres nothing like it its still the one commodity you can rely on youve checked with the harbourmaster yes signore the fortuna is due in at ten a crew of twelve all arab it left the black sea the day before yesterday where will they anchor on the pier no its full a few hundred yards out in the entrance to the bay excellent ill have a shower then dinner ill see you later their plane landed in early evening dillon and johnson booked in as russel and gaunt and took a taxi to al shariz on the way dillon called cohen on his mobile lafayette we are here im saying that on behalf of blake well were here too lower yacht basin pamir pier three see you soon dillon switched off his phone and relayed the information to the driver on the pamir cohen looked through a pair of nightstalker glasses and watched the fortuna drop anchor he said to anya off you go all i want to know is what hes up to it could give us a clue to his movements sure she said another thing he was strangely awkward duty is duty but youre my beloved sister dont get close to this one hes bad news she kissed his cheek hey little brother dont worry she booked into the hotel changed then went down to the bar resplendent in a black mini dress her dark hair to her shoulders and looking terrific she sat at the bar and fox over by the window falcone and russo at the next table saw her at once he nodded to falcone got up went to the bar and sat next to her hi there an american she smiled what are you doing here investigating tourist prospects he said glibly what about you oh im over from london with my husband on the same errand your husband fox was disappointed yes well hes been called to tel aviv left me on my own for three days fox put his hand on hers thats terrible a nicelooking lady like you all on her own but youve got me now have you eaten no well join me which she did for a sumptuous meal part arab part european and lots of cristal champagne she endured his questing hand on her thigh and waited finally falcone who had stood by the window answered a mobile came over and whispered fox squeezed her thigh listen ive got to go what a pity it was ten oclock he said ill be a couple of hours will you still be here of course ill see you he went out with falcone she followed and stood in the shadows of a palm tree and shrubbery while they talked on the terrace the fortuna is in signore good we offload the gold in two hours theres just one thing i dont understand falcone said these hammerheads are short range absolutely so if were talking iraq im puzzled i mean were off the coast of syria so they cant be fired from iraq aldo you dont get the point theyre very easy to set up and fire the fortuna is going to be a gun platform the entire crew as you know is army of god all they want to do is take out tel aviv jerusalem theyre funny about after all its the second most important muslim city my god theyre animals these people depends on your point of view now lets get moving anya called her brother on her mobile and relayed the information gideon said right get out of there now ill expect you within the next half hour on the pamir dillon blake cohen and levy were sitting under the stern awning having a look at the harbour chart when anya arrived she paid off the taxi and stepped over the rail jesus woman dillon told her you look like page sixtyfour in vogue magazine you should be a young jewish mother having babies and making your husbands life miserable instead youre still going around shooting bad guys its my nature dillon whos your friend blake johnson former fbi and works for the president now so lets have some respect here she shook hands with blake nice to meet you she said and turned to her brother as i told you i overheard fox talking to one of his men on the terrace the gold is definitely on board as well as the hammerheads the worrying thing is that the boat is to be used as a gun platform with tel aviv a possible target not if we blow that thing out of the water i couldnt put it better myself told him and sooner rather than later blake put in the boats here and fox will want it offloaded as soon as possible we know from roper that he has a return slot booked for seven oclock tomorrow right then lets get on with it cohen turned to dillon how do we do this well you remember in ninetyfour in beirut when we blew up the alexandrene with all that plutonium on board you mean you blew up the alexandrene anya said and how did you do that blake asked took a shallow dive went up the anchor chain created a little mayhem dropped a block of semtex in the engine room and that was that cohen said sounds good to me a oneman show blake said i dont like it blake vietnam was a long time ago stuff that kind of talk sean we go in together dillon sighed all right its your funeral he looked out as orange flickered on the horizon and in the distance the security lights gleamed on the fortuna lets get on with it time to save the free world again falcone russo and fox went out to the fortuna in a water taxi and pulled up to a steel stairway at the side of the ship fox told the boatman to wait and led the way up to where brendan murphy dermot kelly and captain sawar waited fox and brendan embraced youre looking good murphy said and you old buddy and youll have an even broader smile when you know whats on shore and on its way to my plane come and have a look murphy led the way down to the stern saloon where the two cargo boxes waited five million jack he said it makes me feel god is on my side thats because youre irish you daft bastard fox said lets go and have a drink and then well offload this lot ive got a water taxi waiting beside the pamir an inflatable waited dillon and blake aboard in black dive suits with a single air bottle each weight belts around their waists each had a dive bag with a browning hipower with a carswell silencer inside dillon also carried two threepound blocks of semtex with threeminute timer pencils gideon cohen said to his sister and levy ill take them out you wait here and be ready for sea anya hesitated then picked up an uzi submachine gun and stepped in beside dillon and blake not this time you might need backup and moshe is better with the boat than i am cohen sighed youre a great trial to me okay take the nightstalker and monitor what happens they moved out into the harbour and floated to a halt a hundred yards from the fortuna dillon said here we go and pulled down his diving mask and reached for his mouthpiece at only ten feet there was enough illumination from the security lights to give the water a kind of glow he paused beside the steel stairway released his jacket and air tank and took the browning from his dive bag and cocked it his face halfcovered by his diving hood he surfaced blake beside him and an arab seaman appeared at the top of the stairway dillon shot him instantly the browning near noiseless tumbling him into the water and started up blake somewhere behind him had another problem the arab who crewed the water taxi had been shocked to see dillon surface and kill the seaman he tossed his cigarette into the water stood up and blake with no options had to shoot him on deck it was quiet only for a moment then voices called on the bridge captain sawar moved out onto the flying bridge a machine gun in his hands selim are you there what is it dillon called in arabic its mossad you dog weve come for you sawar fired his machine gun blindly down into the darkness of the deck and blake scrambling up beside dillon fired back shattering a window up there fox and falcone and russo who were on the bridge ducked down fox said what the hell gives israelis someone down there said mossad cover me dillon said to blake and ran crouching through the dark to the engine room hatch pulled it back took out the two blocks of semtex from his dive bag activated the timing pencils then dropped them down and closed the hatch as dillon ran back to rejoin blake who was firing up at the bridge sawar made a bad mistake he switched on more security lights dillon and blake ducked behind a lifeboat as sawar fired his machine gun again and there were cries from members of his crew as they surged onto the aft deck from below all armed sawar fired repeatedly falcone and russo joining in and anya crouched in the inflatable sprayed the deck and bridge with fire from her uzi sawar took a bullet in the head and went down fox and his two men crouched falcone with blood on his face from a glass splinter now get out of it blake dillon said theyre threeminute timers remember take the port side theres another lifeboat there that will give us some protection anya looked through the nightstalker i can see them theyre sliding to the port rail she said to moshe levy well they would dillon will have planted the semtex theres maybe two minutes left then get moving he pushed the engine up to top speed and went round the prow anya still firing up on the side deck and bridge and dillon and blake jumped fox peering out of a side window saw them go saw the inflatable surge on anya tossed a line dillon and blake grabbed it and the inflatable vanished into the darkness theyve jumped ship signore falcone said they didnt stay long and fox his senses sharpened by years of hard living jumped to an immediate conclusion thats because they accomplished what they came here to do lets get out of here now he scrambled down the ladder and they followed running into murphy and kelly on the side deck what the hell is going on murphy demanded mossad theyve planted explosives move it christ they went down the steel stairway fast and crowded into the water taxi fox started the engine falcone and russo threw the dead arab into the water and fox took the boat away fast they were perhaps a hundred yards away when the explosion took place the deck lifted the bridge buckled flames shot up into the night two or three men jumped from the stern then the fortuna seemed to break in half and went down very fast indeed there was burning oil faint screams shall we go back signore falcone asked what for all i want to do is get back to the airport and get out of this fucking place take over he lit a cigarette as they moved towards the pier murphy said its all gone not just the missiles but the gold i know isnt life hell fox had an insane desire to laugh but how did they know this is the middle east brendan the israelis have had considerable experience at giving the arabs a hard time you think they cant find out what saddam is up to you think their friends everywhere from london to washington cant find out he tossed his cigarette into the water on top of that the bastards can fight all that gold i cant believe it well better get used to it back to heathrow now no point sticking around here do you and kelly want a lift no were going to paris then dublin they crashed onto the pier fox had left a limousine with an arab driver waiting he said im going back to the golden house to pack and move on do you want a lift there at least no well get a taxi and go right to the airport no luggage you lost it all on the boat theyll think thats funny i know this place theres a latenight bazaar well pick up some stuff no problem good they moved away from the others to the end of the pier murphy said christ i needed that gold so did i fox said so what will you do ive something laid on in london that should take care of things jesus do you need a hand not this time what about you back to kilbeg to reflect im not broke you still owe me on a lot of that equipment in the bunker i know youve got at least a million on hold there i know i know a few bank raids will take care of the expenses and the war will start again soon anyway fox held out his hand good luck stay in touch i will they went back to the limousine fox falcone and russo got in and it drove away murphy smelled the warm air the aroma of spices disgusting this place dermot lets go home to some civilization blake had a bullet crease on his right shoulder anya gave him first aid on the pamir there was a certain jubilation dillon and he changed then went into the saloon moshe levy was pouring wine into glasses and anya came in from a shower in a towelling robe drying her hair wheres gideon dillon asked making a phone call gideon was talking to his uncle at his apartment in tel aviv general cohen listened and slapped his thigh marvellous what a coup dillon and blake johnson are returning to london soon well tell them they go with my blessing and anya she is well she should get a medal she was wonderful mossad doesnt give medals you know that but i will give you all a nice dinner in beirut fox falcone and russo boarded their plane discreetly observed by lacey and parry who had been supplied with photos the plane rose steadily to fifty thousand feet and turned into the mediterranean russo sat at the back and a woman flight attendant offered drinks and a menu fox waved her away falcone sat opposite him now what signore i dont know aldo ive just lost a fortune murphys lost a lot and he owes me god knows how much for those arms in that bunker in county louth the colosseum is closed down he took a deep breath weve only got the jagos left and that white diamond company job ten million four to them leaves me with six the attendant handed falcone a vodka martini he savoured it and said why not the full ten signore why not all the proceeds russo and i could handle it itd go a long way to making up what you just lost fox tasted his glass of champagne you really are a very bad man aldo but i like it falcone smiled recalling his conversation in the washroom at the airport with don marco on his mobile hed recounted the whole sorry affair don marco had said it just gets worse if i didnt know better id say it was dillon and johnson again but you say it was the israelis no doubt about it they identified themselves its like he was snakebit all right aldo watch out for him okay remembering falcone said the jagos theyre animali signore as i say let russo and me take care of them its certainly an interesting thought fox smiled well see in london ferguson listened to dillon on his codex and nodded what an absolutely marvellous result our friends at mossad have performed magnificently but you and blake havent done too badly either why brigadier praise from you is praise indeed dont let it go to your head dillon well see you soon he sat there by the fire in his flat thinking about it then called for his daimler got a coat on and told his driver to take him to pine grove where he knew hannah bernstein was working on sean regan helen black greeted him and took him to ropers suite where the major sat at one of his screens regan on one side hannah on the other well children youll be delighted to know that al shariz has resounded to a most satisfactory explosion the ss fortuna crewed by army of god fanatics is no more not only the hammerheads but the five million in gold which was supposed to have been split between murphy and fox has gone down thanks to czechoslovakias gift to the world semtex in one hundred fathoms of water holy mary regan said a moment brigadier roper punched at the keys and checked his screen two hundred fathoms actually theres a trench in that harbour be a little difficult to retrieve anyway what next sir hannah asked kilbeg how far have we got oh seans being very cooperative im assembling a ground plan roper said would you like to see no lets wait for dillon and blake he turned to hannah any word from salter no sir i think ill go and see him do you want me to come sir ferguson shook his head no you continue here with regan and the major he turned to helen black how would you fancy an excursion into the london underworld sergeant major why i cant think of anything id like more brigadier good lets be on our way then and ferguson led the way out london salter and billy were in the blind beggar one of londons most famous pubs in its heyday the haunt of gangsters such as the kray brothers the richardsons and others it was crowded and busy at that time in the evening although a lot of the crowd were tourists for organized trips were very much a part of the scene salter waved to a small man an albino in a black tee shirt and suit one of the best lock and safe men in the business billy manchester charlie ford the big black guy with him is amber frazer very good with his hands though mind you hes got a brain theyre an item what do you mean an item billy asked you know gay homosexual billy shook his head well all i can say is theyre missing out on a damn good thing takes all sorts billy well have him over he beckoned and ford approached with frazer by his side charlie my old son and amber salter shook hands my nephew billy watch yourselves hes a right villain arent we all ford said join us for a drink i might be able to put a bit of business your way hed already heard that ford and his friends were booked up but was testing the water what are you suggesting harry ford asked well im organizing something big i wont say what but id need a top man with your skills and lets face it charlie you are the top man when are we talking about next couple of weeks no way harry i mean next month could be all right but im booked right now well good for you its a nice one i hope very nice harry very special say no more what i dont know i cant talk about he kept the faqade going what about phil shapiro got turned over last week theyre holding him at west end central you could try hughie belov mind you he claims to be retired but he taught me a lot depends on what youre offering thanks for the idea salter told him at that moment the jago brothers walked in and stood at the end of the bar ford said got to go old son see you around take care salter told him ford and frazer joined the jagos billy said that settles it id say yeah but we still need to know exactly what theyre up to how do we do that the oldfashioned way follow them to see where it leads come on baxter and hall waited in the range rover parked up the street salter said dont bother with me ill get a taxi you wait with billy the jagos are inside with manchester charlie ford when they come out follow them youve got those night glasses in the glove compartment joe the russian things sure have harry get on with it then and salter walked away it was half an hour later that the jagos emerged with ford and frazer they went up the street to a ford station wagon got inside and drove away to billys surprise they were aiming for home territory wapping there was plenty of late evening traffic and baxter stayed well back the station wagon finally turned into a narrow road between old warehouses mostly refurbished st richards dock baxter said they turned all the old warehouses into offices and such last ear any housing apartments billy asked no then what the hell are they up to pull in at the end of the street and give me those glasses baxter parked in the shadow of a wall and they got out billy focused the glasses as the jagos and the other two got out and went down stone steps to the shingle beach beside the river they started to walk and billy watched for they were clearly seen in the strange green glow of the glasses the tides out hall said otherwise theyd be swimming theyve disappeared billy said well wait it was ten minutes later that the jagos and the others reappeared and walked back along the beach they climbed the steps got in the station wagon and drove away okay billy said get the torch from the range rover joe and well take a look he found what he was looking for with no trouble an arched entrance to a tunnel dark and wet lichen growing over the ancient stoneware there was a damp river smell to everything he led the way probing the darkness with the torchlight and came to a huge rusting iron grille gate there was a lock everything corroded tight so what are they up to baxter asked god knows but well find out back to harry and he turned and led the way out in his personal booth at the end of the bar at the dark man harry salter sipped beer and listened st richards dock ive got a piece of that billy he called to dora and she came round the bar he put an arm round her waist have a look in the file in my office love st richards dock anything for you harry yes i know that only just get me the bleeding file she was back in a couple of minutes he opened the file took out a plan and checked it two merchant banks estate agent property developers two restaurants the white diamond company he sat back jesus christ no they couldnt i mean a place like that these days its stateoftheart security the bleeding works i cant believe this strangely it was billy who said just take it slowly harry lets consider what they were doing on the beach in that tunnel youre right billy youre learning he turned to hall have a look in the saloon bar see if that old geezer handy greens in he usually is used to be a barge captain theres nothing he doesnt know about the river more than me and thats saying something hall went off and returned a moment later with an ancient and wizened man all shrivelled up inside a reefer coat and jeans salter said handy my old son come and join us for a drink i think you might be able to help me anything harry anything i can do you know that the thing is handy ive got a problem you know st richards dock course i do harry theyve redeveloped all the warehouses office all that finished it last year i used to work the boats the old sailing barges from there when i was a kid theres an interesting thing harry said billy happened to be on the beach there and noticed the entrance to a tunnel well he would if the tide was out if the tides in the entrance is covered its called st richards force what the hell is that supposed to mean he took the large brandy dora brought and gave it to the old man oh its a medieval thing force meaning pressure and when the tide goes up the water goes in that tunnel like you wouldnt believe handy swallowed his brandy greedily the thing is harry its an interest of mine london under the ground theres tunnels from roman times norman times tudor sewers then the victorians covered everything up i mean all these modern multistorey buildings and office blocks havent the slightest idea of how many tunnels and sewers go through their foundations and you do always been an interest of mine and st richards dock riddled harry its like a honeycomb down there are you sure harry ive got old books with maps victorian really salter turned to billy do me a favour billy take handy round to his place and get these books ill phone ferguson tell him what weve got which he did and ferguson alerted on his mobile returned to pine grove an hour later at pine grove handy green sat with roper and showed him some very interesting plans in some very old books roper checked the information then got to work ferguson and salter watched with billy baxter and hall were in the canteen the screen came alive with ground plans extraordinary roper said what is it ferguson asked a network of victorian tunnels and sewers adjacent to the st richards dock infrastructure there are places where youd only need a sledgehammer to smash through victorian brick into the st richards basement so whats that bleeding mean salter demanded roper said let me check the st richards specifications his fingers moved on finally he nodded interesting stateoftheart security but its all external if you come up like a mole youre home free thats it it must be salter said id say roper turned to ferguson brigadier looks like it but when are they going to do it thats the thing he turned to salter and his nephew will you stay on the case we know the place but we need to know the time well i dont think its on tuesday if you follow me not from what manchester charlie ford indicated itll be a week to two weeks well do what you can a pleasure brigadier it makes a change being on the right side for once come on billy well leave and take handy with us tell you what well keep an eye on the beach they left and ferguson said to roper do you have anything for me on county louth ive extracted everything i can from regan from what ive surmised ive done a breakdown on the kilbeg place do you want a quick look if you like when roper was finished ferguson sat there thinking about it a tricky one very but i think it should be done sooner rather than later in view of whats happened id be inclined to agree lets have something in the canteen and wait for dillon and blake just one thing brigadier feel free im an old irish hand and i tell you now theres no way you can drive into that coastal area of county louth and pretend to be tourists yes i can see that youre suggesting a sea approach its the only way show me county down louth the scottish coast roper tapped it up obediently there you go ferguson said what would you say about oban on the west coast there would that be a suitable point of departure perfect brigadier excellent ferguson took out his mobile and called hannah bernstein at the office dillon not in yet just landed at farley field sir good i want him down here blake too things are moving superintendent were going to make an irish expedition speak to transportation a motor cruiser that kind of thing certainly sir home port oban any equipment dillon needs well call him when he arrives make the meeting here and come yourself im sorry but i may have to put you in harms way again its what im paid for sir dillon and blake wolfed bacon and eggs and listened to ferguson and roper hannah said i think it might be useful if dillon and sergeant major black had another chat with regan sir just to make sure hes being honest a sensible idea ferguson said lets do it they went up to ropers suite first and he showed them the situation at kilbeg on the screen its very remote a village on the coast population a hundred or so scattered farms hardline catholic republicans you couldnt move an inch without the whole countryside knowing so its got to be by sea ferguson continued dillon nodded thats right well go under cover of darkness do a frogman job if necessary transports already arranged a suitable boat from oban hannah said called the highlander theyll need to know what equipment you want as soon as you can no problem ill draw up a list are you coming blake i sure as hell am also the superintendent ferguson said i want an official police presence dillon sighed at it again hannah trying to get your head blown off what is it guilt get stuffed dillon hey for a nice jewish girl with a cambridge degree that really is elegant she laughed in spite of herself now what oh lets look at the map again roper went over it theres this old abbey which is the entrance and cover but the interesting thing is this rural farmhouse to the east thats an emergency exit regan says they only keep a couple of guys in the bunker as caretakers murphy turns up occasionally hes the local hero fine blake said we go in and blow it to hell ferguson nodded lets have regan in for interrogation you sergeant major black dillon the same variety hall act just in case theres something he forgot when sergeant miller brought in regan dillon was sitting by the fire ah there you are sean they tell me youve been very helpful ive done all ive been asked behind the mirror ferguson blake hannah and roper watched suddenly roper said hes lying the bastards lying how do you know body language instinct i dont know but theres something he hasnt told us right sergeant major ferguson told her put the boot in she burst through the door a moment later boiling over with rage im sick of lies dillon this little sods lying through his teeth there are still things he hasnt told us she took out her silenced colt and miller playing his part caught her wrist no maam thats not the way the colt discharged into the ceiling and regan cried out in terror all right anything anything you want dillon shoved him down into a chair okay weve got kilbeg the bunker the village even the old granite quarry pier below the cliff but what did you leave out regan hesitated and helen black said oh this is a waste of time lets send him back to wandsworth no for gods sake theres something what is iff dillon demanded its the money brendan has one of those safes in the floor of the bunker office hes supposed to have a million pounds in there proceeds of bank raids exploitation that kind of thing so helen black demanded he owes that to fox for arms supplies really dillon said only hes lying he keeps fobbing fox off hes got nearly three million in there dillon almost fell about laughing jesus you mean youre telling me that if we blow the place up well not only be stiffing murphy but also fox thats beautiful he turned to the mirror isnt that a joy brigadier come on in ferguson came in with hannah and blake very naughty regan still playing stupid games yes hes an untrustworthy sod dillon said in the circumstances i think id like to take him along really just in case of problems what if theres more he hasnt told us ferguson nodded yes i take your point would you agree superintendent well shell need to as shell have to take care of the bastard what are you getting aff hannah asked theres no sense in wasting time if you get the quartermaster to fill my order and have the boat ready blake and i will fly up later this afternoon there is an raf base near oban well get things shipshape theyll fly back and pick you up in the morning and do the return journey well do the trip tomorrow afternoon and hit kilbeg tomorrow night youre not wasting time are you ferguson said cant see much point brigadier fine by me theres just one thing dillon said blake took a bullet at al shariz hell its a crease only anya fixed it blake was indignant blake if we do have to go in underwater it isnt on so what youre saying is you want another diver ferguson said its a bit short notice but if i phone marine headquarters they could possibly find someone from the special boat squadron no good they cut their those boys theyd never pass for locals now sas at hereford have plenty of lads who havent seen a barber in months thats so they can go undercover in belfast at a moments notice and look like theyre off a building site dillon smiled that makes sense blake said when you put me in there undercover the other year i recall it was dicey as hell so dillon said ive got another diver in mind who ferguson demanded dillon told him the brigadier laughed helplessly oh i like it i really do do you mind if i come with you and hear him turn you down no problem brigadier itll be the best pub grub in london meanwhile though i want blakes shoulder checked out by daz at rosedene rosedene blake asked a private clinic we use near pine grove we have a very nice man a professor of surgery at london university who shall we say helps us out ferguson said to regan fancy a sea trip to ireland do you i dont have much choice do but already his mind was racing ferguson turned to helen black and miller take him away the superintendent will pick him up tomorrow fine sir miller took regan by the arm and she followed them out ferguson said all right dillon take blake to rosedene the superintendent will phone ahead and make sure daz is there well go back to the office ill meet you for lunch he laughed i cant wait to get his reaction hope hes a patriot people like him usually are brigadier rosedene was an exclusive town house in its own grounds the receptionist greeted dillon like an old friend spoke on the phone and a pleasant middleaged woman in matrons blue came out of her office she had the accent of ulster like dillon and kissed him on the cheek have you been in the wars again sean no martha but he has and he introduced blake well lets get on with it mr daz is waiting mister blake was puzzled in england ordinary physicians are doctor but surgeons are mister dillon smiled and only the english could explain that to you in his case hes also professor she took them along a corridor and opened the door into a wellequipped operating theatre daz in a white coat was sitting at a desk reading some papers a tall cadaverous indian with a ready smile he got up and took dillons hand sean its not you this time what a change no its my friend blake johnson mr johnson a pleasure and what is the problem a superficial gunshot wound i mean its nothing it never is my friend daz turned to the matron under the circumstances martha id rather not have one of the girls in would you be kind enough to assist of course professor ill get ready daz said stay if you want sean blake stripped to his waist stood while daz and martha suitably robed got to work my goodness you have been to the wars daz probed under the left ribs bullet scars are always distinctive another here martha said under the left shoulder vietnam blake said a long time ago but not this i think daz said as martha cut away the pad on the right shoulder he made a face nasty hell its nothing blake told him daz ignored him yes well nothing requires some very careful stitching how many would you say martha fifteen perhaps twenty in the circumstances i dont think a local anaesthetic will do well need a general get doctor hamed for me i know hes here he can assist now look here i dont want to be on my back blake said ive got things to do not if you have a crippled shoulder for the rest of your life martha said do as youre told mr johnson youre not a stupid man she turned to dillon leave him to it check in this afternoon for gods sake sean blake said no problem if youre not fit you can come up to oban tomorrow with hannah and regan at that moment billy salter drove up to st richards dock in the range rover and parked he got out and walked along the embankment to where an old ford van was parked opened the door and got in beside joe baxter who was looking down at the shingle beach through a pair of old binoculars he lowered them what is it billy asked well having nothing to do we checked out that cafe where manchester charlie ford has breakfast the thing is he wasnt only with the big beast go on surprise me connie briggs well thats good hes about the best on any kind of electronic security system in london i know hes a genius who else val french jesus the big expert with the thermal lance cut up those security boxes on that gatwick gold bullion job like sardine cans we all know that so do scotland yard but they couldnt prove it so why are we here they all came down in a toyota van we followed they got out carrying a couple of canvas bags went along the beach the tide being out and went along to the tunnel entrance sams down there now tucked behind that old wreck billy took the binoculars focused them and at that moment manchester charlie ford and the others came out of the tunnel and went back to the steps up to the dock they all got in the toyota and drove away give me the torch and lets take a look let them go billy said the tunnel was damp from the receding early morning tide the brickwork green as billy switched on the torch the rusting iron grille was there as before the only difference was that the huge old lock had gone and the gate responded to a strong heave well well billy said lets take a look they followed the tunnel sloshing through two or three inches of water it seemed to go on forever and there were side tunnels all right billy said enough is enough were under the dock and theres nothing important lets go back they arrived back at the dark man at noon and found salter in his usual booth he listened and nodded okay its on and its got to be the white diamond company ill check with ferguson at that moment ferguson and dillon walked in i cant believe it billy said we were just talking about you and here you are magic billy dillon said its with me being from county down what are you after brigadier salter asked cottage pie for lunch and an indifferent red wine would do for a start yes well weve got news for you billy said and told him ferguson took out his mobile and called roper at pine grove and relayed the information im concerned with timing here its just occurred to me if you could access the white diamond company we might find something is going on leave it with me brigadier ferguson put his phone down so we could be in business gentlemen its an obe for you harry for services to the country fuck off brigadier dora appeared cottage pie love and a bottle of that krug champagne as dillons here she walked away and dillon said its the great man you are harry what are you trying to do you little irish git butter me up actually yes i need a favour what favour i need a master diver and the only one i know on short notice is billy salter was totally shocked youve got to be kidding no my american friend blake took a bullet in the shoulder and wont be too fit im taking a boat into a remote part of the irish coast where theres an underground bunker full of the wrong kind of weapons waiting to be used in the next round of the irish troubles i intend to blow it to hell and as friend fox has a financial interest ill get extra pleasure he turned to billy listen you young dog itll be a good deed in a naughty world are you with me billy had an unholy light in his eyes by god i am dillon these fucks come over and blow up london lets go and blow them up billy his uncle said fergusons phone rang he listened then said fine ill talk later he drank a little champagne that was major roper hes accessed the white diamond companys computer theyre receiving a consignment of topgrade diamonds on thursday ten million pounds worth dillon said so we know where we are he turned harry salter said what the hell were with you excellent dillon smiled its scotland for you billy and a nice sea voyage christ billy said i get seasick well stop at a pharmacist and get you some pills on the way to farley field thatll be three hours from now after which youll be winging your way north ive never been to scotland billy said well well take care of that dillon smiled as dora brought plates of food to the table cottage pie and krug champagne and god help brendan murphy scotland ireland blake was flat out when dillon called at rosedene to check on his condition hannah was with him daz was at the university but martha was there hell be fine but not particularly fit for a while she said and frowned hes not going to get up to any nonsense i hope mr dillon i know what your lot are like and he honestly isnt up to it i know martha i know well take it as it comes im flying off to scotland so keep the superintendent here informed trouble again she asked always is he kissed her cheek oh well she said and gave him the ancient toast may you die in ireland oh thanks very much dillon laughed see you soon he and hannah left on the way to the dark man she said it could be a hard one sean i know and blake wont be up to it frankly in his condition hed be a liability what do you want me to do try and lose him with luck you wont have to do much maybe martha could give him a pill always the practical one arent you hes a good man hannah im the bad one i dont care about that but i do care about him ill never understand you i dont understand me join the club im just passing through hannah id have thought youd have realized that by now dillon phoned ahead and billy was waiting outside the dark man with his uncle baxter and hall harry said i actually care for this young bastard so bringhim back in one piece dillon notice i didnt say try so dont let me down because if you come back alone i get the picture dillon said in you get billy the driver put the case in the boot and billy sat in front nervous and excited christ dillon what have you got me into high adventure billy youll come back and join the marines like hell i will independent spirit me at farley field the departments quartermaster a retired sergeant major waited with his list all loaded mr dillon walthers with carswell silencers three uzi machine pistols with silencers stun grenades and half a dozen of the fragmentation variety in case you have trouble plus the semtex and timers what about diving equipment standard suits and fins as issued to the special boat service our local agent in oban will put six air bottles in the stern rack that should suffice excellent lacey was already in the gulfstream with parry madoc waited at the bottom of the steps dillon kissed hannah on the cheek we who are about to die salute you dont be stupid ill see you tomorrow i know and watch regan hes a devious little sod i thought that was you it was such a stupid remark and instantly regretted but dillon smiled ah the hard woman you are he pushed billy up the steps in front of him madoc followed and closed the door and the gulfstream moved away why hannah whispered why do i say things like that and yet she knew that for his past condemned him all those years as the provisional iras most feared enforcer all the killing she looked up as the gulfstream lifted damn you dillon she said damn you in his suite at pine grove roper trawled the computer and came up with results he checked again then phoned ferguson fox and his two goons are booked into the dorchester for a week anything else murphy and dermot kelly are booked on an air france flight from paris arriving in dublin around what the irish call tea time any idea of the onward destination come on brigadier it must be kilbeg they think hes robin hood up there if you want to check why dont you call in a favour from that chief superintendent malone at the garda special branch what an excellent idea ferguson said he thought about it then rang through to malone in dublin charles ferguson daniel malone groaned what in the hell do you want charles a favour at dublin airport murphy and kelly landed at fourthirty proceeded through customs with light luggage went out of the concourse and approached an old ford saloon car the driver was named john conolly the man beside him joseph tomelty both were hardline republicans and had been members of murphys group for many years all boyhood friends they shook hands with murphy and kelly good to see you brendan conolly said did it go well a total fuckup murphy said couldnt have been worse lets get out of it make for home and ill tell you they all got in and drove away and malone sitting in an unmarked car with a driver said jesus conolly tomelty plus brendan and dermot kelly the old kilbeg mafia theres no doubt where theyre going but follow at a discreet distance and lets make sure theyre taking the right road north twenty minutes later and well outside dublin he tapped the driver on the arm turn back its got to be kilbeg a few minutes later as the car returned to dublin he called ferguson on his mobile and told him what had happened so its kilbeg ferguson said id say definitely are you going to give us trouble here charles dont be silly daniel were doing ourselves a favour and you a favour leave it alone and ill keep you informed one more question since youre running this it means dillons involved obviously then god help brendan murphy ferguson put down his phone and turned to hannah who had been listening you heard murphy and company are on their way to kilbeg ill let dillon know sir in case it affects his plans it wont make much difference you know what hes like hell go in tomorrow night anyway murphy or no murphy just like a bad war movie i know sir he has a kind of death wish why god knows you really have it in for him superintendent you couldnt be more wrong sir actually i like him too much he reminds me of liam devlin that combination of scholar actor poet and absolutely coldblooded killer just like sir walter raleigh ferguson said very bewildering life on occasion dillon and billy were delivered by an unmarked raf car driven by two uniformed raf sergeants named smith and brian checked it out earlier sergeant brian said thats the highlander two hundred yards out well it doesnt look much to me billy told him dont go by appearances its got twin screws depth sounder radar automatic steering does twentyfive knots at full stretch good lets get cracking dillon said right sir weve got a whaleboat to take your gear out forty minutes later the gear was stowed everything shipshape brian said youve got the inflatable with a good outboard motor well get back now thanks for a good job dillon told him the sergeants departed in the whaleboat and dillons mobile rang it was hannah bernstein bringing him up to date on the kilbeg situation murphy being there will it give you a problem only if i cant shoot the bastard hows blake still on his back good lets keep it that way well see you tomorrow oban was enveloped in mist and a fine rain was driving across the water pushed by a light wind above on the land low clouds draped across mountain tops but beyond kerrera the waters of the firth of lorn looked troubled this is scotland billy said what a bloody awful place why would anybody come here for a holiday dont tell the tourist board billy theyd lynch you now weve things to do we can go ashore and eat later he laid out the diving equipment in the stern cabin i dont need to explain this to you youre an expert but lets check over the arms they laid the walthers the semtex the uzis and stun grenades on the main saloon table lets give you a quick course on the uzi billy the walther is simple enough they spent half an hour going over things then dillon took one of the walthers and led the way up to the wheelhouse there was a flap to one side of the instrument board he found a button pressed and inside was a fuse board he cocked the walther slipped it inside and closed the flap ready for action with ten rounds billy remember its there its what is called an ace in the hole you think of everything dont you thats why im still here lets go ashore and eat he switched on the deck lights before they left and they coasted to the front at oban on the inflatable and tied up there was a pub close by that offered food they went in had a look at the menu and opted for fish pie dillon ordered a bushmills but billy shook his head not me i never liked the booze dillon there must be something wrong with me well most things in life are in the bible and what the good book says is wine is a mocker strong drink raging he smiled having said that ill finish this and have another later back on the highlander it started to rain harder they sat on the stern deck under the awning and dillon went through everything from katherine johnsons death in new york to al shariz billy said these mafia guys are fucks dillon and murphys no better that about sums it up so we take them out i hope so the rain drummed on the canvas awning and dillon poured another whisky billy said listen dillon i know a little bit about you the ira hard man who switched sides but every time i ask my uncle how it all happened he clams up whats the story maybe it was the rain and maybe it was the whisky but instead of giving him a hard look and telling him to mind his business dillon felt himself talking the words coming slowly but steadily i was born in ulster my mother died giving birth to me a heavy load to bear my father took me to london he was a good man a small builder got me into st pauls school i thought that was for toffs no billy its for brains anyway i liked the acting went to the royal academy only did a year and joined the national theatre i was still only nineteen my father went home to belfast and got caught in a fire fight between ira and brit paratroopers jesus that was a bastard dillon poured another whisky looking back into the past billy i was a damn good actor but i went back to belfast and joined the ira well you would i mean they killed your old man and i was nineteen but they were nineteen billy mostly a lot like you anyway the ira had access to camps in libya i was sent for training three months and there wasnt a weapon i didnt know inside out you wanted a bomb i could make it any bomb he hesitated only that side i never liked passersby women kids that isnt war thats how you saw it war for a long time yes then i moved on i was a professional soldier so i sold my services eta in spain arabs palestinians also the israelis funny billy the job ive just done in lebanon blowing up a ship with arms for saddam back in ninetyone i worked for them you what gulf war i did the mortar attack on downing street in the snow you wouldnt remember that i bleeding well do ive read articles they used a ford transit then a guy on a motorbike picked up the bomber that was me billy dillon you bastard you nearly got the prime minister and the entire cabinet yes almost but not quite i made a great deal of money out of it im still rich if you like later i got into trouble in bosnia i was due to face a serb firing squad only ferguson turned up saved my miserable skin and in return i had to work for him you see billy he wanted someone who was worse than the bad guys and that was me there was a kind of infinite sadness and billy surprised himself by saying quietly what the hell sometimes life just rolls up on you you could say that the kid who was an actor at nineteen carried on acting just like in a bad movie only he became the living legend of the ira you know those westerns where they say wyatt earp killed twentyone men billy i couldnt tell you what my score is except that its a lot more he smiled gently do you ever get tired i mean really tired billy salter summoned up all his resources listen dillon you need to go to bed true its not much good when you dont sleep very well but theres no harm in trying you do that dillon got up rock steady the trouble is i dont really care whether i live or die any more and when youre into the business of going into harms way thats not good yes well this time youve got me just go to bed dillon went down the companionway billy sat there thinking about it the rain beating down relentlessly dripping off the awning hed never liked anyone as much as he liked dillon never admired anyone as much outside of his uncle anyway he lit a cigarette and thought about it and suddenly saw a parallel his uncle was a gangster a right villain as they said in london but there were things he wouldnt do and billy saw now that dillon was the same he looked at the bottle of bushmills morosely screw you he said then picked it up and the glass and tossed them over the rail he sat there the rain falling feeling curiously relaxed then remembered the paperback on philosophy took it out of his pocket and opened it at random there were some pages about a man called oliver wendell holmes a famous american judge whod also been an infantry officer in their civil war between two groups of men that want to make inconsistent kinds of worlds i see no remedy except forceit seems to me that every society rests on the death of men billy was transfixed jesus he said softly maybe that explains dillon and he read on he awoke in the morning in the aft cabin and was lying there adjusting when he was aware of a loud cry he threw aside his blankets and went up the companionway in his shorts it was still raining relentlessly and mist draped the whole of oban harbour as he looked over the rail dillon surfaced a few yards away come on the waters wonderful you must be bloody mad and then billy cried out behind you for christs sake dillon turned to look those are seals billy no problem theyre intelligent and curious you get them a lot around here he struck out for the ladder and climbed it his shorts clinging to him there was a towel on the table under the awning and he picked it up what a bleeding place billy looked out across the harbour does it always rain like this six days out of seven never mind get dressed and well take the inflatable and go back to that pub well get an allday breakfast just like in london well im with you there hannah bernstein called in at rosedene around ninethirty and found martha in reception how is he not wonderful the bullet gouged deep we thought twenty stitches and ended up with thirty look i dont know whats going on but he isnt fit to go anywhere the professor is checking him out now ill go and see how hes doing hannah helped herself to coffee from the machine and was sipping it when daz appeared listen tell me the truth he said hes as woozy as hell yet he keeps trying to tell me hes got important things to do and i presume by that he means the usual kinds of things you dillon and the brigadier get up to absolutely only this time its something so dangerous that theres no way he can be involved in his condition dillon will handle it yes well he would wouldnt he what do you want from me i know it sounds unethical but couldnt you sedate him hmm that might be the best solution he turned to martha he really needs a sound sleep you know what to do he smiled at hannah if you want to see him better do it now blake was propped up his right shoulder and arm bandaged and looked awful his face haggard hannah leaned over and kissed his cheek how are you blake terrible i just need a rest a couple of hours and ill be fine when are we leaving later this afternoon but take it easy for now christ it hurts martha lurking in the background came forward with a glass of water and a couple of pills in a plastic cup here you go she said to blake what are these painkillers youll feel a lot better soon hannah held his hand for a while and slowly it relaxed and slipped away as he stared blankly at her there he goes martha whispered hell be asleep for hours they went out and found daz at reception signing a few letters he looked up all right on his way to dreamland martha told him good i must go ive got an operation scheduled at guys hospital he smiled at hannah youll monitor the situation the brigadier will im needed elsewhere she nodded to martha and went out with him to where the daimler waited can i give you a lift i was going to get a taxi but yes a lift would help ministry of defence first then you belong to professor daz she told the driver and they drove away i hate march weather she said bloody rain oh dear its like that is it daz smiled as may not have escaped your attention im a hindu hannah personal vibrations are important to me and i sense youre up to your neck in trouble again the dillon kind of trouble something like that when will you learn i know im a nice jewish girl unmarried with no kids but very good at shooting people he took her hand hannah no dont say a thing dillon and i will go off and save the world again only increasingly i wonder what for in fergusons office she said so whats the situation dillon and billy salter are fine theyre both master divers and dillon is an expert boat handler that leaves me and sean regan and without blake youre one short exactly sir ferguson got up went to the window and looked out he turned this kind of black operation works best without official special forces intervention thats why i havent given the kilbeg bunker to the sas it has to be the kind of job that never happened yes i see that sir on the other hand we could do with another gun just to be on the boat when dillon and billy are doing their thing on shore its a difficult one do you have any thoughts yes i do actually an excellent gun and who would that be she told him dillon and billy were sitting in the window seat at a pub in oban just finishing a superb scottish breakfast of kippers poached eggs and bacon washed down with hot steaming tea when dillons mobile rang hannah said blake isnt good theyve sedated him hell be out for hours so youll be on your way with regan yes but sean weve got a problem with you and billy on land and me with regan on the boat we need another gun no big deal just somebody reliable who really knows what hes doing and who would that be she told him what shed suggested to ferguson and dillon laughed why not theres nothing like a professional soldier when will you leave two oclock be with you about fourthirty i look forward to it dillon closed his phone and smiled there you go billy youll have to mind your manners what do you mean so dillon explained ferguson accompanied hannah to pine grove when she went to pick up regan he was in ropers suite again going over a few points and helen black stood by with miller roper said well i think the bastards told the truth or his version of it anyway i damn well have regan said youd better ferguson smiled coldly if not ill see you stand in the dock regan fifteen years he nodded to miller take him and prepare him to move out put the manacles on miller complied and ferguson said get on with it superintendent hannah said weve got a problem sergeant major you are aware of most of the facts but let me summarize were sailing to county louth from oban late this afternoon therell be dillon and billy salter and me to guard regan blake johnson is unwell after the treatment for his gunshot wound were short a gun i see helen black smiled how long have i got to pack half an hour then id better get moving she was out of the door instantly later at the main entrance hannah led regan down the steps and eased him into the daimler onto one of the extra seats the driver had put the luggage in the boot and ferguson stood at the top of the steps with helen black who wore a khaki jumpsuit they were alone for a moment im grateful helen tonys in bosnia at the moment she said referring to her husband the household cavalry has two troops there i know my love theres no need to worry him but youll obviously see to things if anything goes wrong my dear helen he kissed her cheek just believe in sean dillon he is a bastard of the first order but my god hes good you didnt need to tell me not with the years i spent in ulster see you charles and thanks for asking me to the party at farley field the gulfstream was ready madoc loaded the luggage then took them in as parry and lacey came on board hannah made the introductions lacey said theres a bit of a headwind itll be an hour and fortyfive minutes but could run to two he joined parry in the cockpit the engines started and they moved away taking off very quickly and climbing steeply regan held out his manacled wrists can i have these off im not going anywhere helen black laughed thats true she took out a key and unlocked him madoc appeared from the galley tea ladies an excellent idea hannah said personally id like an irish whiskey regan told him madoc looked at hannah who nodded give him what he wants sergeant helen black turned to her well here i go into the war zone again as they returned to the highlander billy said jesus dillon not only two women but both coppers yes scotland yard special branch variety and royal military police but remember one thing billy theyve both killed more than once in the course of duty they both know what theyre doing what have i got myself into well as heidegger said and you quoted him to me life is action and passion billy cut in okay so its going to be bleeding active and terribly exciting youll love it billy dillon said as they coasted in and he reached for the highlanders ladder the rain continued relentlessly billy was coiling a rope under the awning when a voice called highlander ahoy hannah helen black and regan were standing on the jetty beside a range rover the driver in plain clothes but obviously raf billy called down the companionway theyre here dillon dillon came up on deck and looked across fine ill go and get them the inflatable coasted in at the bottom of the steps and hannah called everything okay absolutely lets have the luggage there were only three bags and the driver brought them down regan followed hands manacled again he held up his wrists to dillon i might as well be on a georgia chain gang you deserve to be you shite dillon shoved him into the boat go on get in there he turned to greet the women sergeant major superintendent a fast boat and a passage by night action passion weve got it all here how riveting helen black said i cant wait and she stepped into the inflatable dillon handed the luggage up to billy and helen climbed in followed by hannah hannah looked around the highlander my god i must say it looks pretty basic underneath its lack of a good paint job its superb so dont worry dillon said just get settled in stick sean in the saloon and lets get on with it he turned to regan just remember one thing were back with the old movies again one false move and youre dead come on dillon youre going to kill me anyway not if youre good they put regan in the saloon the two women settled into the aft cabin and dillon made ready for sea he took billy hannah and helen into the wheelhouse and went over the controls then showed the women the walther in the fuse box beside the wheel just in case the sea was starting to flood in through the entrance to the harbour and the highlander was rocking from side to side billy said jesus i feel terrible and he turned went out on deck and vomited over the side dillon followed took a plastic pill bottle from a pocket of his reefer jacket shook the pills out and offered them get them down billy theyll make a difference hannah said kindness and consideration from the great sean dillon dillon smiled sticks and stones hannah not that it matters weve got to leave if were to make tonights schedule so ive other things to worry about well discuss the plan of attack later the winds force five to six at the moment but it should ease later they left at three and ploughed out into the turbulent waters the sea running heavily dillon stood at the wheel alone after a while helen black came in with a mug tea she said i believe thats your preference its the grand woman you are im part irish too dillon from my fathers mothers side in spite of thirty years of war it seems were somehow inextricably mixed eight million irish in the uk sergeant major and the population of the republic only three and a half million its a puzzle you and the superintendent thats a puzzle too shes a hard woman hannah a moralist she finds it difficult to forgive my wicked past you on the other hand understand perfectly weve both been down the same road on different sides yes thats the problem isnt it and she left billy turned up an hour later with another mug of tea are you okay dillon im fine but what about you the pills worked its regan whos in trouble youd better give me some more of those pills dillon handed him the bottle take care of it billy let me know how he is perhaps half an hour later billy came back hes lying down but i think theyre doing the job good billy said dillon on the white diamond job ive been thinking go on dillon turned to automatic pilot and lit a cigarette so theyve sliced through the grille entrance and we know those tunnels go right into the st richards dock basement then all you need is a sledgehammer to break through those old brick walls so but the vaults i still dont see how they get past the electronic security neither do i but there must be a sophisticated explanation its like computers billy theyre state of the art too but if you can get in if you can access the files then all is revealed dillon smiled dont worry harrys on the case and so is roper theyll come up with our answer all im concerned with now is kilbeg and taking you back to the dark man in one piece because if i dont harry will want an explanation hey stuff that dillon ill do my thing okay time for truth billy since blake isnt here its the women im leaving behind ill need you to go on shore with me how do you feel about that great billy smiled never better im with you dillon all the way and he went out it was into early evening when the wheelhouse door opened and there was the smell of fried bacon sandwiches and tea hannah said now whats a nice jewish girl doing giving me bacon she ignored him where are we islay to the east rains a bit squally can i take over no need ill go on automatic pilot dillon checked the course then locked on he attacked the sandwiches fabulous any word from london no he finished the sandwiches and drank the tea there you go thanks love i really think you should go and lie down for a couple of hours and let me take over hell what do women know about boats the wheelhouse door swung open and helen black came in dont be a chauvinist pig mr dillon i dont know if the superintendent knows boats but i do my husband and i race them as a hobby so do shut up and go and rest youre going to have a very hard night dillon raised his hands i give in to this monstrous regiment of women ill leave you to it ladies and he went below hannah too went and helen black took the wheel enjoying it as she always had increasing speed as heavy weather threatened from the east she thought about her husband tony serving in the hell of bosnia with the household cavalry it was a source of hurt that just because the households were the queens personal bodyguard and rode round london in breastplates and helmets on horseback there were those who thought they were chocolate soldiers in fact theyd served in the falklands in the gulf war in ireland and in most of the rotten little wars in between her trouble was that she was a woman and she was a soldier and she loved the army of course dillon had been a soldier too to be fair she rather liked him although hed been the worst of the enemy against the early darkness she could see the outline of one of the irish ferries red and green navigation lights visible she altered course a couple of points then increased speed racing the heavy weather that threatened from the east and the waves grew rougher by now it really was dark only a slight phosphorescent shining from the sea and then the door opened and dillon appeared how are things a bit rough he tapped the radio got the weather channel listened and added thats okay the winds going to drop soon why dont you go and get some coffee ill hang on then ill put her on automatic pilot and we can discuss whats going to happen an hour an hour and a half well hit the louth coast fine she nodded and went out half an hour later brendan murphy dermot kelly conolly and tomelty arrived at kilbeg and pulled up outside the patriot public house murphy led the way in running through torrential rain it was a typical irish pub for either side of the border with a bar beer pumps and a log fire in the hearth there were only three old men at the fire and the landlord behind the bar one fergus sullivan jesus brendan and its grand to see you they shook hands brendan said youre dying the death tonight well its monday night what can i do for you beds for me and dermot weve business elsewhere at the moment well have a drink now and see you later sullivan poured four irish whiskeys and a fifth for himself up the ira and confusion to the english murphy said a short while later inside the grounds of the ruins of kilbeg abbey they entered an ancient hall and approached a dark old oaken door at one end banded with iron that looked as if it had been there for centuries in fact it was a modern replica backed by steel plate of the finest quality murphy took a transceiver from his pocket and pressed the button there was the murmur of a voice murphy he said open sesame a moment later one half of the door opened electronically he and kelly passed through into a short tunnel and went down a flight of concrete steps there was electric light another door opened and in moments they were into a concrete corridor painted white very functional and then into the main part of the bunker two men stood waiting liam brosnan tall heavily built with hair to his shoulders and martin oneill the direct opposite small and redhaired the only thing they had in common were the akassault rifles they carried well at least youre on your toes murphy said any problems only one brendan brosnan told him down at the entrance where the tunnel slopes to the steps theres about a foot of water show me they led the way and murphy and kelly followed it was dark down there and unlike the rest of the bunker cold why is there no heat on no light murphy demanded well thats the point brendan the rest of the bunkers okay but this part under the old farmhouse is on a separate system and the flooding must have screwed it up its the rain oneill said its been terrible during the past two weeks i can tell its the bloody rain you eejit murphy said but if the electricity isnt working that cocks up the entrance there arent any bars they werent necessary when it was electronic ive chained the handles and padlocked them brosnan told him i was waiting for you brendan i know you would want someone reliable exactly dont worry theres that fella patterson in dundalk that builds the fancy houses he knows which side his breads buttered on i know who you mean you call him and tell him ill see him at the patriot for breakfast at eightthirty tomorrow explain the flooding and tell him i expect miracles hell attend to it or hell get a bullet in his left knee and thats only for starters they walked back through the storage areas mortars stacked neatly the kind of missiles and heavy machine guns that could shoot down a helicopter akand armalites still greased and brand new from the factory cases of semtex murphy lit a cigarette and said to kelly look at it dermot just waiting to be used and those old women in london talk peace youre right brendan our day will come ill just check the office it was at the end of the tunnel small functional with filing cabinets a computer system and a desk he said to brosnan and oneill wait outside kelly closed the door murphy knelt behind the desk and lifted a section of carpet underneath set into the concrete floor was an oldfashioned safe with a simple keyhole he felt under the desk found a key on a magnetic block and opened the flap inside were packets of currency sterling and dollars all wrapped in transparent plastic bags he handled a few you think this is cash dermot its not its power with money you can do anything and theres almost three million here what about fox brendan you know what i mean what you owe him hey stuff fox look what happened at al shariz it was a total fuckup and all because of fox it must have been i mean how were the israelis on to us i know it wasnt me so you arent going to pay him what you owe him am i hell murphy locked the safe and put the carpet back what if he makes trouble brendan murphy laughed make trouble for me the mafia dermot this is ireland the one place in the world where theyre powerless were the ones with power dermot you and me so lets get on with it and go and crack a bottle and have a decent supper at the patriot they all sat round the saloon in the highlander a largescale map laid across the table kilbeg village dillon said the abbey is quarter of a mile to the east the bunker is underneath he tapped the map there where the site of a ruined farmhouse is indicated is according to sean here the exit to the bunker he looked at regan who sat on one of the bench seats wrists manacled isnt that so sean to hell with you regan said so how do you intend to play this helen black asked well according to regan there are only two caretakers in the bunker i intend to act very quickly very economically blow the exit door go in dispose of them and leave a hundredpound block of semtex to take the place out theyre storing semtex there as well as arms itll be like bonfire night which if im not mistaken celebrates guy fawkes failing to blow up parliament hannah bernstein said well i wont fail what about me billy asked you can watch my back dillon said guard the exit door after i go in oh great so im standing around like a ponce dont be a silly boy billy ill need you watching out for me so how do you intend to do it helen asked right theres the pier that used to serve the old granite quarry yachtsmen call in here occasionally and usually anchor in the bay according to ropers information what well do is this well take the boat in to the pier you in charge sergeant major billy and i will wear diving suits well offload diving equipment onto the pier in case we have to come back the hard way you will take highlander a hundred yards out into the bay and anchor fine helen said billy and i will have transceivers and so will you so well be in touch the farmhouse is what a quarter of a mile away this will be the ultimate inandout job with luck itll be so clean that ill call and bring you into the pier to pick us up he smiled and turned to billy no need to get your feet wet well thats nice its bleeding cold out there dillon turned to sean regan sitting there sullen on the bench manacled hands on his knees now we come to your part son is there anything you havent told me ive told you everything i know i hope so for your sake because if you havent youre dead in the water and thats not just a figure of speech he turned to the others right people thats the way it is so lets get it done it was nine oclock and pitch dark when they drifted in the engines a muted throbbing dillon left it to helen black she steered onehanded holding a pair of nightstalkers to her eyes and hardly touched the pier in a second dillon was over with a line and ran it round a bollard right billy pass the gear up billy wrestled with air bottles and other things and dillon stacked them on the pier all right son lets have you billy joined him first time in ireland and what a bloody place the hob of hell billy dillon called to helen black on your way the highlander moved out and dillon checked his transceiver hey you still love me superintendent dont be silly she replied and then added for gods sake dillon i know take care well here we go to save the british way of life an irish gunman and a wellknown london gangster why is it that people like us have to do it he switched off checked his uzi and slung it across his chest billy did the same dillon checked his walther and again billy did the same having heard dillon talking on the transceiver he said do you know the answer why is it people like us have to do it billy a great english writer once said its ironic that when it comes down to it that its men of a rough persuasion who have to do all the hard things that the general population are incapable of doing and then the general population disowns them its called being a soldier but im not a bleeding soldier youre a gangster billy its the same thing so shut up and follow me on board the highlander hannah obeyed helen blacks orders and dropped the anchor below sean regan sat on the bench manacled and thought about things he was a practical man and had survived for many years in the irish struggle by being so however try as he could dillons reputation wouldnt go away and it was that of the ultimate hard man the brits used him on situations they didnt want to go to court if he was on your case you were dead with the best will in the world regan couldnt imagine a fate other than being tossed over the side into the irish sea a convenient corpse and there was no way he could risk that a desperate plan came to him and before he could hesitate he acted he knocked a tray bearing a teapot and cups off the table and fell on his knees a moment later hannah appeared what is it my guts killing me i think it must be those seasickness pills she crouched and checked him out that bad i need the necessary for gods sake i might mess myself she pulled him up and took him out to the lavatory he held out his hands come on you cant move in there i couldnt get my trousers down with these things on she hesitated then took out her key uncuffed him and pushed him inside she stood against the wall and waited regan sat down breathed deeply then stood up shoved the door open hard catching hannah and knocking her against the wall he went up the companionway fast ran out on deck past helen black as she emerged from the wheelhouse and vaulted over the rail the cold march irish sea took his breath away but he struck out for the shore with all his strength and vanished into the dark hannah appeared on deck goddammit he conned me i was such a fool happens to us all helen black tried her transceiver dillon are you there but in the valley area up from the cliffs the signal was poor and there was no reply sean regan hit the shore colder than hed ever been in his life and immediately started to run making his way up the cliff path and turning for kilbeg he burst into the patriot fifteen minutes later there were three drinkers at the bar conolly and tomelty two of them he fell across the bar in front of sullivan and tomelty raised his head by his hair regan said thank god youre here weve got trouble well tell the man here regan turned and saw murphy get up from the bench before the fire why sean i thought the brits had you in wandsworth how in the hell did you get here suddenly regan realized he was in deep trouble here too and tried to recover never mind that brendan dillons here sean dillon hes here to destroy the bunker really murphy said but how would he know have you been shooting your gob off please brendan they took me out of wandsworth beat the shire out of me well i must say you dont look too bad tomelty said we came over on a boat anchored off the old pier i managed to get away there are a couple of women on board one special branch that bernstein bitch the other is military police and dillon hes gone to take out the bunker with another guy hes going in by way of the exit at the farmhouse murphy shook his head and how would he know about all that jesus brendan no you sean at that moment there was a rumble in the distance kelly ran out of the pub entrance then came back in its the abbey some sort of explosion shall we get up there murphy cursed no its a waste of bloody time now murphy pushed regan to the door lets get out of here down to the pier a few moments earlier as dillon and billy had reached the exit door in the old farmhouse helen black managed to get through dillon for gods sake what weve got a crisis regan escaped jumped in the bay and swam for it well thats damn unfortunate will you abort like hell were at the exit now well go in hard and get out quick he switched off helen said to hannah hes still going in ill take the inflatable to the pier time could be crucial here maybe i should go hannah said not this time now ive got to get moving at the exit door dillon stopped took a magnetized block from his bag and slammed it over the lock stay here and wait for me billy he stepped back the lock blew and the doors folded inwards dillon ran in took a smoke grenade from the bag and rolled it down the corridor the water considerably reduced its efficiency but he ran on pulling out a stun grenade but again swallowed by the floor it wasnt very effective behind him billy muttered what the hell raised his uzi and went after dillon brosnan and oneill were having a late supper in the office when they heard the noise grabbed their uzis and ran out a certain amount of smoke remained from the grenade and they crouched from the halfshock of the stun grenade a moment later dillon ran out of the fog headlong and brosnan rose to meet him but dillon was faster his uzi battering brosnan back against the wall dillon stumbled to one knee and oneill stood up in the murk ive got you now you bastard he raised his ak and billy came in on the run firing his uzi and shot him to pieces billy dropped on his knees breathing deeply and dillon stood up dont fall down on me now billy this is the good bit he kicked open the office door produced five blocks of semtex from the jump bag took timers from the bag and inserted them he left one on the office floor and pushed billy out you go three minutes he dropped the blocks one by one as they ran through the bunker splashed through the water and made it out of the exit as they went down the slope to the cliffs the explosion rumbled underground murphy was into the car with regan kelly conolly and tomelty and roaring out of the village within seconds of the explosion when they reached the top of the road he said to tomelty who was driving switch off the engine they coasted down the hill silently and braked to a halt helen black sitting in the inflatable heard nothing murphy said not a sound you go along the strip of beach tomelty you and i will take the pier conolly and be very very quiet he turned to regan and you be especially quiet they moved out helen black sat there in the inflatable there was a footfall on the beach she turned and took out her walther and a flashlight was switched on from the pier well i know youre not bernstein id recognize her so i suppose you must be the sergeant major murphy frowned you wouldnt be black would you the one from derry my god youve got a brain down you go tomelty murphy said get her gun he turned to kelly you and conolly take her out to the boat if the bernstein bitch argues tell her youll shoot this one he turned to tomelty you and i stay here for dillon the inflatable moved away tomelty said what about regan murphy said silly me i was forgetting he turned to regan and took a browning from his pocket you sold us out you shire youre lucky i dont have time to make it longer the silenced browning coughed and regan went off the pier into the water on the highlander hannah looked through the nightstalker as the inflatable coasted in are you all right she called kelly said weve got your sergeant major here and ive got a gun to her head if youre not sensible ill kill her stone dead helen black called dont listen hannah do what you have to do you heard the explosion weve achieved our object to hell with these people conolly hit her across the side of her head with his pistol she cried out kelly said i mean it all right hannah stood back her walther in her left hand a moment later kelly boarded followed by helen black and conolly who took the walther from hannahs grasp theres a good girl black was wearing paratroop boots with her jumpsuit stuffed into the right one was the colt hollow point at that moment she could have pulled it out in the darkness of the deck and shot both men but what would that mean for dillon and billy she decided to wait dillon tried to get her on the transceiver and got no reply on the highlander kelly started the engines and moved in to the pier and conolly tied up dillon and billy came down the hill on the run and in the slight light of a quarter moon the rain having stopped saw the boat move in theyve come for us billy said gasping for breath so it would appear they hit the end of the pier looked down at the deck with the light on and saw kelly push hannah and helen out he and conolly both holding guns to the womens backs murphy came out of the shadows with tomelty they mean it you bastard you want them dead certainly not dillon said do as he says billy guns on the floor billy complied and murphy lit a cigarette damn you dillon i always admired you but this time youve cost me money not you brendan jack fox murphy laughed incredulously my god is that what this is about a personal feud you shouldnt have joined brendan neither should you dillon now you and your friend get on board so we can move to where the waters deeper because thats where youre going dillon and billy went down the steps to the deck and joined helen black and hannah murphy followed with tomelty kelly was at the wheel conolly joined the others you know what murphy said its a waste of good women but im going to kill the lot of you he was looking at hannah when he said that helen black close to the wheelhouse pulled the colt out of her boot and shot kelly in the back of the head the boat swerved and everyone fell over as conolly tried to get up she pushed herself upright shot him dead then ducked and dived over the rail as murphy tried to shoot her at the same moment dillon grabbed billy by the arm over he cried and pushed him over the rail after helen black as he tried to follow tomelty still on the deck grabbed his ankles and dillon went down you bastard murphy kicked him in the side youre finally dead meat dillon and you bitch those two in the water arent going anywhere fifteen minutes at this season of the year and its hypothermia time you two will get it quick at least billy close to helen on the port side said im going to try for that gun in the wheelhouse he didnt wait for a reply simply jackknifed and went under the highlander from port to starboard scraping his back under the keel surfaced and reached up for the rail as he pulled himself on board and slithered for the wheelhouse he heard the exchange between dillon and murphy unaware that looking beyond murphy and tomelty dillon had seen him arrive come on brendan why all the dialogue in derry in the old days we didnt talk about it we did it on his knees in the wheelhouse billy dropped the flap and got his hand to the walther which dillon had left cocked he turned and shot tomelty twice in the back shattering his spine murphy started to turn shocked as tomelty went down hannah kicked sideways at his left leg and he stumbled which was dillons moment he grabbed at the gun hand and came breasttobreast now then you dog he pushed hard murphy staggered back and they went over the stern rail and the sea was dillons the master divers element not murphys they went down perhaps ten feet dillon got an arm around murphys throat and then the anchor on its chain scraped his back he grabbed it with his right hand and held on fast murphy kicked and struggled and dillon held his breath until he was bursting and then murphy stopped struggling dillon let him go and surfaced he managed the ladder and hung there and hannah looked over all right dillon what happened to murphy he hauled himself up what do you think happened as the sicilians have it brendan murphy is asleep with the fishes he sat on the deck his back to the wheelhouse billy was there and helen black you okay sergeant major im fine mr dillon and you billy what the fuck did you get me into dillon billy you saved the pass to use an oldfashioned phrase you were fantastic the sas couldnt have done better on top of that youve given superintendent bernstein a severe problem try not to get arrested because shell feel terribly guilty if she has to arrest you billy grinned and turned to hannah what do i have to do take up good works just dont give me a problem billy trouble is ive been giving people a problem all my life dillon said lets get the bodies over the side and do me a favour sergeant major take us out ill do a quick change and ill be up to relieve you leave it to me come on you two he said to hannah and billy lets get into dry clothes and he led the way below an hour later charles ferguson was in his cavendish square flat enjoying a nightcap when his phone rang dillon was at the wheel alone the others below pushing out into the irish sea he had switched to automatic pilot and lit a cigarette as he spoke is it yourself brigadier dillon where are you on our way back to oban dillon was using his codex four mobile we can talk whats happened well the kilbeg bunker is no more and the sergeant majors proved a treasure killed two of murphys gang billy saved our bacon by killing another at the right time good god is everyone all right oh right as rain brigadier were a tough lot well thank god for that and murphy oh i saw to him myself well you would wouldnt you so what now id say six hours to oban the weathers not too good if you could alert lacey and parry for a flight back to london around breakfast time consider it done hows blake a postoperational infection daz and martha have it in hand thats good fox is really going to be mortified over this lot i like that dillon a good choice of words ill see you tomorrow dillon sat there at the wheel and then the door opened there was a bacon smell and billy appeared a plate of sandwiches in one hand and a mug of tea there you go sean billy turned to leave and dillon said billy you were great harry will be proud of you yes but he wont know will he what i mean is nobody knows unless theyve done it been there bought the teeshirt isnt that what they say jesus dillon this wasnt some punchup in an east end pub i killed two men tonight they shouldnt have joined billy if they didnt want the risk remember that okay i suppose so so now its the jagos and fox yes i suppose it is dillon finished the last sandwich go on billy get some sleep youve earned it billy left and dillon turned from automatic pilot to manual and took the highlander onwards over an increasingly turbulent sea london jack fox had gone down to the grill restaurant at the dorchester to enjoy an english breakfast he was reading the times and just finishing poached eggs sausage ham and toast when falcone appeared weve got a problem signore what now fox asked ive just seen sky televisions news programme i think you should see for yourself that bad fox asked im afraid so signore in the suite fox watched the next news update with horror the story of a large explosion at kilbeg in county louth led the hour there were pictures of the irish police on site and reports of some kind of ira connection although the ira and sinn fein had denied it one thing was certain four bodies had drifted on to the beach three dead from gunshot wounds the fourth was brendan murphy a wellknown dissident who had left the provisional ira and formed his own group the suggestion was that the pira had taken his men out it was thought that the explosion had involved an underground arms bunker and this was being investigated there was a ring at the door russo answered and returned with a waiter carrying a tray with fresh coffee he was dismissed and russo poured falcone said murphy owed you money signore well we can kiss that goodbye fox said falcone said please forgive me if i overstep the bounds signore but ive been loyal to you for so many years that i feel i can ask this question how bad are things fox looked at him pretty bad aldo but we still have one ace in the hole left the white diamond company heist on tuesday you said ten million sterling with four to the jagos fox smiled and you disagreed i sure did signore i say we take the lot im beginning to agree aldo but afterwards let these bastards do the hard work falcone smiled broadly excellent signore okay get in touch with the jagos i want a meet at lunchtime pick a quiet pub ill arrange it signore falcone left to make the arrangements but first he phoned don marco who because of the time difference was still in bed but then falcones instructions had been to call at any time of the day or night the don listened patiently finally he said fucked again my nephew fucked at the colosseum then at al shariz and now in ireland you know what they say aldo once is okay twice is coincidence and three times is enemy action so what do we do don marco nothing this is jacks problem he succeeds or fails on his own but if he fails understand me aldo ill never let any physical harm come to him hes my nephew but the family needs a leader in whom it can be confident this diamond heist is his last chance if something happens to that too jacks out capisce capisco don marco in the back bar of the horse guards pub not far from st richards dock harold and tony jago waited it was misty on the river and a little rain drummed against the window harold looked out i like it like this tony its the way the thames should be england for the english eh who needs europe a bunch of frogs and krauts youre right harold mind you were stuck with the fucking mafia right now they dont worry me we can handle them at that minute manchester charlie ford came in through the far door amber frazer with him jesus here they come harold said what a pair i mean if they want their own thing instead of a woman thats all right but i dont like blacks theyre nothing but trouble ford had the file under his arm and passed it across everythings taken care of harold good lets wait for fox what do you want to drink at rosedene blake was feeling a lot better and greeted dillon and helen black with enthusiasm when they turned up miller filled me in we watched sky television you really took them apart which just leaves the white diamond company hey dont leave me out this time sean i want to be part of that you cant be because i wont be part of it and neither will bernstein or ferguson weve given it to harry salter were not involved blake okay but i cant just sit around here i need to be with you fine if daz will release you thats okay by me daz agreed he could go as long as blake did not take part in any physical activity so just before noon they repaired to fergusons office at the ministry of defence blake wearing a sling for his right arm hannah stood beside ferguson at his desk the brigadier said i hardly need to say well done however were left with the final nail in jack foxs coffin the white diamond company job what happens now superintendent frankly sir the salters wont talk to me its up to dillon well according to roper tomorrows the day because thats when the big diamond consignment comes in what we do know is that theyve cut open the old grille gate in the tunnel hannah said the thing we still dont know is once theyve smashed into the basement how do they bypass the security to get into the vault thats what im going to see harry salter about dillon said ill take blake you stay out of it hannah i know you dont like our using a villain like salter and i dont want to offend your fine police morality at the horse guards harold sat reading the file then passed it to tony its not only good its bloody good at that moment fox falcone and russo came in harold got up good to see you were just finishing things they sat but falcone and russo as usual stood at the wall so where are we fox demanded hey your file was sweetness and light harold said but charlie here has put in some extras that will truly delight you tell me afterwards fox nodded excellent theres only one change ive just had more recent information that the take will be more like twelve million than ten more for everyone jago so keep our eye on the ball people we sure will jack harold said fox got up im in your hands youre the experts well keep out of it stay in touch he went out followed by falcone and russo tony jago said so we do all the fucking work never mind harold told him for a payday like that im glad to do the work ferguson went into the dark man with dillon and blake salter and billy were in the end booth and dora was giving them shepherds pie smells good ferguson said takes me back to eton well have the same blake needs building up blake looks bloody awful salter observed have you seen sky television billy dillon asked a terrible business in ireland an underground bunker blown up bodies drifting in on the beach one of them a hard man named brendan murphy everyone believes the provos in dublin were behind it he wouldnt do as he was told yes i did see that billy said terrible what goes on over there dora brought their food and dillon laughed he did well your boy harry saved my life by killing one bastard in the bunker and saved all of us killing another on the boat salter was shocked he turned to billy you never told me yeah well you never believe anything i say my god you are a chip off the old block after all id say hes a chip off his own block ferguson said and started to eat roper definitely thinks tomorrow the big consignment arrives at the white diamond company from south africa and im told the stakes are higher twelve million not ten really salter said then im sorry for them why its too big brigadier im not an educated man i go by experience and nobody knows more about the london underworld and thieving than i do what screwed up the great train robbery was the size biggest criminal haul ever there was no way society and the law could tolerate that so they turned on the big guns that makes considerable sense ferguson agreed blake said yes but jack fox is desperate he has to be he needs a big one oh sure and manchester charlie ford and his team are greedy and stupid and will all be back on landing d at wandsworth before they know it salter said dillon finished his food and accepted the glass of bar champagne that dora put at his elbow lets go over this again harry theyve got manchester charlie ford one of the best lock and safe men in the business amber frazer a heavy and connie briggs a hotshot on security and electronics salter told him did you know he went to london university from a wellknown family of villains his mother was real proud him doing that got this degree what they call firstclass honours my that is good ferguson said they threw a big party i was there he gets a research job for british telecom but its not worth enough money so what does he do starts putting himself about billy said he really is a genius where the electronics caper is concerned dillon im beginning to believe you and val french well hes a top man with a thermal lance cutting all that id say hed have sorted out the gate and organized smashing through the tunnel wall into the basement theyd all finished their food and dora cleared the table blake was sweating his forehead damp he didnt look good salter said bring him a brandy dora you dont look well my old son ive been worse blake said but thanks anyway he hesitated i suppose someone should bring this up for forms sake and it might as well be me shouldnt someone be notifying the white diamond company that they might be in trouble brigadier i take your point blake but were not into ethics here were into finishing off jack fox dillons voice was hard as long as we ruin things for him thats okay all right all right blake said just thought id ask and while were at it how do we think theyre going to get into that vault well it isnt the thermal lance man dillon said hed be there all night trying to get into the kind of strong room theyll have in here id say its the electronics whiz kid i agree harry said but that doesnt get us any further there was a pause and it was billy who said what we need is more information and the only way to get that is to pick up one of the team and squeeze him dry harry laughed out loud my god you really are learning who would you suggest the one whos least important the one whose absence wouldnt be a burden the heavy amber frazer dillon said id say so brilliant harry salter turned to ferguson we lift this guy tonight leave it to us well deliver him to your safe house at holland park then well review the situation this is illegal of course ferguson said he hasnt done anything not yet dillon said but im sure you could think of something after all isnt this why we didnt bring the superintendent youre right of course its in your hands harry i may call you harry you can call me any bleeding thing you like excellent then if your dora can come up with an indifferent glass of red wine ill drink your health and leave you to it ferguson told him it was ten oclock that night when amber frazer and manchester charlie ford emerged from a small italian restaurant in notting hill harry and billy had been waiting for some time sitting in their car ford hailed a cab patted ambers face and got in brilliant billy said as amber turned and walked away they trailed him and billy pulled in at the pavement a little further along harry salter got out amber my old son i thought it was you my god harry what are you doing here looking for you so get in the car amber alarmed tried to turn away and salter pushed the muzzle of a gun he was carrying in his righthand pocket against ambers back is that a gun harry well its not my finger yes its a gun and its silenced so i could blow away your spine leave you on the pavement and drive away and no one would hear a thing get in the car amber did as he was told and harry got in behind him and took out the gun listen amber i know you like to think youre some kind of mike tyson and youve got big muscles but not with a bullet in your stomach so do as youre told billy said evening amber and drove away at the safe house amber sat wondering what the hell was going on miller at the door after a while it opened and dillon and helen black came in followed by harry salter look whats this about amber stood up dillon kicked him very hard in the right ankle sit down helen black said is this the man mr salter definitely hes involved with a gang of known criminals charles ford val french connie briggs i understand their intention is to rob the white diamond company tomorrow night of a very large consignment from south africa i also understand theres a mafia connection a man named jack fox amber panicked here what is this i dont know what youre talking about dillon said to helen black dear me if this little caper goes through hell still be legally a part of it am i right absolutely what kind of sentence would he pull minimum of ten years amber was sweating now look for gods sake no for your sake salter said there was a pause and then helen black said if you help us in the matter youll be released within the next few days and put on a plane back to barbados and if you dont its back to the shower at wandsworth dillon said frazer had done a particularly nasty stretch at wandsworth a couple of years earlier and he had no desire to repeat it he loved charlie but charlie could take care of himself okay amber took out a handkerchief and wiped his face give me a drink helen black nodded to miller who went to the sideboard and poured a large scotch amber swallowed it down okay what do you want to know on the other side of the mirror ferguson stood with hannah blake and billy a good start he said depends on your point of view sir hannah said well my point is getting a result im like a lot of people these days superintendent sick of the bad guys getting away with it as our american cousins would say war is war and this is a kind of war if youre not happy go back to the office theres no need for that sir i hope not in the interview room salter said all right amber manchester charlie ford you connie and val are going to hit the white diamond company for jack fox we know youve already cut open the grille gate in the tunnel from the river amber was shocked how do you know that we know everything old son dillon leaned against the wall and lit a cigarette helen took up the story the gate is open you go up the tunnel smash a hole through an old victorian brick wall and youre into the basement of the white diamond company only what we cant understand old son is how youre supposed to do the job salter said i mean all that security all those alarms amber didnt reply and dillon said its a waste of time sergeant major ship him up to wandsworth and charge him with conspiracy as you say sir helen black said amber said no for gods sake ill tell you give me another drink which miller did amber swallowed it down just like the other okay what do you want to know first of all the security man no problem he takes over at six oclock from the other guy always gets coffee and a big box of sandwiches from the takeaway at the end of the street theres a girl there who charlie knows shes going to put a couple of pills in the coffee they take a while to act but when they do hes out for three or four hours but the security system helen black said thats connie briggs hes a genius at electronics hes got hold of this thing called a howler when you switch it on it screws up all electronic systems in a given area tv video security gate locks vaults the lot my god helen black said i cant believe it of course dillon said oh what an ass i am ive seen those things they work believe me he turned to amber so it is tomorrow night amber nodded seven oclock its got to be early because of the tide will fox be there dillon asked no way its all down to us and the jagos the door opened and ferguson came in trailed by billy hannah and blake johnson thank you sergeant major the brigadier said take him out and keep him secure black and miller took amber frazer between them and blake said well now we know the only trouble is fox isnt taking part hannah said well he wouldnt dillon told her hes too careful to get directly involved in a caper like this we have to settle for foiling the robbery and banging up the lot of them including the jagos the end result will still be that fox loses his hope of a big killing with those diamonds his last hope blake said exactly dillon nodded so how do we handle it harry salter said ive been thinking my joe joe baxter when he was doing a five stretch at armle prison in leeds did a learning programme did welding all that stuff you know oxyacetylene so what are you suggesting ferguson asked well it would run something like this brigadier and harry salter told him they all listened and ferguson burst into laughter my god thats the best thing ive heard in years the following day fox was having a light lunch in the piano bar at the dorchester tagliatelle alla panna noodles in a cream and ham sauce just the way he liked it the waiter poured him a glass of krug and falcone came down the stairs ive been to the colosseum signore mori has laid off most of the staff hes kept on rossi and cameci i know that damn ferguson any word from ford no signore todays the day aldo make or break time more than you know falcone thought manchester charlie ford had expected amber for lunch and when he failed to turn up he tried ambers mobile when it rang at holland park helen black nodded miller stood behind and amber answered hey where are you charlie demanded sorry charlie amber mumbled ive got a terrible toothache ive only just managed to find a dentist who could give me an appointment you poor sod okay ill see you this evening i dont know charlie this thing could knock me out of commission there was a brief silence well i suppose we can manage if we have to me tony and harold but be here if you can okay amber ill do my best charlie well you do that darling stay well amber switched off the phone and looked at helen black was that okay you should be on stage amber for some strange reason he perked up you really think so absolutely much better than prison maybe you shouldnt go back to barbados maybe you should get an education grant and try the london theatre school there was a final meeting at foxs suite at the dorchester the jagos ford briggs and french falcone and russo stood by and fox nodded to russo who got a bottle of champagne from the basket and thumbed off the cork he filled glasses all around fox raised his and toasted the others to the big one theyll all have to sit up and take notice he turned to ford everything okay amber isnt up to snuff hes got some sort of tooth infection he rang me up from the dentist we dont need the black tony jago said we can manage enough of us as it is you know best fox nodded tony said so youre sure youre not joining us dont be silly that tunnel would be rather crowded but you dont mind joining us to share out the loot falcone leaning against the wall straightened but harold took charge you shut your mouth he said to his brother or ill give you a slapping he turned to fox look im sorry hes young well we all were once jack told him and smiled come on another glass of bubbly and then as i believe the irish say god bless the good work it was six oclock that evening when hannah answered her doorbell and found dillon on the step ferguson expects us at his place to wait out whats happening ive got the daimler ill get my coat she was out in a few minutes he opened the rear door for her and she climbed in behind the driver dillon leaned in through the open window and tapped the driver on the shoulder take the superintendent to brigadier ferguson he smiled at hannah ill see you later ive got things to do hannah opened her mouth in surprise but the daimler moved away before she could reply outside the jagos house in wapping a large white truck bearing the sign elite construction drew up ford was at the wheel wearing overalls briggs beside him french in the back the door to the house opened and harold and tony jago emerged came down the steps and also got in the back the moment of truth boys harold said lets get to it at the same time the night security guard at the white diamond company having finished his sandwiches and coffee sat back to read the evening standard he kept blinking his eyes yawned a couple of times put the newspaper down and checked the multiple television security screens everything looked normal suddenly he leaned over the desk put his head on his arms and was asleep in the tunnel ford and french each wielding a sledgehammer attacked the wall at the right point the old victorian brickwork crumbled and fell backwards in large sections into the basement perfect ford said in we go gents they all scrambled through now what harold jago asked the tide started to come in downriver fifteen minutes ago were good for forty minutes after that the tunnel entrance will be covered then lets bleeding get on with it harold said connie briggs took an object from one of the carrying bags that resembled a television remote control the howler he said and pressed a button is that it tony jago asked well if it isnt all hell will break loose when we go upstairs if it works the security system is fucked and all the doors will be open lets go and see dillon the salters joe baxter and sam hall got out of a transit baxter and hall were carrying large canvas holdalls blake got out after them harry salter said look old son cant you stay in the transit youre not up to it no its important to me fox had my wife killed harry i want to be there when he finally gets his what happens now if we succeed will finish him strange it was billy who said hes entitled let him be well youve changed you young sod damn right harry dillon said hes killed two men and on the side of right no going back on that salter said okay lets get going he led the way down the steps and started along the shingle to the tunnel entrance when they got there he turned to billy you checked with handy how long have we got thirty minutes and dont forget when that tide floods in its what handy means by st richards force right lets get to it as the jagos and the others reached the entrance hall they paused observing the security guard sprawled across the desk the security screens blank there you go downstairs to the vault connie briggs said manchester charlie ford laughed i told you he was a genius and he led the way down a broad marble stairway to the vaults below the others in the tunnel had reached the grille door harry salter said right lets get on with it billy said we could clobber them on the way out harry i mean twelve million like i said its too much billy theyd bring out the big battalions now we go with my suggestion ive never liked the jagos with their drugs whores and pornography filth he turned to joe baxter so get your gear out and lets hope the british prison system taught you a trade joe baxter took out an oxyacetylene welding torch from his holdall from the other bag sam hall produced an oxygen cylinder baxter flared the torch and started to work the great vault doors opened and the jagos and their friends were into an aladdins cave they opened their canvas holdalls pulled out bags and poured in a stream of diamonds jesus harold said ive never known the like there was an atmosphere of hysteria everyone laughing and finally they were finished okay lets be on our way harold ordered and led the way back upstairs they moved down to the basement to the exit hole theyd smashed moved through one by one tony said christ theres water in the tunnel well there would be harold said the tides coming in weve got time lets get moving it was already a foot deep when they reached the gate manchester charlie ford in the lead he tried to open it what the hell is going on it wont budge val french pushed him out of the way and checked it christ someones welded it together that would be me and my friends dillon sloshed forward in a foot of water blake at his side sean dillon and this is blake johnson im sure youve got a mobile call jack fox and give him the bad news the jagos grabbed the bars of the grille and shook them fuck you dillon smiled no im afraid its you who are fucked gentlemen now if youll excuse me the waters getting a bit high dillon and blake turned and waded away the water already two feet deep and rising they exited on to the beach which was already flooded harry salter and the other were at the steps waiting dillon took out his codex four mobile phone and called scotland yard using the special branch number the officer who replied said special branch how can i help you the jago brothers and a handpicked team are trapped in the white diamond company building at st richards dock they cant get out the way they got in underground because the tides rising if you get to the front entrance fast youll catch them with twelve million in diamonds who is this dont be silly get moving in the tunnel the jagos and the others shook desperately at the grille together but joe baxter had done too good a job and then the water rose and started to bore in very fast christ harold said its that st richards force thing lets get out of here they turned and scrambled along the tunnel the water foaming around them got through the hole and scrambled upstairs to the foyer and the security office listen harold said if that howler works then the front doors open thats right connie told him okay lets get the hell out of here he led the way to the door and there was a squeal of brakes as half a dozen police cars arrived outside harold stood there bitter and angry and said to connie close the door with your sodding howler which connie did let them wait the police bunched together outside the glass doors and tony jago gave them two fingers harold called through on the mobile to fox at his suite at the dorchester fox said harold how did it go wonderful im standing here at the white diamond company holding a bag worth twelve million and there must be at least twenty cops outside trying to get in at us what happened for gods sake harold told him dillon fox said are you sure and the american johnson i think theyve been on your case more than you know jack the trouble is its put them on my case ill get you the best barrister in london thanks very much thats a great comfort fox sod you and your barrister he switched off the mobile tony said what the hell do we do harold travel hopefully tony harold turned to connie briggs go on use that gadget and open the door connie did and the police rushed in and surged all over them fox said that bastard dillon he and johnson theyve ruined the operation signore falcone said god i see it all now it wasnt them just with the colosseum but al shariz and kilbeg too and now this but how signore how would they know the johnson woman everything flows from that somehow she found out and told them god knows how so what do we do now signore fox turned to him with a hard light in his eyes we exact revenge fox said thats what i want revenge and how do we do that ill tell you later right now i want you and russo to get down to the colosseum and pick up rossi and cameci go on do it now he was angry and make it fast signore falcone left picked up russo from his room and filled him in as they went down in the elevator to get the car russo said hes too angry and being too angry isnt good you dont have to tell me falcone said in the car on the way to the colosseum he phoned don marco in new york and brought him up to date ah god aldo cant he see theyre looking for him to come after them he should just cut his losses get out of there he wont do that don marco hes an angry man and insane to go after them but then jack was always headstrong falcone hesitated then said the unthinkable do you wish me to take care of him don marco no aldo no matter what hes done hes my nephew flesh of my flesh im coming over there ill leave new york within the hour you stay in dose touch of course aldo i need your total loyalty in this you have it as always don marco besides the gulfstream the family operated a golden eagle twinengine aircraft out of bardsey aero club outside london it was useful for local flights the kind where you had to put down on short runways so it was particularly good for hellsmouth fox called the pilot now an ageing exraf pilot named swan and got him at home mr fox what can i do for you i need a flight in a couple of hours to hellsmouth can you manage that if you say so mr fox it might be a rough landing its pretty dark i dont care if you put us down on its belly just so you get us there as you say sir when dillon arrived at stable mews fox russo falcone rossi and cameci were waiting in a large black van dillon got out with blake and gave him the key to the house there you go ill be back later ill go and see what ferguson wants he got back into the taxi and it moved away blake walked slowly towards the door and the van drove up and braked rossi and cameci were out and had him in seconds blake tried to struggle but had little strength fox leaned across russo who was at the wheel its my turn now johnson get him in the back you know what to do falcone they dragged blake in and falcone produced a hypodermic now this will really make you feel good he said and jabbed it into the right arm blake continued to struggle but then everything slipped away and he was still bardsey operated a twentyfourhour service that handled the everincreasing volume of private planes and executive jets that heathrow didnt welcome any more for internal flights there was no particular security swan was waiting for them fox said well take off right away i dont want to hang around im a little worried about my friend here hes had too much to drink will there be a return mr fox swan asked not tonight you wait at the airstrip for further instructions swan only too well aware of the kind of people he was dealing with said as you say sir went and logged flight details rossi and cameci took blake up the steps russo followed and fox turned to falcone phone the caretaker old carter tell him i want the fireplaces lit but i dont want him in the house he can go home as you say signore fox boarded the eagle and falcone got on his mobile and made the call when he finished falcone followed and swan pulled up the steps and dosed the airstair door as he went up to the cockpit fox reached out to falcone give me the phone he took out a card a digest of information maud jackson had given him found fergusons number in cavendish square and dialled it charles ferguson jack fox is dillon there why mr fox and how are you this evening shove it ferguson give me dillon ferguson handed the phone to dillon and he and hannah stood up why jack so sorry to hear your bad news yeah well its nothing compared to the news i have for you dillon ive just grabbed blake johnson and im taking him to hell but not alas back i saw you clear off in the cab dillon and i got him before he opened the door if you use your brains you might come up with where im taking him and that would please me no end he switched off before dillon could reply and dillon turned to hannah and ferguson hes got blake he said hes taking him to hell but not back he frowned hellsmouth his place in cornwall its got to be let me use the phone hannah said dillon no its a trap he made it easy for you to guess and now hell kill you too that may be hannah but i cant leave blake there alone he dialled the holland park safe house and got helen black bad news the bastards have kidnapped blake johnson put the major on roper said here i am sean whats the deal dillon told him roper said give me a couple of minutes at my computer good man roper was back very quickly yes besides the gulfstream the solazzo family have a golden eagle you know that plane ive flown one many times dillon said its excellent for short runways well thats what they have at the hellsmouth estate theres an

take it you could say that i wish i could be with you ill stay on the computer in case you need me just a minute there was a pause and roper spoke again the golden eagle took off twenty minutes ago the slot booked says cornwall hellsmouth six passengers and one of those is blake thanks roper dillon said hellsmouth theyve gone down in a golden eagle from bardsey six passengers he punched another number on the phone sean what are you doing hannah said well im not phoning the cornish police theyre a fine body of men but not for a job like this im calling farley field what for she demanded because hes going after them ferguson said i know my sean he said to hell but not back dillon said well ill follow him to hell a voice on the receiver said farley field dillon get me squadron leader lacey if hes there actually i just saw him in the mess hang on lacey was there quickly is that you dillon were going into action and i mean now whats the score hellsmouth near lizard point in cornwall its a small airstrip so i need a parachute landing i know that area raf st just is not too far away exactly so you drop me then land at st just jesus dillon youre at it again saving the world no saving blake johnsons life speak to the quartermaster brownings aks parachutes for two id say six hundred feet youre mad sean but let me get on with it dillon put the phone down and hannah bernstein said gear for two parachutists what the hell are you talking about well not the sas there isnt time ive someone in mind and ill go and see him now if you want to see me again it will be at farley field youre just going to execute all those people arent you dillon she said angrily dillon turned to ferguson shes a lovely woman brigadier but ive had it up to here with her morality im more interested in saving a good mans life and he turned and walked out hannah turned and said hes mad sir no superintendent hes dillon harry salter billy joe and sam hall were in the end booth at the dark man enjoying large scotches when dillon came in sean my old son harry salter said did we do it or did we do it fox has kidnapped blake dillon said flown off to this estate he has in cornwall with four of his heavies there was silence salter said what are you going to do i cant leave it they might chop him im flying down in an hour from farley field ill drop over the estate by parachute try and catch them with their pants down its got to be a drop the landing field there is too short for a gulfstream the nearest raf base is twenty miles away billy said fox and four makes five dillon and youre going in alone no billy im going in with you you must be bleeding mad harry salter said dillon ignored him billy youve heard of arnhem in the second world war all those paratroopers going in there was one major an army surgeon whod never done a jump in his life but they needed a doctor he survived just fine and so will you billy trust me you jump out pull the cord at six hundred feet you hit the ground in twentyfive seconds and thats all there is to it salter said youre crazy but billy was smiling all over his face ive said it before dillon youre just like me you dont give a stuff just show me the way well if he goes im bleeding going salter said even if im only on the sidelines right dillon said then lets do it hellsmouth when dillon harry salter and billy arrived at farley field lacey and parry were waiting lets go into the operations room and make sure ive got it right lacey said the quartermaster stood ready with dillons brownings two aksparachutes and jumpsuits ready dillon said have a word with mr salter sergeant major its his first jump is that so mr dillon the sergeant major replied face impassive then a word might be indicated just show me billy told him dillon went to the chart table and started to check it out with lacey and parry its not as bad as it could be lacey said theres almost a half moon one pass is all id recommend theres no time for more then well rush to st just sounds good to me the other chap lacey said he knows what hes doing absolutely ferguson and hannah bernstein came in when the brigadier saw the salters he was astonished for gods sake what is this you said two parachutists and he isnt a parachutist well i am now billy said i think ive got the hang of it dillon i pull this ring and thats it the guns are pretty obvious i managed kilbeg i can manage this this is madness hannah bernstein said no its trying to save blake johnsons life dillon said im ready when you are brigadier unless you have other ideas no ferguson said it makes the usual wild sense where you are concerned so lets get on with it harrys coming along for the ride dillon said i suggest you lot board and billy and i will change and follow as you wish ten minutes later dillon and billy in jumpsuits flak jackets parachutes shoulder holsters aks suspended across the chest went up the steps and took their seats parry dosed the door salter said christ billy you look like youre in a vietnam war movie or something what are you playing at billy actually smiled im playing at being me harry and it feels great blake sat down again on the stone seat in the tunnel waist deep in water hugging himself and trying to keep warm would dillon come fox seemed to expect it dangling him as bait it was an impossible situation but then dillon had always been master of the impossible somewhere high above through the thick walls of the old house he seemed to hear a noise far off something like an aircraft engine but he couldnt be sure the rat appeared and circled swimming i told you he said behave yourself the noise of the aircraft faded quickly falcone said what was that it could be normal air traffic at the raf place at st just fox said and then again it could be dillon wed better get ready he was standing by the fire in the great hall with falcone and russo get me a brandy first russo went to the sideboard filled a glass and brought it back rossi and cameci came in holding uzis falcone said excuse me signore but do you really think dillon will come i gave him enough clues hes smart hell come it was russo who said but what if they send the police dillon no its too personal for that hes not going to trust the police to do this for him but ferguson is secret intelligence falcone pointed out what if he decided to use special forces the sas same thing hes operated this whole thing very close to his chest publicity is the last thing he wants he wont change now low key thats the way theyll do it like in the bullring mano a mano handtohand facetoface as you say signore fox turned to rossi and cameci get out in the garden and keep watch check the doors they went out and he drank some of the brandy he was right in all respects except one dillon was already there as the gulfstream throttled back to almost stalling speed parry ran back opened the door and dropped the steps there was a rush of wind salter said christ almighty dillon turned and grinned at billy im an older guy you young bastard ill go first thanks very much get going dillon billy feeling totally insane pushed him out and dived after him there was rain light mist and yet the moon the house and estate were clear below dillon hit in no time at all punched the quick release after a perfect landing not even a roll and looked around he saw the other parachute billowing like some strange flower ran over and stamped on it billy sat up are you okay dillon asked i think so went backwards and hit my back he worked the muscles around but it feels okay dillon punched billys quick release then come on move it billy was on his feet in a moment jesus dillon i cant believe this is happening well it is kilbeg all over again except this time there are five bad guys out there waiting to pounce so be ready dillon trawled the gardens with the nightstalker and saw cameci over by the terrace take a look he whispered to billy billy nodded cant see anything else ill go left you right im with you dillon cameci was by the balustrade looking out over the moonlit garden when the muzzle of an nudged his back billy said make a sound and ill blow your spine apart cameci said is that dillon no im his younger brother billy called softly over here dillon moved out of the shadows and rossi on the other side of the terrace stood up it was billy who saw him dillon he rasped dillon turned his silenced ak coughed and rossi went backwards dead dillon took cameci by the jaw tell me whos inside and tell me now or ill kill you cameci terrified said signores fox falcone and russo dillon said excellent now what about the american hes in the tunnel in the cellars good take us there cameci led the way through the kitchen down the stairs and into the cellar system they arrived at an old oak door thats it cameci said then open it cameci did as he was told blake in the water turned the light falling across his face and dillon said what are you doing taking a dip this is no time for fun get the hell out of there blake stumbled up the steps what kept you he was shivering and very wet dillon said to cameci get your clothes off the mans freezing but signore cameci protested dillon shoved the muzzle of the ak under his chin just do it he pulled the combat scarf from around his neck and gave it to blake dry yourself a little blake did the best he would while cameci stripped blake pulled on the clothes cameci was left in his underpants meanwhile falcone upstairs had opened the french windows gone out on the terrace and found rossi he was back inside in an instant to fox and russo rossis out there dead no sign of cameci christ fox said hes here the bastards here spread out at that moment dillon shoved cameci into the room in his underpants and startled by the sudden apparition falcone turned and fired cameci went down writhing hey you got the wrong guy dillon called its me jack time to pay up fuck you dillon fox shouted they crouched in the hall the great chandelier hanging from the ceiling spreading its illumination falcone whispered to russo stick with me lets move towards the door to the kitchen quarters he saw fox moving to the right theres too much light russo said falcone fired his uzi up at the chandelier and brought it crashing down not any more he ducked pulling russo with him the hall was a strange place now only the light from the great log fire picking out the suits of armour the ancient banners the great staircase to the left dillon blake and billy crept in and crouched behind the great central table now what billy demanded just wait billy always hasten slowly he took out his browning and passed it to blake just in case how the hell did you get here anyway blake asked lacey and parry did a low pass and billy and i jumped dear god what does this boy know about parachuting a lot more than he did a couple of hours ago dont worry there are reinforcements coming a special forces team no ferguson hannah and harry salter christ almighty we can make it blake cameci and rossi are down that just leaves falcone russo and good old jack fox so how do we do it billy asked ive told you we wait billy and let them come to us there was quiet falcone and russo had reached the green baize door leading to the kitchen fox had reached another door to one side of the fireplace he opened it and went up a spiral staircase to the landing peered down at the hall and saw a movement behind the table beneath his foot a board creaked the bastards somewhere above us dillon said slide off to the right billy billy moved away and dillon called why jack here we are again at the final end of things he pushed blake away get over to the shadows on the other side up above jack fox moved crouching by the switches for the wall lights that normally illuminated the collection of paintings that hung on the wall he paused and reached below blake started to move slipped and cried out in pain as he fell on his arm dillon reached down to pick him up and fox switched on the lights ive got you now you bastard he raised the walther in his right hand and shot dillon twice in the back to do it he had to stand and so did billy over to the right raising his ak he pumped ten rounds into fox driving him back across the landing fox bounced off the wall back to the balustrade and fell over he lay there on the stone flagging twitching for just a second then there was silence falcone eased open the green baize door and said were out of here where to russo asked the airstrip weve got to get to london don marcos due in and weve got to give him the news russo said sometimes they kill the messenger not now this is too important they slid back through the door went down the steps and made the courtyard a few moments later they were driving away to the airstrip in the hall dillon had been thrown onto his face by the force of the bullets hed taken in his back groaning he forced himself up billy ran over crouching dillon are you all right yes thank god for flak jackets ill be a little sore thats all he looked around anyone there he called there was silence blake said are you okay sean yes im fine i think theyve run for it i heard a car leaving he got up and walked to jack foxs body and blake fol lowed they stood looking down well there you go blake hes paid the price youve got your revenge now blake said not really fox gave the order but falcone boasted to me that it was he and russo who killed my wife and where are they billy asked come with me and ill show you dillon said he went and opened the front door and stood at the top of the steps and billy and blake followed a moment later there was the sound of an aircraft engine as a plane passed over there they are billy falcone and russo getting out while they still can as they turned to the door an raf land rover drove into the courtyard hannah bernstein at the wheel and ferguson and harry salter in the rear standing by the fire in the hall harry salter said are you okay billy hes better than okay dillon said fox shot me in the back twice only my flak jacket saved me and billy blew the bastard away he turned thats three billy youre an ace so what happens now sir hannah bernstein asked shall i notify the cornwall constabulary i think not ferguson said leave this for the caretaker to discover fox and these other two rogues are on scotland yards intelligence information computer this whole thing is obviously a mafia feud therefore its nothing to do with us but sir hannah said superintendent be sensible that would be the best way of handling it so dont lets argue now lets get out of here and back to st just on the golden eagle falcone called don marco on his mobile the don was about to board his gulfstream in new york aldo what news do you have for me terrible don marco how can i tell you don marco said by getting on with it afterwards he said poor jack so stupid so headstrong what shall i do signore nothing at the moment there is obviously a matter of family honour here but well discuss that later when im in london as you say don marco on board the gulfstream bearing dillon and the others to farley field fergusons mobile sounded he hesitated then passed it to dillon i think you need to deal with this roper said i had a call from hannah so i know whats gone down im glad youre still with us so am v ive trawled the solazzo family affairs the golden eagle just landed at bardsey with two passengers falcone and russo anything else well youll love this don marco solazzo is en route from new york in one of the family gulfstreams booked in at the dorchester dillon laughed well that really is going to make it old home week and he switched off london there was fog at heathrow airport and don marcos gulfstream was diverted to shannon in ireland it was several hours before it was once again in the air it eventually landed in the private aircraft section at heathrow where falcone and russo waited with the dons favourite car a bentley falcone kissed the dons hand my condolences don marco everything that could be done was done you dont need to tell me aldo lets get going then we speak russo did the driving don marco said a little brandy aldo falcone opened the small bar in the rear of the bentleyfound the right bottle and a glass don marco sipped a little and nodded fine so now tell me tell me everything later in the oliver messel suite at the dorchester he stood at the open french window rain drifting across the mayfair rooftops to his terrace get me a cigar he told falcone in the crocodile case falcone nodded to russo who quickly opened the case that was on the sideboard he took out a romeo and julietta havana clipped the end and gave it to falcone who warmed it with a large match and passed it to the old man don marco lit up jack was stupid jack was greedy and headstrong but jack was also my nephew half of him was solazzo flesh and blood all men are a mixture of things aldo rain swept across the roofs with considerable force the curtains billowed and don marco nodded jack could be foolish he was certainly a thief whatever you mean by that but he was also a war hero and served his country we all know what signor fox was aldo said and we all know how he ended on his face at the hands of these people this dillon johnson brigadier ferguson the don turned not even angry there is a matter of honour here a debt must be paid money isnt everything in this world aldo of course don marco the old man bit on the cigar took out his wallet and extracted a card that carried some phone numbers i think the third one is fergusons office at the ministry of defence try it it was twothirty at the dark man and they were all there in the end booth harry and billy baxter and hall against the wall dillon and blake ferguson and hannah hannahs mobile rang and she answered all right tell me she switched off priority intelligence at scotland yard keeping me informed it seems there were three killings in cornwall all known members of the mafia well there you are dillon said billy was laughing surprise surprise harry said here now you watch it doesnt go to your head billy the kid dillon said in the battle of britain hed have earned a dfc dora brought a bottle of bollinger and glasses on a tray thumbed off the cork and poured billy said thats it then not really billy dillon took a glass i mean why is good old don marco solazzo flying to london to see his doctor to get measured for a new suit in savile row he shook his head vendetta billy killone of our own we kill you harry said you think that i think that blake said so it isnt over harry said last act dillon shrugged youd need shakespeare to write it hes not available hes bleeding dead billy told him it was then that fergusons mobile rang he listened then switched off the ministry of defence don marco solazzo wanting a word hes at the dorchester he turned to hannah would you mind getting him for me superintendent dora brought her the bar phone and hannah called the dorchester and asked for the don solazzo here i have brigadier ferguson for you she passed the phone to ferguson who switched to audio so they could all listen what a surprise i doubt that brigadier condolences on the death of your nephew and congratulations to dillon i suppose not at all your nephew was disposed of by an east end gangster from a family that isnt in the least intimidated by the mafia dont let us play games ferguson this affair has gone on long enough and my nephew is dead i think its time for us to meet and arrange a compromise that sounds sensible when do you suggest the old man was tranquil thats up to you but i think it should be just the two of us i dont want dillon and johnson there ill call back hannah bernstein said hes lying sir of course he turned to dillon well he said he didnt want me and johnson there that means he does if he knew billy had killed jack fox hed want him there this is a mafia thing honour family revenge hell kill us all if he can its funny we talk capitalistic values in society but this kind of thing is the ultimate example of money being of no value so what are we talking about here it was blake who answered id say a facetoface meet where hell have his people obviously falcone and russo and hell take it for granted that youll do the same not that hell think im much help but theres dillon and who knows theres me billy said yeah well just hold your tongue youre getting too much of a taste for this billy this isnt dodge city harry salter said its better than dodge city billy told him fine ferguson nodded but what happens now you arrange a meeting dillon told him but where hardly the piano bar at the dorchester dillon thought about it then turned to salter those boats of yours on the thames harry something from westminster to chelsea or whatever the bluebell salter said that goes from westminster dillon turned to ferguson choose one of the evening times arrange to meet him on board just the two of you hannah said urgently but he wont go alone of course not hell have falcone and russo with him he smiled at ferguson hell certainly expect me and maybe blake blake was sweating again his arm back in a sling not that im any good yeah well i bleeding am billy said all right ferguson nodded so we meet and what happens he kills us if he can its the last act you see dillon told him hannah said look i think this is getting out of hand sir weve already breached all police codes by our behaviour in the cornish matter dillon said youre a good copper and ive worked with you for some years but were talking about some of the worst people in the business and i want to finally put them out of business and im talking about the law she cried which people like solazzo play games with lawyers are part of the law the solazzos are able to buy the best lawyers does that satisfy your fine moral conscience hannah because it does nothing for me i shall take those bastards out there was a heavy silence ferguson said well superintendent there was another pause blake said falcone and russo killed my wife and yet well never prove that hannah bernstein was obviously distressed i know and its terrible but without the law weve got nothing even if they walk free blake said im afraid so dillon said well youve got me and im going to play public executioner again hannah stood up i cant manage this sir she said to ferguson then i suggest you take a couple of weeks leave superintendent and i would remind you that you signed the official secrets act when you joined me of course sir off you go then she went out and ferguson said now how do we handle this increased in force as darkness fell and the bentley arrived at westminster pier and don marco got out and walked up the gangplank falcone and russo had joined the boat on its earlier trip dressed in jeans and reefer coats the kind of thing crew members wore so did billy and harry salter the fog was quite bad and rain fell heavily the bluebell nosed out into the river and don marco walked out of the saloon where there were only two other passengers old ladies and on to the stern where there was a certain cover from the upper deck he lit his cigar and ferguson moved out of the shadows don marco charles ferguson ah brigadier fog swirled in there was a seaman coiling a rope at the starboard rail one of yours ferguson asked oh come now brigadier all i want to do is bring this whole unfortunate affair to an end my nephew was stupid i acknowledge that he wasnt only stupid he was murderous ferguson told him having said that dont tell me you dont want revenge what would be the point you know something ferguson said the older i get the more obvious to me it is that lifes like the movies take this situation its the gunfight at the ok corral earp and the clantons whos going to shoot whom i mean my dear old stick why would an ageing mafia don go to all the trouble of coming here the seaman at the rail falcone stood up and another at the port rail appeared russo on the top deck billy and harry salter looked over billy holding a silenced ak out of the shadows dillon appeared blake beside him his right arm in the sling sweating badly don marco said you dont look good mr johnson oh ill get by blake turned to falcone you butchered my wife hey it was business falcone had a gun in his hand well this is personal blakes left hand came out of his sling holding a silenced walther and he shot falcone knocking him against the rail falcone spun round and went over head first into the river russo raised his gun to ferguson and billy leaning over the rail on the top deck extended the silenced ak and gave russo a burst that sent him over the rail after falcone blake was really very ill sweat all over his face he said to don marco why the hell i dont kill you ill never know but we ruined your nephew killed the bastard and his men i think id rather leave you to chew on that he turned and he and ferguson walked away dillon lit a cigarette hes one of the good guys blake wants to improve the world even ferguson still tries but not me ive found life more disappointing than id hoped so to hell with you he slapped don marco backhanded across the face reached for his ankles and tossed him over into the river the fog swirled a cigar butt floated smouldering on the water it was over they were waiting for him in the daimler on charing cross pier ferguson said taken care of dillon nodded whichever gang took out jack fox and his men in cornwall was obviously laying in wait for don marco here another mafia execution very messy all in all then ferguson said a satisfactory night except for one thing they turned to the figure who sat slumped and ashen in the dark blake looked at them his eyes burning it wont bring her back and to that there was no answer
