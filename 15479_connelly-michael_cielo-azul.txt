michael connelly cielo azul on the way up the cars air conditioner gave up shortly after bakersfield it was september and hot as i pushed through the middle of the state pretty soon i could feel my shirt start to stick to the vinyl seat i pulled off my tie and unbuttoned my collar i didnt know why i had put a tie on in the first place i wasnt on the clock and i wasnt going anywhere that required a tie i tried to ignore the heat and concentrate on how i would try to handle seguin but that was like the heat i knew there was no way to handle him somehow it had always been the other way around seguin had the handle on me made my shirt stick to my back one way or the other that would end on this trip i turned my wrist on the steering wheel and checked the date on my timex exactly twelve years since the day i had met seguin since i had looked into the cold green eyes of a killer the case began on mulholland drive the winding snake of a road that follows the spine of the santa monica mountains a group of high schoolers had pulled off the road to drink their beer and look down upon the smoggy city of dreams one of them spotted the body nestled among the mountain brush and the beer cans and tequila bottles tossed down by past revelers the woman was naked her arms and legs stretched outward in some sort of grotesque display of sex and murder the call went to me and my partner frankie sheehan at the time we worked out of the lapds robberyhomicide division the crime scene was treacherous the body was snagged on an incline with a better than sixtydegree grade one slip and a person could tumble all the way down the mountainside maybe end up in somebodys hot tub down below or on somebodys concrete patio we wore jumpsuits and leather harnesses and were lowered down to the body by firemen from the th battalion the scene was clean no clothes no id no physical evidence no clues but the dead woman we didnt even find any fibers that were going to be useful this was unusual for a homicide i studied the victim closely and realized she was barely a womanprobably still a teenager mexican or of mexican descent she had brown hair brown eyes and a dark complexion i could tell that in life she had been beautiful to look at in death she was heartbreaking my partner always said the most dangerous women were the ones like her beautiful in life heartbreaking in death they could haunt you stick with you even if you found the monster that took everything from her she had been strangled the indentations of her killers thumbs clear on her neck the petechial hemorrhaging putting a murderous rouge around her eyes rigor mortis had come and gone she was loose that told us she had been dead more than twentyfour hours the guess was that she had been dumped the night before under cover of darkness that meant she had been lying dead somewhere else for twelve hours or more that other place was the true crime scene it was the place we needed to find when i turned the car inland toward the bay the air finally began to cool i skirted the east side of the bay up to oakland and then went across the bridge into san francisco before crossing the golden gate i stopped for a hamburger at the balboa bar grill i get to san francisco two or three times a year on cases i always eat at the balboa this time i ate at the bar glancing occasionally up at the television to see the giants playing in chicago they were losing but mostly i rolled the old case back and forth in my head it was a closed case now and seguin would never hurt another person again except himself his last victim would be himself but still the case stuck with me a killer was caught tried and convicted and now stood to be executed for his crimes but there was still an unanswered question that stuck with me it was what put me on the road to san quentin on my day off we didnt know her name fingerprints from the body matched no prints contained in computerized records her description matched no description on an active missing persons case anywhere in los angeles county or on national crime computer systems an artists rendering of her face put on the tv news and in the papers brought no calls from a loved one or an acquaintance sketches faxed to five hundred police agencies across the southwest and to the state judicial police in mexico drew no responses the victim remained unclaimed and unidentified her body reposing in the refrigerator at the coroners office while sheehan and i worked the case it was tough most cases start with the victim who that person was and where she lived becomes the center of the wheel the grounding point everything comes from the center but we didnt have that and we didnt have the true crime scene we had nothing and we were going nowhere all that changed with teresa corazon she was the deputy coroner assigned to the case officially known as jane doe while preparing the body for an autopsy she came across the lead that would take us first to mccaleb and then to seguin corazon found that the victims body had apparently been washed with an industrial strength cleaner before being discarded on the hillside it was an attempt by the killer to destroy trace evidence this in itself however was both a solid clue and trace evidence the cleaning agent could help lead to the killers identity or help tie him to the crime however it was another discovery made by corazon that turned the case for us while photographing the body the deputy coroner noticed an impression in the skin on the rear left hip postmortem lividity indicated the blood in the body had settled on the left half meaning the body had been lying on its left side in the time between the stilling of the heart and the dropping of the body down the hillside off of mulholland the evidence indicated that during the time that the blood settled the body had been lying on top of the object that left the impression on the hip using angled light to study the impression corazon found that she could clearly see the number the letter j and part of a third letter that could have been the upper left stem of an h a k or an l a license plate i said when she called me to the autopsy suite to view the discovery he put her down on a license plate exactly detective bosch said corazon sheehan and i quickly formed the theory that whoever had killed the woman with no name had hidden the body in the trunk of a car until it was nighttime and safe to take it up to mulholland and dump it after carefully cleaning the body the killer put it into the trunk of his car mistakenly putting it down on part of a license plate that had been taken off the car and also placed in the trunk that part of the theory was that the license plate had been removed and possibly replaced with a stolen plate as one more safety measure that would help the killer avoid detection if his car happened to be spotted by a suspicious passerby at the mulholland overlook the skin impression gave no indication of what state issued the license plate but the use of the mulholland outlook gave us the idea that we were looking for someone familiar with the area a local we began with the california department of motor vehicles and obtained a list of every car registered in los angeles county that carried a plate beginning jh jk and jl the list contained over one thousand names of car owners we then cut forty percent of those names by discounting the female owners the remaining names were slowly fed into the national crime index computer and we came up with a list of thirtysix men with criminal records ranging from minor to the extreme the first time i studied the list of thirtysix i knew i felt certain that one of the names on it belonged to the killer of the woman with no name the golden gate lived up to its name in the afternoon sun it was packed with cars going both ways and the tourist turnoff on the north side had the lot full sign up i kept moving into the rainbowpainted tunnel and through the mountain soon enough i could see san quentin up on the right a forebodinglooking place in an idyllic spot it housed the worst criminals california had to offer and i was going to see the worst of the worst harry bosch i turned from the window where i had been looking down at the white stones of the veterans cemetery across wilshire a man in a white shirt and maroon tie stood holding open the door to the fbi offices he looked like he was in his midthirties with a lean build and healthy look about him he was smiling terry mccaleb thats me we shook hands and he invited me back leading me through a warren of woodpaneled hallways and offices until we came to his it looked like it might have been a janitors closet at one time it was smaller than a solitary confinement cell and had just enough room for a desk and two chairs guess its a good thing my partner didnt want to come i said squeezing into the room frankie sheehan alternately referred to criminal profiling as buroh bullshit and quantico quackery when i had chosen a week earlier to contact mccaleb the resident profiler in the bureaus la office there had been an argument about it but i was lead on the case i made the call yeah things are kind of tight here mccaleb said but at least i get a private space most cops i know like being in a squad room they like the camaraderie i guess mccaleb just nodded and said i like being alone he pointed to the guest chair and i sat down i noticed a photo of a teenaged girl taped to the wall above his desk she looked to be just a few years younger than my victim i thought that if maybe it were mccalebs daughter it would be a little plus for me something that would make him put a little extra drive into my case shes not my daughter mccaleb said shes from an old case a florida case i just looked at him it wouldnt be the last time he seemed to know my thoughts like i was saying them out loud so still no id on yours right no nothing yet that always makes it tough so on your message you said youd reviewed the file yes i did i had sent copies of the murder book and all crime scene photographs the week before we had not videotaped the crime scene and this distressed mccaleb but i had been able to get tape of the scene from a television reporter his stations chopper had been in the air over the crime scene but had not aired any footage because of the graphic nature of its contents mccaleb opened a file on his desk and referred to it before speaking first of all are you familiar with our vicap program violent criminal apprehension i know what it is this is the first time i ever submitted a case yes youre a rarity in the lapd most of you guys dont want or trust the help but a few more guys like you and maybe i can get a bigger office i nodded i wasnt going to tell him that it was institutional distrust and suspicion that stopped most lapd detectives from seeking the help of the bureau it was an unspoken dictate that came from the police chief himself it was said that the chief could be heard cursing loudly in his office every time news of an fbi arrest within city limits was reported it was well known in the department that the bank robbery squad routinely monitored the radio transmissions of the bureaus bank squad and often moved in on suspects before the feds got the chance yeah well i just want to clear the case i said i dont really care if youre a psychic or santa claus if youve got something that will help me ill listen well i think maybe i do he turned the page in the file and picked up a stack of crime scene photographs these were not the photos i had sent him these were x blowups of the original crime scene photos he had made these on his own it told me that mccaleb had certainly spent some time with the case it made me think that maybe it had hooked him the way it had hooked me a woman with no name left dead on the hillside a woman no one had come forward to claim a woman no one cared about the dangerous kind in my secret heart i cared and i had claimed her and now maybe mccaleb had too let me just start with my overview of what i think youve got here mccaleb said he shuffled through the photos for a moment ending with a still that had been made off of the news video it showed an aerial shot of the naked body arms and legs stretched wide on the hillside i took out my cigarettes and shook one out of the pack you may have already arrived at these same conclusions if so i apologize i dont want to waste your time by the way you cant smoke in here dont worry about it i said putting the smokes away what have you got the crime scene is very important in that it gives us an avenue to the killers thinking what i see here suggests the work of what we call an exhibition killer in other words this is a killer who wanted his crime to be seento be very publicand by virtue of this to instill horror and fear in the general population from this reaction by the public he draws his gratification he is somebody who reads the newspapers and watches the news for any information or update on the investigation it is a way of keeping score so when we find him i think we will find newspaper clippings and maybe even videos containing television reports on the case these will probably be in his bedroom because they would be useful to him in carrying out masturbatory fantasies i noticed he had said we in reference to the case investigators but i didnt react mccaleb went on as if he was talking to himself and there was no one else in the office a component of the exhibition killers fantasy is the duel exhibiting his crime to the public includes exhibiting it to the police in effect he is throwing down a challenge he is saying i am better than you smarter and more clever prove me wrong if you can catch me if you can you see he is dueling with you in the public media arena with me yes you in this case in particular you appear to be the media front man it is your name in the newspaper stories included in the file im lead on the case ive been the one talking to the reporters mccaleb nodded okay i said all this is good in terms of understanding what a nut job this guy is but what do you have that will help point us to the right guy mccaleb nodded you know how the realtors say location location location its the same with me the place he chose to leave her is significant in that it plays into his exhibitionistic tendencies you have the hollywood hills here you have mulholland drive and the view of the city this victim was not dropped here randomly this place was chosen perhaps just as carefully as she was chosen as a victim the conclusion is that the drop site is a place our killer may be familiar with because of the routines of his life but nonetheless was not chosen because of reasons of convenience he chose this spot he wanted this spot because it was the best spot to announce his work to the world it was part of the canvas it means he could have come from a long distance to leave her there he could have come a few blocks i noticed the use of our as in our killer i knew if frankie had come with me he wouldve blown a gasket by now i let it go did you look at the list i gave you of the names yes i looked at everything and i think your instincts are good the two potential suspects you highlighted both fit into the profile i constructed for this killing late twenties with a history of crimes of escalating nature the woodland hills janitor has routine access to industrial cleanerswe could match something to the cleaning agent used on the body hes the one we like best mccaleb nodded but didnt say anything he seemed to be studying the photographs which were now spread across the desk you like the other guy dont you the stage builder from burbank mccaleb looked up at me yes i like him better his crimes though minor fall more into line with the sexual predator maturation models we have seen i think when we talk to him we have to make sure we do it in his home well get a better feel for him well know we yes and we need to do it soon he nodded to the photos covering his desk this wasnt a one shot deal whoever he is hes going to do it again if he hasnt already i had been responsible for many men going to san quentin but i had never been there myself before at the gate i showed id and was given a printout with instructions that directed me to a fenced lot for law enforcement vehicles at a nearby door marked law enforcement personnel only i was ushered through the great wall of the prison and my weapon was taken and locked in a gun vault i was given a red plastic chit with the number printed on it after my name was put into the computer and the prearranged clearances were noted a guard who didnt bother introducing himself walked me through an empty recreation yard to a brick building that had darkened over time to a fireplace black it was the death house the place where seguin would get the juice in one weeks time we moved through a man trap and a metal detector and i was passed off to a new guard he opened a solid steel door and pointed me down a hall last one on the right he said when you want out wave at one of the cameras well be watching he left me there closing the steel door with a thunderous bang that seemed to reverberate through my marrow frankie sheehan wasnt happy about it but i was the lead and i made the call i allowed mccaleb to come with us on the interviews we started with victor seguin he was first on mccalebs list second on mine but there was something about the intensity in mccalebs eyes and words that made me defer and go with seguin first seguin was a stage builder who lived on screenland drive in burbank it was a small house with a lot of woodwork you might expect to find in a carpenters house it looked as though when seguin wasnt finding movie work he was home building handsome window boxes and planters for the house the ford taurus with the license plate containing jk on it was parked in the driveway i put my hand on the hood as we walked up the driveway to the door it was cold at pm just as the light was leaving the sky i knocked on the front door seguin answered in blue jeans and a tshirt no shoes i saw his eyes go wide when he looked at me he knew who i was before i held up the badge and said my name i felt the cold finger of adrenaline slide down my back i remembered what mccaleb had said about the killer tracking the police while they tracked him i had been on tv talking about the case i had been in the papers giving nothing away i calmly said mr seguin i am detective harry bosch with the lapd is that your car in the driveway yeah its mine what about it whats going on we need to ask you about it if you dont mind can we come in for a few minutes well no id first like to know what thank you i moved through the threshold forcing him to step back the others followed me in hey wait a minute what is this we had worked it out before wed arrived the interview was mine to conduct sheehan was second seat mccaleb said he just wanted to observe the living room was carpenter overkill builtin bookshelves on three walls a wooden mantel that was too big for the room had been built around the small brick fireplace a floor to ceiling television cabinet was built in place as a divider between the sitting area and what looked like a little office space i nodded approvingly nice work you get a lot of downtime with your work seguin reluctantly nodded did most of this when we had a strike a couple years ago what do you do stage builder look what is this about my car you cant just push your way in here like this i have rights why dont you sit down mr seguin and ill explain we believe your car was possibly used in the commission of a serious crime seguin dropped into a soft chair positioned for best viewing of the television i noticed that mccaleb was moving about the outer edges of the room studying the books on the shelves and the various knickknacks displayed on the mantel and other surfaces sheehan sat down on the couch to seguin s left he stared at him coldly wordlessly what crime a murder i let that sink in but it appeared to me that seguin had recovered from his initial shock and was hardening i had seen this before he was going to try to ride it out does anyone drive your car besides you mr seguin sometimes if i loan it to somebody what about three weeks ago august fifteenth did you lend it to anybody i dont know id have to check i dont think i want to answer any more questions and i think i want you people to leave now mccaleb slid into the seat to seguin s right i remained standing i looked at mccaleb and he nodded slightly and only once but i knew what he was telling me hes the guy i looked at my partner sheehan had missed the sign from mccaleb because he had not taken his eyes off seguin i had to make a call go with mccalebs signal or back out i looked back at mccaleb he looked up at me his eyes as intense as any i had ever seen i signaled seguin to stand up mr seguin i need you to stand up for me i am placing you under arrest on suspicion of murder seguin slowly came to his feet and then made a sudden move toward the door but sheehan was ready for it and was all over him and had his face down in the carpet before he had gotten three feet frankie pulled his arms behind his back and cuffed them i then helped him pull seguin to his feet and we walked him out to the car leaving mccaleb behind frankie stayed with the suspect as soon as i could i came back inside i found mccaleb still sitting in the chair what was it mccaleb reached out his arm to the nearest bookshelf this is his reading chair he said he pulled a book off the shelf and this is his favorite book the book was badly worn its spine cracked and its pages weathered by repeated readings as mccaleb thumbed the pages i could see paragraphs and sentences had been underlined by hand i reached over and closed the book so i could read the cover it was called the collector ever read it mccaleb asked no what is it its about a guy who abducts women he collects them keeps them in his house in the basement i nodded terry we need to back out of here and get a search warrant i want to do this right so do i seguin was sitting on the bed in his cell looking at a chessboard set up on the toilet he didnt look up when i came to the bars though i could tell my shadow had fallen across the game board who are you playing i asked somebody who died sixtyfive years ago they put his best momentthis gamein a book and he lives on hes eternal he looked up at me then his eyes still the samecold green killers eyesin a body turned pasty and weak from twelve years in small windowless rooms detective bosch i wasnt expecting you until next week i shook my head im not coming next week you dont want to see the show to see the glory of the righteous doesnt do it for me back when they used the gas maybe thatd be worth seeing but watching some asshole on a massage table get the needle and then drift off to nevernever land nah im going to go see the dodgers play the giants that day already got my ticket seguin stood up and approached the bars i remembered the hours we had spent in the interrogation room close like this the body was worn but not the eyes they were unchanged those eyes were the signature of all the evil i had ever known then what is it that brings you to me here today detective he smiled at me his teeth yellowed his gums as gray as the walls i knew then that the trip had been a mistake i knew then that he would not give me what i wanted and release me two hours after we put seguin in the car two other detectives from rhd arrived with a signed search warrant for the house and car because we were in the city of burbank i had routinely notified the local authorities of our presence and a burbank detective team and two patrol officers arrived on scene while the patrol officers kept a vigil on seguin the rest of us began the search we spread out the house had no basement mccaleb and i took the master bedroom and terry immediately noticed wheels had been attached to the legs of the bed he dropped to his knees pushed the bed aside and there was a trapdoor in the wood floor there was a padlock on it while mccaleb went off into the house to find the key i took my picks out of my wallet and worked the lock i was alone in the room as i fumbled with the lock i banged it against the metal hasp and i thought i heard a noise from beyond the door in response it was far away and muffled but to me it was the sound of terror in someones voice my insides seized with my own terror and hope i worked the lock with all my skill and in another thirty seconds it came open got it mccaleb i got it mccaleb came rushing back into the room and we pulled open the door revealing a sheet of plywood below with finger latches at the four corners we raised this next and there beneath the floor was a young girl she was blindfolded gagged and her hands were shackled behind her back she was naked beneath a dirty pink blanket but she was alive she turned and pushed herself into the soundproofing padding that lined the coffinlike box it was as if she were trying to get away i realized then that she thought the opening of the door had been him coming back to her seguin its okay mccaleb said were here to help mccaleb reached down into the box and gently touched her shoulder she startled like an animal but then calmed mccaleb then lay down flat on the floor and reached into the box to start removing the blindfold and gag harry get an ambulance i stood up and stepped back from the scene i felt my chest growing tight a clarity of thought coming over me in all my years i had spoken for the dead many times i had avenged the dead i was at home with the dead but i had never so clearly had a part of pulling someone away from the outstretched hands of death and in that moment i knew we had just done that and i knew that whatever happened afterward and wherever my life took me i would always have this moment that it would be a light that could lead me out of the darkest of tunnels harry what are you doing get an ambulance i looked at him yeah right away the woodworkers cell was all concrete and steel it had been a decade since he had run his fingers over the grain of wood i stepped closer to the bars and looked in at him youre running out of time youve exhausted your appeals youve got a governor who needs to show hes tough on crime this is it victor a week from today you take the needle i waited for a reaction but there was nothing he just looked at me and waited for what he knew i would ask time to come clean tell me who she was tell me where you took her from he moved closer to the bars close enough for me to smell the decay in his breath i didnt back away all these years bosch all these years and you still need to know why is that i just need to you and mccaleb what about him oh he came to see me too i knew mccaleb was out of the life the job had taken his heart he got a transplant and moved to catalina he was running a fishing charter when did he come oh let me see time is so hard to track here a few months ago dropped by for a chat with his new heart terry did said he was in the neighborhood he didnt like my review of the film what did you think of it he was talking about the film in which clint eastwood portrayed mccaleb i didnt see it what did he want when he came here he wanted to know the same thing who was the girl where did she come from he told me you gave her a name back then during the trial cielo azul thats really very pretty detective bosch blue sky why did you choose that he told you that yes standing right where you are standing thats unprofessional isnt it detective bosch to get close like that that could be dangerous to let a woman in like that dead or alive i wanted to go to get away from him look seguin are you going to tell me or not or are you just going to take it with you he smiled and stepped back from the bars he walked over to the chessboard and seemed to look down at it to consider a move you know they used to let me keep a cat in here i miss that cat he picked up one of the plastic game pieces but then hesitated and returned it to the same spot he turned and looked at me you know what i think i think that you two cant stand the thought of that girl not having a name not coming from a home with a mommy and a daddy and a little baby brother the idea of no one caring and no one missing her it leaves you hollow doesnt it i just want to close the case oh but it is closed youre not here because of any case you are here on your own admit it detective just as mccaleb came on his own the idea of that pretty little thingand by the way if you thought she was beautiful in death then you should have seen her beforethe idea of her lying unclaimed in an unmarked grave all this time undercuts everything you do doesnt it its a loose end i dont like loose ends its more than that detective i know i said nothing hoping that if he kept on talking he would make a mistake her face was like an angels he said and that long brown hair i was always a sucker for that kind of hair i can still remember its smell she told me she used a strawberry and cream shampoo i didnt even know they put that stuff in shampoo man he was taunting me the whole idea i had of getting him to tell me her name seemed absurd now she was one of those women you know no i dont know why dont you tell me well she had that thing that power that was why i chose her what power you know she could wound you with just a look face like an angel but a body like have you ever noticed how red cars look like theyre going fast even if theyre just sitting still she was like that she was dangerous she had to go if i didnt do it she wouldve done it to us a lot of us he smiled at me and i knew he was still pulling the strings he was giving me nothing just trying to get a rise out of me hey bosch what if a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it does it make a sound his smile opened even broader if a woman is murdered in the city and nobody cares does it matter i care exactly he came back to the bars and you need me to relieve you of that burden by giving you a name a mommy and daddy who care he was a foot away from me i could reach through the bars and grab his throat if i wanted to but that would be what hed want me to do well i wont release you detective you put me in this cage i put you in that one he stepped back and pointed at me i looked down and realized both my hands were tightly gripped on the steel bars of the cage my cage i looked back up at him and his smile was back as guiltless as a babys funny isnt it i remember that daytwelve years ago today sitting in the back of the car while you cops played hero so full of yourselves for saving her bet you never thought it would come to this did you you saved one but you lost the other i lowered my head to the bars seguin youre going to burn you are going to hell yes i suppose so but i hear its a dry heat he laughed loudly and i looked at him dont you know detective you have to believe in heaven to believe in hell i abruptly turned from the bars and headed back toward the steel door above it i saw the mounted camera i made an open up gesture with my hand and picked up my speed as i got closer i needed to get out of there i heard seguin s voice echoing off the walls behind me ill keep her close bosch ill keep her right here with me eternally together eternally mine when i got to the steel door i hit it with both fists until i heard the electronic lock snap and the guard began to slide it open all right man all right whats the hurry just get me out of here i said as i pushed past him i could still hear seguin s voice echoing from the death house as i crossed back across the open
