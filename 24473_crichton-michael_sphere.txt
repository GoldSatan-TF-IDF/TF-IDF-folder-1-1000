michael crichton sphere for lynn nesbit when a scientist views things hes not considering the incredible at all louis i kahn you cant fool nature richard feynman during the preparation of this manuscript i received help and encouragement from caroline conley kurt villadsen lisa plonsker valery pine annemarie martin john deubert lynn nesbit and bob gottlieb i am grateful to them all the surface west of tonga for a long time the horizon had been a monotonous flat blue line separating the pacific ocean from the sky the navy helicopter raced forward flying low near the waves despite the noise and the thumping vibration of the blades norman johnson fell asleep he was tired he had been traveling on various military aircraft for more than fourteen hours it was not the kind of thing a fiftythreeyearold professor of psychology was used to he had no idea how long he slept when he awoke he saw that the horizon was still flat there were white semicircles of coral atolls ahead he said over the intercom whats this islands of ninihina and tafahi the pilot said technically part of tonga but theyre uninhabited good sleep not bad norman looked at the islands as they flashed by a curve of white sand a few palm trees then gone the flat ocean again whered they bring you in from the pilot asked san diego norman said i left yesterday so you came honoluluguampagohere thats right long trip the pilot said what kind of work you do sir im a psychologist norman said a shrink huh the pilot grinned why not theyve called in just about everything else how do you mean weve been ferrying people out of guam for the last two days physicists biologists mathematicians you name it everybody being flown to the middle of nowhere in the pacific ocean whats going on norman said the pilot glanced at him eyes unreadable behind dark aviator sunglasses theyre not telling us anything sir what about you whatd they tell you they told me norman said that there was an airplane crash uhhuh the pilot said you get called on crashes i have been yes for a decade norman johnson had been on the list of faa crashsite teams experts called on short notice to investigate civilian air disasters the first time had been at the united airlines crash in san diego in then he had been called to chicago in and dallas in each time the pattern was the samethe hurried telephone call frantic packing the absence for a week or more this time his wife ellen had been annoyed because he was called away on july which meant he would miss their july beach barbecue then too tim was coming back from his sophomore year at chicago on his way to a summer job in the cascades and amy now sixteen was just back from andover and amy and ellen didnt get along very well if norman wasnt there to mediate the volvo was making noises again and it was possible norman might miss his mothers birthday the following week what crash is it ellen had said i havent heard about any crash she turned on the radio while he packed there was no news on the radio of an airline crash when the car pulled up in front of his house norman had been surprised to see it was a navy pool sedan with a uniformed navy driver they never sent a navy car the other times ellen said following him down the stairs to the front door is this a military crash i dont know he said when will you be back he kissed her ill call you he said promise but he hadnt called everyone had been polite and pleasant but they had kept him away from telephones first at hickam field in honolulu then at the naval air station in guam where he had arrived at two in the morning and had spent half an hour in a room that smelled of aviation gasoline staring dumbly at an issue of the american journal of psychology which he had brought with him before flying on he arrived at pago pago just as dawn was breaking norman was hurried onto the big sea knight helicopter which immediately lifted off the cold tarmac and headed west over palm trees and rusty corrugated rooftops into the pacific he had been on this helicopter for two hours sleeping part of the time ellen and tim and amy and his mothers birthday now seemed very far away where exactly are we between samoa and fiji in the south pacific the pilot said can you show me on the chart im not supposed to do that sir anyway it wouldnt show much right now youre two hundred miles from anywhere sir norman stared at the flat horizon still blue and featureless i can believe it he thought he yawned dont you get bored looking at that to tell you the truth no sir the pilot said im real happy to see it flat like this at least weve got good weather and it wont hold theres a cyclone forming up in the admiralties should swing down this way in a few days what happens then everybody clears the hell out weather can be tough in this part of the world sir im from florida and i saw some hurricanes when i was a kid but youve never seen anything like a pacific cyclone sir norman nodded how much longer until we get there any minute now sir after two hours of monotony the cluster of ships appeared unusually interesting there were more than a dozen vessels of various kinds formed roughly into concentric circles on the outer perimeter he counted eight gray navy destroyers closer to the center were large ships that had widespaced double hulls and looked like floating drydocks then nondescript boxy ships with flat helicopter decks and in the center amid all the gray two white ships each with a flat pad and a bullseye the pilot listed them off you got your destroyers on the outside for protection rvss further in thats remote vehicle support for the robots then mss mission support and supply and osrvs in the center osrvs oceanographic survey and research vessels the pilot pointed to the white ships john hawes to port and william arthur to starboard well put down on the hawes the pilot circled the formation of ships norman could see launches running back and forth between the ships leaving small white wakes against the deep blue of the water all this for an airplane crash norman said hey the pilot grinned i never mentioned a crash check your seat belt if you would sir were about to land barnes the red bullseye grew larger and slid beneath them as the helicopter touched down norman fumbled with his seat belt buckle as a uniformed navy man ran up and opened the door dr johnson norman johnson thats right have any baggage sir just this norman reached back pulled out his day case the officer took it any scientific instruments anything like that no thats it this way sir keep your head down follow me and dont go aft sir norman stepped out ducking beneath the blades he followed the officer off the helipad and down a narrow stairs the metal handrail was hot to the touch behind him the helicopter lifted off the pilot giving him a final wave once the helicopter had gone the pacific air felt still and brutally hot good trip sir fine need to go sir ive just arrived norman said no i mean do you need to use the head sir no norman said good dont use the heads theyre all backed up all right plumbings been screwed up since last night were working on the problem and hope to have it solved soon he peered at norman we have a lot of women on board at the moment sir i see norman said theres a chemical john if you need it sir im okay thanks in that case captain barnes wants to see you at once sir id like to call my family you can mention that to captain barnes sir they ducked through a door moving out of the hot sun into a fluorescentlit hallway it was much cooler air conditioning hasnt gone out lately the officer said at least thats something does the air conditioning go out often only when its hot through another door and into a large workroom metal walls racks of tools acetylene torches spraying sparks as workmen hunched over metal pontoons and pieces of intricate machinery cables snaking over the floor we do rov repairs here the officer said shouting over the din most of the heavy work is done on the tenders we just do some of the electronics here we go this way sir through another door down another corridor and into a wide lowceilinged room crammed with video monitors a halfdozen technicians sat in shadowy halfdarkness before the color screens norman paused to look this is where we monitor the rovs the officer said weve got three or four robots down on the bottom at any given time plus the msbs and the fds of course norman heard the crackle and hiss of radio communications soft fragments of words he couldnt make out on one screen he saw a diver walking on the bottom the diver was standing in harsh artificial light wearing a kind of suit norman had never seen heavy blue cloth and a brightyellow helmet sculpted in an odd shape norman pointed to the screen how deep is he i dont know thousand twelve hundred feet something like that and what have they found so far just the big titanium fin the officer glanced around it doesnt read on any monitors now bill can you show dr johnson here the fin sorry sir the technician said present maincomops is working north of there in quadrant seven ah quad sevens almost half a mile away from the fin the officer said to norman too bad its a hell of a thing to see but youll see it later im sure this way to captain barnes they walked for a moment down the corridor then the officer said do you know the captain sir no why just wondered hes been very eager to see you calling up the com techs every hour to find out when youre arriving no norman said ive never met him very nice man i m sure the officer glanced over his shoulder you know they have a saying about the captain he said oh whats that they say his bite is worse than his bark through another door which was marked project commander and had beneath that a sliding plate that said capt harold c barnes usn the officer stepped aside and norman entered a paneled stateroom a burly man in shirtsleeves stood up from behind a stack of files captain barnes was one of those trim military men who made norman feel fat and inadequate in his middle forties hal barnes had erect military bearing an alert expression short hair a flat gut and a politicians firm handshake welcome aboard the hawes dr johnson howre you feeling tired norman said im sure im sure you came from san diego yes so its fifteen hours give or take like to have a rest id like to know whats going on norman said perfectly understandable barnes nodded whatd they tell you who the men who picked you up in san diego the men who flew you out here the men in guam whatever they didnt tell me anything and did you see any reporters any press no nothing like that barnes smiled good im glad to hear it he waved norman to a seat norman sat gratefully how about some coffee barnes said moving to a coffee maker behind his desk and then the lights went out the room was dark except for the light that streamed in from a side porthole god damn it barnes said not again emerson emerson an ensign came in a side door sir working on it captain what was it this time blew out in rov bay sir i thought we added extra lines to bay apparently they overloaded anyway sir i want this fixed now emerson we hope to have it solved soon sir the door closed barnes sat back in his chair norman heard the voice in the darkness its not really their fault he said these ships werent built for the kind of power loads we put on them now andah there we are the lights came back on barnes smiled did you say you wanted coffee dr johnson black is fine norman said barnes poured him a mug anyway im relieved you didnt talk to anybody in my job dr johnson security is the biggest worry especially on a thing like this if word gets out about this site well have all kinds of problems and so many people are involved now hell cinccompac didnt even want to give me destroyers until i started talking about soviet submarine reconnaissance the next thing i get four then eight destroyers soviet submarine reconnaissance norman asked thats what i told them in honolulu barnes grinned part of the game to get what you need for an operation like this youve got to know how to requisition equipment in the modern navy but of course the soviets wont come around they wont norman felt he had somehow missed the assumptions that lay behind the conversation and was trying to catch up its very unlikely oh they know were here theyll have spotted us with their satellites at least two days ago but were putting out a steady stream of decodable messages about our search and rescue exercises in the south pacific s and r drill represents a low priority for them even though they undoubtedly figure a plane went down and were recovering for real they may even suspect that were trying to recover nuclear warheads like we did off of spain in but theyll leave us alonebecause politically they dont want to be implicated in our nuclear problems they know we have troubles with new zealand these days is that what all this is norman said nuclear warheads no barnes said thank god anything nuclear somebody in the white house always feels dutybound to announce it but weve kept this one away from the white house staff in fact we bypass the jcs on this all briefings go straight from the defense secretary to the president personally he rapped his knuckles on the desk so far so good and youre the last to arrive now that youre here well shut this thing down tight nothing in nothing out norman still couldnt put it together if nuclear warheads arent involved in the crash he said why the secrecy well barnes said we dont have all the facts yet the crash occurred in the ocean yes more or less directly beneath us as we sit here then there cant be any survivors survivors barnes looked surprised no i wouldnt think so then why was i called here barnes looked blank well norman explained im usually called to crash sites when there are survivors thats why they put a psychologist on the team to deal with the acute traumatic problems of surviving passengers or sometimes the relatives of surviving passengers their feelings and their fears and their recurring nightmares people who survive a crash often experience all sorts of guilt and anxiety concerning why they survived and not others a woman sitting with her husband and children suddenly theyre all dead and she alone is alive that kind of thing norman sat back in his chair but in this casean airplane that crashed in a thousand feet of waterthere wouldnt be any of those problems so why am i here barnes was staring at him he seemed uncomfortable he shuffled the files around on his desk actually this isnt an airplane crash site dr johnson what is it its a spacecraft crash site there was a short pause norman nodded i see that doesnt surprise you barnes said no norman said as a matter of fact it explains a lot if a military spacecraft crashed in the ocean that explains why i havent heard anything about it on the radio why it was kept secret why i was brought here the way i was when did it crash barnes hesitated just a fraction before answering as best we can estimate he said this spacecraft crashed three hundred years ago ulf there was a silence norman listened to the drone of the air conditioner he heard faintly the radio communications in the next room he looked at the mug of coffee in his hand noticing a chip on the rim he struggled to assimilate what he was being told but his mind moved sluggishly in circles three hundred years ago he thought a spacecraft three hundred years old but the space program wasnt three hundred years old it was barely thirty years old so how could a spacecraft be three hundred years old it couldnt be barnes must be mistaken but how could barnes be mistaken the navy wouldnt send all these ships all these people unless they were sure what was down there a spacecraft three hundred years old but how could that be it couldnt be it must be something else he went over it again and again getting nowhere his mind dazed and shocked solutely no question about it barnes was saying we can estimate the date from coral growth with great accuracy pacific coral grows twoandahalf centimeters a year and the objectwhatever it isis covered in about five meters of coral thats a lot of coral of course coral doesnt grow at a depth of a thousand feet which means that the present shelf collapsed to a lower depth at some point in the past the geologists are telling us that happened about a century ago so were assuming a total age for the craft of about three hundred years but we could be wrong about that it could in fact be much older it could be a thousand years old barnes shifted papers on his desk again arranging them into neat stacks lining up the edges i dont mind telling you dr johnson this thing scares the hell out of me thats why youre here norman shook his head i still dont understand we brought you here barnes said because of your association with the ulf project ulf norman said and he almost added but ulf was a joke seeing how serious barnes was he was glad he had caught himself in time yet ulf was a joke everything about it had been a joke from the very beginning in in the waning days of the carter administration norman johnson had been an assistant professor of psychology at the university of california at san diego his particular research interest was group dynamics and anxiety and he occasionally served on faa crashsite teams in those days his biggest problems had been finding a house for ellen and the kids keeping up his publications and wondering whether ucsd would give him tenure normans research was considered brilliant but psychology was notoriously prone to intellectual fashions and interest in the study of anxiety was declining as many researchers came to regard anxiety as a purely biochemical disorder that could be treated with drug therapy alone one scientist had even gone so far as to say anxiety is no longer a problem in psychology there is nothing left to study similarly group dynamics was perceived as oldfashioned a field that had seen its heyday in the gestalt encounter groups and corporate brainstorming procedures of the early s but now was dated and passe norman himself could not comprehend this it seemed to him that american society was increasingly one in which people worked in groups not alone rugged individualism was now replaced by endless corporate meetings and group decisions in this new society group behavior seemed to him more important not less and he did not think that anxiety as a clinical problem was going to be solved with pills it seemed to him that a society in which the most common prescription drug was valium was by definition a society with unsolved problems not until the preoccupation with japanese managerial techniques in the s did normans field gain a new hold on academic attention around the same time valium dependence became recognized as a major concern and the whole issue of drug therapy for anxiety was reconsidered but in the meantime johnson spent several years feeling as if he were in a backwater he did not have a research grant approved for nearly three years tenure and finding a house were very real problems it was during the worst of this time in late that he was approached by a solemn young lawyer from the national security council in washington who sat with his ankle across his knee and plucked nervously at his sock the lawyer told norman that he had come to ask his help norman said he would help if he could still plucking at the sock the lawyer said he wanted to talk to norman about a grave matter of national security facing our country today norman asked what the problem was simply that this country has absolutely no preparedness in the event of an alien invasion absolutely no preparedness whatever because the lawyer was young and because he stared down at his sock as he spoke norman at first thought he was embarrassed at having been sent on a fools errand but when the young man looked up norman saw to his astonishment that he was utterly serious we could really be caught with our pants down on this one the lawyer said an alien invasion norman had to bite his lip thats probably true he said people in the administration are worried are they there is the feeling at the highest levels that contingency plans should be drawn you mean contingency plans in the event of an alien invasion norman somehow managed to keep a straight face perhaps said the lawyer perhaps invasion is too strong a word lets soften that to say contact alien contact i see youre already involved in civilian crashsite teams dr johnson you know how these emergency groups function we want your input concerning the optimal composition of a crashsite team to confront an alien invader i see norman said wondering how he could tactfully get out of this the idea was clearly ludicrous he could see it only as displacement the administration faced with immense problems it could not solve had decided to think about something else and then the lawyer coughed proposed a study and named a substantial figure for a twoyear research grant norman saw a chance to buy his house he said yes im glad you agree the problem is a real one oh yes norman said wondering how old this lawyer was he guessed about twentyfive well just have to get your security clearance the lawyer said i need security clearance dr johnson the lawyer said snapping his briefcase shut this project is top top secret thats fine with me norman said and he meant it he could imagine his colleagues reactions if they ever found out about this what began as a joke soon became simply bizarre over the next year norman flew five times to washington for meetings with highlevel officials of the national security council over the pressing imminent danger of alien invasion his work was very secret one early question was whether his project should be turned over to darpa the defense advanced research project agency of the pentagon they decided not to there were questions about whether it should be given to nasa and again they decided not to one administration official said this isnt a scientific matter dr johnson this is a national security matter we dont want to open it out norman was continually surprised at the level of the officials he was told to meet with one senior undersecretary of state pushed aside the papers on his desk relating to the latest middle east crisis to say what do you think about the possibility that these aliens will be able to read our minds i dont know norman said well it occurs to me howre we going to be able to formulate a negotiating posture if they can read our minds that could be a problem norman agreed sneaking a glance at his watch hell its bad enough our encrypted cables get intercepted by the russians we know the japanese and the israelis have cracked all our codes we just pray the russians cant do it yet but you see what i mean the problem about reading minds oh yes your report will have to take that into consideration norman promised it would a white house staffer said to him you realize the president will want to talk to these aliens personally hes that kind of man uhhuh norman said and i mean the publicity value here the exposure is incalculable the president meets with the aliens at camp david what a media moment a real moment norman agreed so the aliens will need to be informed by an advance man of who the president is and the protocol in talking to him you cant have the president of the united states talking to people from another galaxy or whatever on television without advance preparation do you think the aliensll speak english doubtful norman said so someone may need to learn their language is that it its hard to say perhaps the aliens would be more comfortable meeting with an advance man from one of our ethnic minorities the white house man said anyway its a possibility think about it norman promised he would think about it the pentagon liaison a major general took him to lunch and over coffee casually asked what sorts of armaments do you see these aliens having im not sure norman said well thats the crux of it isnt it and what about their vulnerabilities i mean the aliens might not even be human at all no they might not they might be like giant insects your insects can withstand a lot of radiation yes norman said we might not be able to touch these aliens the pentagon man said gloomily then he brightened but i doubt they could withstand a direct hit with a multimeg nuclear device do you no norman said i dont think they could itd vaporize em sure laws of physics right your report must make that point clearly about the nuclear vulnerability of these aliens yes norman said we dont want to start a panic the pentagon man said no sense getting everyone upset is there i know the jcs will be reassured to hear the aliens are vulnerable to our nuclear weapons ill keep that in mind norman said eventually the meetings ended and he was left to write his report and as he reviewed the published speculations on extraterrestrial life he decided that the major general from the pentagon was not so wrong after all the real question about alien contactif there was any real question at allconcerned panic psychological panic the only important human experience with extraterrestrials had been orson welless radio broadcast of the war of the worlds and the human response was unequivocal people had been terrified norman submitted his report entitled contact with possible extraterrestrial life it was returned to him by the nsc with the suggestion that the title be revised to sound more technical and that he remove any suggestion that alien contact was only a possibility as alien contact is considered virtually certain in some quarters of the administration revised normans paper was duly classified top secret under the title recommendations for the human contact team to interact with unknown life forms ulf as norman envisioned it the ulf contact team demanded particularly stable individuals in his report he had said i wonder barnes said opening a folder if you recognize this quote contact teams meeting an unknown life form ulf must be prepared for severe psychological impact extreme anxiety responses will almost certainly occur the personality traits of individuals who can withstand extreme anxiety must be determined and such individuals selected to comprise the team anxiety when confronted by unknown life has not been sufficiently appreciated the fears unleashed by contact with a new life form are not understood and cannot be entirely predicted in advance but the most likely consequence of contact is absolute terror barnes snapped the folder shut you remember who said that yes norman said i do and he remembered why he had said it as part of the nsc grant norman had conducted studies of group dynamics in contexts of psychosocial anxiety following the procedures of asch and milgram he constructed several environments in which subjects did not know they were being tested in one case a group of subjects were told to take an elevator to another floor to participate in a test the elevator jammed between floors subjects were then observed by hidden video camera there were several variations to this sometimes the elevator was marked under repair sometimes there was telephone communication with the repairman sometimes not sometimes the ceiling fell in and the lights went out and sometimes the floor of the elevator was constructed of clear lucite in another case subjects were loaded into a van and driven out into the desert by an experiment leader who ran out of gas and then suffered a heart attack thus stranding the subjects in the most severe version subjects were taken up in a private plane and the pilot suffered a heart attack in midair despite the traditional complaints about such teststhat they were sadistic that they were artificial that subjects somehow sensed the situations were contrivedjohnson gained considerable information about groups under anxiety stress he found that fear responses were minimized when the group was small five or less when group members knew each other well when group members could see each other and were not isolated when they shared defined group goals and fixed time limits when groups were mixed age and mixed gender and when group members had high phobictolerant personalities as measured by las tests for anxiety which in turn correlated with athletic fitness study results were formulated in dense statistical tables although in essence norman knew he had merely verified common sense if you were trapped in an elevator it was better to be with a few relaxed athletic people you knew to keep the lights on and to know someone was working to get you free yet norman knew that some of his results were counterintuitive such as the importance of group composition groups composed entirely of men or entirely of women were much poorer at handling stress than mixed groups groups composed of individuals roughly the same age were much poorer than groups of mixed age and preexisting groups formed for another purpose did worst of all at one point he had stressed a championship basketball team and it cracked almost immediately although his research was good norman remained uneasy about the underlying purposes for his paperalien invasionwhich he personally considered speculative to the point of absurdity he was embarrassed to submit his paper particularly after he had rewritten it to make it seem more significant than he knew it was he was relieved when the carter administration did not like his report none of normans recommendations were approved the administration did not agree with dr norman johnson that fear was a problem they thought the predominant human emotion would be wonder and awe furthermore the administration preferred a large contact team of thirty people including three theologians a lawyer a physician a representative from the state department a representative from the joint chiefs a select group from the legislative branch an aerospace engineer an exobiologist a nuclear physicist a cultural anthropologist and a television anchor personality in any case president carter was not reelected in and norman heard nothing further about his ulf proposal he had heard nothing for six years until now barnes said you remember the ulf team you proposed of course norman said norman had recommended a ulf team of fouran astrophysicist a zoologist a mathematician a linguistand a fifth member a psychologist whose job would be to monitor the behavior and attitude of the working team members give me your opinion of this barnes said he handed norman a sheet of paper anomaly investigation team usn staffsupport members harold c barnes usn project commander captain jane edmunds usn data processing tech po c tina chan usn electronics tech po c alice fletcher usn deepsat habitat support chief po rose c levy usn deepsat habitat support c civilian staff members theodore fielding astrophysicistplanetary geologist elizabeth halpern zoologistbiochemist harold j adams mathematicianlogician arthur levine marine biologistbiochemist norman johnson psychologist norman looked at the list except for levine this is the civilian ulf team i originally proposed i even interviewed them and tested them back then correct but you said yourself there are probably no survivors theres probably no life inside that spacecraft yes barnes said but what if im wrong he glanced at his watch im going to brief the team members at eleven hundred hours i want you to come along and see what you think about the team members barnes said after all we followed your ulf report recommendations you followed my recommendations norman thought with a sinking feeling jesus christ i was just paying for a house i knew youd jump at the opportunity to see your ideas put into practice barnes said thats why ive included you on the team as the psychologist although a younger man would be more appropriate i appreciate that norman said i knew you would barnes said smiling cheerfully he extended a beefy hand welcome to the ulf team dr johnson beth an ensign showed norman to his room tiny and gray more like a prison cell than anything else normans day bag lay on his bunk in the corner was a computer console and a keyboard next to it was a thick manual with a blue cover he sat on the bed which was hard unwelcoming he leaned back against a pipe on the wall hi norman a soft voice said im glad to see they dragged you into this this is all your fault isnt it a woman stood in the doorway beth halpern the team zoologist was a study in contrasts she was a tall angular woman of thirtysix who could be called pretty despite her sharp features and the almost masculine quality of her body in the years since norman had last seen her she seemed to have emphasized her masculine side even more beth was a serious weightlifter and runner the veins and muscles bulged at her neck and on her forearms and her legs beneath her shorts were powerful her hair was cut short hardly longer than a mans at the same time she wore jewelry and makeup and she moved in a seductive way her voice was soft and her eyes were large and liquid especially when she talked about the living things that she studied at those times she became almost maternal one of her colleagues at the university of chicago had referred to her as mother nature with muscles norman got up and she gave him a quick peck on the cheek my rooms next to yours i heard you arrive when did you get in an hour ago i think im still in shock norman said do you believe all this do you think its real i think thats real she pointed to the blue manual next to his computer norman picked it up regulations governing personnel conduct during classified military operations he thumbed through pages of dense legal text it basically says beth said that you keep your mouth shut or you spend a long time in military prison and theres no calls in or out yes norman i think it must be real theres a spacecraft down there theres something down there its pretty exciting she began to speak more rapidly why for biology alone the possibilities are staggeringeverything we know about life comes from studying life on our own planet but in a sense all life on our planet is the same every living creature from algae to human beings is basically built on the same plan from the same dna now we may have a chance to contact life that is entirely different different in every way its exciting all right norman nodded he was thinking of something else what did you say about no calls in or out i promised to call ellen well i tried to call my daughter and they told me the mainland com links are out if you can believe that the navys got more satellites than admirals but they swear theres no available line to call out barnes said hed approve a cable thats it how old is jennifer now norman asked pleased to pull the name from his memory and what was her husbands name he was a physicist norman remembered something like that sandy blond man had a beard wore bow ties nine shes pitching for the evanston little league now not much of a student but a hell of a pitcher she sounded proud hows your family ellen shes fine the kids are fine tims a sophomore at chicago amys at andover how is george we divorced three years ago beth said george had a year at cern in geneva looking for exotic particles and i guess he found whatever he was looking for shes french he says shes a great cook she shrugged anyway my work is going well for the past year i have been working with cephalopodssquid and octopi hows that interesting it gives you quite a strange feeling to realize the gentle intelligence of these creatures particularly octopi you know an octopus is smarter than a dog and would probably make a much better pet its a wonderful clever very emotional creature an octopus only we never think of them that way norman said do you still eat them oh norman she smiled do you still relate everything to food whenever possible norman said patting his stomach well you wont like the food in this place its terrible but the answer is no she said cracking her knuckles i could never eat an octopus now knowing what i do about them which reminds me what do you know about hal barnes nothing why ive been asking around turns out barnes is not navy at all hes exnavy you mean hes retired retired in he was originally trained as an aeronautical engineer at cal tech and after he retired he worked for grumman for a while then a member of the navy science board of the national academy then assistant undersecretary of defense and a member of dsarc the defense systems acquisition review council a member of the defense science board which advises the joint chiefs and the secretary of defense advises them on what weapons acquisition beth said hes a pentagon man who advises the government on weapons acquisition so howd he get to be running this project beats me norman said sitting on the bunk he kicked off his shoes he felt suddenly tired beth leaned against the doorway you seem to be in very good shape norman said even her hands looked strong he thought a good thing too as it turns out beth said i have a lot of confidence for whats coming what about you think youll manage okay me why shouldnt i he glanced down at his own familiar paunch ellen was always after him to do something about it and from time to time he got inspired and went to the gym for a few days but he could never seem to get rid of it and the truth was it didnt matter that much to him he was fiftythree years old and he was a university professor what the hell then he had a thought what do you mean you have confidence for whats coming whats coming well its only rumors so far but your arrival seems to confirm them what rumors theyre sending us down there beth said down where to the bottom to the spaceship but its a thousand feet down theyre investigating it with robot submersibles these days a thousand feet isnt that deep beth said the technology can handle it there are navy divers down there now and the word is the divers have put up a habitat so our team can go down and live on the bottom for a week or so and open the spacecraft up norman felt a sudden chill in his work with the faa he had been exposed to every sort of horror once in chicago at a crash site that extended over a whole farm field he had stepped on something squishy he thought it was a frog but it was a childs severed hand palm up another time he had seen a mans charred body still strapped into the seat except the seat had been flung into the back yard of a suburban house where it sat upright next to a portable plastic kiddie swimming pool and in dallas he had watched the investigators on the rooftops of the suburban houses collecting the body parts putting them in bags working on a crashsite team demanded the most extraordinary psychological vigilance to avoid being overwhelmed by what you saw but there was never any personal danger any physical risk the risk was the risk of nightmares but now the prospect of going down a thousand feet under the ocean to investigate a wreck you okay beth said you look pale i didnt know anybody was talking about going down there just rumors beth said get some rest norman i think you need it the briefing the ulf team met in the briefing room just before eleven norman was interested to see the group he had picked six years before now assembled together for the first time ted fielding was compact handsome and still boyish at forty at ease in shorts and a polo sport shirt an astrophysicist at the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena he had done important work on the planetary stratigraphy of mercury and the moon although he was best known for his studies of the mangala vallis and valles marineris channels on mars located at the martian equator these great canyons were as much as twentyfive hundred miles long and two and a half miles deepten times the length and twice the depth of the grand canyon and fielding had been among the first to conclude that the planet most like the earth in composition was not mars at all as previously suspected but tiny mercury with its earthlike magnetic field fieldings manner was open cheerful and pompous at jpl he had appeared on television whenever there was a spacecraft flyby and thus enjoyed a certain celebrity he had recently been remarried to a television weather reporter in los angeles they had a young son ted was a longstanding advocate for life on other worlds and a supporter of seti the search for extraterrestrial intelligence which other scientists considered a waste of time and money he grinned happily at norman now i always knew this would happensooner or later wed get our proof of intelligent life on other worlds now at last we have it norman this is a great moment and i am especially pleased about the shape the shape of the object down there what about it norman hadnt heard anything about the shape ive been in the monitor room watching the video feed from the robots theyre beginning to define the shape beneath the coral and its not round it is not a flying saucer ted said thank god perhaps this will silence the lunatic fringe he smiled all things come to him who waits eh i guess so norman said he wasnt sure what fielding meant but ted tended to literary quotations ted saw himself as a renaissance man and random quotations from rousseau and laotsu were one way to remind you of it yet there was nothing meanspirited about him someone once said that ted was a brandname guy and that carried over to his speech as well there was an innocence almost a naivete to ted fielding that was endearing and genuine norman liked him he wasnt so sure about harry adams the reserved princeton mathematician norman hadnt seen for six years harry was now a tall very thin black man with wireframe glasses and a perpetual frown he wore a tshirt that said mathematicians do it correctly it was the kind of thing a student would wear and indeed adams appeared even younger than his thirty years he was clearly the youngest member of the groupand arguably the most important many theorists argued that communication with extraterrestrials would prove impossible because human beings would have nothing in common with them these thinkers pointed out that just as human bodies represented the outcome of many evolutionary events so did human thought like our bodies our ways of thinking could easily have turned out differently there was nothing inevitable about how we looked at the universe men already had trouble communicating with intelligent earthly creatures such as dolphins simply because dolphins lived in such a different environment and had such different sensory apparatus yet men and dolphins might appear virtually identical when compared with the vast differences that separated us from an extraterrestrial creaturea creature who was the product of billions of years of divergent evolution in some other planetary environment such an extraterrestrial would be unlikely to see the world as we did in fact it might not see the world at all it might be blind and it might learn about the world through a highly developed sense of smell or temperature or pressure there might be no way to communicate with such a creature no common ground at all as one man put it how would you explain wordsworths poem about daffodils to a blind watersnake but the field of knowledge we were most likely to share with extraterrestrials was mathematics so the team mathematician was going to play a crucial role norman had selected adams because despite his youth harry had already made important contributions to several different fields what do you think about all this harry norman said dropping into a chair next to him i think its perfectly clear harry said that it is a waste of time this fin theyve found underwater i dont know what it is but i know what it isnt it isnt a spacecraft from another civilization ted standing nearby turned away in annoyance harry and ted had evidently had this same conversation already how do you know norman asked a simple calculation harry said with a dismissing wave of his hand trivial really you know the drake equation norman did it was one of the famous proposals in the literature on extraterrestrial life but he said refresh me harry sighed irritably pulled out a sheet of paper its a probability equation he wrote p fnfff what it means harry adams said is that the probability p that intelligent life will evolve in any star system is a function of the probability that the star will have planets the number of habitable planets the probability that simple life will evolve on a habitable planet the probability that intelligent life will evolve from simple life and the probability that intelligent life will attempt interstellar communication within five billion years thats all the equation says uhhuh norman said but the point is that we have no facts harry said we must guess at every single one of these probabilities and its quite easy to guess one way as ted does and conclude there are probably thousands of intelligent civilizations its equally easy to guess as i do that there is probably only one civilization ours he pushed the paper away and in that case whatever is down there is not from an alien civilization so were all wasting our time here then what is down there norman said again it is an absurd expression of romantic hope adams said pushing his glasses up on his nose there was a vehemence about him that troubled norman six years earlier harry adams had still been a street kid whose obscure talent had carried him in a single step from a broken home in the slums of philadelphia to the manicured green lawns of princeton in those days adams had been playful amused at his turn of fortune why was he so harsh now adams was an extraordinarily gifted theoretician his reputation secured in probabilitydensity functions of quantum mechanics which were beyond normans comprehension although adams had worked them out when he was seventeen but norman could certainly understand the man himself and harry adams seemed tense and critical now ill at ease in this group or perhaps it had to do with his presence as part of a group norman had worried about how he would fit in because harry had been a child prodigy there were really only two kinds of child prodigiesmathematical and musical some psychologists argued there was only one kind since music was so closely related to mathematics while there were precocious children with other talents such as writing painting and athletics the only areas in which a child might truly perform at the level of an adult were in mathematics or music psychologically such children were complex often loners isolated from their peers and even from their families by their gifts for which they were both admired and resented socialization skills were often retarded making group interactions uncomfortable as a slum kid harrys problems would have been if anything magnified he had once told norman that when he first learned about fourier transforms the other kids were learning to slamdunk so maybe harry was feeling uncomfortable in the group now but there seemed to be something else harry appeared almost angry you wait adams said a week from now this is going to be recognized as one big fat false alarm nothing more you hope norman thought and again wondered why well i think its exciting beth halpern said smiling brightly even a slim chance of finding new life is exciting as far as i am concerned thats right ted said after all harry there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in your philosophy norman looked over at the final member of the team arthur levine the marine biologist levine was the only person he didnt know a pudgy man levine looked pale and uneasy wrapped in his own thoughts he was about to ask levine what he thought when captain barnes strode in a stack of files under his arm welcome to the middle of nowhere barnes said and you cant even go to the bathroom they all laughed nervously sorry to keep you waiting he said but we dont have a lot of time so lets get right down to it if youll kill the lights we can begin the first slide showed a large ship with an elaborate superstructure on the stern the rose sealady barnes said a cablelaying vessel chartered by transpac communications to lay a submarine telephone line from honolulu to sydney australia the rose left hawaii on may of this year and by june it had gotten as far as western samoa in the midpacific it was laying a new fiberoptics cable which has a carrying capacity of twenty thousand simultaneous telephonic transmissions the cable is covered with a dense metalandplastics web matrix unusually tough and resistant to breaks the ship had already laid more than fortysix hundred nautical miles of cable across the pacific with no mishaps of any sort next a map of the pacific with a large red spot at ten pm on the night of june the vessel was located here midway between pago pago in american samoa and viti levu in fiji when the ship experienced a wrenching shudder alarms sounded and the crew realized the cable had snagged and torn they immediately consulted their charts looking for an underwater obstruction but could see none they hauled up the loose cable which took several hours since at the time of the accident they had more than a mile of cable paid out behind the ship when they examined the cut end they saw that it had been cleanly shearedas one crewman said like it was cut with a huge pair of scissors next a section of fiberglas cable held toward the camera in the rough hand of a sailor the nature of the break as you can see suggests an artificial obstruction of some sort the rose steamed north back over the scene of the break next a series of ragged blackandwhite lines with a region of small spikes this is the original sonar scan from the ship if you cant read sonar scans thisll be hard to interpret but you see here the thin knifeedge obstruction consistent with a sunken ship or aircraft which cut the cable the charter company transpac communications notified the navy requesting any information we had about the obstruction this is routine whenever there is a cable break the navy is notified on the chance that the obstruction is known to us if its a sunken vessel containing explosives the cable company wants to know about it before they start repair but in this case the obstruction was not in navy files and the navy was interested we immediately dispatched our nearest search ship the ocean explorer from melbourne the ocean explorer reached the site on june of this year the reason for the navy interest was the possibility that the obstruction might represent a sunken chinese wuhanclass nuclear submarine fitted with sy missiles we knew the chinese lost such a sub in this approximate area in may the ocean explorer scanned the bottom using a most sophisticated sidelooking sonar which produced this picture of the bottom in color the image was almost threedimensional in its clarity as you see the bottom appears flat except for a single triangular fin which sticks up some two hundred and eighty feet above the ocean floor you see it here he said pointing now this wing dimension is larger than any known aircraft manufactured in either the united states or the soviet union this was very puzzling at first next a submersible robot being lowered on a crane over the side of a ship the robot looked like a series of horizontal tubes with cameras and lights nestled in the center by june the navy had the rov carrier neptune iv on site and the remote operated vehicle scorpion which you see here was sent down to photograph the wing it returned an image that clearly showed a control surface of some sort here it is there were murmurs from the group in a harshly lit color image a gray fin stuck up from a flat coral floor the fin was sharpedged and aeronauticallooking tapered definitely artificial youll notice barnes said that the sea bottom in this region consists of scrubby dead coral the wing or fin disappears into the coral suggesting the rest of the aircraft might be buried beneath an ultrahighresolution sls bottom scan was carried out to detect the shape underneath the coral next another color sonar image composed of fine dots instead of lines as you see the fin seems to be attached to a cylindrical object buried under the coral the object has a diameter of a hundred and ninety feet and extends west for a distance of feet before tapering to a point more murmurings from the audience thats correct barnes said the cylindrical object is half a mile long the shape is consistent with a rocket or spacecraftit certainly looks like thatbut from the beginning we were careful to refer to this object as the anomaly norman glanced over at ted who was smiling up at the screen but alongside ted in the darkness harry adams frowned and pushed his glasses up on his nose then the projector light went out the room was plunged into darkness there were groans norman heard barnes say god damn it not again someone scrambled for the door there was a rectangle of light beth leaned over to norman and said they lose power here all the time reassuring huh moments later the electricity came back on barnes continued on june a scarab remote vehicle cut a piece from the tail fin and brought it to the surface the fin segment was analyzed and found to be a titanium alloy in an epoxyresin honeycomb the necessary bonding technology for such metalplastic materials was currently unknown on earth experts confirmed that the fin could not have originated on this planetalthough in ten or twenty years wed probably know how to make it harry adams grunted leaned forward made a note on his pad meanwhile barnes explained other robot vessels were used to plant seismic charges on the bottom seismic analysis showed that the buried anomaly was of metal that it was hollow and that it had a complex internal structure after two weeks of intensive study barnes said we concluded the anomaly was some sort of spacecraft the final verification came on june from the geologists their core samples from the bottom indicated that the present seabed had formerly been much shallower perhaps only eighty or ninety feet deep this would explain the coral which covered the craft to an average thickness of thirty feet therefore the geologists said the craft had been on the planet at least three hundred years and perhaps much longer five hundred or even five thousand years however reluctantly barnes said the navy concluded that we had in fact found a spacecraft from another civilization the decision of the president before a special meeting of the national security council was to open the spacecraft so starting june the ulf team members were called in on july the subsea habitat dh was lowered into position near the spacecraft site dh housed nine navy divers working in a saturated exoticgas environment they proceeded to do primary drilling work and i think that brings you up to date barnes said any questions ted said the internal structure of the spacecraft has it been clarified not at this point the spacecraft seems to be built in such a way that shock waves are transmitted around the outer shell which is tremendously strong and well engineered that prevents a clear picture of the interior from the seismics how about passive techniques to see whats inside weve tried barnes said gravitometric analysis negative thermography negative resistivity mapping negative proton precision magnetometers negative listening devices weve had hydrophones on the bottom from day one there have been no sounds emanating from the craft at least not so far what about other remote inspection procedures most involve radiation and were hesitant to irradiate the craft at this time harry said captain barnes i notice the fin appears undamaged and the hull appears a perfect cylinder do you think that this object crashed in the ocean yes barnes said looking uneasy so this object has survived a highspeed impact with the water without a scratch or a dent well its tremendously strong harry nodded it would have to be beth said the divers who are down there nowwhat exactly are they doing looking for the front door barnes smiled for the time being weve had to fall back on classical archaeological procedures were digging exploratory trenches in the coral looking for an entrance or a hatch of some kind we hope to find it within the next twentyfour to fortyeight hours once we do youre going in anything else yes ted said what was the russian reaction to this discovery we havent told the russians barnes said you havent told them no we havent but this is an incredible unprecedented development in human history not just american history human history surely we should share this with all the nations of the world this is the sort of discovery that could unite all of mankind youd have to speak to the president barnes said i dont know the reasoning behind it but its his decision any other questions nobody said anything the team looked at each other then i guess thats it barnes said the lights came on there was the scraping of chairs as people stood stretched then harry adams said captain barnes i must say i resent this briefing very much barnes looked surprised what do you mean harry the others stopped looked at adams he remained seated in his chair an irritated look on his face did you decide you have to break the news to us gently what news the news about the door barnes laughed uneasily harry i just got through telling you that the divers are cutting exploratory trenches looking for the door id say you had a pretty good idea where the door was three days ago when you started flying us in and id say that by now you probably know exactly where the door is am i right barnes said nothing he stood with a fixed smile on his face my god norman thought looking at barnes harrys right harry was known to have a superbly logical brain an astonishing and cold deductive ability but norman had never seen him at work yes barnes said finally youre right you know the location of the door we do yes there was a moment of silence and then ted said but this is fantastic absolutely fantastic when will we go down there to enter the spacecraft tomorrow barnes said never taking his eyes off harry and harry for his own part stared fixedly at barnes the minisubs will take you down in pairs starting at oh eight hundred hours tomorrow morning this is exciting ted said fantastic unbelievable so barnes said still watching harry you should all get a good nights sleepif you can innocent sleep sleep that knits up the ravelld sleave of care ted said he was literally bobbing up and down in his chair with excitement during the rest of the day supply and technical officers will be coming to measure and outfit you any other questions barnes said you can find me in my office he left the room and the meeting broke up when the others filed out norman remained behind with harry adams harry never moved from his chair he watched the technician packing up the portable screen that was quite a performance just now norman said was it i dont see why you deduced that barnes wasnt telling us about the door oh theres much more hes not telling us about adams said in a cold voice hes not telling us about any of the important things like what like the fact harry said getting to his feet at last that captain barnes knows perfectly well why the president decided to keep this a secret he does the president had no choice under the circumstances what circumstances he knows that the object down there is not an alien spacecraft then what is it i think its quite clear what it is not to me norman said adams smiled for the first time it was a thin smile entirely without humor you wouldnt believe it if i told you he said and he left the room tests arthur levine the marine biologist was the only member of the expedition norman johnson had not met it was one of the things we hadnt planned for he thought norman had assumed that any contact with unknown life would occur on land he hadnt considered the most obvious possibilitythat if a spacecraft landed at random somewhere on the earth it would most likely come down on water since percent of the planet was covered with water it was obvious in retrospect that they would need a marine biologist what else he wondered would prove obvious in retrospect he found levine hanging off the port railing levine came from the oceanographic institute at woods hole massachusetts his hand was damp when norman shook it levine looked extremely ill at ease and finally admitted that he was seasick seasick a marine biologist norman said i work in the laboratory he said at home on land where things dont move all the time why are you smiling sorry norman said you think its funny a seasick marine biologist incongruous i guess a lot of us get seasick levine said he stared out at the sea look out there he said thousands of miles of flat nothing the ocean it gives me the creeps levine said so barnes said back in his office what do you think of what of the team for christs sake its the team i chose six years later basically a good group certainly very able i want to know who will crack why should anybody crack norman said he was looking at barnes noticing the thin line of sweat on his upper lip the commander was under a lot of pressure himself a thousand feet down barnes said living and working in a cramped habitat listen its not like im going in with military divers who have been trained and who have themselves under control im taking a bunch of scientists for gods sake i want to make sure they all have a clean bill of health i want to make sure nobodys going to crack i dont know if you are aware of this captain but psychologists cant predict that very accurately who will crack even when its from fear whatever its from barnes frowned i thought fear was your specialty anxiety is one of my research interests and i can tell you who on the basis of personality profiles is likely to suffer acute anxiety in a stress situation but i cant predict wholl crack under that stress and who wont then what good are you barnes said irritably he sighed im sorry dont you just want to interview them or give them some tests there arent any tests norman said at least none that work barnes sighed again what about levine hes seasick there isnt any motion underwater that wont be a problem but what about him personally id be concerned norman said duly noted what about harry adams hes arrogant yes norman said but thats probably desirable studies had shown that the people who were most successful at handling pressure were people others didnt likeindividuals who were described as arrogant cocksure irritating maybe so barnes said but what about his famous research paper harry was one of the biggest supporters of seti a few years back now that weve found something hes suddenly very negative you remember his paper norman didnt and was about to say so when an ensign came in captain barnes here is the visual upgrade you wanted okay barnes said he squinted at a photograph put it down what about the weather no change sir satellite reports are confirming we have fortyeight plusminus twelve on site sir hell barnes said trouble norman asked the weathers going bad on us barnes said we may have to clear out our surface support does that mean youll cancel going down there no barnes said we go tomorrow as planned why does harry think this thing is not a spacecraft norman asked barnes frowned pushed papers on his desk let me tell you something he said harrys a theoretician and theories are just thattheories i deal in the hard facts the fact is weve got something damn old and damn strange down there i want to know what it is but if its not an alien spacecraft what is it lets just wait until we get down there shall we barnes glanced at his watch the second habitat should be anchored on the sea floor by now well begin moving you down in fifteen hours between now and then weve all got a lot to do just hold it there dr johnson norman stood naked felt two metal calipers pinch the back of his arms just above the elbow just a bit thats fine now you can get into the tank the young medical corpsman stepped aside and norman climbed the steps to the metal tank which looked like a military version of a jacuzzi the tank was filled to the top with water as he lowered his body into the water it spilled over the sides whats all this for norman asked im sorry dr johnson if you would completely immerse yourself what just for a moment sir norman took a breath ducked under the water came back up thats fine you can get out now the corpsman said handing him a towel whats all this for he asked again climbing down the ladder total body adipose content the corpsman said we have to know it to calculate your sat stats my sat stats your saturation statistics the corpsman marked points on his clipboard oh dear he said youre off the graph why is that do you get much exercise dr johnson some he was feeling defensive now and the towel was too small to wrap around his waist why did the navy use such small towels do you drink some he was feeling distinctly defensive no question about it may i ask when you last consumed an alcoholic beverage sir i dont know two three days ago he was having trouble thinking back to san diego it seemed so far away why thats fine dr johnson any trouble with joints hips or knees no why episodes of syncope faintness or blackouts no if you would just sit over here sir the corpsman pointed to a stool next to an electronic device on the wall id really like some answers norman said just stare at the green dot both eyes wide open he felt a brief blast of air on both eyes and blinked instinctively a printed strip of paper clicked out the corpsman tore it off glanced at it thats fine dr johnson if you would come this way id like some information from you norman said id like to know whats going on i understand sir but i have to finish your workup in time for your next briefing at seventeen hundred hours norman lay on his back and technicians stuck needles in both arms and another in his leg at the groin he yelled in sudden pain thats the worst of it sir the corpsman said packing the syringes in ice if you will just press this cotton against it here there was a clip over his nostrils a mouthpiece between his teeth this is to measure your co the corpsman said just exhale thats right big breath now exhale norman exhaled he watched a rubber diaphragm inflate pushing a needle up a scale try it again sir im sure you can do better than that norman didnt think he could but he tried again anyway another corpsman entered the room with a sheet of paper covered with figures here are his bcs he said the first corpsman frowned has barnes seen this yes and whatd he say he said it was okay he said to continue okay fine hes the boss the first corpsman turned back to norman lets try one more big breath dr johnson if you would metal calipers touched his chin and his forehead a tape went around his head now the calipers measured from his ear to his chin whats this for norman said fitting you with a helmet sir shouldnt i be trying one on this is the way we do it sir dinner was macaroni and cheese burned underneath norman pushed it aside after a few bites the corpsman appeared at his door time for the seventeenhundredhours briefing sir im not going anywhere norman said until i get some answers what the hell is all this youre doing to me routine deepsat workup sir navy regs require it before you go down and why am i off the graph sorry sir you said i was off the graph oh that youre a bit heavier than the navy tables figure for sir is there a problem about my weight shouldnt be no sir and the other tests what did they show sir you are in very good health for your age and lifestyle and what about going down there norman asked half hoping he wouldnt be able to go down there ive talked with captain barnes shouldnt be any problem at all sir if youll just come this way to the briefing sir the others were sitting around in the briefing room with styrofoam cups of coffee norman felt glad to see them he dropped into a chair next to harry jesus did you have the damn physical yeah he said had it yesterday they stuck me in the leg with this long needle norman said really they didnt do that to me and how about breathing with that clip on your nose i didnt do that either harry said sounds like you got some special treatment norman norman was thinking the same thing and he didnt like the implications he felt suddenly tired all right men weve got a lot to cover and just three hours to do it a brisk man said turning off the lights as he came into the room norman hadnt even gotten a good look at him now it was just a voice in the dark as you know daltons law governs partial pressures of mixed gases or as represented here in algebraic form the first of the graphs flashed up pp p x vol now lets review how calculation of the partial pressure might be done in atmospheres absolute which is the most common procedure we employ the words were meaningless to norman he tried to pay attention but as the graphs continued and the voice droned on his eyes grew heavier and he fell asleep be taken down in the submarine and once in the habitat module you will be pressurized to thirtythree atmospheres at that time you will be switched over to mixed gases since it is not possible to breathe earth atmosphere beyond eighteen atmospheres norman stopped listening these technical details only filled him with dread he went back to sleep awakening only intermittently since oxygen toxicity only occurs when the po exceeds point ata for prolonged periods nitrogen narcosis in which nitrogen behaves like an anesthetic will occur in mixedgas atmospheres if partial pressures exceeds ata in the dds demand open circuit is generally preferable but you will be using semiclosed circuit with inspired fluctuations of to millimeters he went back to sleep when it was over they walked back to their rooms did i miss anything norman said not really harry shrugged just a lot of physics in his tiny gray room norman got into bed the glowing wall clock said it took him a while to figure out that that was pm in nine more hours he thought i will begin the descent then he slept the deep descent in the morning light the submarine charon v bobbed on the surface riding on a pontoon platform bright yellow it looked like a childs bathtub toy sitting on a deck of oildrums a rubber zodiac launch took norman over and he climbed onto the platform shook hands with the pilot who could not have been more than eighteen younger than his son tim ready to go sir the pilot said sure norman said he was as ready as he would ever be up close the sub did not look like a toy it was incredibly massive and strong norman saw a single porthole of curved acrylic it was held in place by bolts as big as his fist he touched them tentatively the pilot smiled want to kick the tires sir no ill trust you ladders this way sir norman climbed the narrow rungs to the top of the sub and saw the small circular hatch opening he hesitated sit on the edge here the pilot said and drop your legs in then follow it down you may have to squeeze your shoulders together a bit and suck in your thats it sir norman wriggled through the tight hatch into an interior so low he could not stand the sub was crammed with dials and machinery ted was already aboard hunched in the back grinning like a kid isnt this fantastic norman envied his easy enthusiasm he felt cramped and a little nervous above him the pilot clanged the heavy hatch shut and dropped down to take the controls everybody okay they nodded sorry about the view the pilot said glancing over his shoulders you gentlemen are mostly going to be seeing my hindquarters lets get started mozart okay he pressed a tape deck and smiled weve got thirteen minutes descent to the bottom music makes it a little easier if you dont like mozart we can offer you something else mozarts fine norman said mozarts wonderful ted said sublime very good gentlemen the submarine hissed there was squawking on the radio the pilot spoke softly into a headset a scuba diver appeared at the porthole waved the pilot waved back there was a sloshing sound then a deep rumble and they started down as you see the whole sled goes under the pilot explained the subs not stable on the surface so we sled her up and down well leave the sled at about a hundred feet or so through the porthole they saw the diver standing on the deck the water now waistdeep then the water covered the porthole bubbles came out of the divers scuba were under the pilot said he adjusted valves above his head and they heard the hiss of air startlingly loud more gurgling the light in the submarine from the porthole was a beautiful blue lovely ted said well leave the sled now the pilot said motors rumbled and the sub moved forward the diver slipping off to one side now there was nothing to be seen through the porthole but undifferentiated blue water the pilot said something on the radio and turned up the mozart just sit back gentlemen he said descending eighty feet a minute norman felt the rumble of the electric motors but there was no real sense of motion all that happened was that it got darker and darker you know ted said were really quite lucky about this site most parts of the pacific are so deep wed never be able to visit it in person he explained that the vast pacific ocean which amounted to half the total surface area of the earth had an average depth of two miles there are only a few places where it is less one is the relatively small rectangle bounded by samoa new zealand australia and new guinea which is actually a great undersea plain like the plains of the american west except its at an average depth of two thousand feet thats what we are doing now descending to that plain ted spoke rapidly was he nervous norman couldnt tell he was feeling his own heart pound now it was quite dark outside the instruments glowed green the pilot flicked on red interior lights their descent continued four hundred feet the submarine lurched then eased forward this is the river what river norman said sir we are in a current of different salinity and temperature it behaves like a river inside the ocean we traditionally stop about here sir the sub sticks in the river takes us for a little ride oh yes ted said reaching into his pocket ted handed the pilot a tendollar bill norman glanced questioningly at ted didnt they mention that to you old tradition you always pay the pilot on your way down for good luck i can use some luck norman said he fumbled in his pocket found a fivedollar bill thought better of it took out a twenty instead thank you gentlemen and have a good bottom stay both of you the pilot said the electric motors cut back in the descent continued the water was dark five hundred feet he said halfway there the submarine creaked loudly then made several explosive pops norman was startled thats normal pressure adjustment the pilot said no problem uhhuh norman said he wiped sweat on his shirtsleeve it seemed that the interior of the submarine was now much smaller the walls closer to his face actually ted said if i remember this particular region of the pacific is called the lau basin isnt that right thats right sir the lau basin its a plateau between two undersea ridges the south fiji or lau ridge to the west and the tonga ridge to the east thats correct dr fielding norman glanced at the instruments they were covered with moisture the pilot had to rub the dials with a cloth to read them was the sub leaking no he thought just condensation the interior of the submarine was growing colder take it easy he told himself eight hundred feet the pilot said it was now completely black outside this is very exciting ted said have you ever done anything like this before norman no norman said me neither ted said what a thrill norman wished he would shut up you know ted said when we open this alien craft up and make our first contact with another form of life its going to be a great moment in the history of our species on earth ive been wondering about what we should say say you know what words at the threshold with the cameras rolling will there be cameras oh im sure therell be all sorts of documentation its only proper considering so we need something to say a memorable phrase i was thinking of this is a momentous moment in human history momentous moment norman said frowning youre right ted said awkward i agree maybe a turning point in human history norman shook his head how about a crossroads in the evolution of the human species can evolution have a crossroads i dont see why not ted said well a crossroads is a crossing of roads is evolution a road i thought it wasnt i thought evolution was undirected youre being too literal ted said reading the bottom the pilot said nine hundred feet he slowed the descent they heard the intermittent ping of sonar ted said a new threshold in the evolution of the human species sure think it will be will be what a new threshold why not ted said what if we open it up and its just a lot of rusted junk inside and nothing valuable or enlightening at all good point ted said nine hundred fifty feet exterior lights are on the pilot said through the porthole they saw white flecks the pilot explained this was suspended matter in the water visual contact i have bottom oh lets see ted said the pilot obligingly shifted to one side and they looked norman saw a flat dead dullbrown plain stretching away to the limit of the lights blackness beyond not much to look at right here im afraid the pilot said surprisingly dreary ted said without a trace of disappointment i would have expected more life well its pretty cold water temperature is ah thirtysix degrees fahrenheit almost freezing ted said yes sir lets see if we can find your new home the motors rumbled muddy sediment churned up in front of the porthole the sub turned moved across the bottom for several minutes they saw only the brown landscape then lights there we are a vast underwater array of lights arranged in a rectangular pattern thats the grid the pilot said the submarine planed up and glided smoothly over the illuminated grid which extended into the distance for half a mile through the porthole they saw divers standing on the bottom working within the grid structure the divers waved to the passing sub the pilot honked a toy horn they can hear that oh sure waters a great conductor my god ted said directly ahead the giant titanium fin rose sharply above the ocean floor norman was completely unprepared for its dimension as the submarine moved to port the fin blocked their entire field of view for nearly a minute the metal was dull gray and except for small white speckles of marine growth entirely unmarked there isnt any corrosion ted said no sir the pilot said everybodys mentioned that they think its because its a metalplastic alloy but i dont think anybody is quite sure the fin slipped away to the stern the submarine again turned directly ahead more lights arranged in vertical rows norman saw a single cylinder of yellowpainted steel and bright portholes next to it was a low metal dome thats dh the divers habitat to port the pilot said its pretty utilitarian you guys are in dh which is much nicer believe me he turned starboard and after a momentary blackness they saw another set of lights coming closer norman counted five different cylinders some vertical some horizontal interconnected in a complex way there you are dh your home away from home the pilot said give me a minute to dock metal clanged against metal there was a sharp jolt and then the motors cut off silence hissing air the pilot scrambled to open the hatch and surprisingly cold air washed down on them airlocks open gentlemen he said stepping aside norman looked up through the lock he saw banks of red lights above he climbed up through the submarine and into a round steel cylinder approximately eight feet in diameter on all sides there were handholds a narrow metal bench the glowing heat lamps overhead though they didnt seem to do much good ted climbed up and sat on the bench opposite him they were so close their knees touched below their feet the pilot closed the hatch they watched the wheel spin they heard a clank as the submarine disengaged then the whirr of motors as it moved away then nothing what happens now norman said they pressurize us ted said switch us over to exoticgas atmosphere we cant breathe air down here why not norman said now that he was down here staring at the cold steel walls of the cylinder he wished he had stayed awake for the briefing because ted said the atmosphere of the earth is deadly you dont realize it but oxygen is a corrosive gas its in the same chemical family as chlorine and fluorine and hydrofluoric acid is the most corrosive acid known the same quality of oxygen that makes a halfeaten apple turn brown or makes iron rust is incredibly destructive to the human body if exposed to too much of it oxygen under pressure is toxicwith a vengeance so we cut down the amount of oxygen you breathe you breathe twentyone percent oxygen at the surface down here you breathe two percent oxygen but you wont notice any difference a voice over a loudspeaker said were starting to pressurize you now whos that norman said barnes the voice said but it didnt sound like barnes it sounded gritty and artificial it must be the talker ted said and then laughed his voice was noticeably higherpitched its the helium norman theyre pressurizing us with helium you sound like donald duck norman said and he laughed too his own voice sounded squeaky like a cartoon characters speak for yourself mickey ted squeaked i taut i taw a puddy tat norman said they were both laughing hearing their voices knock it off you guys barnes said over the intercom this is serious yes sir captain ted said but by now his voice was so highpitched it was almost unintelligible and they fell into laughter again their tinny voices like those of schoolgirls reverberating inside the steel cylinder helium made their voices high and squeaky but it also had other effects getting chilled boys barnes said they were indeed getting colder he saw ted shivering felt goosebumps on his own legs it felt as if a wind were blowing across their bodiesexcept there wasnt any wind the lightness of the helium increased evaporation made them cold across the cylinder ted said something but norman couldnt understand ted at all any more his voice was too highpitched to be comprehensible it was just a thin squeal sounds like a couple of rats in there now barnes said with satisfaction ted rolled his eyes toward the loudspeaker and squeaked something if you want to talk get a talker barnes said youll find them in the locker under the seat norman found a metal locker clicked it open the metal squealed loudly like chalk on a blackboard all the sounds in the chamber were highpitched inside the locker he saw two black plastic pads with neck straps just slip them over your neck put the pad at the base of your throat okay ted said and then blinked in surprise his voice sounded slightly rough but otherwise normal these things must change the vocalcord frequencies norman said why dont you guys pay attention to briefings barnes said thats exactly what they do youll have to wear a talker all the time youre down here at least if you want anybody to understand you still cold yes ted said well hang on youre almost fully pressurized now then there was another hiss and a side door slid open barnes stood there with light jackets over his arm welcome to dh he said dh youre the last to arrive barnes said we just have time for a quick tour before we open the spacecraft youre ready to open it now ted asked wonderful ive just been talking about this with norman this is such a great moment our first contact with alien life we ought to prepare a little speech for when we open it up therell be time to consider that barnes said with an odd glance at ted ill show you the habitat first this way he explained that the dh habitat consisted of five large cylinders designated a to e cyl a is the airlock where we are now he led them into an adjacent changing room heavy cloth suits hung limply on the wall alongside yellow sculpted helmets of the sort norman had seen the divers wearing the helmets had a futuristic look norman tapped one with his knuckles it was plastic and surprisingly light he saw johnson stenciled above one faceplate we going to wear these norman asked thats correct barnes said then well be going outside norman said feeling a twinge of alarm eventually yes dont worry about it now still cold they were barnes had them change into tightfitting jumpsuits of clinging blue polyester ted frowned dont you think these look a little silly they may not be the height of fashion barnes said but they prevent heat loss from helium the color is unflattering ted said screw the color barnes said he handed them lightweight jackets norman felt something heavy in one pocket and pulled out a battery pack the jackets are wired and electrically heated barnes said like an electric blanket which is what youll use for sleeping follow me they went on to cyl b which housed power and lifesupport systems at first glance it looked like a large boiler room all multicolored pipes and utilitarian fittings this is where we generate all of our heat power and air barnes said he pointed out the features closedcycle ic generator hydrogenandoxygendriven fuel cells lss monitors liquid processor runs on silverzinc batteries and thats chief petty officer fletcher teeny fletcher norman saw a bigboned figure working back among the pipes with a heavy wrench the figure turned alice fletcher gave them a grin waved a greasy hand she seems to know what shes doing ted said approvingly she does barnes said but all the major support systems are redundant fletcher is just our final redundancy actually youll find the entire habitat is selfregulating he clipped heavy badges onto the jumpsuits wear these at all times even though theyre just a precaution the alarms trigger automatically if lifesupport conditions go below optimum but that wont happen there are sensors in each room of the habitat youll get used to the fact that the environment continually adjusts to your presence lights will go on and off heat lamps will turn on and off and air vents will hiss to keep track of things its all automatic dont sweat it every single major system is redundant we can lose power we can lose air we can lose water entirely and we will be fine for a hundred and thirty hours one hundred and thirty hours didnt sound very long to norman he did the calculation in his head five days five days didnt seem very long either they went into the next cylinder the lights clicking on as they entered cylinder c contained living quarters bunks toilets showers plenty of hot water youll find barnes showed them around proudly as if it were a hotel the living quarters were heavily insulated carpeted deck walls and ceilings all covered in soft padded foam which made the interior appear like an overstuffed couch but despite the bright colors and the evident care in decoration norman still found it cramped and dreary the portholes were tiny and they revealed only the blackness of the ocean outside and wherever the padding ended he saw heavy bolts and heavy steel plating a reminder of where they really were he felt as if he were inside a large iron lungand he thought that isnt so far wrong they ducked through narrow bulkheads into d cyl a small laboratory with benches and microscopes on the top level a compact electronics unit on the level below this is tina chan barnes said introducing a very still woman they all shook hands norman thought that tina chan was almost unnaturally calm until he realized she was one of those people who almost never blinked their eyes be nice to tina barnes was saying shes our only link to the outsideshe runs the com ops and the sensor systems as well in fact all the electronics tina chan was surrounded by the bulkiest monitors norman had ever seen they looked like tv sets from the s barnes explained that certain equipment didnt do well in the helium atmosphere including tv tubes in the early days of undersea habitats the tubes had to be replaced daily now they were elaborately coated and shielded hence their bulk next to chan was another woman jane edmunds whom barnes introduced as the unit archivist whats a unit archivist ted asked her petty officer first class data processing sir she said formally jane edmunds wore spectacles and stood stiffly she reminded norman of a librarian data processing ted said my mission is to keep all the digital recordings visual materials and videotapes sir every aspect of this historic moment is being recorded and i keep everything neatly filed norman thought she is a librarian oh excellent ted said im glad to hear it film or tape tape sir i know my way around a video camera ted said with a smile whatre you putting it down on halfinch or threequarter sir we use a datascan image equivalent of two thousand pixels per sidebiased frame each pixel carrying a twelvetone gray scale oh ted said its a bit better than commercial systems you may be familiar with sir i see ted said but he recovered smoothly and chatted with edmunds for a while about technical matters ted seems awfully interested in how were going to record this barnes said looking uneasy yes he seems to be norman wondered why that troubled barnes was barnes worried about the visual record or did he think ted would try to hog the show would ted try to hog the show did barnes have any worries about having this appear to be a civilian operation no the exterior lights are a hundredfiftywatt quartz halogen edmunds was saying were recording at equivalent of half a million asa so thats ample the real problem is backscatter were constantly fighting it norman said i notice your support team is all women yes barnes said all the deepdiving studies show that women are superior for submerged operations theyre physically smaller and consume less nutrients and air they have better social skills and tolerate close quarters better and they are physiologically tougher and have better endurance the fact is the navy long ago recognized that all their submariners should be female he laughed but just try to implement that one he glanced at his watch wed better move on ted they went on the final cylinder e cyl was more spacious than the others there were magazines a television and a large lounge and on the deck below was an efficient mess and a kitchen seaman rose levy the cook was a redfaced woman with a southern accent standing beneath giant suction fans she asked norman whether he had any favorite desserts desserts yes sir dr johnson i like to make everybodys favorite dessert if i can what about you you have a favorite dr fielding key lime pie ted said i love key lime pie can do sir levy said with a big smile she turned back to norman i havent heard yours yet dr johnson strawberry shortcake easy got some nice new zealand strawberries coming down on the last sub shuttle maybe youd like that shortcake tonight why not rose barnes said heartily norman looked out the black porthole window from the portholes of d cyl he could see the rectangular illuminated grid that extended across the bottom following the halfmilelong buried spacecraft divers illuminated like fireflies moved over the glowing grid surface norman thought i am a thousand feet beneath the surface of the ocean and we are talking about whether we should have strawberry shortcake for dessert but the more he thought about it the more it made sense the best way to make somebody comfortable in a new environment was to give him familiar food strawberries make me break out ted said ill make your shortcake with blueberries levy said not missing a beat and whipped cream ted said well you cant have everything barnes said and one of the things you cant have at thirty atmospheres of mixed gas is whipped cream wont whip lets move on beth and harry were waiting in the small padded conference room directly above the mess they both wore jumpsuits and heated jackets harry was shaking his head as they arrived like our padded cell he poked the insulated walls its like living in a vagina beth said dont you like going back to the womb harry no harry said ive been there once was enough these jumpsuits are pretty bad ted said plucking at the clinging polyester shows your belly nicely harry said lets settle down barnes said a few sequins you could be elvis presley harry said elvis presleys dead nows your chance harry said norman looked around wheres levine levine didnt make it barnes said briskly he got claustrophobic in the sub coming down and had to be taken back one of those things then we have no marine biologist well manage without him i hate this damn jumpsuit ted said i really hate it beth looks good in hers yes beth works out and its damp in here too ted said is it always so damp norman had noticed that humidity was a problem everything they touched felt slightly wet and clammy and cold barnes warned them of the danger of infections and minor colds and handed out bottles of skin lotion and ear drops i thought you said the technology was all worked out harry said it is barnes said believe me this is plush compared to the habitats ten years ago ten years ago harry said they stopped making habitats because people kept dying in them barnes frowned there was one accident there were two accidents harry said a total of four people special circumstances barnes said not involving navy technology or personnel great harry said how long did you say we going to be down here maximum seventytwo hours barnes said you sure about that its navy regs barnes said why norman asked puzzled barnes shook his head never he said never ask a reason for navy regulations the intercom clicked and tina chan said captain barnes we have a signal from the divers they are mounting the airlock now another few minutes to open the feeling in the room changed immediately the excitement was palpable ted rubbed his hands together you realize of course that even without opening that spacecraft we have already made a major discovery of profound importance whats that norman said weve shot the unique event hypothesis to hell ted said glancing at beth the unique event hypothesis barnes said hes referring beth said to the fact that physicists and chemists tend to believe in intelligent extraterrestrial life while biologists tend not to many biologists feel the development of intelligent life on earth required so many peculiar steps that it represents a unique event in the universe that may never have occurred elsewhere wouldnt intelligence arise again and again barnes said well it barely arose on the earth beth said the earth is billion years old and singlecelled life appeared billion years agoalmost immediately geologically speaking but life remained singlecelled for the next three billion years then in the cambrian period around six hundred million years ago there was an explosion of sophisticated life forms within a hundred million years the ocean was full of fish then the land became populated then the air but nobody knows why the explosion occurred in the first place and since it didnt occur for three billion years theres the possibility that on some other planet it might never occur at all and even after the cambrian the chain of events leading to man appears to be so special so chancy that biologists worry it might never have happened just consider the fact that if the dinosaurs hadnt been wiped out sixtyfive million years agoby a comet or whateverthen reptiles might still be the dominant form on earth and mammals would never have had a chance to take over no mammals no primates no primates no apes no apes no man there are a lot of random factors in evolution a lot of luck thats why biologists think intelligent life might be a unique event in the universe only occurring here except now ted said we know its not a unique event because there is a damn big spacecraft out there personally beth said i couldnt be more pleased she bit her lip you dont look pleased norman said ill tell you beth said i cant help being nervous ten years ago bill jackson at stanford ran a series of weekend seminars on extraterrestrial life this was right after he won the nobel prize in chemistry he split us into two groups one group designed the alien life form and worked it all out scientifically the other group tried to figure out the life form and communicate with it jackson presided over the whole thing as a hard scientist not letting anybody get carried away one time we brought in a sketch of a proposed creature and he said very tough okay wheres the anus that was his criticism but many animals on earth have no anus there are all kinds of excretory mechanisms that dont require a special orifice jackson assumed an anus was necessary but it isnt and now she shrugged who knows what well find well know soon enough ted said the intercom clicked captain barnes the divers have the airlock mounted in place the robot is now ready to enter the spacecraft ted said what robot the door i dont think its appropriate at all ted said angrily we came down here to make a manned entry into this alien spacecraft i think we should do what we came here to domake a manned entry absolutely not barnes said we cant risk it you must think of this ted said as an archaeological site greater than chichen itza greater than troy greater than tutankhamens tomb unquestionably the most important archaeological site in the history of mankind do you really intend to have a damned robot open that site wheres your sense of human destiny wheres your sense of selfpreservation barnes said i strongly object captain barnes duly noted barnes said turning away now lets get on with it tina give us the video feed ted sputtered but he fell silent as two large monitors in front of them clicked on on the left screen they saw the complex tubular metal scaffolding of the robot with exposed motors and gears the robot was positioned before the curved gray metal wall of the spacecraft within that wall was a door that looked rather like an airliner door the second screen gave a closer view of the door taken by the video camera mounted on the robot itself its rather similar to an airplane door ted said norman glanced at harry who smiled enigmatically then he looked at barnes barnes did not appear surprised barnes already knew about the door he realized i wonder how we can account for such parallelism in door design ted said the likelihood of its occurring by chance is astronomically small why this door is the perfect size and shape for a human being thats right harry said its incredible ted said quite incredible harry smiled said nothing barnes said lets find control surfaces the robot video scanner moved left and right across the spacecraft hull it stopped on the image of a rectangular panel mounted to the left of the door can you open that panel working on it now sir whirring the robot claw extended out toward the panel but the claw was clumsy it scraped against the metal leaving a series of gleaming scratches but the panel remained closed ridiculous ted said its like watching a baby the claw continued to scratch at the panel we should be doing this ourselves ted said use suction barnes said another arm extended out with a rubber sucker ah the plumbers friend ted said disdainfully as they watched the sucker attached to the panel flattened then with a click the panel lifted open at last i cant see the view inside the panel was blurred out of focus they could distinguish what appeared to be a series of colored round metal protrusions red yellow and blue there were also intricate blackandwhite symbols above the knobs look ted said red blue yellow primary colors this is a very big break why norman said because it suggests that the aliens have the same sensory equipment that we dothey may see the universe the same way visually in the same colors utilizing the same part of the electromagnetic spectrum thats going to help immeasurably in making contact with them and those blackandwhite markings that must be some of their writing can you imagine alien writing he smiled enthusiastically this is a great moment he said i feel truly privileged to be here focus barnes called focusing now sir the image became even more blurred no the other way yes sir focusing now the image changed slowly resolved into sharp focus uhoh ted said staring at the screen they now saw that the blurred knobs were actually three colored buttons yellow red and blue the buttons were each an inch in diameter and had knurled or machined edges the symbols above the buttons resolved sharply into a series of neatly stenciled labels from left to right the labels read emergency ready emergency lock and emergency open in english there was a moment of stunned silence and then very softly harry adams began to laugh the spacecraft thats english ted said staring at the screen written english yeah harry said sure is whats going on ted said is this some kind of joke no harry said he was calm oddly detached how could this spacecraft be three hundred years old and carry instructions in modem english think about it harry said ted frowned maybe he said this alien spacecraft is somehow presenting itself to us in a way that will make us comfortable think about it some more harry said there was a short silence well if it is an alien spacecraft its not an alien spacecraft harry said there was another silence then ted said well why dont you just tell us all what it is since youre so sure of yourself all right harry said its an american spacecraft an american spacecraft half a mile long made with technology we dont have yet and buried for three hundred years of course harry said its been obvious from the start right captain barnes we had considered it barnes admitted the president had considered it thats why you didnt inform the russians exactly by now ted was completely frustrated he clenched his fists as if he wanted to hit someone he looked from one person to another but how did you know the first clue harry said came from the condition of the craft itself it shows no damage whatever its condition is pristine yet any spacecraft that crashes in water will be damaged even at low entry velocitiessay two hundred miles an hourthe surface of water is as hard as concrete no matter how strong this craft is you would expect some degree of damage from the impact with the water yet it has no damage meaning meaning it didnt land in the water i dont understand it must have flown here it didnt fly here it arrived here from where from the future harry said this is some kind of earth craft that waswill bemade in the future and has traveled backward in time and appeared under our ocean several hundred years ago why would people in the future do that ted groaned he was clearly unhappy to be deprived of his alien craft his great historical moment he slumped in a chair and stared dully at the monitor screens i dont know why people in the future would do that harry said were not there yet maybe it was an accident unintended lets go ahead and open it up barnes said opening sir the robot hand moved forward toward the open button the hand pressed several times there was a clanking sound but nothing happened whats wrong barnes said sir were not able to impact the button the extensor arm is too large to fit inside the panel great shall i try the probe try the probe the claw hand moved back and a thin needle probe extended out toward the button the probe slid forward adjusted position delicately touched the button it pushedand slipped off trying again sir the probe again pressed the button and again slid off sir the surface is too slippery keep trying you know ted said thoughtfully this is still a remarkable situation in one sense its even more remarkable than contact with extraterrestrials i was already quite certain that extraterrestrial life exists in the universe but time travel frankly as an astrophysicist i had my doubts from everything we know its impossible contradicted by the laws of physics and yet now we have proof that time travel is possibleand that our own species will do it in the future ted was smiling wideeyed and happy again you had to admire him norman thoughthe was so wonderfully irrepressible and here we are ted said on the threshold of our first contact with our species from the future think of it we are going to meet ourselves from some future time the probe pressed again and again without success sir we cannot impact the button i see that barnes said standing up okay shut it down and get it out of there ted looks like youre going to get your wish after all well have to go in and open it up manually lets suit up into the ship in the changing room in cylinder a norman stepped into his suit tina and edmunds helped fit the helmet over his head and snaplocked the ring at the neck he felt the heavy weight of the rebreather tanks on his back the straps pressed into his shoulders he tasted metallic air there was a crackle as his helmet intercom came on the first words he heard were what about at the threshold of a great opportunity for the human species norman laughed grateful for the break in the tension you find it funny ted asked offended norman looked across the room at the suited man with fielding stenciled on his yellow helmet no norman said im just nervous me too beth said nothing to it barnes said trust me what are the three biggest lies in dh harry said and they laughed again they crowded together into the tiny airlock bumping helmeted heads and the bulkhead hatch to the left was sealed the wheel spinning barnes said okay folks just breathe easy he opened the lower hatch exposing black water the water did not rise into the compartment the habitats on positive pressure barnes said the level wont come up now watch me and do this the way i do you dont want to tear your suit moving awkwardly with the weight of the tanks he crouched down by the hatch gripped the side handholds and let go disappearing with a soft splash one by one they dropped down to the floor of the ocean norman gasped as nearfreezing water enveloped his suit immediately he heard the hum of a tiny fan as the electrical heaters in his suit activated his feet touched soft muddy ground he looked around in the darkness he was standing beneath the habitat directly ahead a hundred yards away was the glowing rectangular grid barnes was already striding forward leaning into the current moving slowly like a man on the moon isnt this fantastic calm down ted harry said beth said actually its odd how little life there is down here have you noticed not a sea fan not a slug not a sponge not a solitary fish nothing but empty brown sea floor this must be one of those dead spots in the pacific a bright light came on behind him normans own shadow was cast forward on the bottom he looked back and saw edmunds holding a camera and light in a bulky waterproof housing we recording all this yes sir try not to fall down norman beth laughed im trying they were closer now to the grid norman felt better seeing the other divers working there to the right was the high fin extending out of the coral an enormous smooth dark surface dwarfing them as it rose toward the surface barnes led them past the fin and down into a tunnel cut in the coral the tunnel was sixty feet long narrow strung with lights they walked single file it felt like going down into a mine norman thought this what the divers cut thats right norman saw a boxy corrugatedsteel structure surrounded by pressure tanks airlock ahead were almost there barnes said everybody okay so far harry said they entered the airlock and barnes closed the door air hissed loudly norman watched the water recede down past his faceplate then his waist his knees then to the floor the hissing stopped and they passed through another door sealing it behind them norman turned to the metal hull of the spaceship the robot had been moved aside norman felt very much as if he were standing alongside a big jetlinera curved metal surface and a flush door the metal was a dull gray which gave it an ominous quality despite himself norman was nervous listening to the way the others were breathing he sensed they were nervous too okay barnes said everybody here edmunds said wait for video please sir okay waiting they all lined up beside the door but they still had their helmets on it wasnt going to be much of a picture norman thought edmunds tape is running ted id like to say a few words harry jesus ted cant you ever let up ted i think its important harry go ahead make your speech ted hello this is ted fielding here at the door of the unknown spacecraft which has been discovered barnes wait a minute ted here at the door of the unknown spacecraft sounds like here at the tomb of the unknown soldier ted you dont like it barnes well i think it has the wrong associations ted i thought you would like it beth can we just get on with it please ted never mind harry what are you going to pout now ted never mind well do without any commentary on this historic moment harry okay fine lets get it open ted i think everybody knows how i feel i feel that we should have some brief remarks for posterity harry well make your goddamn remarks ted listen you son of a bitch ive had about enough of your superior knowitall attitude barnes stop tape please edmunds tape is stopped sir barnes lets everyone settle down harry i consider all this ceremony utterly irrelevant ted well its not irrelevant its appropriate barnes all right ill do it roll the tape edmunds tape is rolling barnes this is captain barnes we are now about to open the hatch cover present with me on this historic occasion are ted fielding norman johnson beth halpern and harry adams harry why am i last barnes i did it left to right harry harry isnt it funny the only black man is named last barnes harry its left to right the way were standing here harry and after the only woman im a full professor beth is only an assistant professor beth harry ted you know hal perhaps we should be identified by our full titles and institutional affiliations harry whats wrong with alphabetical order barnes thats it forget it no tape edmunds tape is off sir barnes jesus christ he turned away from the group shaking his helmeted head he flipped up the metal plate exposed the two buttons and pushed one a yellow light blinked ready everybody stay on internal air barnes said they all continued to breathe from their tanks in case the interior gases in the spacecraft were toxic everybody ready ready barnes pushed the button marked open a sign flashed adjusting atmosphere then with a rumble the door slid open sideways just like an airplane door for a moment norman could see nothing but blackness beyond they moved forward cautiously shone their lights through the open door saw girders a complex of metal tubes check the air beth beth pulled the plunger on a small gas monitor in her hand the readout screen glowed helium oxygen trace co and water vapor the right proportions its pressurized atmosphere the ship adjusted its own atmosphere looks like it okay one at a time barnes removed his helmet first breathed the air it seems okay metallic a slight tingle but okay he took a few deep breaths then nodded the others removed their helmets set them on the deck thats better shall we go why not there was a brief hesitation and then beth stepped through quickly ladies first the others followed her norman glanced back saw all their yellow helmets lying on the floor edmunds holding the video camera to her eye said go ahead dr johnson norman turned and stepped into the spacecraft interior they stood on a catwalk five feet wide suspended high in the air norman shone his flashlight down the beam glowed through forty feet of darkness before it splashed on the lower hull surrounding them dimly visible in the darkness was a dense network of struts and girders beth said its like being in an oil refinery she shone her light on one steel beam stenciled was avr all the stenciling was in english most of what you see is structural barnes said crossstress bracing for the outer hull gives tremendous support along all axes the ship is very ruggedly built as we suspected designed to take extraordinary stresses theres probably another hull further in norman was reminded that barnes had once been an aeronautical engineer not only that harry said shining his light on the outer hull look at thisa layer of lead radiation shield must be its six inches thick so this ship was built to handle a lot of radiation a hell of a lot harry said there was a haze in the ship and a faintly oily feel to the air the metal girders seemed to be coated in oil but when norman touched them the oil didnt come off on his fingers he realized that the metal itself had an unusual texture it was slick and slightly soft to the touch almost rubbery interesting ted said some kind of new material we associate strength with hardness but this metalif it is metalis both strong and soft materials technology has obviously advanced since our day obviously harry said well it makes sense ted said if you think of america fifty years ago as compared with today one of the biggest changes is the great variety of plastics and ceramics we have now that were not even imagined back then ted continued to talk his voice echoing in the cavernous darkness but norman could hear the tension in his voice teds whistling in the dark he thought they moved deeper into the ship norman felt dizzy to be so high in the gloom they came to a branchpoint in the catwalk it was hard to see with all the pipes and strutslike being in a forest of metal which way barnes had a wrist compass it glowed green go right they followed the network of catwalks for ten minutes more gradually norman could see that barnes was right there was a central cylinder constructed within the outer cylinder and held away from it by a dense arrangement of girders and supports a spacecraft within a spacecraft why would they build the ship like this youd have to ask them the reasons must have been compelling barnes said the power requirements for a double hull with so much lead shielding hard to imagine the engine youd need to make something this big fly after three or four minutes they arrived at the door on the inner hull it looked like the outer door breathers back on i dont know can we risk it without waiting beth flipped up the panel of buttons pressed open and the door rumbled open more darkness beyond they stepped through norman felt softness underfoot he shined his light down on beige carpeting their flashlights crisscrossed the room revealing a large contoured beige console with three highbacked padded seats the room was clearly built for human beings must be the bridge or the cockpit but the curved consoles were completely blank there was no instrumentation of any kind and the seats were empty they swung their beams back and forth in the darkness looks like a mockup rather than the real thing it cant be a mockup well it looks like one norman ran his hand over the smooth contours of the console it was nicely molded pleasant to feel norman pressed the surface felt it bend to his touch rubbery again another new material normans flashlight showed a few artifacts taped to the far end of the console was a handmarked sign on a threebyfive filing card it said go baby go nearby was a small plastic statuette of a cute animal that looked like a purple squirrel the base said lucky lemontina whatever that meant these seats leather looks like it where are the damned controls norman continued to poke at the blank console and suddenly the beige console surface took on depth and appeared to contain instruments screens all the instrumentation was somehow within the surface of the console like an optical illusion or a hologram norman read the lettering above the instruments pos thrusters f piston booster glider sieves more new technology ted said reminiscent of liquid crystals but far superior some kind of advanced optoelectronics suddenly all the console screens glowed red and there was a beeping sound startled norman jumped back the control panel was coming to life watch it everybody a single bright lightning flash of intense white light filled the room leaving a harsh afterimage oh god another flashand anotherand then the ceiling lights came on evenly illuminating the room norman saw startled frightened faces he sighed exhaling slowly jesus how the hell did that happen barnes said it was me beth said i pushed this button lets not go around pushing buttons if you dont mind barnes said irritably it was marked room lights it seemed an appropriate thing to do lets try to stay together on this barnes said well jesus hat just dont push any more buttons beth they were moving around the cabin looking at the instrument panel at the chairs all of them that is all except for harry he stood very still in the middle of the room not moving and said anybody see a date anywhere no date theres got to be a date harry said suddenly tense and weve got to find it because this is definitely an american spaceship from the future whats it doing here norman asked damned if i know harry said he shrugged norman frowned whats wrong harry nothing sure yeah sure norman thought hes figured out something and it bothers him but hes not saying what it is ted said so this is what a timetravel machine looks like i dont know barnes said if you ask me this instrument panel looks like its for flying and this room looks like a flight deck norman thought so too everything about the room reminded him of an airplane cockpit the three chairs for pilot copilot navigator the layout of the instrumentation this was a machine that flew he was sure of it yet something was odd he slipped into one of the contoured chairs the soft leatherlike material was almost too comfortable he heard a gurgling water inside i hope youre not going to fly this sucker ted laughed no no whats that whirring noise the chair gripped him norman had an instant of panic feeling the chair move all around his body squeezing his shoulders wrapping around his hips the leather padding slid around his head covering his ears drawing down over his forehead he was sinking deeper disappearing inside the chair itself being swallowed up by it oh god and then the chair snapped forward pulling up tight before the control console and the whirring stopped then nothing i think beth said that the chair thinks you are going to fly it umm norman said trying to control his breathing his racing pulse i wonder how i get out the only part of his body still free were his hands he moved his fingers felt a panel of buttons on the arms of the chair he pressed one the chair slid back opened like a soft clam released him norman climbed out and looked back at the imprint of his body slowly disappearing as the chair whirred and adjusted itself harry poked one of the leather pads experimentally heard the gurgle waterfilled makes perfect sense barnes said waters not compressible you can withstand enormous gforces sitting in a chair like this and the ship itself is built to take great strains ted said maybe time travel is strenuous structurally strenuous maybe norman was doubtful but i think barnes is rightthis is a machine that flew perhaps it just looks that way ted said after all we know how to travel in space but we dont know how to travel in time we know that space and time are really aspects of the same thing spacetime perhaps youre required to fly in time just the way you fly in space maybe time travel and space travel are more similar than we think now arent we forgetting something beth said where is everybody if people flew this thing in either time or space where are they probably somewhere else on the ship im not so sure harry said look at this leather on these seats its brandnew maybe it was a new ship no i mean really brandnew this leather doesnt show any scratches any cuts any coffeecup spills or stains there is nothing to suggest that these seats have ever been sat in maybe there wasnt any crew why would you have seats if there wasnt any crew maybe they took the crew out at the last minute it seems they were worried about radiation the inner hulls leadshielded too why should there be radiation associated with time travel i know ted said maybe the ship got launched by accident maybe the ship was on the launch pad and somebody pressed the button before the crew got aboard so the ship took off empty you mean oops wrong button thatd be a hell of a mistake norman said barnes shook his head im not buying it for one thing a ship this big could never be launched from earth it had to be built and assembled in orbit and launched from space what do you make of this beth said pointing to another console near the rear of the flight deck there was a fourth chair drawn up close to the console the leather was wrapped around a human form no kidding theres a man in there lets have a look beth pushed the armrest buttons the chair whirred back from the console and unwrapped itself they saw a man staring forward his eyes open my god after all these years perfectly preserved ted said you would expect that harry said considering hes a mannequin but hes so lifelike give our descendants some credit for advances harry said theyre half a century ahead of us he pushed the mannequin forward exposing an umbilicus running out the back at the base of the hips wires not wires ted said glass optical cables this whole ship uses optical technology and not electronics in any case its one mystery solved harry said looking at the dummy obviously this craft was built to be a manned ship but it was sent out unmanned why probably the intended voyage was too dangerous they sent an unmanned vessel first before they sent a manned vessel beth said and where did they send it with time travel you dont send it to a where you send it to a when okay then to when did they send it harry shrugged no information yet he said that diffidence again norman thought what was harry really thinking well this craft is half a mile long barnes said we have a lot more to see i wonder if they had a flight recorder norman said you mean like a commercial airliner yes something to record the activity of the ship on its voyage they must have harry said trace the dummy cable back youre sure to find it id like to see that recorder too in fact i would say it is crucial norman was looking at the console lifting up a keyboard panel look here he said i found a date they clustered around there was a stamp in the plastic beneath the keyboard intel inc made in usa serial no august looks like it so were walking through a ship fiftyodd years before its going to be built this is giving me a headache look here beth had moved forward from the console deck into what looked like living quarters there were twenty bunk beds crew of twenty if it took three people to fly it what were the other seventeen for nobody had an answer to that next they entered a large kitchen a toilet living quarters everything was new and sleekly designed but recognizable for what it was you know hal this is a lot more comfortable than dh yes maybe we should move in here absolutely not barnes said were studying this ship not living in it weve got a lot more work to do before we even begin to know what this is all about itd be more efficient to live here while we explore it i dont want to live here harry said it gives me the creeps me too beth said they had been aboard the ship for an hour now and normans feet hurt that was another thing he hadnt anticipated while exploring a large spacecraft from the future your feet could begin to hurt but barnes continued on leaving the crew quarters they entered a vast area of narrow walkways set out between great sealed compartments that stretched ahead as far as they could see the compartments turned out to be storage bays of immense size they opened one bay and found it was filled with heavy plastic containers which looked rather like the loading containers of contemporary airliners except many times larger they opened one container no kidding barnes said peering inside what is it food the food was wrapped in layers of lead foil and plastic like nasa rations ted picked one up food from the future he said and smacked his lips you going to eat that harry said absolutely ted said you know i once had a bottle of dom perignon but this will be the first time ive ever had anything to eat from the future from its also three hundred years old harry said maybe youll want to film this ted said to edmunds me eating edmunds dutifully put the camera to her eye flicked on the light lets not do that now barnes said we have other things to accomplish this is human interest ted said not now barnes said firmly he opened a second storage container and a third they all contained food they moved to the next storage bay and opened more containers its all food nothing but food the ship had traveled with an enormous amount of food even allowing for a crew of twenty it was enough food for a voyage of several years they were getting very tired it was a relief when beth found a button said i wonder what this does barnes said beth and the walkway began to move rubber tread rolling forward with a slight hum beth i want you to stop pushing every damn button you see but nobody else objected it was a relief to ride the walkway past dozens of identical storage bays finally they came to a new section much farther forward norman guessed by now they were a quarter of a mile from the crew compartment in the back that meant they were roughly in the middle of the huge ship and here they found a room with lifesupport equipment and twenty hanging spacesuits bingo ted said its finally clear this ship is intended to travel to the stars the others murmured excited by the possibility suddenly it all made sense the great size the vastness of the ship the complexity of the control consoles oh for christs sake harry said it cant have been made to travel to the stars this is obviously a conventional spacecraft although very large and at conventional speeds the nearest star is two hundred and fifty years away maybe they had new technology where is it theres no evidence of new technology well maybe its face the facts ted harry said even with this huge size the ship is only provisioned for a few years fifteen or twenty years at most how far could it go in that time barely out of the solar system right ted nodded glumly its true it took the voyager spacecraft five years to reach jupiter nine years to reach uranus in fifteen years maybe they were going to pluto why would anyone want to go to pluto we dont know yet but the radios squawked the voice of tina chan said captain barnes surface wants you for a secure encrypted communication sir okay barnes said its time to go back anyway they headed back through the vast ship to the main entrance space and time they were sitting in the lounge of dh watching the divers work on the grid barnes was in the next cylinder talking to the surface levy was cooking lunch or dinnera meal anyway they were all getting confused about what the navy people called surface time surface time doesnt matter down here edmunds said in her precise librarians voice day or night it just doesnt make any difference you get used to it they nodded vaguely everyone was tired norman saw the strain the tension of the exploration had taken its toll beth had already drifted off to sleep feet up on the coffee table her muscular arms folded across her chest outside the window three small submarines had come down and were hovering over the grid several divers were clustered around others were heading back to the divers habitat dh looks like somethings up harry said something to do with barness call could be harry was still preoccupied distracted wheres tina chan she must be with barnes why i need to talk to her what about ted said its personal harry said ted raised his eyebrows but said nothing more harry left going into d cyl norman and ted were alone hes a strange fellow ted said is he you know he is norman arrogant too probably because hes black compensating dont you think i dont know id say he has a chip on his shoulder ted said he seems to resent everything about this expedition he sighed of course mathematicians are all strange hes probably got no sort of life at all i mean a private life women and so forth did i tell you i married again i read it somewhere norman said shes a television reporter ted said wonderful woman he smiled when we got married she gave me this corvette beautiful corvette as a wedding present you know that nice fireengine red color they had in the fifties that color ted paced around the room glanced over at beth i just think this is all unbelievably exciting i couldnt possibly sleep norman nodded it was interesting how different they all were he thought ted eternally optimistic with the bubbling enthusiasm of a child harry with the cold critical demeanor the icy mind the unblinking eye beth not so intellectual or so cerebral at once more physical and more emotional that was why though they were all exhausted only beth could sleep say norman ted said i thought you said this was going to be scary i thought it would be norman said well ted said of all the people who could be wrong about this expedition im glad it was you i am too although i cant imagine why you would select a man like harry adams for this team not that he isnt distinguished but norman didnt want to talk about harry ted remember back on the ship when you said space and time are aspects of the same thing spacetime yes ive never really understood that why its quite straightforward you can explain it to me sure in english norman said you mean explain it without mathematics yes well ill try ted frowned but norman knew he was pleased ted loved to lecture he paused for a moment then said okay lets see where we need to begin youre familiar with the idea that gravity is just geometry no curvature of space and time not really no uh einsteins general relativity sorry norman said never mind ted said there was a bowl of fruit on the table ted emptied the bowl setting the fruit on the table okay this table is space nice flat space okay norman said ted began to position the pieces of fruit this orange is the sun and these are the planets which move in circles around the sun so we have the solar system on this table okay fine ted said now the sunhe pointed to the orange in the center of the tableis very large so it has a lot of gravity right ted gave norman a ball bearing this is a spaceship i want you to send it through the solar system so it passes very close to the sun okay norman took the ball bearing and rolled it so it passed close to the orange okay you notice that your ball rolled straight across the flat table right but in real life what would happen to your spacecraft when it passed near the sun it would get sucked into the sun yes we say it would fall into the sun the spacecraft would curve inward from a straight line and hit the sun but your spacecraft didnt no so we know that the flat table is wrong ted said real space cant be flat like the table it cant no ted said he took the empty bowl and set the orange in the bottom now roll your ball straight across past the sun norman flicked the ball bearing into the bowl the ball curved and spiraled down the inside of the bowl until it hit the orange okay ted said the spacecraft hit the sun just like it would in real life but if i gave it enough speed norman said itd go right past it itd roll down and up the far side of the bowl and out again correct ted said also like real life if the spacecraft has enough velocity it will escape the gravitational field of the sun right so ted said what we are showing is that a spacecraft passing the sun in real life behaves as if it were entering a curved region of space around the sun space around the sun is curved like this bowl okay and if your ball had the right speed it wouldnt escape from the bowl but instead would just spiral around endlessly inside the rim of the bowl and thats what the planets are doing they are endlessly spiraling inside the bowl created by the sun he put the orange back on the table in reality you should imagine the table is made out of rubber and the planets are all making dents in the rubber as they sit there thats what space is really like real space is curvedand the curvature changes with the amount of gravity yes so ted said space is curved by gravity okay and that means that you can think of gravity as nothing more than the curvature of space the earth has gravity because the earth curves the space around it okay except its not that simple ted said norman sighed i didnt think it would be harry came back into the room looked at the fruit on the table but said nothing now ted said when you roll your ball bearing across the bowl you notice that it not only spirals down but it also goes faster right yes now when an object goes faster time on that object passes slower einstein proved that early in the century what it means is that you can think of the curvature of space as also representing a curvature of time the deeper the curve in the bowl the slower time passes harry said well laymans terms ted said give the guy a break yeah norman said give the guy a break ted held up the bowl now if youre doing all this mathematically what you find is that the curved bowl is neither space nor time but the combination of both which is called spacetime this bowl is spacetime and objects moving on it are moving in spacetime we dont think about movement that way but thats really whats happening it is sure take baseball idiot game harry said i hate games you know baseball ted said to norman yes norman said okay imagine the batter hits a line drive to the center fielder the ball goes almost straight out and takes say half a second right now imagine the batter hits a high pop fly to the same center fielder this time the ball goes way up in the air and it takes six seconds before the center fielder catches it okay now the paths of the two ballsthe line drive and the pop flylook very different to us but both these balls moved exactly the same in spacetime no norman said yes ted said and in a way you already know it suppose i ask you to hit a high pop fly to the center fielder but to make it reach the fielder in half a second instead of six seconds thats impossible norman said why just hit the pop fly harder if i hit it harder it will go higher and end up taking longer okay then hit a low line drive that takes six seconds to reach center field i cant do that either right ted said so what you are telling me is that you cant make the ball do anything you want there is a fixed relationship governing the path of the ball through space and time sure because the earth has gravity yes ted said and weve already agreed that gravity is a curvature of spacetime like the curve of this bowl any baseball on earth must move along the same curve of spacetime as this ball bearing moves along this bowl look he put the orange back in the bowl heres the earth he put two fingers on opposite sides of the orange heres batter and fielder now roll the ball bearing from one finger to the other and youll find you have to accommodate the curve of the bowl either you flick the ball lightly and it will roll close to the orange or you can give it a big flick and it will go way up the side of the bowl before falling down again to the other side but you cant make this ball bearing do anything you want because the ball bearing is moving along the curved bowl and thats what your baseball is really doingits moving on curved spacetime norman said i sort of get it but what does this have to do with time travel well we think the gravitational field of the earth is strongit hurts us when we fall downbut in reality its very weak its almost nonexistent so spacetime around the earth isnt very curved spacetime is much more curved around the sun and in other parts of the universe its very curved producing a sort of rollercoaster ride and all sorts of distortions of time may occur in fact if you consider a black hole he broke off yes ted a black hole oh my god ted said softly harry pushed his glasses up on his nose and said ted for once in your life you just might be right they both grabbed for paper began scribbling it couldnt be a schwartzschild hole no no have to be rotating angular momentum would assure that and you couldnt approach the singularity no the tidal forces rip you apart but if you just dipped below the event horizon is it possible did they have the nerve the two fell silent making calculations muttering to themselves what is it about a black hole norman said but they werent listening to him any more the intercom clicked barnes said attention this is the captain speaking i want all hands in the conference room on the double were in the conference room norman said on the double now were already there hal that is all barnes said and the intercom clicked off the conference ive just been on the scrambler with admiral spaulding of cinccompac honolulu barnes said apparently spaulding just learned that i had taken civilians to saturated depths for a project about which he knew nothing he wasnt happy about it there was a silence they all looked at him he demanded that all the civilians be sent up topside good norman thought he had been disappointed by what they had found so far the prospect of spending another seventytwo hours in this humid claustrophobic environment while they investigated an empty space vehicle did not appeal to him i thought ted said we had direct authorization from the president we do barnes said but there is the question of the storm what storm harry said theyre reporting fifteenknot winds and southeast swells on the surface it looks like a pacific cyclone is headed our way and will reach us within twentyfour hours theres going to be a storm here beth said not here barnes said down here we wont feel anything but itll be rough on the surface all our surface support ships may have to pull out and steam for protected harbors in tonga so wed be left alone down here for twentyfour to fortyeight hours yes that wouldnt be a problemwere entirely selfsufficientbut spaulding is nervous about pulling surface support when there are civilians below i want to know your feelings do you want to stay down and continue exploring the ship or leave stay definitely ted said barnes said beth i came here to investigate unknown life beth said but there isnt any life on that ship it just isnt what i thought it would behoped it would be i say we go barnes said norman lets admit the truth norman said were not really trained for a saturated environment and were not really comfortable down here at least im not and were not the best people to evaluate this spacecraft at this point the navyd be much better off with a team of nasa engineers i say go harry lets get the hell out harry said any particular reason barnes said call it intuition ted said i cant believe you would say that harry just when we have this fabulous new idea about the ship thats beside the point now barnes said crisply ill make the arrangements with the surface to pull us out in another twelve hours ted said god damn it but norman was looking at barnes barnes wasnt upset he wants to leave he thought hes looking for an excuse to leave and were providing his excuse meantime barnes said we can make one and perhaps even two more trips to the ship well rest for the next two hours and then go back thats all for now i have more id like to say thats all ted the votes been taken get some rest as they headed toward their bunks barnes said beth id like a word with you please what about beth when we go back to the ship i dont want you pushing every button you come across all i did was turn on the lights hal yes but you didnt know that when you sure i did the button said room lights it was pretty clear as they moved off they heard beth say im not one of your little navy people you can order around hal and then barnes said something else and the voices faded damn it ted said he kicked one of the iron walls it rang hollowly they passed into c cylinder on their way to the bunks i cant believe you people want to leave ted said this is such an exciting discovery how can you walk away from it especially you harry the mathematical possibilities alone the theory of the black hole ill tell you why harry said i want to go because barnes wants to go barnes doesnt want to go ted said why he put it to a vote i know what he did but barnes doesnt want to look as if hes made the wrong decision in the eyes of his superiors or as if hes backing down so he let us decide but im telling you barnes wants to go norman was surprised the cliche image of mathematicians was that they had their heads in the clouds were absentminded inattentive but harry was astute he didnt miss a thing why would barnes want to go ted said i think its clear harry said because of the storm on the surface the storm isnt here yet ted said no harry said and when it comes we dont know how long it will last barnes said twentyfour to fortyeight hours neither barnes nor anyone else can predict how long the storm will last harry said what if it lasts five days we can hold out that long we have air and supplies for five days whatre you so worried about im not worried harry said but i think barnes is worried nothing will go wrong for christs sake ted said i think we should stay and then there was a squishing sound they looked down at the allweather carpeting at their feet the carpet was dark soaked whats that id say it was water harry said salt water ted said bending over touching the damp spot he licked his finger doesnt taste salty from above them a voice said thats because its urine looking up they saw teeny fletcher standing on a platform among a network of pipes near the curved top of the cylinder everythings under control gentlemen just a small leak in the liquid waste disposal pipe that goes to the ho recycler liquid waste ted was shaking his head just a small leak fletcher said no problem sir she sprayed one of the pipes with white foam from a spray canister the foam sputtered and hardened on the pipe we just urethane the suckers when we get them makes a perfect seal how often do you get these leaks harry said liquid waste ted said again hard to say dr adams but dont worry really i feel sick ted said harry slapped him on the back come on it wont kill you lets get some sleep i think im going to throw up they went into the sleeping chamber ted immediately ran off to the showers they heard him coughing and gagging poor ted harry said shaking his head norman said whats all this business about a black hole anyway a black hole harry said is a dead compressed star basically a star is like a big beach ball inflated by the atomic explosions occurring inside it when a star gets old and runs out of nuclear fuel the ball collapses to a much smaller size if it collapses enough it becomes so dense and it has so much gravity that it keeps on collapsing squeezing down on itself until it is very dense and very smallonly a few miles in diameter then its a black hole nothing else in the universe is as dense as a black hole so theyre black because theyre dead no theyre black because they trap all the light black holes have so much gravity they pull everything into them like vacuum cleanersall the surrounding interstellar gas and dust and even light itself they just suck it right up they suck up light norman said he found it hard to think of that yes so what were you two so excited about with your calculations oh its a long story and its just speculation harry yawned it probably wont amount to anything anyway talk about it later sure norman said harry rolled over went to sleep ted was still in the showers hacking and sputtering norman went back to d cyl to tinas console did harry find you all right he said i know he wanted to see you yes sir and i have the information he requested now why did you want to make out your will too norman frowned dr adams said he didnt have a will and he wanted to make one he seemed to feel it was quite urgent anyway i checked with the surface and you cant do it its some legal problem about it being in your own handwriting you cant transmit your will over electronic lines i see im sorry dr johnson should i tell the others as well no norman said dont bother the others well be going to the surface soon right after we have one last look at the ship the large glass this time they split up inside the spaceship barnes ted and edmunds continued forward in the vast cargo bays to search the parts of the ship that were still unexplored norman beth and harry stayed in what they now called the flight deck looking for the flight recorder teds parting words were it is a far far better thing that i do than i have ever done then he set off with barnes edmunds left them a small video monitor so they could see the progress of the other team in the forward section of the ship and they could hear ted chattered continuously to barnes giving his views about structural features of the ship the design of the big cargo bays reminded ted of the stonework of the ancient mycenaeans in greece particularly the lion gate ramp at mycenae ted has more irrelevant facts at his fingertips than any man i know harry said can we turn the volume down yawning norman turned the monitor down he was tired the bunks in dh were damp the electric blankets heavy and clinging sleep had been almost impossible and then beth had come storming in after her talk with barnes she was still angry now god damn barnes she said where does he get off hes doing the best he can like everyone else norman said she spun you know norman sometimes youre too psychological and understanding the man is an idiot a complete idiot lets just find the flight recorder shall we harry said thats the important thing now harry was following the umbilicus cable that ran out the back of the mannequin into the floor he was lifting up floor panels tracing the wires aft im sorry beth said but he wouldnt speak like that to a man certainly not to ted teds hogging the whole show and i dont see why he should be allowed to what does ted have to do with norman began the man is a parasite thats what he is he takes the ideas of others and promotes them as his own even the way he quotes famous sayingsits outrageous you feel he takes other peoples ideas norman said listen back on the surface i mentioned to ted that we ought to have some words ready when we opened this thing and the next thing i know teds making up quotes and positioning himself in front of the camera well well what norman dont well me for christs sake it was my idea and he took it without so much as a thank you did you say anything to him about it norman said no i did not say anything to him about it im sure he wouldnt remember if i did hed go did you say that beth i suppose you might have mentioned something like that yes i still think you should talk to him norman youre not listening to me if you talked to him at least you wouldnt be so angry about it now shrink talk she said shaking her head look ted does whatever he wants on this expedition he makes his stupid speeches whatever he wants but i go through the door first and barnes gives me hell why shouldnt i go first whats wrong with a woman being the first for once in the history of science beth and then i had the gall to turn on the lights you know what barnes said about that he said i might have started a shortcircuit and put us all in jeopardy he said i didnt know what i was doing he said i was impulsive jesus impulsive stoneage military cretin turn the volume back up harry said id rather hear ted come on guys were all under a lot of pressure beth norman said its going to affect everybody in different ways she glared at norman youre saying barnes was right im saying were all under pressure including him including you jesus you men always stick together you know why im still an assistant professor and not tenured your pleasant easygoing personality harry said i can do without this i really can beth harry said you see the way these cables are going theyre running toward that bulkhead there see if they go up the wall on the other side of the door you trying to get rid of me if possible she laughed breaking the tension all right ill look on the other side of the door when she was gone harry said shes pretty worked up norman said you know the ben stone story which one beth did her graduate work in stones lab oh benjamin stone was a biochemist at bu a colorful engaging man stone had a reputation as a good researcher who used his graduate students like lab assistants taking their results as his own in this exploitation of others work stone was not unique in the academic community but he proceeded a little more ruthlessly than his colleagues beth was living with him as well uhhuh back in the early seventies apparently she did a series of important experiments on the energetics of ciliary inclusion bodies they had a big argument and stone broke off his relationship with her she left the lab and he published five papersall her workwithout her name on them very nice harry said so now she lifts weights well she feels mistreated and i can see her point yeah harry said but the thing is lie down with dogs get up with fleas you know what i mean jesus beth said returning this is like the girl whos raped is always asking for it is that what youre saying no harry said still lifting up floor panels following the wires but sometimes you gotta ask what the girl is doing in a dark alley at three in the morning in a bad part of town i was in love with him its still a bad part of town i was twentytwo years old how old do you have to be up yours harry harry shook his head you find the wires butch yes i found the wires they go into some kind of a glass grid lets have a look norman said going next door hed seen flight recorders before they were long rectangular metal boxes reminiscent of safedeposit boxes painted red or bright orange if this was he stopped he was looking at a transparent glass cube one foot on each side inside the cube was an intricate grid arrangement of fine glowing blue lines between the glowing lines blue lights flickered intermittently there were two pressure gauges mounted on top of the cube and three pistons and there were a series of silver stripes and rectangles on the outer surface on the left side it didnt look like anything he had seen before interesting harry peered into the cube some kind of optronic memory is my guess we dont have anything like it he touched the silver stripes on the outside not paint its some plastic material probably machinereadable by what certainly not us no probably a robot recovery device of some kind and the pressure gauges the cube is filled with some kind of gas under pressure maybe it contains biological components to attain that compactness in any case ill bet this large glass is a memory device a flight recorder their equivalent yes how do we access it watch this beth said going back to the flight deck she began pushing sections of the console activating it dont tell barnes she said over her shoulder how do you know where to press i dont think it matters she said i think the console can sense where you are the control panel keeps track of the pilot something like that in front of them a section of the console glowed making a screen yellow on black rvlhooq dcomi uss star voyager then nothing harry said now well get the bad news what bad news norman said and he wondered why had harry stayed behind to look for the flight recorder instead of going with ted and barnes to explore the rest of the ship why was he so interested in the past history of this vessel maybe it wont be bad harry said why do you think it might be because harry said if you consider it logically something vitally important is missing from this ship at that moment the screen filled with columns ship systems propulsion systems life systems waste manag v data systems status om outer quartermaster status om inner flight records status om fore core operations status dv aft deck control status v summa integration direct status comrec lss test line a lss test line a bx lss test stabilix whats your pleasure beth said hands on the console flight records harry said he bit his lip flight data summaries rvlhooq fds fds fds fds fds fds fds fds fds entry event fds entry event fds entry event summary ampozoddxxxx fs xxxx xxxxxxxx what do you make of that norman said harry was peering at the screen as you see the earliest records are in threeyear intervals then theyre shorter one year then six months and finally one month then this entry event business so they were recording more and more carefully beth said as the ship approached the entry event whatever it was i have a pretty good idea what it was harry said i just cant believe thatlets start how about entry event summary beth pushed buttons on the screen a field of stars and around the edges of the field a lot of numbers it was threedimensional giving the illusion of depth holographic not exactly but similar several largemagnitude stars there or planets what planets i dont know this is one for ted harry said he may be able to identify the image lets go on he touched the console the screen changed more stars yeah and more numbers the numbers around the edges of the screen were flickering changing rapidly the stars dont seem to be moving but the numbers are changing no look the stars are moving too they could see that all the stars were moving away from the center of the screen which was now black and empty no stars in the center and everything moving away harry said thoughtfully the stars on the outside were moving very quickly streaking outward the black center was expanding why is it empty like that in the center harry beth said i dont think it is empty i cant see anything no but its not empty in just a minute we should seethere a dense white cluster of stars suddenly appeared in the center of the screen the cluster expanded as they watched it was a strange effect norman thought there was still a distinct black ring that expanded outward with stars on the outside and on the inside it felt as if they were flying through a giant black donut my god harry said softly do you know what you are looking at no beth said whats that cluster of stars in the center its another universe its what well okay its probably another universe or it might be a different region of our own universe nobody really knows for sure whats the black donut norman said its not a donut its a black hole what you are seeing is the recording made as this spacecraft went through a black hole and entered into anotheris someone calling harry turned cocked his head they fell silent but heard nothing what do you mean another universe sssssh a short silence and then a faint voice crying hellooo whos that norman said straining to listen the voice was so soft but it sounded human and maybe more than one voice it was coming from somewhere inside the spacecraft yoohoo anybody there hellooo oh for gods sake beth said its them on the monitor she turned up the volume on the little monitor edmunds had left behind on the screen they saw ted and barnes standing in a room somewhere and shouting hellooo hellooooo can we talk back yes press that button on the side norman said we hear you high damn time ted all right now barnes said listen up what are you people doing back there ted said listen up barnes said he stepped to one side revealing a piece of multicolored equipment we now know what this ship is for so do we harry said we do beth and norman said together but barnes wasnt listening and the ship seems to have picked up something on its travels picked up something what is it i dont know barnes said but its something alien something alien the moving walkway carried them past endless large cargo bays they were going forward to join barnes and ted and edmunds and to see their alien discovery why would anyone send a spaceship through a black hole beth asked because of gravity harry said you see black holes have so much gravity they distort space and time incredibly you remember how ted was saying that planets and stars make dents in the fabric of spacetime well black holes make tears in the fabric and some people think its possible to fly through those tears into another universe or another part of our universe or to another time another time thats the idea harry said are you people coming barness tinny voice on the monitor in transit now beth said glowering at the screen he cant see you norman said i dont care they rode past more cargo areas harry said i cant wait to see teds face when we tell him finally they reached the end of the walkway they passed through a midsection of struts and girders and entered a large forward room which they had previously seen on the monitor with ceilings nearly a hundred feet high it was enormous you could put a sixstory building in this room norman thought looking up he saw a hazy mist or fog whats that thats a cloud barnes said shaking his head the room is so big it apparently has its own weather maybe it even rains in here sometimes the room was filled with machinery on an immense scale at first glance it looked like oversized earthmoving machinery except it was brightly painted in primary colors glistening with oil then norman began to notice individual features there were giant claw hands enormously powerful arms moving gear wheels and an array of buckets and receptacles he realized suddenly he was looking at something very similar to the grippers and claws mounted on the front end of the charon v submersible he had ridden down on the day before was it the day before or was it still the same day which day was this july how long had they been down here if you look carefully barnes was saying you can see that some of these devices appear to be largescale weapons others like that long extensor arm the various attachments to pick things up in effect make this ship a gigantic robot a robot no kidding beth said i guess it would have been appropriate for a robot to open it after all ted said thoughtfully maybe even fitting snug fitting beth said pipe fitting norman said sort of robottorobot you mean harry said sort of a meeting of the threads and treads hey ted said i dont make fun of your comments even when theyre stupid i wasnt aware they ever were harry said you say foolish things sometimes thoughtless children barnes said can we get back to the business at hand point it out the next time ted i will ill be glad to know when i say something foolish no problem something you consider foolish tell you what barnes said to norman when we go back to the surface lets leave these two down here surely you cant think of going back now ted said weve already voted but that was before we found the object where is the object harry said over here harry ted said with a wicked grin lets see what your fabled powers of deduction make of this they walked deeper into the room moving among the giant hands and claws and they saw nestled in the padded claw of one hand a large perfectly polished silver sphere about thirty feet in diameter the sphere had no markings or features of any kind they moved around the sphere seeing themselves reflected in the polished metal norman noticed an odd shifting iridescence faint rainbow hues of blue and red gleaming in the metal it looks like an oversized ball bearing harry said keep walking smart guy on the far side they discovered a series of deep convoluted grooves cut in an intricate pattern into the surface of the sphere the pattern was arresting though norman could not immediately say why the pattern wasnt geometric and it wasnt amorphous or organic either it was hard to say what it was norman had never seen anything like it and as he continued to look at it he felt increasingly certain this was a pattern never found on earth never created by any man never conceived by a human imagination ted and barnes were right he felt sure of it this sphere was something alien priorities huh harry said after staring in silence for a long time im sure youll want to get back to us on this ted said about where it came from and so on actually i know where it came from and he told ted about the star record and the black hole actually ted said i suspected that this ship was made to travel through a black hole for some time did you what was your first clue the heavy radiation shielding harry nodded thats true you probably guessed the significance of that before i did he smiled but you didnt tell anybody hey ted said theres no question about it i was the one who proposed the black hole first you did yes no question at all remember in the conference room i was explaining to norman about spacetime and i started to do the calculations for the black hole and then you joined in norman you remember that i proposed it first norman said thats true you had the idea harry grinned i didnt feel that was a proposal i thought it was more like a guess or a speculation harry ted said you are rewriting history there are witnesses since youre so far ahead of everybody else harry said how about telling us your proposals for the nature of this object with pleasure ted said this object is a burnished sphere approximately ten meters in diameter not solid and composed of a dense metal alloy of an asyetunknown nature the cabalistic markings on this side these grooves are what youre calling cabalistic do you mind if i finish the cabalistic markings on this side clearly suggest artistic or religious ornamentation evoking a ceremonial quality this indicates the object has significance to whoever made it i think we can be sure thats true personally i believe that this sphere is intended as a form of contact with us visitors from another star another solar system it is if you will a greeting a message or a trophy a proof that a higher form of life exists in the universe all well and good and beside the point harry said what does it do im not sure it does anything i think it just is it is what it is very zen well whats your idea lets review what we know harry said as opposed to what we imagine in a flight of fancy this is a spacecraft from the future built with all sorts of materials and technology we havent developed yet although we are about to develop them this ship was sent by our descendants through a black hole and into another universe or another part of our universe yes this spacecraft is unmanned but equipped with robot arms which are clearly designed to pick up things that it finds so we can think of this ship as a huge version of the unmanned mariner spacecraft that we sent in the s to mars to look for life there this spacecraft from the future is much bigger and more complicated but its essentially the same sort of machine its a probe yes so the probe goes into another universe where it comes upon this sphere presumably it finds the sphere floating in space or perhaps the sphere is sent out to meet the spacecraft right ted said sent out to meet it as an emissary thats what i think in any case our robot spacecraft according to whatever builtin criteria it has decides that this sphere is interesting it automatically grabs the sphere in its big claw hand here draws it inside the ship and brings it home except in going home it goes too far it goes into the past its past harry said our present right barnes snorted impatiently fine so this spacecraft goes out and picks up a silver alien sphere and brings it back get to the point what is this sphere harry walked forward to the sphere pressed his ear against the metal and rapped it with his knuckles he touched the grooves his hands disappearing in the deep indentations the sphere was so highly polished norman could see harrys face distorted in the curve of the metal yes as i suspected these cabalistic markings as you call them are not decorative at all they have another purpose entirely to conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere thus they represent a door harry stepped back what is the sphere ill tell you what i think harry said i think this sphere is a hollow container i think theres something inside and i think it scares the hell out of me first evaluation no mr secretary barnes said into the phone were pretty sure it is an alien artifact there doesnt seem to be any question about that he glanced at norman sitting across the room yes sir barnes said very damn exciting they were back in the habitat and barnes had immediately called washington he was trying to delay their return to the surface not yet we havent opened it well we havent been able to open it the door is a weird shape and its very finely milled no you couldnt wedge anything in the crack he looked at norman rolled his eyes no we tried that too there dont seem to be any exterior controls no no message on the outside no no labels either all it is is a highly polished sphere with some convoluted grooves on one side what blast it open norman turned away he was in d cylinder in the communications section run by tina chan she was adjusting a dozen monitors with her usual calm norman said you seem like the most relaxed person here she smiled just inscrutable sir is that it it must be sir she said adjusting the vertical gain on one rolling monitor the screen showed the polished sphere because i feel my heart pounding sir what do you think is inside that thing i havent any idea norman said do you think theres an alien inside you know some kind of a living creature maybe and were trying to open it up maybe we shouldnt let it out whatever is in there arent you curious norman said not that curious sir i dont see how blasting would work barnes was saying on the phone yes we have smtmps yes oh different sizes but i dont think we can blast the sucker open no well if you saw it youd understand the thing is perfectly made perfect tina adjusted a second monitor they had two views of the sphere and soon there would be a third edmunds was setting up cameras to watch the sphere that had been one of harrys suggestions harry had said monitor it maybe it does something from time to time has some activity on the screen he saw the network of wires that had been attached to the sphere they had a full array of passive sensors sound and the full electromagnetic spectrum from infrared to gamma and xrays the readouts on the sensors were displayed on a bank of instruments to the left harry came in getting anything yet tina shook her head so far nothing has ted come back no norman said teds still there ted had remained behind in the cargo bay ostensibly to help edmunds set up the cameras but in fact they knew he would try to open the sphere they saw ted now on the second monitor probing the grooves touching pushing harry smiled he hasnt got a prayer norman said harry remember when we were in the flight deck and you said you wanted to make out your will because something was missing oh that harry said forget it thats irrelevant now barnes was saying no mr secretary raising it to the surface would be just about impossiblewell sir it is presently located inside a cargo bay half a mile inside the ship and the ship is buried under thirty feet of coral and the sphere itself is a good thirty feet across its the size of a small house i just wonder whats in the house tina said on the monitor ted kicked the sphere in frustration not a prayer harry said again hell never get it open beth came in how are we going to open it harry said how harry stared thoughtfully at the sphere gleaming on the monitor there was a long silence maybe we cant we cant open it you mean not ever thats one possibility norman laughed ted would kill himself barnes was saying well mr secretary if you wanted to commit the necessary navy resources to do a fullscale salvage from one thousand feet we might be able to undertake it starting six months from now when we were assured of a month of good surface weather in this region yes its winter in the south pacific now yes beth said i can see it now at great expense the navy brings a mysterious alien sphere to the surface it is transported to a topsecret government installation in omaha experts from every branch come and try to open it nobody can like excalibur norman said beth said as time goes by they try stronger and stronger methods eventually they try to blow it open with a small nuclear device and still nothing finally nobody has any more ideas the sphere sits there decades go by the sphere is never opened she shook her head one great frustration for mankind norman said to harry do you really think thatd happen that wed never get it open harry said never is a long time no sir barnes was saying given this new development well stay down to the last minute weather topside is holdingat least six more hours yes sir from the metsat reportswell i have to rely on that judgment yes sir hourly yes sir he hung up turned to the group okay we have authorization to stay down six to twelve hours more as long as the weather holds lets try to open that sphere in the time remaining teds working on it now harry said on the video monitor they saw ted fielding slap the polished sphere with his hand and shout open open sesame open up you son of a bitch the sphere did not respond the anthropomorphic problem seriously norman said i think somebody has to ask the question should we consider not opening it up why barnes said listen i just got off the phone i know norman said but maybe we should think twice about this out of the corner of his eye he saw tina nodding vigorously harry looked skeptical beth rubbed her eyes sleepy are you afraid or do you have a substantive argument barnes said i have the feeling harry said that normans about to quote from his own work well yes norman admitted i did put this in my report in his report he had called it the anthropomorphic problem basically the problem was that everybody who had ever thought or written about extraterrestrial life imagined that life as essentially human even if the extraterrestrial life didnt look humanif it was a reptile or a big insect or an intelligent crystalit still acted in a human way youre talking about the movies barnes said im talking about research papers too every conception of extraterrestrial life whether by a movie maker or a university professor has been basically humanassuming human values human understanding human ways of approaching a humanly understandable universe and generally a human appearancetwo eyes a nose a mouth and so on so so norman said thats obviously nonsense for one thing theres enough variation in human behavior to make understanding just within our own species very troublesome the differences between say americans and japanese are very great americans and japanese dont really look at the world the same way at all yes yes barnes said impatiently we all know the japanese are different and when you come to a new life form the differences may be literally incomprehensible the values and ethics of this new form of life may be utterly different you mean it may not believe in the sanctity of life or thou shalt not kill barnes said still impatient no norman said i mean that this creature may not be able to be killed and so it may have no concept of killing in the first place barnes stopped this creature may not be able to be killed norman nodded as someone once said you cant break the arms of a creature that has no arms it cant be killed you mean its immortal i dont know norman said thats the point i mean jesus a thing that couldnt be killed barnes said how would we kill it he bit his lip i wouldnt like to open that sphere and release a thing that couldnt be killed harry laughed no promotions for that one hal barnes looked at the monitors showing several views of the polished sphere finally he said no thats ridiculous no living thing is immortal am i right beth actually no beth said you could argue that certain living creatures on our own planet are immortal for example singlecelled organisms like bacteria and yeasts are apparently capable of living indefinitely yeasts barnes snorted were not talking about yeasts and to all intents and purposes a virus could be considered immortal a virus barnes sat down in a chair he hadnt considered a virus but how likely is it really harry i think harry said that the possibilities go far beyond what weve mentioned so far weve only considered threedimensional creatures of the kind that exist in our threedimensional universeor to be more precise the universe that we perceive as having three dimensions some people think our universe has nine or eleven dimensions barnes looked tired except the other six dimensions are very small so we dont notice them barnes rubbed his eyes therefore this creature harry continued may be multidimensional so that it literally does not existat least not entirelyin our usual three dimensions to take the simplest case if it were a fourdimensional creature we would only see part of it at any time because most of the creature would exist in the fourth dimension that would obviously make it difficult to kill and if it were a fivedimensional creature just a minute why havent any of you mentioned this before we thought you knew harry said knew about fivedimensional creatures that cant be killed nobody said a word to me he shook his head opening this sphere could be incredibly dangerous it could yes what we have here is we have pandoras box thats right well barnes said lets consider worst cases whats the worst case for what we might find beth said i think thats clear irrespective of whether its a multidimensional creature or a virus or whatever irrespective of whether it shares our morals or has no morals at all the worst case is that it hits us below the belt meaning meaning that it behaves in a way that interferes with our basic life mechanisms a good example is the aids virus the reason why aids is so dangerous is not that its new we get new viruses every yearevery week and all viruses work in the same way they attack cells and convert the machinery of the cells to make more viruses what makes the aids virus dangerous is it attacks the specific cells that we use to defend against viruses aids interferes with our basic defense mechanism and we have no defense against it well barnes said if this sphere contains a creature that interferes with our basic mechanismswhat would that creature be like it could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas beth said it could excrete radioactive waste harry said it could disrupt our brain waves norman said interfere with our ability to think or beth said it might merely disrupt cardiac conduction stop our hearts from beating it might produce a sound vibration that would resonate in our skeletal system and shatter our bones harry said he smiled at the others i rather like that one clever beth said but as usual were only thinking of ourselves the creature might do nothing directly harmful to us at all ah barnes said it might simply exhale a toxin that kills chloroplasts so that plants could no longer convert sunlight then all the plants on earth would dieand consequently all life on earth would die ah barnes said you see norman said at first i thought the anthropomorphic problemthe fact that we can only conceive of extraterrestrial life as basically humani thought it was a failure of imagination man is man all he knows is man and all he can think of is what he knows yet as you can see thats not true we can think of plenty of other things but we dont so there must be another reason why we only conceive of extraterrestrials as humans and i think the answer is that we are in reality terribly frail animals and we dont like to be reminded of how frail we arehow delicate the balances are inside our own bodies how short our stay on earth and how easily it is ended so we imagine other life forms as being like us so we dont have to think of the real threatthe terrifying threatthey may represent without ever intending to there was a silence of course we mustnt forget another possibility bames said it may be that the sphere contains some extraordinary benefit to us some wondrous new knowledge some astonishing new idea or new technology which will improve the condition of mankind beyond our wildest dreams although the chances are harry said that there wont be any new idea that is useful to us why barnes said well lets say that the aliens are a thousand years ahead of us just as we are relative to say medieval europe suppose you went back to medieval europe with a television set there wouldnt be any place to plug it in barnes stared from one to another for a long time im sorry he said this is too great a responsibility for me i cant make the decision to open it up i have to call washington on this ted wont be happy harry said the hell with ted barnes said im going to give this to the president until we hear from him i dont want anybody trying to open that sphere barnes called for a twohour rest period and harry went to his quarters to sleep beth announced that she was going off to sleep too but she remained at the monitor station with tina chan and norman chans station had comfortable chairs with high backs and beth swiveled in the chair swinging her legs back and forth she played with her hair making little ringlets by her ear and she stared into space tired norman thought were all tired he watched tina who moved smoothly and continuously adjusting the monitors checking the sensor inputs changing the videotapes on the bank of vcrs tense alert because edmunds was in the spaceship with ted tina had to look after the recording units as well as her own communications console the navy woman didnt seem to be as tired as they were but then she hadnt been inside the spaceship to her that spaceship was something she saw on the monitors a tv show an abstraction tina hadnt been confronted facetoface with the reality of the new environment the exhausting mental struggle to understand what was going on what it all meant you look tired sir tina said yes were all tired its the atmosphere she said breathing the heliox so much for psychological explanations norman thought tina said the density of the air down here has a real effect were at thirty atmospheres if we were breathing regular air at this pressure it would be almost as thick as a liquid heliox is lighter but its far denser than what were used to you dont realize it but its tiring just to breathe to move your lungs but you arent tired oh im used to it ive been in saturated environments before is that right where i really cant say dr johnson navy operations she smiled im not supposed to talk about it is that your inscrutable smile i hope so sir but dont you think you ought to try and sleep he nodded probably norman considered going to sleep but the prospect of his damp bunk was unappealing instead he went down to the galley hoping to find one of rose levys desserts levy was not there but there was some coconut cake under a plastic dome he found a plate cut a slice and took it over to one of the portholes but it was black outside the porthole the grid lights were turned off the divers gone he saw lights in the portholes of dh the divers habitat located a few dozen yards away the divers must be getting ready to go back to the surface or perhaps they had already gone in the porthole he saw his own face reflected the face looked tired and old this is no place for a fiftythreeyearold man he said watching his reflection as he looked out he saw some moving lights in the distance then a flash of yellow one of the minisubs pulled up under a cylinder at dh moments later a second sub arrived to dock alongside it the lights on the first sub went out after a short time the second sub pulled away into the black water the first sub was left behind whats going on he wondered but he was aware he didnt really care he was too tired he was more interested in what the cake would taste like and looked down the cake was eaten only a few crumbs remained tired he thought very tired he put his feet up on the coffee table and put his head back against the cool padding of the wall he must have fallen asleep for a while because he awoke disoriented in darkness he sat up and immediately the lights came on he saw he was still in the galley barnes had warned him about that the way the habitat adjusted to the presence of people apparently the motion sensors stopped registering you if you fell asleep and automatically shut off the room lights then when you awoke and moved the lights came back he wondered if the lights would stay on if you snored who had designed all this he wondered had the engineers and designers working on the navy habitat taken snoring into account was there a snore sensor more cake he got up and walked across to the galley kitchen several pieces of cake were now missing had he eaten them he wasnt sure couldnt remember lot of videotapes beth said norman turned around yes tina said we are recording everything that goes on in this habitat as well as the other ship itll be a lot of material there was a monitor mounted just above his head it showed beth and tina upstairs at the communications console they were eating cake aha he thought so that was where the cake had gone every twelve hours the tapes are transferred to the submarine tina said what for beth said thats so if anything happens down here the submarine will automatically go to the surface oh great beth said i wont think about that too much where is dr fielding now tina said he gave up on the sphere and went into the main flight deck with edmunds norman watched the monitor tina had stepped out of view beth sat with her back to the monitor eating the cake on the monitor behind beth he could clearly see the gleaming sphere monitors showing monitors he thought the navy people who eventually review this stuff are going to go crazy tina said do you think theyll ever get the sphere open beth chewed her cake maybe she said i dont know and to normans horror he saw on the monitor behind beth that the door of the sphere was sliding silently open revealing blackness inside open they must have thought he was crazy running through the lock to d cylinder and stumbling up the narrow stairs to the upper level shouting its open its open he came to the communications console just as beth was wiping the last crumbs of coconut from her lips she set down her fork whats open the sphere beth spun in her chair tina ran over from the bank of vcrs they both looked at the monitor behind beth there was an awkward silence looks closed to me norman it was open i saw it he told them about watching in the galley on the monitor it was just a few seconds ago and the sphere definitely opened it must have closed again while i was on my way here are you sure thats a pretty small monitor in the galley i saw it norman said replay it if you dont believe me good idea tina said and she went to the recorders to play the tape back norman was breathing heavily trying to catch his breath this was the first time he had exerted himself in the dense atmosphere and he felt the effects strongly dh was not a good place to get excited he decided beth was watching him you okay norman im fine i tell you i saw it it opened tina itll take me a second here harry walked in yawning beds in this place are great arent they he said like sleeping in a bag of wet rice sort of combination bed and cold shower he sighed itll break my heart to leave beth said norman thinks the sphere opened when he said yawning again just a few seconds ago harry nodded thoughtfully interesting interesting i see its closed now were rewinding the videotapes to look again uhhuh is there any more of that cake harry seems very cool norman thought this is a major piece of news and he doesnt seem excited at all why was that didnt harry believe it either was he still sleepy not fully awake or was there something else here we go tina said the monitor showed jagged lines and then resolved on the screen tina was saying hours the tapes are transferred to the submarine beth what for tina thats so if anything happens down here the submarine will automatically go to the surface beth oh great i wont think about that too much where is dr fielding now tina he gave up on the sphere and went into the main flight deck with edmunds on the screen tina stepped out of view beth remained alone in the chair eating the cake her back to the monitor onscreen tina was saying do you think theyll ever get the sphere open beth ate her cake maybe she said i dont know there was a short pause and then on the monitor behind beth the door of the sphere slid open hey it did open keep the tape running onscreen beth didnt notice the monitor tina still somewhere offscreen said it scares me beth i dont think theres a reason to be scared tina its the unknown sure beth said but an unknown thing is not likely to be dangerous or frightening its most likely to be just inexplicable i dont know how you can say that you afraid of snakes beth said onscreen all during this conversation the sphere remained open watching harry said too bad we cant see inside it i may be able to help that tina said ill do some imageintensification work with the computer it almost looks like there are little lights harry said little moving lights inside the sphere onscreen tina came back into view snakes dont bother me well i cant stand snakes beth said slimy cold disgusting things ah beth harry said watching the monitor got snake envy onscreen beth was saying if i were a martian who came to earth and i stumbled upon a snakea funny cold wiggling tubelike lifei wouldnt know what to think of it but the chance that i would stumble on a poisonous snake is very small less than one percent of snakes are poisonous so as a martian i wouldnt be in danger from my discovery of snakes id just be perplexed thats whats likely to happen with us well be perplexed onscreen beth was saying anyway i dont think well ever get the sphere open no tina i hope not behind her on the monitor the sphere closed huh harry said how long was it open all together thirtythree point four seconds tina said they stopped the tape tina said anybody want to see it again she looked pale not right now harry said he drummed his fingers on the arm of his chair stared off thinking no one else said anything they just waited patiently for harry norman realized how much the group deferred to him harry is the person who figures things out for us norman thought we need him rely on him okay harry said at last no conclusions are possible we have insufficient data the question is whether the sphere was responding to something in its immediate environment or whether it just opened for reasons of its own wheres ted ted left the sphere and went to the flight deck teds back ted said grinning broadly and i have some real news so do we beth said it can wait ted said but i know where this ship went ted said excitedly ive been analyzing the flight data summaries on the flight deck looking at the star fields and i know where the black hole is located ted beth said the sphere opened it did when a few minutes ago then it closed again what did the monitors show no biological hazard it seems to be safe ted looked at the screen then what the hell are we doing here barnes came in twohour rest period is over everybody ready to go back to the ship for a last look thats putting it mildly harry said the sphere was polished silent closed they stood around it and stared at themselves distorted in reflection nobody spoke they just walked around it finally ted said i feel like this is an iq test and im flunking you mean like the davies message harry said oh that ted said norman knew about the davies message it was one of the episodes that the seti promoters wished to forget in there had been a large meeting in rome of the scientists involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence basically seti called for a radio astronomy search of the heavens now the scientists were trying to decide what sort of message to search for emerson davies a physicist from cambridge england devised a message based on fixed physical constants such as the wavelength of emitted hydrogen which were presumably the same throughout the universe he arranged these constants in a binary pictorial form because davies thought this would be exactly the kind of message an alien intelligence might send he figured it would be easy for the seti people to figure out he distributed his picture to everybody at the conference nobody could figure it out when davies explained it they all agreed it was a clever idea and a perfect message for extraterrestrials to send but the fact remained that none of them had been able to figure out this perfect message one of the people who had tried to figure it out and had failed was ted well we didnt try very hard ted said there was a lot going on at the conference and we didnt have you there harry you just wanted a free trip to rome harry said beth said is it my imagination or have the door markingschanged norman looked at first glance the deep grooves appeared the same but perhaps the pattern was different if so the change was subtle we can compare it with old videotapes barnes said it looks the same to me ted said anyway its metal i doubt it could change what we call metal is just a liquid that flows slowly at room temperature harry said its possible that this metal is changing i doubt it ted said barnes said you guys are supposed to be the experts we know this thing can open its been open already how do we get it open again were trying hal it doesnt look like youre doing anything from time to time they glanced at harry but harry just stood there looking at the sphere his hand on his chin tapping his lower lip thoughtfully with his finger harry harry said nothing ted went up and slapped the sphere with the flat of his hand it made a dull sound but nothing happened ted pounded the sphere with his fist then he winced and rubbed his hand i dont think we can force our way in i think it has to let you in norman said nobody said anything after that my handpicked crack team barnes said needling them and all they can do is stand around and stare at it what do you want us to do hal nuke it if you dont get it open there are people who will try that eventually he glanced at his watch meanwhile you got any other bright ideas nobody did okay barnes said our time is up lets go back to the habitat and get ready to be ferried to the surface departure norman pulled the small navyissue bag from beneath his bunk in c cylinder he got his shaving kit from the bathroom found his notebook and his extra pair of socks and zipped the bag shut im ready me too ted said ted was unhappy he didnt want to leave i guess we cant delay it any longer the weathers getting worse theyve got all the divers out from dh and now theres only us norman smiled at the prospect of being on the surface again i never thought id look forward to seeing navy battleship gray on a ship but i do wherere the others norman said beths already packed i think shes with barnes in communication harry too i guess ted plucked at his jumpsuit ill tell you one thing ill be glad to see the last of this suit they left the sleeping quarters heading down to communications on the way they squeezed past teeny fletcher who was going toward b cylinder ready to leave norman said yes sir all squared away fletcher said but her features were tense and she seemed rushed under pressure arent you going the wrong way norman asked just checking the diesel backups backups norman thought why check the backups now that they were leaving she probably left something on that she shouldnt have ted said shaking his head in the communications console the mood was grim barnes was on the phone with the surface vessels say that again he said i want to hear whos authorized that he was frowning angry they looked at tina hows the weather on the surface deteriorating fast apparently barnes spun will you idiots keep it down norman dropped his day bag on the floor beth was sitting near the portholes tired rubbing her eyes tina was turning off the monitors one after another when she suddenly stopped look on one monitor they saw the polished sphere harry was standing next to it whats he doing there didnt he come back with us i thought he did i didnt notice i assumed he did god damn it i thought i told you people barnes began and then stopped he stared at the monitor on the screen harry turned toward the video camera and made a short bow ladies and gentlemen your attention please i think you will find this of interest harry turned to face the sphere he stood with his arms at his sides relaxed he did not move or speak he closed his eyes he took a deep breath the door to the sphere opened not bad huh harry said with a sudden grin then harry stepped inside the sphere the door closed behind him they all began talking at once barnes was shouting over everyone else shouting for quiet but no one paid any attention until the lights in the habitat went out they were plunged into darkness ted said whats happened the only light came through the portholes faintly from the grid lights a moment later the grid went out too no power i tried to tell you barnes said there was a whirring sound and the lights flickered then came back on we have internal power were running on our diesels now why look ted said pointing out the porthole outside they saw what looked like a wriggling silver snake then norman realized it was the cable that linked them to the surface sliding back and forth across the porthole as it coiled in great loops on the bottom theyve cut us free thats right barnes said theyve got full galeforce conditions topside they can no longer maintain cables for power and communications they can no longer use the submarines theyve taken all the divers up but the subs cant come back for us at least not for a few days until the seas calm down then were stuck down here thats correct for how long several days barnes said for how long maybe as long as a week jesus christ beth said ted tossed his bag onto the couch what a fantastic piece of luck he said beth spun are you out of your mind lets all stay calm barnes said everythings under control this is just a temporary delay theres no reason to get upset but norman didnt feel upset he felt suddenly exhausted beth was sulking angry feeling deceived ted was excited already planning another excursion to the spacecraft arranging equipment with edmunds but norman felt only tired his eyes were heavy he thought he might go to sleep standing there in front of the monitors he excused himself hurriedly went back to his bunk lay down he didnt care that the sheets were clammy he didnt care that the pillow was cold he didnt care that diesels were droning and vibrating in the next cylinder he thought this is a very strong avoidance reaction and then he was asleep beyond pluto norman rolled out of bed and looked for his watch but hed gotten into the habit of not wearing one down here he had no idea what time it was how long he had been asleep he looked out the porthole saw nothing but black water the grid lights were still off he lay back in his bunk and looked at the gray pipes directly over his head they seemed closer than before as if they had moved toward him while he slept everything seemed cramped tighter more claustrophobic several more days of this he thought god he hoped the navy would think to notify his family after so many days ellen would start to worry he imagined her first calling the faa then calling the navy trying to find out what had happened of course no one would know anything because the project was classified ellen would be frantic then he stopped thinking about ellen it was easier he thought to worry about your loved ones than to worry about yourself but there wasnt any point ellen would be okay and so would he it was just a matter of waiting staying calm and waiting out the storm he got into the shower wondering if theyd still have hot water while the habitat was on emergency power they did and he felt less stiff after his shower it was odd he thought to be a thousand feet underwater and to relish the soothing effects of a hot shower he dressed and headed for the c cylinder he heard tinas voice say think theyll ever get the sphere open beth maybe i dont know it scares me i dont think theres a reason to be scared its the unknown tina said when norman came in he found beth running the videotape looking at herself and tina sure beth said on the videotape but an unknown thing is not likely to be dangerous or frightening its most likely to be just inexplicable tina said i dont know how you can say that you afraid of snakes beth said onscreen beth snapped off the videotape just trying to see if i could figure out why it opened she said any luck norman said not so far on the adjacent monitor they could see the sphere itself the sphere was closed harry still in there norman said yes beth said how long has it been now she looked up at the consoles a little more than an hour i only slept an hour yeah im starving norman said and he went down to the galley to eat all the coconut cake was gone he was looking for something else to eat when beth showed up i dont know what to do norman she said frowning about what theyre lying to us she said who is barnes the navy everybody this is all a setup norman come on beth no conspiracies now we have enough to worry about without just look at this she said she led him back upstairs flicked on a console pressed buttons i started putting it together when barnes was on the phone she said barnes was talking to somebody right up to the moment when the cable started to coil down except that cable is a thousand feet long norman they would have broken communications several minutes before unhooking the cable itself probably yes so who was barnes talking to at the last minute nobody beth look she said pointing to the screen com summary dhsurcoml barnes to surcom civilian and usn personnel polled although advised of risks all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft barnes usn youre kidding norman said i thought barnes wanted to leave he did but he changed his mind when he saw that last room and he didnt bother to tell us id like to kill the bastard beth said you know what this is about norman dont you norman nodded he hopes to find a new weapon right barnes is a pentagonacquisition man and he wants to find a new weapon but the sphere is unlikely its not the sphere beth said barnes doesnt really care about the sphere he cares about the associated spacecraft because according to congruity theory its the spacecraft that is likely to pay off not the sphere congruity theory was a troublesome matter for the people who thought about extraterrestrial life in a simple way the astronomers and physicists who considered the possibility of contact with extraterrestrial life imagined wonderful benefits to mankind from such a contact but other thinkers philosophers and historians did not foresee any benefits to contact at all for example astronomers believed that if we made contact with extraterrestrials mankind would be so shocked that wars on earth would cease and a new era of peaceful cooperation between nations would begin but historians thought that was nonsense they pointed out that when europeans discovered the new worlda similarly worldshattering discoverythe europeans did not stop their incessant fighting on the contrary they fought even harder europeans simply made the new world an extension of preexisting animosities it became another place to fight and to fight over similarly astronomers imagined that when mankind met extraterrestrials there would be an exchange of information and technology giving mankind a wonderful advancement historians of science thought that was nonsense too they pointed out that what we called science actually consisted of a rather arbitrary conception of the universe not likely to be shared by other creatures our ideas of science were the ideas of visually oriented monkeylike creatures who enjoyed changing their physical environment if the aliens were blind and communicated by odors they might have evolved a very different science which described a very different universe and they might have made very different choices about the directions their science would explore for example they might ignore the physical world entirely and instead develop a highly sophisticated science of mindin other words the exact opposite of what earth science had done the alien technology might be purely mental with no visible hardware at all this issue was at the heart of congruity theory which said that unless the aliens were remarkably similar to us no exchange of information was likely barnes of course knew that theory so he knew he wasnt likely to derive any useful technology from the alien sphere but he was very likely to get useful technology from the spaceship itself since the spaceship had been made by men and congruity was high and he had lied to keep them down to keep the search going what should we do with the bastard beth said nothing for the moment norman said you dont want to confront him jesus i do it wont serve any purpose norman said ted wont care and the navy people are all following orders and anyway even if it had been arranged for us to depart as planned would you have gone leaving harry behind in the sphere no beth admitted well then its all academic jesus norman i know but were here now and for the next couple of days theres not a damn thing we can do about it lets deal with that reality as best we can and point the finger later you bet im going to point the finger thats fine but not now beth okay she sighed not now she went back upstairs alone norman stared at the console he had his work cut out for him keeping everybody calm for the next few days he hadnt looked into the computer system before he started pressing buttons pretty soon he found a file marked ulf contact team biog he opened it up civilian team members theodore fielding astrophysicistplanetary geologist elizabeth halpern zoologistbiochemist harold j adams mathematicianlogician arthur levine marine biologistbiochemist john f thompson psychologist choose one norman stared in disbelief at the list he knew jack thompson an energetic young psychologist from yale thompson was worldrenowned for his studies of the psychology of primitive peoples and in fact for the past year had been somewhere in new guinea studying native tribes norman pressed more buttons ulf team psychologist choices by rank john f thompson yaleapproved william l hartz ucbapproved jeremy white utapproved pending clearance norman johnson sdurejected age he knew them all bill hartz at berkeley was seriously ill with cancer jeremy white had gone to hanoi during the vietnam war and would never get clearance that left norman he understood now why he had been the last to be called in he understood now about the special tests he felt a burst of intense anger at barnes at the whole system which had brought him down here despite his age with no concern for his safety at fiftythree norman johnson had no business being a thousand feet underwater in a pressurized exotic gas environmentand the navy knew it it was an outrage he thought he wanted to go upstairs and give barnes hell in no uncertain terms that lying son of a bitch he gripped the arms of his chair and reminded himself of what he had told beth whatever had happened up to this point there was nothing any of them could do about it now he would indeed give barnes hellhe promised himself he wouldbut only when they got back to the surface until then it was no use making trouble he shook his head and swore then he turned the console off the hours crept by harry was still in the sphere tina ran her image intensification of the videotape that showed the sphere open trying to see interior detail unfortunately we have only limited computing power in the habitat she said if i could hardlink to the surface i could really do a job but as it is she shrugged she showed them a series of enlarged freezeframes from the open sphere the images clicked through at onesecond intervals the quality was poor with jagged intermittent static the only internal structures we can see in the blackness tina said pointing to the opening are these multiple pointsources of light the lights appear to move from frame to frame its as if the sphere is filled with fireflies beth said except these lights are much dimmer than fireflies and they dont blink they are very numerous and they give the impression of moving together in surging patterns a flock of fireflies something like that the tape ran out the screen went dark ted said thats it im afraid so dr fielding poor harry ted said mournfully of all the group ted was the most visibly upset about harry he kept staring at the closed sphere on the monitor saying how did he do that then he would add i hope hes all right he repeated it so often that finally beth said i think we know your feelings ted im seriously concerned about him i am too we all are you think im jealous beth is that what youre saying why would anyone think that ted norman changed the subject it was crucial to avoid confrontations among group members he asked ted about his analysis of the flight data aboard the spaceship its very interesting ted said warming to his subject my detailed examination of the earliest flightdata images he said convinced me that they show three planetsuranus neptune and plutoand the sun very small in the background therefore the pictures are taken from some point beyond the orbit of pluto this suggests that the black hole is not far beyond our own solar system is that possible norman said oh sure in fact for the last ten years some astrophysicists have suspected that theres a black holenot a large one but a black hole just outside our solar system i hadnt heard that oh yes in fact some of us have argued that if it was small enough in a few years we could go out and capture the black hole bring it back park it in earth orbit and use the energy it generates to power the entire planet barnes smiled blackhole cowboys in theory theres no reason it couldnt be done then just think the entire planet would be free of its dependency on fossil fuels the whole history of mankind would be changed barnes said probably make a hell of a weapon too even a very tiny black hole would be a little too powerful to use as a weapon so you think this ship went out to capture a black hole i doubt it ted said the ship is so strongly made so shielded against radiation that i suspect it was intended to go through a black hole and it did and thats why the ship went back in time norman said im not sure ted said you see a black hole really is the edge of the universe what happens there isnt clear to anybody now alive but what some people think is that you dont go through the hole you sort of skip into it like a pebble skipping over water and you get bounced into a different time or space or universe so the ship got bounced yes possibly more than once and when it bounced back here it undershot and arrived a few hundred years before it left and on one of its bounces it picked up that beth said pointing to the monitor they looked the sphere was still closed but lying next to it sprawled on the deck in an awkward pose was harry adams for a moment they thought he was dead then harry lifted his head and moaned the subject norman wrote in his notebook subject is a thirtyyearold black mathematician who has spent three hours inside a sphere of unknown origin on recovery from the sphere was stuporous and unresponsive he did not know his name where he was or what year it was brought back to habitat slept for one halfhour then awoke abruptly complaining of headache oh god harry was sitting in his bunk holding his head in his hands groaning hurt norman asked brutal pounding anything else thirsty god he licked his lips really thirsty extreme thirst norman wrote rose levy the cook showed up with a glass of lemonade norman handed the glass to harry who drank it in a single gulp passed it back more better bring a pitcher norman said levy went off norman turned to harry still holding his head still groaning and said i have a question for you what whats your name norman i dont need to be psychoanalyzed right now just tell me your name harry adams for christs sake whats the matter with you oh my head you didnt remember before norman said when we found you when you found me he asked he seemed confused again norman nodded do you remember when we found you it must have been outside outside harry looked up suddenly furious eyes glowing with rage outside the sphere you goddamn idiot what do you think im talking about take it easy harry your questions are driving me crazy okay okay take it easy emotionally labile rage and irritability norman made more notes do you have to make so much noise norman looked up puzzled your pen harry said it sounds like niagara falls norman stopped writing it must be a migraine or something like migraine harry was holding his head in his hands delicately as if it were made of glass why cant i have any aspirin for christs sake we dont want to give you anything for a while in case youve hurt yourself we need to know where the pain is the pain norman is in my head its in my goddamn head now why wont you give me any aspirin barnes said not to is barnes still here were all still here harry looked up slowly but you were supposed to go to the surface i know why didnt you go the weather went bad and they couldnt send the subs well you should go you shouldnt be here norman levy arrived with more lemonade harry looked at her as he drank youre still here too yes dr adams how many people are down here all together levy said there are nine of us sir jesus he passed the glass back levy refilled it you should all go you should leave harry norman said we cant go you have to go norman sat on the bunk opposite harry and watched as harry drank harry was demonstrating a rather typical manifestation of shock the agitation the irritability the nervous manic flow of ideas the unexplained fears for the safety of othersit was all characteristic of shocked victims of severe accidents such as major auto crashes or airplane crashes given an intense event the brain struggled to assimilate to make sense to reassemble the mental world even as the physical world was shattered around it the brain went into a kind of overdrive hastily trying to reassemble things to get things right to reestablish equilibrium yet it was fundamentally a confused period of wheelspinning you just had to wait it out harry finished the lemonade handed the glass back more levy asked no thats good headaches better perhaps it was dehydration after all norman thought but why would harry be dehydrated after three hours in the sphere harry tell me something do i look different norman no i look the same to you yes id say so are you sure harry said he jumped up went to a mirror mounted on the wall he peered at his face how do you think you look norman said i dont know different different how i dont know he pounded the padded wall next to the mirror the mirror image vibrated he turned away sat down on the bunk again he sighed just different harry what do you remember what happened of course what happened i went inside he waited but harry said nothing further he just stared at the carpeted floor do you remember opening the door harry said nothing how did you open the door harry harry looked up at norman you were all supposed to leave to go back to the surface you werent supposed to stay how did you open the door harry there was a long silence i opened it he sat up straight his hands at his sides he seemed to be remembering reliving it and then i went inside and what happened inside it was beautiful what was beautiful the foam harry said and then he fell silent again staring vacantly into space the foam norman prompted the sea the foam beautiful was he talking about the lights norman wondered the swirling pattern of lights what was beautiful harry now dont kid me harry said promise you wont kid me i wont kid you you think i look the same yes i do you dont think ive changed at all no not that i can see do you think youve changed i dont know maybe imaybe did something happen in the sphere to change you you dont understand about the sphere then explain it to me norman said nothing happened in the sphere you were in the sphere for three hours nothing happened nothing ever happens inside the sphere its always the same inside the sphere whats always the same the foam the foam is always different the sphere is always the same i dont understand norman said i know you dont harry said he shook his head what can i do tell me some more there isnt any more then tell me again it wont help harry said do you think youll be leaving soon barnes says not for several days i think you should leave soon talk to the others convince them make them leave why harry i cant bei dont know harry rubbed his eyes and lay back on the bed youll have to excuse me he said but im very tired maybe we can continue this some other time talk to the others norman get them to leave its dangerous to stay here and he lay down in the bunk and closed his eyes changes hes sleeping norman told them hes in shock hes confused but he seems basically intact what did he tell you ted said about what happened in there hes quite confused norman said but hes recovering when we first found him he didnt even remember his name now he does he remembers my name he remembers where he is he remembers he went into the sphere i think he remembers what happened inside the sphere too he just isnt telling great ted said he mentioned the sea and the foam but i wasnt clear what he meant by that look outside tina said pointing to the portholes norman had an immediate impression of lightsthousands of lights filling the blackness of the oceanand his first response was unreasoning terror the lights in the sphere were coming out to get them but then he saw each of the lights had a shape and were moving wriggling they pressed their faces to the portholes looked squid beth said finally bioluminescent squid thousands of them more she said id guess at least half a million all around the habitat beautiful the size of the school is amazing ted said impressive but not really unusual beth said the fecundity of the sea is very great compared with the land the sea is where life began and where intense competition among animals first appeared one response to competition is to produce enormous numbers of offspring many sea animals do that in fact we tend to think that animals came out onto the land as a positive step forward in the evolution of life but the truth is the first creatures were really driven out of the ocean they were just trying to get away from the competition and you can imagine when the first fishamphibians climbed up the beach and poked their heads up to look out at the land and saw this vast dryland environment without any competition at all it must have looked like the promised beth broke off turned to barnes quick where do you keep specimen nets i dont want you going out there i have to beth said those squid have six tentacles so theres no known species of sixtentacled squid this is an undescribed species i must collect samples barnes told her where the equipment locker was and she went off norman looked at the school of squid with renewed interest the animals were each about a foot long and seemed to be transparent the large eyes of the squid were clearly visible in the bodies which glowed a pale blue in a few minutes beth appeared outside standing in the midst of the school swinging her net catching specimens several squid angrily squirted clouds of ink cute little things ted said you know the development of squid ink is a very interesting what do you say to squid for dinner levy said hell no barnes said if this is an undiscovered species were not going to eat it the last thing i need is everybody sick from food poisoning very sensible ted said i never liked squid anyway interesting mechanism of propulsion but rubbery texture at that moment there was a buzz as one of the monitors turned itself on as they watched the screen rapidly filled with numbers wheres that coming from ted said the surface barnes shook his head weve cut direct contact with the surface then is it being transmitted underwater in some way no tina said its too fast for underwater transmission is there another console in the habitat no how about dh dhs empty now the divers have gone then whered it come from barnes said it looks random to me tina nodded it may be a discharge from a temporary buffer memory somewhere in the system when we switched over to internal diesel power thats probably it barnes said buffer discharge on switchover i think you should keep it ted said staring at the screen just in case its a message a message from where from the sphere hell barnes said it cant be a message how do you know because theres no way a message can be transmitted were not hooked up to anything certainly not to the sphere its got to be a memory dump from somewhere inside our own computer system how much memory have you got fair amount ten giga something like that maybe the heliums getting to the chips tina said maybe its a saturation effect i still think you should keep it ted said norman had been looking at the screen he was no mathematician but hed looked at a lot of statistics in his life searching for patterns in the data that was something human brains were inherently good at finding patterns in visual material norman couldnt put his finger on it but he sensed a pattern here he said i have the feeling its not random then lets keep it barnes said tina went forward to the console as her hands touched the keys the screen went blank so much for that barnes said its gone too bad we didnt have harry to look at it with us yeah ted said gloomily too bad analysis take a look at this beth said this one is still alive norman was with her in the little biological laboratory near the top of d cylinder nobody had been in this laboratory since their arrival because they hadnt found anything living now with the lights out he and beth watched the squid move in the glass tank the creature had a delicate appearance the blue glow was concentrated in stripes along the back and sides of the creature yes beth said the bioluminescent structures seem to be located dorsally theyre bacteria of course what are the bioluminescent areas squid cant create light themselves the creatures that do are bacteria so the bioluminescent animals in the sea have incorporated these bacteria into their bodies youre seeing bacteria glowing through the skin so its like an infection yes in a way the large eyes of the squid stared the tentacles moved and you can see all the internal organs beth said the brain is hidden behind the eye that sac is the digestive gland and behind it the stomach and below thatsee it beatingthe heart that big thing at the front is the gonad and coming down from the stomach a sort of funnelthats where it squirts the ink and propels itself is it really a new species norman said she sighed i dont know internally it is so typical but fewer tentacles would qualify it as a new species all right you going to get to call it squidus bethus norman said she smiled architeuthis bethis she said sounds like a dental problem architeuthis bethis means you need root canal how about it dr halpern levy said poking her head in got some good tomatoes and peppers be a shame to waste them are the squid really poisonous i doubt it beth said squid arent known to be go ahead she said to levy i think itll be okay to eat them when levy had gone norman said i thought you gave up eating these things just octopi beth said an octopus is cute and smart squid are rather unsympathetic unsympathetic well theyre cannibalistic and rather nasty she raised an eyebrow are you psychoanalyzing me again no just curious as a zoologist youre supposed to be objective beth said but i have feelings about animals like anybody else i have a warm feeling about octopi theyre clever you know i once had an octopus in a research tank that learned to kill cockroaches and use them as bait to catch crabs the curious crab would come along investigate the dead cockroach and then the octopus would jump out of its hiding place and catch the crab in fact an octopus is so smart that the biggest limitation to its behavior is its lifespan an octopus lives only three years and thats not long enough to develop anything as complicated as a culture or civilization maybe if octopi lived as long as we do they would long ago have taken over the world but squid are completely different i have no feelings about squid except i dont really like em he smiled well he said at least you finally found some life down here you know its funny she said remember how barren it was out there nothing on the bottom sure very striking well i went around the side of the habitat to get these squid and therere all sorts of sea fans on the bottom beautiful colors blues and purples and yellows some of them quite large think they just grew no they must have always been in that spot but we never went over there ill have to investigate it later id like to know why they are localized in that particular place next to the habitat norman went to the porthole he had switched on the exterior habitat lights shining onto the bottom he could indeed see many large sea fans purple and pink and blue waving gently in the current they extended out to the edge of the light to the darkness in a way beth said its reassuring were deep for the majority of oceanic life which is found in the first hundred feet of water but even so this habitat is located in the most varied and abundant marine environment in the world scientists had made species counts and had determined that the south pacific had more species of coral and sponges than anywhere else on earth so im glad were finally finding things she said she looked at her benches of chemicals and reagents and im glad to finally get to work on something harry was eating bacon and eggs in the galley the others stood around and watched him relieved that he was all right and they told him the news he listened with interest until they mentioned that there had been a large school of squid squid he looked up sharply and almost dropped his fork yeah lots of em levy said im cooking up a bunch for dinner are they still here harry asked no theyre gone now he relaxed shoulders dropping something the matter harry norman said i hate squid harry said i cant stand them i dont care for the taste myself ted said terrible harry said nodding he resumed eating his eggs the tension passed then tina shouted from d cylinder im getting them again im getting the numbers again what do you think harry barnes said pointing to the screen is this what you got before harry said looks like it except the spacing is different because this is definitely nonrandom harry said its a single sequence repeated over and over look starts here goes to here then repeats hes right tina said fantastic barnes said absolutely incredible for you to see it like that ted drummed his fingers on the console impatiently elementary my dear barnes harry said that part is easy the hard part iswhat does it mean surely its a message ted said possibly its a message harry said it could also be some kind of discharge from within the computer the result of a programming error or a hardware glitch we might spend hours translating it only to find it says copyright acme computer systems silicon valley or something similar well ted said the greatest likelihood is that this series of numbers originates from within the computer itself harry said but let me give it a try tina printed out the screen for him id like to try too ted said quickly tina said certainly dr fielding and printed out a second sheet if its a message harry said its most likely a simple substitution code like an askey code it would help if we could run a decoding program on the computer can anybody program this thing they all shook their heads can you barnes said no and i suppose theres no way to transmit this to the surface the nsa codebreaking computers in washington would take about fifteen seconds to do this barnes shook his head no contact i wouldnt even put up a radio wire on a balloon the last report they have fortyfoot waves on the surface snap the wire right away so were isolated were isolated i guess its back to the old pencil and paper i always say traditional tools are bestparticularly when theres nothing else and left the room he seems to be in a good mood barnes said id say a very good mood norman said maybe a little too good ted said a little manic no norman said just a good mood i thought he was a little high ted said let him stay that way barnes snorted if it helps him to crack this code im going to try too ted reminded him thats fine barnes said you try too ted im telling you this reliance on harry is misplaced ted paced back and forth and glanced at norman harry is manic and hes overlooking things obvious things like what like the fact that the printout cant possibly be a discharge from the computer how do you know norman said the processor ted said the processor is a chip which means that any memory dump would be in hex whats hex there are lots of ways to represent numbers ted said the chip uses basesixteen representation called hexadecimal hex is entirely different from regular decimal looks different but the message used zero through nine norman said exactly my point ted said so it didnt come from the computer i believe its definitely a message from the sphere furthermore although harry thinks it is a substitution code i think its a direct visual representation you mean a picture yes ted said and i think its a picture of the creature itself he started searching through sheets of paper i started with this now here i have translated the message to binary ted said you can immediately sense visual pattern cant you not really norman said well it is certainly suggestive ted said im telling you all those years at jpl looking at images from the planets i have an eye for these things so the next thing i did was go back to the original message and fill in the spaces i got this uhhuh norman said i agree it doesnt look like anything ted said but by changing the screen width you get this proudly he held up the next sheet yes norman said dont tell me you dont see the pattern ted said i dont see the pattern norman said squint at it ted said norman squinted sorry but it is obviously a picture of the creature ted said look thats the vertical torso three legs two arms theres no head so presumably the creatures head is located within the torso itself surely you see that norman ted for once harry has missed the point entirely the message is not only a picture its a selfportrait ted ted sat back he sighed youre going to tell me im trying too hard i dont want to dampen your enthusiasm norman said but you dont see the alien not really no hell ted tossed the papers aside i hate that son of a bitch hes so arrogant he makes me so mad and on top of that hes young youre forty norman said i wouldnt exactly call that over the hill for physics it is ted said biologists can sometimes do important work late in life darwin was fifty when he published the origin of species and chemists sometimes do good work when theyre older but in physics if you havent done it by thirtyfive the chances are you never will but ted youre respected in your field ted shook his head ive never done fundamental work ive analyzed data ive come to some interesting conclusions but never anything fundamental this expedition is my chance to really do something to really get my name in the books norman now had a different sense of teds enthusiasm and energy that relentlessly juvenile manner ted wasnt emotionally retarded he was driven and he clung to his youth out of a sense that time was slipping by and he hadnt yet accomplished anything it wasnt obnoxious it was sad well norman said the expedition isnt finished yet no ted said suddenly brightening youre right youre absolutely right there are more wonderful experiences awaiting us i just know there are and theyll come wont they yes ted norman said theyll come beth damn it nothing works she waved a hand to her laboratory bench not a single one of the chemicals or reagents here is worth a damn whatve you tried barnes said calmly zenkerformalin h and e the other stains proteolytic extractions enzyme breaks you name it none of it works you know what i think i think that whoever stocked this lab did it with outdated ingredients no barnes said its the atmosphere he explained that their environment contained only percent oxygen percent carbon dioxide but no nitrogen at all chemical reactions are unpredictable he said you ought to take a look at levys recipe book sometime its like nothing youve ever seen in your life the food looks normal when shes finished but she sure doesnt make it the normal way and the lab the lab was stocked without knowing the working depth we would be at if we were shallower wed be breathing compressed air and all your chemical reactions would worktheyd just go very fast but with heliox reactions are unpredictable and if they wont go well he shrugged what am i supposed to do she said the best you can barnes said same as the rest of us well all i can really do is gross anatomical analyses all this bench is worthless then do the gross anatomy i just wish we had more lab capability this is it barnes said accept it and go on ted entered the room you better take a look outside everybody he said pointing to the portholes we have more visitors the squid were gone for a moment norman saw nothing but the water and the white suspended sediment caught in the lights look down at the bottom the sea floor was alive literally alive crawling and wiggling and tremulous as far as they could see in the lights what is that beth said its shrimps a hell of a lot of shrimps and she ran to get her net now thats what we ought to be eating ted said i love shrimp and those look perfectsize a little smaller than crayfish probably delicious i remember once in portugal my second wife and i had the most fabulous crayfish norman felt slightly uneasy whatre they doing here i dont know what do shrimps do anyway do they migrate damned if i know barnes said i always buy em frozen my wife hates to peel em norman remained uneasy though he could not say why he could clearly see now that the bottom was covered in shrimps they were everywhere why should it bother him norman moved away from the window hoping his sense of vague uneasiness would go away if he looked at something else but it didnt go away it just stayed therea small tense knot in the pit of his stomach he didnt like the feeling at all harry harry oh hi norman i heard the excitement lot of shrimps outside is that it harry sat on his bunk with the paper printout of numbers on his knees he had a pencil and pad and the page was covered with calculations scratchouts symbols arrows harry norman said whats going on damned if i know im just wondering why we should suddenly be finding life down herethe squid the shrimpswhen before there was nothing ever oh that i think thats pretty clear yes sure whats different between then and now youve been inside the sphere no no i mean whats different in the outside environment norman frowned he didnt grasp what harry was driving at well just look outside harry said what could you see before that you cant see now the grid uhhuh the grid and the divers lot of activityand a lot of electricity i think it scared off the normal fauna of the area this is the south pacific you know it ought to be teeming with life and now that the divers are gone the animals are back thats my guess thats all there is to it norman said frowning why are you asking me harry said ask beth shell give you a definitive answer but i know animals are sensitive to all kinds of stimuli we dont notice you cant run god knows how many million volts through underwater cables to light a halfmile grid in an environment that has never seen light before and not expect to have an effect something about this argument tickled the back of normans mind he knew something something pertinent but he couldnt get it harry yes norman you look a little worried you know this substitution code is really a bitch ill tell you the truth im not sure ill be able to crack it you see the problem is if it is a letter substitution you will need two digits to describe a single letter because there are twentysix letters in the alphabet assuming no punctuationwhich may or may not be included here as well so when i see a two next to a three i dont know if it is letter two followed by letter three or just letter twentythree its taking a long time to work through the permutations you see what i mean harry yes norman what happened inside the sphere is that what youre worried about harry asked what makes you think im worried about anything norman asked your face harry said thats what makes me think youre worried maybe i am norman said but about this sphere you know ive been thinking a lot about that sphere and its quite amazing i really dont remember what happened harry i feel finei feel better all the time honest to god my energys back headaches goneand earlier i remembered everything about that sphere and what was inside it but every minute that passes it seems to fade you know the way a dream fades you remember it when you wake up but an hour later its gone harry i remember that it was wonderful and beautiful something about lights swirling lights but thats all how did you get the door to open oh that it was very clear at the time i remember i had worked it all out i knew exactly what to do what did you do im sure it will come back to me you dont remember how you opened the door no i just remember this sudden insight this certainty about how it was done but i cant remember the details why does somebody else want to go in ted probably im sure ted would like to go in i dont know if thats a good idea frankly i dont think ted should do it think how boring hell be with his speeches after he comes out i visited an alien sphere by ted fielding wed never hear the end of it and he giggled ted is right norman thought hes definitely manic there was a speedy overly cheerful quality to harry his characteristic slow sarcasm was gone replaced by a sunny open very quick manner and a kind of laughing indifference to everything an imbalance in his sense of what was important he had said he couldnt crack the code he had said he couldnt remember what happened inside the sphere or how he had opened it and he didnt seem to think it mattered harry when you first came out of the sphere you seemed worried did i had a brutal headache i remember that you kept saying we should go to the surface did i yes why was that god only knows i was so confused you also said it was dangerous for us to stay here harry smiled norman you cant take that too seriously i didnt know if i was coming or going harry we need you to remember these things if things start to come back to you will you tell me oh sure norman absolutely you can count on me ill tell you right away the laboratory no beth said none of it makes sense first of all in areas where fish havent encountered human beings before they tend to ignore humans unless they are hunted the navy divers didnt hunt the fish second if the divers stirred up the bottom thatd actually release nutrients and attract more animals third many species of animals are attracted to electrical currents so if anything the shrimps and other animals shouldve been drawn here earlier by the electricity not now with the power off she was examining the shrimps under the lowpower scanning microscope how does he seem harry yes i dont know is he okay i dont know i think so still looking through the microscope lens she said did he tell you anything about what happened inside the sphere not yet she adjusted the microscope shook her head ill be damned what is it norman said extra dorsal plating meaning its another new species she said norman said shrimpus bethus youre making discoveries hand over fist down here beth uhhuh i checked the sea fans too because they seemed to have an unusual radial growth pattern theyre a new species as well thats great beth she turned looked at him no not great weird she clicked on a highintensity light cut open one of the shrimps with a scalpel i thought so what is it norman she said we didnt see any life down here for daysand suddenly in the last few hours we find three new species its not normal we dont know whats normal at one thousand feet im telling you its not normal but beth you said yourself that we simply hadnt noticed the sea fans before and the squid and the shrimpscant they be migrating passing through this area something like that barnes says theyve never had trained scientists living this deep at one site on the ocean floor before maybe these migrations are normal and we just dont know they occur i dont think so beth said when i went out to get these shrimps i felt their behavior was atypical for one thing they were too close together shrimps on the bottom maintain a characteristic distance from one another about four feet these were packed close in addition they moved as if they were feeding but theres nothing to feed on down here nothing that we know of well these shrimps cant have been feeding she pointed to the cut animal on the lab bench they havent got a stomach are you kidding look for yourself norman looked but the dissected shrimp didnt mean much to him it was just a mass of pink flesh it was cut on a ragged diagonal not cleanly shes tired he thought shes not working efficiently we need sleep we need to get out of here the external appearance is perfect except for an extra dorsal fan at the tail she said but internally its all screwed up theres no way for these animals to be alive no stomach no reproductive apparatus this animal is like a bad imitation of a shrimp yet the shrimps are alive norman said yeah she said they are she seemed unhappy about it and the squid were perfectly normal inside actually they werent when i dissected one i found that it lacked several important structures theres a nerve bundle called the stellate ganglion that wasnt there well and there were no gills norman squid possess a long gill structure for gas exchange this one didnt have one the squid had no way to breathe norman it must have had a way to breathe im telling you it didnt were seeing impossible animals down here all of a sudden impossible animals she turned away from the highintensity lamp and he saw that she was close to tears her hands were shaking she quickly dropped them into her lap youre really worried he said arent you she searched his face norman she said all this started when harry came out of the sphere didnt it i guess it did harry came out of the sphere and now we have impossible sea life i dont like it i wish we could get out of here i really do her lower lip was trembling he gave her a hug and said gently we cant get out of here i know she said she hugged him back and began to cry pushing her face into his shoulder its all right i hate it when i get this way she said i hate this feeling i know and i hate this place i hate everything about it i hate barnes and i hate teds lectures and i hate levys stupid desserts i wish i wasnt here i know she sniffled for a moment then abruptly pushed him away with her strong arms she turned away wiped her eyes im all right she said thanks sure he said she remained turned away her back to him wheres the damn kleenex she found one blew her nose you wont say anything to the others of course not a bell rang startling her jesus whats that i think its dinner norman said dinner i dont know how you can eat those things harry said pointing to the squid theyre delicious norman said sauteed squid as soon as he had sat at the table he became aware of how hungry he was and eating made him feel better there was a reassuring normalcy about sitting at a table with a knife and fork in his hands it was almost possible to forget where he was i especially like them fried tina said fried calamari barnes said wonderful my favorite i like them fried too edmunds the archivist said she sat primly very erect eating her food precisely norman noticed that she put her knife down between bites why arent these fried norman said we cant deepfry down here barnes said the hot oil forms a suspension and gums up the air filters but sauteed is fine well i dont know about the squid but the shrimps are great ted said arent they harry ted and harry were eating shrimp great shrimp harry said delicious you know how i feel ted said i feel like captain nemo remember living underwater off the bounty of the sea twenty thousand leagues under the sea barnes said james mason ted said remember how he played the organ duhduhduh da da da daaaaah da bach toccata and fugue in d minor and kirk douglas kirk douglas was great remember when he fought the giant squid that was great kirk douglas had an ax remember yeah and he cut off one of the squid arms that movie harry said scared the hell out of me i saw it when i was a kid and it scared the hell out of me i didnt think it was scary ted said you were older harry said not that much older yes you were for a kid it was terrifying thats probably why i dont like squid now you dont like squid ted said because theyre rubbery and disgusting barnes said that was the movie that made me want to join the navy i can imagine ted said so romantic and exciting and a real vision of the wonders of applied science who played the professor in that the professor yes remember there was a professor i vaguely remember a professor old guy norman you remember who was the professor no i dont norman said ted said are you sitting over there keeping an eye on us norman how do you mean norman said analyzing us seeing if were cracking up yes norman said smiling i am howre we doing ted said i would say it is highly significant that a group of scientists cant remember who played the scientist in a movie they all loved well kirk douglas was the hero thats why the scientist wasnt the hero franchot tone barnes said claude rains no i dont think so fritz somebody fritz weaver they heard a crackle and hiss and then the sounds of an organ playing the toccata and fugue in d minor great ted said i didnt know we had music down here edmunds returned to the table theres a tape library ted i dont know if this is right for dinner barnes said i like it ted said now if we only had seaweed salad isnt that what captain nemo served maybe something lighter barnes said lighter than seaweed lighter than bach what was the submarine called ted said the nautilus edmunds said oh right nautilus it was the name of the first atomic submarine too launched in she said and she gave ted a bright smile true ted said true norman thought hes met his match in irrelevant trivia edmunds went to the porthole and said oh more visitors what now harry said looking up quickly frightened norman thought no just quick manic interested theyre beautiful edmunds was saying some kind of little jellyfish all around the habitat we should really film them what do you think dr fielding should we go film them i think ill just eat now jane ted said a bit severely edmunds looked stricken rejected norman thought ill have to watch that she turned to leave the others glanced toward the porthole but nobody left the table have you ever eaten jellyfish ted said i hear theyre a delicacy some of them are poisonous beth said toxins in the tentacles dont the chinese eat jellyfish harry said yes tina said they make a soup too my grandmother used to make it in honolulu youre from honolulu mozart would be better for dining barnes said or beethoven something with strings this organ music is gloomy dramatic ted said playing imaginary keys in the air in time to the music swaying his body like james mason gloomy barnes said the intercom crackled oh you should see this edmunds said over the intercom its beautiful where is she she must be outside barnes said he went to the porthole its like pink snow edmunds said they all got up and went to the portholes edmunds was outside with the video camera they could hardly see her through the dense clouds of jellyfish the jellyfish were small the size of a thimble and a delicate glowing pink it was indeed like a snowfall some of the jellyfish came quite close to the porthole they could see them well they have no tentacles harry said theyre just little pulsating sacs thats how they move beth said muscular contractions expel the water like squid ted said not as developed but the general idea theyre sticky edmunds said over the intercom theyre sticking to my suit that pink color is fantastic ted said like snow in a sunset very poetic i thought so you would theyre sticking to my faceplate too edmunds said i have to pull them off they leave a smeary streak she broke off abruptly but they could still hear her breathing can you see her ted said not very well shes there to the left over the intercom edmunds said they seem to be warm i feel heat on my arms and legs thats not right barnes said he turned to tina tell her to get out of there tina ran from the cylinder toward the communications console norman could hardly see edmunds any more he was vaguely aware of a dark shape moving arms agitated over the intercom she said the smear on the faceplateit wont go awaythey seem to be eroding the plasticand my armsthe fabric is tinas voice said jane jane get out of there on the double barnes shouted tell her on the double edmundss breathing was coming in ragged gasps the smearscant see very welli feelhurtsmy arms burninghurtstheyre eating through jane come back jane are you reading jane shes fallen down harry said look you can see her lying we have to save her ted said jumping to his feet nobody move barnes said but shes nobody else is going out there mister edmundss breathing was rapid she coughed gasped i canti cantoh god edmunds began to scream the scream was highpitched and continuous except for ragged gasps for breath they could no longer see her through the swarms of jellyfish they looked at each other at barnes barness face was rigidly set his jaw tight listening to the screams and then abruptly there was silence the next messages an hour later the jellyfish disappeared as mysteriously as they had come they could see edmundss body outside the habitat lying on the bottom rocking back and forth gently in the current there were small ragged holes in the fabric of the suit they watched through the portholes as barnes and the chief petty officer teeny fletcher crossed the bottom into the harsh floodlights carrying extra air tanks they lifted edmundss body the helmeted head flopped loosely back revealing the scarred plastic faceplate dull in the light nobody spoke norman noticed that even harry had dropped his manic effect he sat unmoving staring out the window outside barnes and fletcher still held the body there was a great burst of silvery bubbles which rose swiftly to the surface whatre they doing inflating her suit why arent they bringing her back ted said they cant tina said theres nowhere to put her here the decomposition byproducts would ruin our air but there must be some kind of a sealed container there isnt tina said theres no provision for keeping organic remains in the habitat you mean they didnt plan on anyone dying thats right they didnt now there were many thin streams of bubbles rising from the holes in the suit toward the surface edmundss suit was puffed bloated barnes released it and it floated slowly away as if pulled upward by the streaming silver bubbles itll go to the surface yes the gas expands continuously as outside pressure diminishes and what then sharks beth said probably in a few moments the body disappeared into blackness beyond the reach of the lights barnes and fletcher still watched the body helmets tilted up toward the surface fletcher made the sign of the cross then they trudged back toward the habitat a bell rang from somewhere inside tina went into d cyl moments later she shouted dr adams more numbers harry got up and went into the next cylinder the others trailed after him nobody wanted to look out the porthole any longer norman stared at the screen entirely puzzled but harry clapped his hands in delight excellent harry said this is extremely helpful it is of course now i have a fighting chance you mean to break the code yes of course why remember the original number sequence this is the same sequence it is of course harry said except its in binary binary ted said nudging norman didnt i tell you binary was important whats important harry said is that this establishes the individual letter breaks from the original sequence heres a copy of the original sequence tina said handing them a sheet good harry said now you can see my problem at once look at the word ohohohthreetwoone and so on the question is how do i break that word up into individual letters i couldnt decide but now i know how well obviously it goes three twentyone twentyfive twentyfive norman didnt understand but how do you know that look harry said impatiently its very simple norman its a spiral reading from inside to outside its just giving us the numbers in abruptly the screen changed again there is that clearer for you norman frowned look its exactly the same harry said see center outward ohohohthreetwentyonetwentyfivetwentyfive its made a spiral moving outward from the center it maybe its sorry about what happened to edmunds harry said why do you say that norman asked staring curiously at harry because its obviously trying very hard to communicate with us harry said its attempting different things who is it it harry said may not be a who the screen went blank and another pattern appeared all right harry said this is very good where is this coming from obviously from the ship but were not connected to the ship how is it managing to turn on our computer and print this we dont know well shouldnt we know beth said not necessarily ted said shouldnt we try to know not necessarily you see if the technology is advanced enough it appears to the naive observer to be magic theres no doubt about that for example you take a famous scientist from our pastaristotle leonardo da vinci even isaac newton show him an ordinary sony colortelevision set and hed run screaming claiming it was witchcraft he wouldnt understand it at all but the point ted said is that you couldnt explain it to him either at least not easily isaac newton wouldnt be able to understand tv without first studying our physics for a couple of years hed have to learn all the underlying concepts electromagnetism waves particle physics these would all be new ideas to him a new conception of nature in the meantime the tv would be magic as far as he was concerned but to us its ordinary its tv youre saying were like isaac newton ted shrugged were getting a communication and we dont know how its done and we shouldnt bother to try and find out i think we have to accept the possibility ted said that we may not be able to understand it norman noticed the energy with which they threw themselves into this discussion pushing aside the tragedy so recently witnessed theyre intellectuals he thought and their characteristic defense is intellectualization talk ideas abstractions concepts it was a way of getting distance from the feelings of sadness and fear and being trapped norman understood the impulse he wanted to get away from those feelings himself harry frowned at the spiral image we may not understand how but its obvious what its doing its trying to communicate by trying different presentations the fact that its trying spirals may be significant maybe it believes we think in spirals or write in spirals right beth said who knows what kind of weird creatures we are ted said if its trying to communicate with us why arent we trying to communicate back harry snapped his fingers good idea he went to the keyboard theres an obvious first step harry said we just send the original message back well start with the first grouping beginning with the double zeroes i want it made clear ted said that the suggestion to attempt communication with the alien originated with me its clear ted barnes said harry ted said yes ted harry said dont worry its your idea sitting at the keyboard harry typed the numbers appeared on the screen there was a pause they listened to the hum of the air fans the distant thump of the diesel generator they all watched the screen nothing happened the screen went blank and then printed out norman felt the hair rise on the back of his neck it was just a series of numbers on a computer screen but it still gave him a chill standing beside him tina shivered he answered us fabulous ted said ill try the second grouping now harry said he seemed calm but his fingers kept making mistakes at the keyboard it took a few moments before he was able to type the reply immediately came back well harry said looks like we just opened our line of communication yes beth said too bad we dont understand what were saying to each other presumably it knows what its saying ted said but were still in the dark maybe we can get it to explain itself impatiently barnes said what is this it you keep referring to harry sighed and pushed his glasses up on his nose i think theres no doubt about that it harry said is something that was previously inside the sphere and that is now released and is free to act thats what it is the monster alarm norman awoke to a shrieking alarm and flashing red lights he rolled out of his bunk pulled on his insulated shoes and his heated jacket and ran for the door where he collided with beth the alarm was screaming throughout the habitat whats happening he shouted over the alarm i dont know her face was pale frightened norman pushed past her in the b cylinder among all the pipes and consoles a flashing sign winked life support emergency he looked for teeny fletcher but the big engineer wasnt there he hurried back toward c cylinder passing beth again do you know beth shouted its life support wheres fletcher wheres barnes i dont know im looking theres nobody in b he shouted and scrambled up the steps into d cylinder tina and fletcher were there working behind the computer consoles the back panels were pulled off exposing wires banks of chips the room lights were flashing red the screens all flashed emergencylife support systems whats going on norman shouted fletcher waved a hand dismissingly tell me he turned saw harry sitting in the corner near edmundss video section like a zombie with a pencil and a pad of paper on his knee he seemed completely indifferent to the sirens the lights flashing on his face harry harry didnt respond norman turned back to the two women for gods sake will you tell me what it is norman shouted and then the sirens stopped the screens went blank there was silence except for soft classical music sorry about that tina said it was a false alarm fletcher said jesus christ norman said dropping into a chair he took a deep breath were you asleep he nodded sorry it just went off by itself jesus christ the next time it happens you can check your badge fletcher said pointing to the badge on her own chest thats the first thing to do you see the badges are all normal now jesus christ take it easy norman harry said when the psychiatrist goes crazy its a bad sign im a psychologist whatever tina said our computer alarm has a lot of peripheral sensors dr johnson it goes off sometimes theres not much we can do about it norman nodded went into e cyl to the galley levy had made strawberry shortcake for lunch and nobody had eaten it because of the accident with edmunds he was sure it would still be there but when he couldnt find it he felt frustrated he opened cabinet doors slammed them shut he kicked the refrigerator door take it easy he thought it was just a false alarm but he couldnt overcome the feeling that he was trapped stuck in some damned oversized iron lung while things slowly fell apart around him the worst moment had been barness briefing when he came back from sending edmundss body to the surface barnes had decided it was time to make a little speech deliver a little pep talk i know youre all upset about edmunds he had said but what happened to her was an accident perhaps she made an error of judgment in going out among jellyfish perhaps not the fact is accidents happen under the best of circumstances and the deep sea is a particularly unforgiving environment listening norman thought hes writing his report explaining it away to the brass right now barnes was saying i urge you all to remain calm its sixteen hours since the gale hit topside we just sent up a sensor balloon to the surface before we could make readings the cable snapped which suggests that surface waves are still thirty feet or higher and the gale is still in full force the weather satellite estimates were for a sixtyhour storm on site so we have two more full days down here theres not much we can do about it we just have to remain calm dont forget even when you do go topside you cant throw open the hatch and start breathing you have to spend four more days decompressing in a hyperbaric chamber on the surface that was the first norman had heard of surface decompression even after they left this iron lung they would have to sit in another iron lung for another four days i thought you knew barnes had said thats sop for saturated environments you can stay down here as long as you like but you have a fourday decompress when you go back and believe me this habitats a lot nicer than the decompression chamber so enjoy this while you can enjoy this while you can he thought jesus christ strawberry shortcake would help where the hell was levy anyway he went back to d cyl wheres levy dunno tina said around here somewhere maybe sleeping nobody could sleep through that alarm norman said try the galley i just did wheres barnes he went back to the ship with ted theyre putting more sensors around the sphere i told them it was a waste of time harry said so nobody knows where levy is norman said fletcher finished screwing the computer panels back on doctor she said are you one of those people who need to keep track of where everyone is no norman said of course not then whats the big deal about levy sir i only wanted to know where the strawberry shortcake was gone fletcher said promptly captain and i came back from funeral duty and we sat down and ate the whole thing just like that she shook her head maybe rosell make some more harry said he found beth in her laboratory on the top level of d cyl he walked in just in time to see her take a pill what was that valium god whered you get it look she said dont give me any psychotalk about it i was just asking beth pointed to a white box mounted on the wall in the corner of the lab theres a firstaid kit in every cylinder turns out to be pretty complete too norman went over to the box flipped open the lid there were neat compartments with medicines syringes bandages beth was right it was quite completeantibiotics sedatives tranquilizers even surgical anesthetics he didnt recognize all the names on the bottles but the psychoactive drugs were strong you could fight a war with the stuff in this kit yeah well the navy theres everything you need here to do major surgery norman noticed a card on the inside of the box it said medaid code any idea what this means she nodded its a computer code i called it up and the news she said is not good is that right he sat at the terminal in her room and punched in the screen said hyperbaric saturated environment medical complications majorfatal pulmonary embolism high pressure nervous syndrome aseptic bone necrosis oxygen toxicity thermal stress syndrome disseminated pseudomonas infection cerebral infarction choose one dont choose one beth said reading the details will only upset you just leave it at thiswere in a very dangerous environment barnes didnt bother to give us all the gory details you know why the navy has that rule about pulling people out within seventytwo hours because after seventytwo hours you increase your risk of something called aseptic bone necrosis nobody knows why but the pressurized environment causes bone destruction in the leg and hip and you know why this habitat constantly adjusts as we walk through it its not because thats slick and hightech its because the helium atmosphere makes bodyheat control very volatile you can quickly become overheated and just as quickly overchilled fatally so it can happen so fast you dont realize it until its too late and you drop dead and high pressure nervous syndromethat turns out to be sudden convulsions paralysis and death if the carbondioxide content of the atmosphere drops too low thats what the badges are for to make sure we have enough co in the air thats the only reason we have the badges nice huh norman flicked off the screen sat back well i keep coming back to the same pointtheres not much we can do about it now exactly what barnes said beth started pushing equipment around on her counter top nervously rearranging things too bad we dont have a sample of those jellyfish norman said yes but im not sure how much good it would do to tell the truth she frowned shifted papers on the counter again norman im not thinking very clearly down here hows that after the uh accident i came up here to look over my notes review things and i checked the shrimps remember how i told you they didnt have any stomach well they do id made a bad dissection out of the midsagittal plane i just missed all the midline structures but theyre there all right the shrimps are normal and the squid it turns out the one squid i dissected was a little anomalous it had an atrophic gill but it had one and the other squid are perfectly normal just what youd expect i was wrong too hasty it really bothers me is that why you took the valium she nodded i hate to be sloppy nobodys criticizing you if harry or ted reviewed my work and found that id made these stupid mistakes whats wrong with a mistake i can hear them now just like a woman not careful enough too eager to make a discovery trying to prove herself too quick to draw conclusions just like a woman nobodys criticizing you beth i am nobody else norman said i think you ought to give yourself a break she stared at the lab bench finally she said i cant something about the way she said it touched him i understand norman said and a memory came rushing back to him you know when i was a kid i went to the beach with my younger brother tim hes dead now but tim was about six at the time he couldnt swim yet my mother told me to watch him carefully but when i got to the beach all my friends were there bodysurfing i didnt want to be bothered with my brother it was hard because i wanted to be out in the big surf and he had to stay close to shore anyway in the middle of the afternoon he comes out of the water screaming bloody murder absolutely screaming and tugging at his right side it turned out he had been stung by some kind of a jellyfish it was still attached to him sticking to his side then he collapsed on the beach one of the mothers ran over and took timmy to the hospital before i could even get out of the water i didnt know where he had gone i got to the hospital later my mother was already there tim was in shock i guess the poison was a heavy dose for his small body anyway nobody blamed me it wouldnt have mattered if i had been sitting right on the beach watching him like a hawk he would still have been stung but i hadnt been sitting there and i blamed myself for years long after he was fine every time id see those scars on his side i felt terrible guilt but you get over it youre not responsible for everything that happens in the world you just arent there was a silence somewhere in the habitat he heard a soft rhythmic knocking a sort of thumping and the everpresent hum of the air handlers beth was staring at him seeing edmunds die must have been hard for you its funny norman said i never made the connection until right now blocked it i guess want a valium he smiled no you looked as if you were about to cry no im fine he stood up stretched he went over to the medicine kit and closed the white lid came back beth said what do you think about these messages were getting beats me norman said he sat down again actually i did have one crazy thought do you suppose the messages and these animals were seeing are related why i never thought about it until we started to get spiral messages harry says its because the thingthe famous itbelieves we think in spirals but its just as likely that it thinks in spirals and so it assumes we do too the sphere is round isnt it and weve been seeing all these radially symmetrical animals jellyfish squid nice idea beth said except for the fact that squid arent radially symmetrical an octopus is and like an octopus squid have a round circle of tentacles but squidre bilaterally symmetrical with a matching left and right side the way we have and then theres the shrimps thats right the shrimps norman had forgotten about the shrimps i cant see a connection between the sphere and the animals beth said they heard the thumping again soft rhythmic sitting in his chair norman realized that he could feel the thumping as well as a slight impact what is that anyway i dont know sounds like its coming from outside he had started toward the porthole when the intercom clicked and he heard barnes say now hear this all hands to communications all hands to communications dr adams has broken the code harry wouldnt tell them the message right away relishing his triumph he insisted on going through the decoding process step by step first he explained he had thought that the messages might express some universal constant or some physical law stated as a way to open conversation but harry said it might also be a graphic representation of some kindcode for a picturewhich presented immense problems after all whats a picture we make pictures on a flat plane like a piece of paper we determine positions within a picture by what we call x and y axes vertical and horizontal but another intelligence might see images and organize them very differently it might assume more than three dimensions or it might work from the center of the picture outward for example so the code might be very tough i didnt make much progress at first later when he got the same message with gaps between number sequences harry began to suspect that the code represented discrete chunks of informationsuggesting words not pictures now word codes fall into several types from simple to complex there was no way to know immediately which method of encoding had been used but then i had a sudden insight they waited impatiently for his insight why use a code at all harry asked why use a code norman said sure if you are trying to communicate with someone you dont use a code codes are ways of hiding communication so perhaps this intelligence thinks he is communicating directly but is actually making some kind of logical mistake in talking to us he is making a code without ever intending to do so that suggested the unintentional code was probably a substitution code with numbers for letters when i got the word breaks i began to try and match numbers to letters by frequency analysis in frequency analysis you break down codes by using the fact that the most common letter in english is e and the second most common letter is t and so on so i looked for the most common numbers but i was impeded by the fact that even a short number sequence such as twothreetwo might represent many code possibilities two and three and two twentythree and two two and thirtytwo or two hundred and thirtytwo longer code sequences had many more possibilities then he said he was sitting in front of the computer thinking about the spiral messages and he suddenly looked at the keyboard i began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard those rows of symbols on a device made to be pressed how confusing it must look to another kind of creature look here he said the letters on a regular keyboard go like this he held up his pad tab q w e r t y u i o p caps a s d f g h j k l shift z x c v b n m and then i imagined what the keyboard would look like as a spiral since our creature seems to prefer spirals and i started numbering the keys in concentric circles it took a little experimentation since the keys dont line up exactly but finally i got it he said look here the numbers spiral out from the center g is one b is two h is three y is four and so on see its like this he quickly penciled in numbers tab q w e r t y u o p caps a s d f g h j k l shift z x c v b n m they just keep spiraling outwardm is sixteen k is seventeen and so forth so finally i understood the message what is the message harry harry hesitated i have to tell you its strange how do you mean strange harry tore another sheet off his yellow pad and handed it to them norman read the short message printed in neat block letters hello how are you i am fine what is your name my name is jerry the first exchange well ted said finally this is not what i expected at all it looks childish beth said like something out of those old see spot run readers for kids thats exactly what it looks like maybe you translated it wrong barnes said certainly not harry said well this alien sounds like an idiot barnes said i doubt very much that he is ted said you would doubt it barnes said a stupid alien would blow your whole theory but its something to consider isnt it a stupid alien they must have them i doubt ted said that anyone in command of such high technology as that sphere is stupid then you havent noticed all the ninnies driving cars back home barnes said jesus after all this effort how are you i am fine jesus norman said i dont feel that this message implies a lack of intelligence hal on the contrary harry said i think the message is very smart im listening barnes said the content certainly appears childish harry said but when you think about it its highly logical a simple message is unambiguous friendly and not frightening it makes a lot of sense to send such a message i think hes approaching us in the simple way that we might approach a dog you know hold out your hand let it sniff get used to you youre saying hes treating us like dogs barnes said norman thought barnes is in over his head hes irritable because hes frightened he feels inadequate or perhaps he feels hes exceeding his authority no hal ted said hes just starting at a simple level well its simple all right barnes said jesus christ we contact an alien from outer space and he says his name is jerry lets not jump to conclusions hal maybe he has a last name barnes said hopefully i mean my report to cinccompac is going to say one person died on a deepsat expedition to meet an alien named jerry it could sound better anything but jerry barnes said can we ask him ask him what harry said his full name ted said i personally feel we should have much more substantive conversations id like the full name barnes said for the report right ted said full name rank and serial number i would remind you dr fielding that i am in charge here harry said the first thing we have to do is to see if hell talk at all lets give him the first number grouping he typed there was a pause then the answer came back okay harry said jerrys listening he made some notes on his pad and typed another string of numbers what did you say beth said we are friends harry said forget friends ask his damn name barnes said just a minute one thing at a time ted said he may not have a last name you know you can be damn sure barnes said that his real name isnt jerry the response came back he said yes yes what barnes said just yes lets see if we can get him to switch over to english characters itll be easier if he uses letters and not his number codes howre you going to get him to use letters well show him theyre the same harry said he typed hello after a short pause the screen blinked hello he doesnt get it ted said no doesnt look like it lets try another pairing he typed yes the reply came back yes hes definitely not getting it ted said i thought he was so smart barnes said give him a chance ted said after all hes speaking our language not the other way around the other way around harry said good idea lets try the other way around see if hell deduce the equation that way harry typed yes yes there was a long pause while they watched the screen nothing happened is he thinking who knows what hes doing why isnt he answering lets give him a chance hal okay the reply finally came yes sey uhuh he thinks were showing him mirror images stupid barnes said i knew it what do we do now lets try a more complete statement harry said give him more to work with harry typed yes yes yes a syllogism ted said very good a what barnes said a logical proposition ted said the reply came back what the hell is that barnes said harry smiled i think hes playing with us playing with us you call that playing yes i do harry said what you really mean is that hes testing ustesting our responses to a pressure situation barnes narrowed his eyes hes only pretending to be stupid maybe hes testing how smart we are ted said maybe he thinks were stupid hal dont be ridiculous barnes said no harry said the point is hes acting like a kid trying to make friends and when kids try to make friends they start playing together lets try something playful harry sat at the console typed the reply quickly came back cute harry said this guy is very cute he quickly typed the reply came amp are you enjoying yourself barnes said because i dont know what the hell you are doing he understands me fine harry said im glad somebody does harry typed ppp the reply came hello okay harry said hes getting bored playtimes over lets switch to straight english harry typed yes the reply came back harry typed hello there was a pause then i am delighted to make your acquaintance the pleasure is entirely mine i assure you there was a long silence nobody spoke okay barnes said finally lets get down to business hes polite ted said very friendly unless its an act why should it be an act dont be naive barnes said norman looked at the lines on the screen he had a different reaction from the othershe was surprised to find an expression of emotion did this alien have emotions probably not he suspected the flowery rather archaic words suggested an adopted tone jerry was talking like a character from a historical romance well ladies and gentlemen harry said for the first time in human history you are online with an alien what do you want to ask him his name barnes said promptly besides his name hal there are certainly more profound questions than his name ted said i dont understand why you wont ask him the screen printed are you the entity hecho in mexico jesus whered he get that maybe there are things on the ship fabricated in mexico like what chips maybe are you the entity made in the usa the guy doesnt wait for an answer who says hes a guy beth said oh beth maybe jerry is short for geraldine not now beth are you the entity made in the usa answer him barnes said yes we are who are you a long pause then we are we are what barnes said staring at the screen hal take it easy harry typed we are the entities from the usa who are you entitiesentity its too bad ted said that we have to speak english howre we going to teach him plurals harry typed no you are a many entity i see what hes asking he thinks we may be multiple parts of a single entity well straighten him out no we are many separate entities you can say that again beth said i understand is there one control entity ted started laughing look what hes asking i dont get it barnes said harry said hes saying take me to your leader hes asking whos in charge im in charge barnes said you tell him harry typed yes the control entity is captain harald c barnes i understand with an o barnes said irritably harold with an o you want me to retype it never mind just ask him who he is who are you i am one good barnes said so theres only one ask him where hes from where are you from i am from a location ask him the name barnes said the name of the location hal names are confusing we have to pin this guy down where is the location you are from i am here we know that ask again where is the location from where you began ted said that isnt even good english from where you began its going to look foolish when we publish this exchange well clean it up for publication barnes said but you cant do that ted said horrified you cant alter this priceless scientific interaction happens all the time what do you guys call it massaging the data harry was typing again where is the location from where you began i began at awareness awareness is that a planet or what where is awareness awareness is hes making us look like fools barnes said ted said let me try harry stepped aside and ted typed did you make a journey yes did you make a journey yes ted typed i make a journey you make a journey we make a journey together i am happy norman thought he said he is happy another expression of emotion and this time it didnt seem to come from a book the statement appeared direct and genuine did that mean that the alien had emotions or was he just pretending to have them to be playful or to make them comfortable lets cut the crap barnes said ask him about his weapons i doubt hell understand the concept of weapons everybody understands the concept of weapons barnes said defense is a fact of life i must protest that attitude ted said military people always assume that everyone else is exactly like them this alien may not have the least conception of weapons or defense he may come from a world where defense is wholly irrelevant since youre not listening barnes said ill say it again defense is a fact of life if this jerry is alive hell have a concept of defense my god ted said now youre elevating your idea of defense to a universal life principledefense as an inevitable feature of life barnes said you think it isnt what do you call a cell membrane what do you call an immune system what do you call your skin what do you call wound healing every living creature must maintain the integrity of its physical borders thats defense and we cant have life without it we cant imagine a creature without a limit to its body that it defends every living creature knows about defense i promise you now ask him id say the captain has a point beth said perhaps ted said but im not sure we should introduce concepts that might induce paranoia im in charge here barnes said the screen printed out is your journey now far from your location tell him to wait a minute ted typed please wait we are talking yes i am also i am delighted to talk to multiple entities from made in the usa i am enjoying this much thank you ted typed i am pleased to be in contact with your entities i am happy for talking with you i am enjoying this much barnes said lets get offline the screen printed please do not stop i am enjoying this much norman thought ill bet he wants to talk to somebody after three hundred years of isolation or had it been even longer than that had he been floating in space for thousands of years before he was picked up by the spacecraft this raised a whole series of questions for norman if the alien entity had emotionsand he certainly appeared tothen there was the possibility of all sorts of aberrant emotional responses including neuroses even psychoses most human beings when placed in isolation became seriously disturbed rather quickly this alien intelligence had been isolated for hundreds of years what had happened to it during that time had it become neurotic was that why it was childish and demanding now do not stop i am enjoying this much we have to stop for christs sake barnes said ted typed we stop now to talk among our entities it is not necessary to stop i do not care to stop norman thought he detected a petulant irritable tone perhaps even a little imperious i do not care to stopthis alien sounded like louis xiv it is necessary for us ted typed i do not wish it it is necessary for us jerry i understand the screen went blank thats better barnes said now lets regroup here and formulate a game plan what do we want to ask this guy i think we better acknowledge norman said that hes showing an emotional reaction to our interaction meaning what beth said interested i think we need to take the emotional content into account in dealing with him you want to psychoanalyze him ted said put him on the couch find out why he had an unhappy childhood norman suppressed his anger with some difficulty beneath that boyish exterior lies a boy he thought no ted but if jerry does have emotions then wed better consider the psychological aspects of his response i dont mean to offend you ted said but personally i dont see that psychology has much to offer psychologys not a science its a form of superstition or religion it simply doesnt have any good theories or any hard data to speak of its all soft all this emphasis on emotionsyou can say anything about emotions and nobody can prove you wrong speaking as an astrophysicist i dont think emotions are very important i dont think they matter very much many intellectuals would agree norman said yes well ted said were dealing with a higher intellect here arent we in general norman said people who arent in touch with their emotions tend to think their emotions are unimportant youre saying im not in touch with my emotions ted said if you think emotions are unimportant youre not in touch no can we have this argument later barnes said nothing is but thinking makes it so ted said why dont you just say what you mean norman said angrily and stop quoting other people now youre making a personal attack ted said well at least i havent denied the validity of your field of study norman said although without much effort i could astrophysicists tend to focus on the faroff universe as a way of evading the realities of their own lives and since nothing in astrophysics can ever be finally proven thats absolutely untrue ted said enough thats enough barnes said slamming his fist on the table they fell into an awkward silence norman was still angry but he was also embarrassed ted got to me he thought he finally got to me and he did it in the simplest possible way by attacking my field of study norman wondered why it had worked all his life at the university hed had to listen to hard scientistsphysicists and chemistsexplain patiently to him that there was nothing to psychology while these men went through divorce after divorce while their wives had affairs their kids committed suicide or got in trouble with drugs hed long ago stopped responding to these arguments yet ted had gotten to him return to the business at hand barnes was saying the question is what do we want to ask this guy what do we want to ask this guy they stared at the screen uhoh barnes said uhoh does that mean what i think it means does that mean what eye think it means ted pushed back from the console he said loudly jerry can you understand what i am saying yes ted great barnes said shaking his head just great i am happy also alien negotiations norman barnes said i seem to remember you covered this in your report didnt you the possibility that an alien could read our minds i mentioned it norman said and what were your recommendations i didnt have any it was just something the state department asked me to include as a possibility so i did you didnt make any recommendations in your report no norman said to tell you the truth at the time i thought the idea was a joke its not barnes said he sat down heavily stared at the screen what the hell are we going to do now do not be afraid thats fine for him to say listening to everything we say he looked at the screen are you listening to us now jerry yes hal what a mess barnes said ted said i think its an exciting development norman said jerry can you read our minds yes norman oh brother barnes said he can read our minds maybe not norman thought he frowned concentrating and thought jerry can you hear me the screen remained blank jerry tell me your name the screen did not change maybe a visual image norman thought perhaps he can receive a visual image norman cast around in his mind for something to visualize chose a sandy tropical beach then a palm tree the image of the palm tree was clear but then he thought jerry wouldnt know what a palm tree was it wouldnt mean anything to him norman thought he should choose something that might be within jerrys experience he decided to imagine a planet with rings like saturn he frowned jerry i am going to send you a picture tell me what you see he focused his mind on the image of saturn a brightyellow sphere with a tilted ring system hanging in the blackness of space he sustained the image about ten seconds and then looked at the screen the screen did not change jerry are you there the screen still did not change jerry are you there norman said yes norman i am here i dont think we should talk in this room barnes said maybe if we go into another cylinder and turn the water on like in the spy movies its worth a try ted said i think were being unfair to jerry if we feel that he is intruding on our privacy why dont we just tell him ask him not to intrude i do not wish to in trude lets face it barnes said this guy knows a lot more about us than we know about him yes i know many things about your entities jerry ted said yes ted i am here please leave us alone i do not wish to do so i am happy to talk with you i enjoy to talk with you let us talk now i wish it its obvious he wont listen to reason barnes said jerry ted said you must leave us alone for a while no that is not possible i do not agree no now the bastards showing his true colors barnes said the child king norman thought let me try be my guest jerry norman said yes norman i am here jerry it is very exciting for us to talk to you thank you i am excited also jerry we find you a fascinating and wonderful entity barnes was rolling his eyes shaking his head thank you norman and we wish to talk to you for many many hours jerry good we admire your gifts and talents thank you and we know that you have great power and understanding of all things this is so norman yes jerry in your great understanding you certainly know that we are entities who must have conversations among ourselves without your listening to us the experience of meeting you is very challenging to us and we have much to talk about among ourselves barnes was shaking his head i have much to talk about also i enjoy much to talk with your entities norman yes i know jerry but you also know in your wisdom that we need to talk alone do not be afraid were not afraid jerry we are uncomfortable do not be un comfortable we cant help it jerry it is the way we are i enjoy much to talk with your entities norman i am happy are you happy also yes very happy jerry but you see we need good i am glad we need to talk alone please do not listen for a while am i offended you no you are very friendly and charming but we need to talk alone without your listening for a while i understand you need this i wish you to have comfort with me norman i shall grant what you desire thank you jerry sure barnes said you think hell really do it well be right back after a short break for these messages from our sponsor and the screen went blank despite himself norman laughed fascinating ted said apparently hes been picking up television signals cant do that from underwater we cant but it looks like he can barnes said i know hes still listening i know he is jerry are you there the screen was blank jerry nothing happened the screen remained blank hes gone well norman said youve just seen the power of psychology in action he couldnt help saying it he was still annoyed with ted im sorry ted began thats all right but i just dont think that for a higher intellect emotions are really significant lets not go into this again beth said the real point norman said is that emotions and intellect are entirely unrelated theyre like separate compartments of the brain or even separate brains and they dont communicate with each other thats why intellectual understanding is so useless ted said intellectual understanding is useless he sounded horrified in many cases yes norman said if you read a book on how to ride a bike do you know how to ride a bike no you dont you can read all you want but you still have to go out and learn to ride the part of your brain that learns to ride is different from the part of your brain that reads about it what does this have to do with jerry barnes said we know norman said that a smart person is just as likely to blunder emotionally as anyone else if jerry is really an emotional creatureand not just pretending to be onethen we need to deal with his emotional side as well as his intellectual side very convenient for you ted said not really norman said frankly id be much happier if jerry were just cold emotionless intellect why because norman said if jerry is powerful and also emotional it raises a question what happens if jerry gets mad levy the group broke up harry exhausted by the sustained effort of decoding immediately went off to sleep ted went to c cyl to tape his personal observations on jerry for the book he was planning to write barnes and fletcher went to e cyl to plan battle strategy in case the alien decided to attack them tina stayed for a moment adjusting the monitors in her precise methodical way norman and beth watched her work she spent a lot of time with a deck of controls norman had never noticed before there was a series of gasplasma readout screens glowing bright red whats all that beth said epsa the external perimeter sensor array we have active and passive sensors for all modalitiesthermal aural pressurewaveranged in concentric circles around the habitat captain barnes wants them all reset and activated why is that norman said i dont know sir his orders the intercom crackled barnes said seaman chan to e cylinder on the double and shut down the com line in here i dont want that jerry listening to these plans yes sir beth said paranoid ass tina collected her papers and hurried off norman sat with beth in silence for a moment they heard the rhythmic thumping from somewhere in the habitat then another silence then they heard the thumping again what is that beth said it sounds like its somewhere inside the habitat she went to the porthole looked out flicked on the exterior floods uhoh beth said norman looked stretching across the ocean floor was an elongated shadow which moved back and forth with each thumping impact the shadow was so distorted it took him a moment to realize what he was seeing it was the shadow of a human arm and a human hand captain barnes are you there there was no reply norman snapped the intercom switch again captain barnes are you reading still no reply hes shut off the com line beth said he cant hear you do you think the persons still alive out there norman said i dont know they might be lets get going norman said he tasted the dry metallic compressed air inside his helmet and felt the numbing cold of the water as he slid through the floor hatch and fell in darkness to the soft muddy bottom moments later beth landed just behind him okay she said fine i dont see any jellyfish she said no neither do i they moved out from beneath the habitat turned and looked back the habitat lights shone harshly into their eyes obscuring the outlines of the cylinders rising above they could clearly hear the rhythmic thumping but they still could not locate the source of the sound they walked beneath the stanchions to the far side of the habitat squinting into the lights there beth said ten feet above them a bluesuited figure was wedged in a light stand bracket the body moved loosely in the current the brightyellow helmet banging intermittently against the wall of the habitat can you see who it is beth said no the lights were shining directly in his face norman climbed up one of the heavy supporting stanchions that anchored the habitat to the bottom the metal surface was covered with a slippery brown algae his boots kept sliding off the pipes until finally he saw that there were builtin indented footholds then he climbed easily now the feet of the body were swinging just above his head norman climbed another step and one of the boots caught in the loop of the air hose that ran from his tank pack to his helmet he reached behind his helmet trying to free himself from the body the body shivered and for an awful moment he thought it was still alive then the boot came free in his hand and a naked footgray flesh purple toenailskicked his faceplate a moment of nausea quickly passed norman had seen too many airplane crashes to be bothered by this he dropped the boot watched it drift down to beth he tugged on the leg of the corpse he felt a mushy softness to the leg and the body came free it gently drifted down he grabbed the shoulder again feeling softness he turned the body so he could see the face its levy her helmet was filled with water behind the faceplate he saw staring eyes open mouth an expression of horror i got her beth said pulling the body down then she said jesus norman climbed back down the stanchion beth was moving the body away from the habitat into the lighted area beyond shes all soft its like every bone in her body was broken i know he moved out into the light joined her he felt a strange detachment a coldness and a remove he had known this woman she had been alive just a short time before now she was dead but it was as if he were viewing it all from a great distance he turned levys body over on the left side was a long tear in the fabric of the suit he had a glimpse of red mangled flesh norman bent to inspect it an accident i dont think so beth said here hold her norman lifted up the edges of suit fabric several separate tears met at a central point its actually torn in a star pattern he said you see she stepped back i see yes what would cause that beth i dontim not sure beth stepped farther back norman was looking into the tear at the body beneath the suit the flesh is macerated macerated chewed jesus yes definitely chewed he thought probing inside the tear the wound was peculiar there were fine jagged serrations in the flesh thin palered trickles of blood drifted up past his faceplate lets go back beth said just hang on norman squeezed the body at legs hips shoulders everywhere it was soft like a sponge the body had been somehow almost entirely crushed he could feel the leg bones broken in many places what could have done that he went back to the wound i dont like it out here beth said tense just a second at first inspection he had thought levys wound represented some sort of bite but now he wasnt sure her skin norman said its like a rough file has gone over it he jerked his head back startled as something small and white drifted past his faceplate his heart pounded at the thought that it was a jellyfishbut then he saw it was perfectly round and almost opaque it was about the size of a golf ball it drifted past him he looked around there were thin streaks of mucus in the water and many white spheres whatre these beth eggs over the intercom he heard her take deep slow breaths lets get out of here norman please just another second no norman now on the radio they heard an alarm distant and tinny it seemed to be transmitted from inside the habitat they heard voices and then barness voice very loud what the hell are you doing out there we found levy hal norman said well get back on the double damn it barnes said the sensors have activated youre not alone out thereand whatevers with you is very damn big norman felt dull and slow what about levys body drop the body get back here but the body he thought sluggishly they had to do something with the body he couldnt just leave the body whats the matter with you norman barnes said norman mumbled something and he vaguely felt beth grab him strongly by the arm lead him back toward the habitat the water was now clouded with white eggs the alarms were ringing in his ears the sound was very loud and then he realized a new alarm this alarm was ringing inside his suit he began to shiver his teeth chattered uncontrollably he tried to speak but bit his tongue tasted blood he felt numb and stupid everything was happening in slow motion as they approached the habitat he could see that the eggs were sticking to the cylinders clinging densely making a nubbly white surface hurry barnes shouted hurry its coming this way they were under the airlock and he began to feel surging currents of water there was something very big out there beth was pushing him upward and then his helmet burst above the waterline and fletcher gripped him with strong arms and a moment after that beth was pulled up and the hatch slammed shut somebody took off his helmet and he heard the alarm shrieking loud in his ears by now his whole body was shaking in spasms thumping on the deck they stripped off his suit and wrapped him in a silver blanket and held him until his shivering lessened then finally stopped and abruptly despite the alarm he went to sleep military considerations its not your goddamned job thats why barnes said you had no authorization to do what you did none whatsoever levy might have still been alive beth said calm in the face of barness fury but she wasnt alive and by going outside you risked the lives of two civilian expedition members unnecessarily norman said it was my idea hal norman was still wrapped in blankets but they had given him hot drinks and made him rest and now he felt better and you barnes said youre lucky to be alive i guess i am norman said but i dont know what happened this is what happened barnes said waving a small fan in front of him your suit circulator shorted out and you experienced rapid central cooling from the helium another couple of minutes and you would have been dead it was so fast norman said i didnt realize you goddamn people barnes said i want to make something clear this is not a scientific conference this is not the underwater holiday inn where you can do whatever you please this is a military operation and you will damn well follow military orders is that clear this is a military operation ted said it is now barnes said wait a minute was it always it is now you havent answered the question ted said because if it is a military operation i think we need to know that i personally do not wish to be associated with then leave beth said a military operation that is look ted barnes said you know what this is costing the navy no but i dont see ill tell you a deepplacement saturated gas environment with full support runs about a hundred thousand dollars an hour by the time we all get out of here the total project cost will be eighty to a hundred million dollars you dont get that kind of appropriations from the military without what they call a serious expectation of military benefit its that simple no expectation no money you following me you mean like a weapon beth said possibly yes barnes said well ted said i personally would never have joined is that right youd fly all the way to tonga and id say ted theres a spacecraft down there that might contain life from another galaxy but its a military operation and youd say gosh sorry to hear that count me out is that what youd have done ted well ted said then you better shut up barnes said because ive had it with your posturing hear hear beth said i personally feel youre overwrought ted said i personally feel youre an egomaniacal asshole barnes said just a minute everybody harry said does anybody know why levy went outside in the first place tina said she was on a trl a what a timeclock required lockout barnes said its the duty schedule levy was edmundss backup after edmunds died it became levys job to go to the submarine every twelve hours go to the sub why harry said barnes pointed out the porthole you see dh over there well next to the single cylinder is an inverted dome hangar and beneath the dome is a minisub that the divers left behind in a situation like this barnes said navy regs require that all tapes and records be transferred to the sub every twelve hours the sub is on tbdr modetimed ballast drop and releaseset on a timer every twelve hours that way if somebody doesnt get there every twelve hours transfer the latest tapes and press the yellow delay button the sub will automatically drop ballast blow tanks and go to the surface unattended why is that if theres a disaster down heresay something happened to all of usthen the sub would automatically surface after twelve hours with all the tapes accumulated thus far the navyd recover the sub at the surface and theyd have at least a partial record of what happened to us down here i see the subs our flight recorder you could say that yes but its also our way out our only emergency exit so levy was going to the sub yes and she must have made it because the sub is still here she transferred the tapes pressed the delay button and then she died on the way back yes how did she die harry said looking carefully at barnes were not sure barnes said her entire body was crushed norman said it was like a sponge harry said to barnes an hour ago you ordered the epsa sensors to be reset and adjusted why was that we had gotten a strange reading in the previous hour what sort of a reading something out there something very large but it didnt trigger the alarms harry said no this thing was beyond alarmset parameters you mean it was too big to set off the alarms yes after the first false alarm the settings were all cranked down the alarms were set to ignore anything that large thats why tina had to readjust the settings and what set off the alarms just now harry said when beth and norman were out there barnes said tina i dont know what it was some kind of animal i guess silent and very big how big she shook her head from the electronic footprint dr adams i would say the thing was almost as big as this habitat battle stations beth slipped one round white egg onto the stage of the scanning microscope well she said peering through the eyepiece its definitely marine invertebrate the interesting feature is this slimy coating she poked at it with forceps what is it norman said some kind of proteinaceous material sticky no i mean what is the egg dont know yet beth continued her examination when the alarm sounded and the red lights began to flash again norman felt a sudden dread probably another false alarm beth said attention all hands barnes said on the intercom all hands battle stations oh shit beth said beth slid gracefully down the ladder as if it were a fire pole norman followed clumsily back down behind her at the communications section on d cyl he found a familiar scene everyone clustered around the computer and the back panels again removed the lights still flashed the alarm still shrieked what is it norman shouted equipment breakdown what equipment breakdown we cant turn the damn alarm off barnes shouted it turned it on but we cant turn it off teeny w orking on it sir the big engineer was crouched behind the computer norman saw the broad curve of her back get that damn thing off getting it off sir get it off i cant hear hear what norman wondered and then harry stumbled into the room colliding with norman jesus this is an emergency barnes was shouting this is an emergency seaman chan sonar tina was next to him calm as always adjusting dials on side monitors she slipped on headphones norman looked at the sphere on the video monitor the sphere was closed beth went to one of the portholes and looked closely at the white material that blocked it barnes spun like a dervish beneath the flashing red lights shouting swearing in all directions and then suddenly the alarm stopped and the red lights stopped flashing everyone was silent fletcher straightened and sighed harry said i thought you got that fixed shhh they heard the soft repetitive pong of the sonar impulses tina cupped her hands over the headphones frowning concentrating nobody moved or spoke they stood tensely listening to the sonar as it echoed back barnes said quietly to the group a few minutes ago we got a signal from outside something very large finally tina said im not getting it now sir go passive aye aye sir going passive the pinging sonar stopped in its place they heard a slight hiss tina adjusted the speaker volume hydrophones harry said quietly barnes nodded polar glass transducers best in the world they all strained to listen but heard nothing except the undifferentiated hiss to norman it sounded like tape noise with an occasional gurgle of the water if he wasnt so tense he would have found the sound irritating barnes said bastards clever hes managed to blind us cover all our ports with goo not goo beth said eggs well theyre covering every damn port in the habitat the hissing continued unchanging tina twisted the hydrophone dials there was a soft continuous crackling like cellophane being crumpled whats that ted said beth said fish eating barnes nodded tina twisted the dials tuning it out they again heard the undifferentiated hiss the tension in the room lessened norman felt tired and sat down harry sat next to him norman noticed that harry looked more thoughtful than concerned across the room ted stood near the hatch door and bit his lip he looked like a frightened kid there was a soft electronic beep lines on the gasplasma screens jumped tina said i have a positive on peripheral thermals barnes nodded direction east coming they heard a metallic clank then another clank whats that the grid hes hitting the grid hitting it sounds like hes dismantling it norman remembered the grid it was made of threeinch pipe a big fish a shark beth said barnes shook his head hes not moving like a shark and hes too big tina said positive thermals on inline perimeter hes still coming barnes said go active the pong of the sonar echoed in the room tina said target acquired one hundred yards image him fas on sir there was a rapid succession of sonar sounds pong pong pong pong then a pause and it came again pong pong pong pong norman looked puzzled fletcher leaned over and whispered falseaperture sonar makes a detailed picture from several senders outside gives you a good look at him he smelled liquor on her breath he thought whered she get liquor pong pong pong pong building image ninety yards pong pong pong pong image up they turned to the screens norman saw an amorphous streaky blob it didnt mean much to him jesus barnes said look at the size of him pong pong pong pong eighty yards pong pong pong pong another image appeared now the blob was a different shape the streaks in another direction the image was sharper at the edges but it still meant nothing to norman a big blob with streaks jesus hes got to be thirty forty feet across barnes said no fish in the world is that big beth said whale its not a whale norman saw that harry was sweating harry took off his glasses and wiped them on his jumpsuit then he put them back on and pushed them up on the bridge of his nose they slipped back down he glanced at norman and shrugged tina fifty yards and closing pong pong pong pong thirty yards pong pong pong pong thirty yards pong pong pong pong holding at thirty yards sir pong pong pong pong still holding active off once again they heard the hiss of the hydrophones then a distinct clicking sound normans eyes burned sweat had rolled into his eyes he wiped his forehead with his jumpsuit sleeve the others were sweating too the tension was unbearable he glanced at the video monitor again the sphere was still closed he heard the hiss of the hydrophones a soft scraping sound like a heavy sack being dragged across a wooden floor then the hiss again tina whispered want to image him again no barnes said they listened more scraping a moment of silence followed by the gurgle of water very loud very close jesus barnes whispered hes right outside a dull thump against the side of the habitat the screen flashed on i am here the first impact came suddenly knocking them off their feet they tumbled rolling on the floor all around them the habitat creaked and groaned the sounds frighteningly loud norman scrambled to his feethe saw fletcher bleeding from her foreheadand the second impact hit norman was thrown sideways against the bulkhead there was a metallic clang as his head struck metal a sharp pain and then barnes landed on top of him grunting and cursing barnes pushed his hand in normans face as he struggled to his feet norman slid back to the floor and a video monitor crashed alongside him spitting sparks by now the habitat was swaying like a building in an earthquake they clutched consoles panels doorways to keep their balance but it was the noise that norman found most frighteningthe incredibly loud metallic groans and cracks as the cylinders were shaken on their moorings the creature was shaking the entire habitat barnes was on the far side of the room trying to make his way to the bulkhead door he had a bleeding gash along one arm and he was shouting orders but norman couldnt hear anything except the terrifying sound of rending metal he saw fletcher squeeze through the bulkhead and then tina and then barnes made it through leaving behind a bloody handprint on the metal norman couldnt see harry but beth lurched toward him holding her hand out saying norman norman we have to and then she slammed into him and he was knocked over and he fell onto the carpet underneath the couch and slid up against the cold outer wall of the cylinder and he realized with horror that the carpet was wet the habitat was leaking he had to do something he struggled back to his feet and stood right in a fine sizzling spray from one of the wall seams he glanced around saw other leaks spurting from the ceiling the walls this place is going to be torn apart beth grabbed him pulled her head close were leaking she shouted god were leaking i know norman said and barnes shouted over the intercom positive pressure get positive pressure norman saw ted on the floor just before he tripped over him and fell heavily against the computer consoles his face near the screen the glowing letters large before him do not be afraid jerry ted was shouting stop this jerry jerry suddenly harrys face was next to ted glasses askew save your breath hes going to kill us all he doesnt understand ted shouted as he fell backward onto the couch flailing arms the powerful wrenching of metal on metal continued without pause throwing norman from one side to the other he kept reaching for handholds but his hands were wet and he couldnt seem to grasp anything now hear this barnes said over the intercom chan and i are going outside fletcher assumes command dont go out harry shouted dont go out there opening hatch now barnes said laconically tina you follow me youll be killed harry shouted and then he was thrown against beth norman was on the floor again he banged his head on one of the couch legs were outside barnes said and abruptly the banging stopped the habitat was motionless they did not move with the water streaming in through a dozen fine misty leaks they looked up at the intercom speaker and listened clear of the hatch barnes said our status is good armament j exploding head spears loaded with taglin charges well show this bastard a trick or two silence water visibility is poor visibility under five feet seems to be stirredup bottom sediment and very black dark feeling our way along buildings silence north side going east now tina silence tina behind you sir all right put your hand on my tank so yougood okay silence inside the cylinder ted sighed i dont think they should kill it he said softly norman thought i dont think they can nobody else said anything they listened to the amplified breathing of barnes and tina northeast corner all right feel strong currents active moving water something nearby cant see visibility less than five feet can barely see stanchion i am holding i can feel him though hes big hes near tina silence a loud sharp crackling sound static then silence tina tina silence ive lost tina another very long silence i dont know what it tina if you can hear me stay where you are ill take it from here okay he is very close i feel him moving pushes a lot of water this guy a real monster silence again wish i could see better silence tina is that and then a muffled thud that might have been an explosion they all looked at each other trying to know what the sound meant but in the next instant the habitat began rocking and wrenching again and norman unprepared was slammed sideways against the sharp edge of the bulkhead door and the world went gray he saw harry strike the wall next to him and harrys glasses fell onto normans chest and norman reached for the glasses for harry because harry needed his glasses and then norman lost consciousness and everything was black after the attack hot spray poured over him and he inhaled steam standing in the shower norman looked down at his body and thought i look like a survivor of an airplane crash one of those people i used to see and marvel that they were still alive the lumps on his head throbbed his chest was scraped raw in a great swath down to his abdomen his left thigh was purplered his right hand was swollen and painful but then everything was painful he groaned turning his face up to the water hey harry called how about it in there okay norman stepped out and harry climbed in scrapes and bruises covered his thin body norman looked over at ted who lay on his back in one of the bunks ted had dislocated both shoulders and it had taken beth half an hour to get them back in even after shed shot him up with morphine how is it now norman said to him okay ted had a numb dull expression his ebullience was gone he had sustained a greater injury than the dislocated shoulders norman thought in many ways a naive child ted must have been profoundly shocked to discover that this alien intelligence was hostile hurt much norman said its okay norman sat slowly on his bunk feeling pain streak up his spine fiftythree years old he thought i should be playing golf then he thought i should be just about anywhere in the world except here he winced and gingerly slipped a shoe over his injured right foot for some reason he remembered levys bare toes the skin color dead the foot striking his faceplate did they find barnes ted asked i havent heard norman said i dont think so he finished dressing and went down to d cyl stepping over the puddles of water in the corridor inside d itself the furniture was soaked the consoles were wet and the walls were covered with irregular blobs of white urethane foam where fletcher had spraysealed the cracks fletcher stood in the middle of the room the spray can in hand not as pretty as it was she said will it hold sure but i guarantee you we cant survive another one of those attacks what about the electronics they working i havent checked but it should be okay its all waterproofed norman nodded any sign of captain barnes he looked at the bloody handprint on the wall no sir no sign of the captain at all fletcher followed his eyes to the wall ill clean the place up in a minute sir wheres tina norman asked resting in e cyl norman nodded e cyl any drier than this yes fletcher said its a funny thing there was nobody in e cyl during the attack and it stayed completely dry any word from jerry no contact sir no norman flicked on one of the computer consoles jerry are you there the screen remained blank jerry he waited a moment then turned the console off tina said look at it now she sat up and drew the blanket back to expose her left leg the injury was much worse than when they had heard her screaming and had run through the habitat and pulled her up through the a cyl hatch now running diagonally down her leg was a series of saucershaped welts the center of each puffed and purple its swollen a lot in the last hour tina said norman examined the injuries fine toothmarks ringed swollen areas do you remember what it felt like he said it felt awful tina said it felt sticky you know like sticky glue or something and then each one of these round places burned very strong and what could you see of the creature itself justit was a long flat spatulathing it looked like a giant leaf it came out and wrapped around me any color sort of brownish i couldnt really see he paused a moment and captain barnes during the course of the action i was separated from captain barnes sir i dont know what happened to captain barnes sir tina spoke formally her face a mask he thought lets not go into this now if you ran away its all right with me has beth seen this injury tina yes sir she was here a few minutes ago okay just rest now sir yes tina who will be making the report sir i dont know lets not worry about reports now lets just concentrate on getting through this yes sir as he approached beths lab he heard tinas recorded voice say do you think theyll ever get the sphere open beth said maybe i dont know it scares me and then tinas voice came again do you think theyll ever get the sphere open maybe i dont know it scares me in the lab beth was hunched over the console watching the tape still at it huh norman said yeah on the tape beth was finishing her cake saying i dont think theres a reason to be scared its the unknown tina said sure beth said onscreen but an unknown thing is not likely to be dangerous or frightening its most likely to be just inexplicable famous last words beth said watching herself it sounded good at the time norman said to keep her calmed down onscreen beth said to tina you afraid of snakes snakes dont bother me tina said well i cant stand snakes beth said beth stopped the tape turned to norman seems like a long time ago doesnt it i was just thinking that norman said does this mean were living life to the fullest i think it means were in mortal peril norman said why are you so interested in this tape because i have nothing better to do and if i dont keep busy im going to start screaming and make one of those traditional feminine scenes youve already seen me do it once norman have i i dont remember any scene thank you she said norman noticed a blanket on a couch in the corner of her lab and beth had unclipped one of the workbench lamps and mounted it on the wall above the blankets you sleeping here now yeah i like it here up at the top of the cylinderi feel like the queen of the underworld she smiled sort of like a tree house when you were a kid did you ever have a tree house when you were a kid no norman said i never did neither did i beth said but its what i imagine it would be if i had looks very cozy beth you think im cracking up no i just said it looks cozy you can tell me if you think im cracking up i think youre fine beth what about tina youve seen her injury yes beth frowned and ive seen these she gestured to some white eggs in a glass container on the lab bench more eggs they were clinging to tinas suit when she came back in her injury is consistent with these eggs also the smell you remember the smell when we pulled her back in norman remembered very well tina had smelled strongly of ammonia it was almost as if shed been doused in smelling salts beth said as far as i know theres only one animal that smells of ammonia that way architeuthis sanctipauli which is one of the species of giant squid thats what attacked us i think so yes she explained that little was known about the giant squid because the only specimens studied were dead animals that washed ashore generally in a state of advanced decay and reeking of ammonia for most of human history the giant squid was considered a mythical sea monster like the kraken but in the first reliable scientific reports appeared after a french warship managed to haul in fragments of one dead animal and many killed whales which showed scars from giant suckers testimony of undersea battles whales were the only known predator of the giant squidthe only animals large enough to be predators by now beth said giant squid have been observed in every major ocean of the world there are at least three distinct species the animals grow very large and can weigh a thousand pounds or more the head is about twenty feet long with a crown of eight arms each arm is about ten feet long with long rows of suckers in the center of the crown is a mouth with a sharp beak like a parrots beak except the jaws are seven inches long levys torn suit yes she nodded the beak is mounted in a ring of muscle so it can twist in circles as it bites and the radulathe tongue of the squidhas a raspy filelike surface tina mentioned something about a leaf a brown leaf the giant squid has two tentacles that extend out much further than the arms as long as forty feet each tentacle ends in a flattened manus or palm which looks very much like a big leaf the manus is what the squid really uses to catch prey the suckers on the manus are surrounded by a little hard ring of chitin which is why you see the circular toothmarks around the injury norman said how would you fight one well beth said in theory although giant squid are very large they are not particularly strong so much for theory norman said she nodded of course nobody knows how strong they are since a living specimen has never been encountered we have the dubious distinction of being first but it can be killed i would think rather easily the squids brain is located behind the eye which is about fifteen inches across the size of a big dinner plate if you directed an explosive charge into the animal anywhere in that area you would almost certainly disrupt the nervous system and it would die do you think barnes killed the squid she shrugged i dont know is there more than one in an area i dont know will we see one again i dont know the visitor norman went downstairs to the communications center to see if he could talk to jerry but jerry was not responding norman must have dozed off in the console chair because he looked up abruptly startled to see a trim black seaman in uniform standing just behind him looking over his shoulder at the screens hows it going sir the seaman asked he was very calm his uniform was crisply pressed norman felt a burst of tremendous elation this mans arrival at the habitat could mean only one thingthe surface ships must be back the ships had returned and the subs had been sent down to retrieve them they were all going to be saved sailor norman said pumping his hand im very damn glad to see you thank you sir when did you get here norman asked just now sir do the others know yet the others sir yes theres uh theres six of us left have they been told youre here i dont know the answer to that sir there was a flatness to this man that norman found odd the sailor was looking around the habitat and for a moment norman saw the environment through his eyesthe damp interior the wrecked consoles the foamspattered walls it looked like they had fought a war in here weve had a rough time norman said i can see that sir three of us have died im sorry to hear that sir that flatness again neutrality was he being proper was he worried about a pending courtmartial was it something else entirely where have you come from norman said come from sir what ship oh the sea hornet sir its topside now yes sir it is well lets get moving norman said tell the others youre here yes sir the seaman went away norman stood and shouted yahoo were saved at least he wasnt an illusion norman said staring at the screen there he is big as life on the monitor yes there he is but whered he go beth said for the last hour they had searched the habitat thoroughly there was no sign of the black crewman there was no sign of a submarine outside there was no evidence of surface ships the balloon they had sent up registered eightyknot winds and thirtyfoot waves before the wire snapped so where had he come from and where had he gone fletcher was working the consoles a screen of data came up how about this log of ships in active service shows no vessel currently designated sea hornet norman said what the hell is going on here maybe he was an illusion ted said illusions dont register on videotape harry said besides i saw him too you did norman said yeah i had just woken up and i had had this dream about being rescued and i was lying in bed when i heard footsteps and he walked into the room did you talk to him yes but he was funny he was dull kind of boring norman nodded you could tell something wasnt right about him yes you could but where did he come from beth said i can think of only one possibility ted said he came from the sphere or at least he was made by the sphere by jerry why would jerry do that to spy on us ted shook his head ive been thinking about this he said it seems to me that jerry has the ability to create things animals i dont think that jerry is a giant squid but jerry created the giant squid that attacked us i dont think jerry wants to attack us but from what beth was telling us once he made the squid then the squid might attack the habitat thinking the cylinders were its mortal enemy the whale so the attack happened as a kind of accident of creation they frowned listening to norman the explanation was entirely too convenient i think there is another possibility that jerry is hostile i dont believe that ted said i dont believe jerry is hostile he certainly acts hostile ted but i dont think he intends to be hostile whatever he intends fletcher said we better not go through another attack because the structure cant take it and neither can the support systems after the first attack i had to increase positive pressure fletcher said in order to fix the leaks to keep water from coming in i had to increase the pressure of the air inside the habitat to make it greater than the pressure of the water outside that stopped the leaks but it meant that air bubbled out through all the cracks and one hour of repair work consumed nearly sixteen hours of our reserve air ive been worried well run out of air there was a pause they all considered the implications of that to compensate fletcher said ive dropped the internal pressure by three centimeters pressure were slightly negative right now and we should be fine our air will last us but another attack under these conditions and well crush like a beer can norman didnt like hearing any of this but at the same time he was impressed with fletchers competence she was a resource they ought to be using he thought do you have any suggestions teeny if theres another attack well we have something in cyl b called hvds which is high voltage defense system theres a little box in b that electrifies the metal walls of the cylinders at all times to prevent electrolytic corrosion very slight electrical charge you arent really aware of it anyway theres another green box attached to that one and its the hvds its basically a lowamp stepup transformer that sends two million volts over the cylinder surface should be very unpleasant for any animal why didnt we use it before beth said why didnt barnes use it instead of risking because the green box has problems fletcher said for one thing its really sort of theoretical as far as i know its never actually been used in a real undersea work situation yes but it must have been tested yes and in all the tests it started fires inside the habitat another pause while they considered that finally norman said bad fires the fires tend to burn the insulation the wall padding the fires take the padding off wed die of heat loss in a few minutes beth said how bad can a fire be fires need oxygen to burn and weve only got two percent oxygen down here thats true dr halpern fletcher said but the actual oxygen percentage varies the habitat is made to deliver pulses as high as sixteen percent for brief periods four times an hour its all automatically controlled you cant override it and if the oxygen percentage is high then fires burn just finethree times faster than topside they easily go out of control norman looked around the cylinder he spotted three fire extinguishers mounted on the walls now that he thought about it there were extinguishers all over the habitat hed just never really paid attention before even if we get the fires under control theyre hell on the systems fletcher said the air handlers arent made to take the added monoxide byproducts and soot so what do we do last resort only fletcher said thatd be my recommendation the group looked at each other nodded okay norman said last resort only lets just hope we dont have another attack another attack there was a long silence as they considered that then the gasplasma screens on tinas console jumped and a soft pinging filled the room we have a contact on peripheral thermals tina said in a flat voice where fletcher said north approaching and on the monitor they saw the words i am coming they turned off both the interior and exterior lights norman peered through the porthole straining to see out in the darkness they had long ago learned that the darkness at this depth was not absolute the waters of the pacific were so clear that even a thousand feet down some light registered on the bottom it was very slightedmunds had compared it to starlightbut norman knew that on the surface you could see by starlight alone now he cupped his hands by the sides of his face to block out the low light coming from tinas consoles waited for his eyes to adjust behind him tina and fletcher were working with the monitors he heard the hiss of the hydrophones in the room it was all happening again ted was standing by the monitor saying jerry can you hear me jerry are you listening but he wasnt getting through beth came up as norman peered out the porthole you see anything not yet behind them tina said eighty yards and closing sixty yards you want sonar no sonar fletcher said nothing to make ourselves interesting to him then should we kill the electronics kill everything all the console lights went out now there was just the red glow of the space heaters above them they sat in darkness and stared out norman tried to remember how long darkvision accommodation required he remembered it might be as long as three minutes he began to see shapes the outline of the grid on the bottom and dimly the high fin of the spaceship rising sharply up then something else a green glow in the distance at the horizon its like a green sunrise beth said the glow increased in intensity and then they saw an amorphous green shape with lateral streaks norman thought its just like the image we saw before it looks just like that he couldnt really make out the details is it a squid he said yes beth said i cant see youre looking at it endon the body is toward us the tentacles behind partially blocked by the body thats why you cant see it the squid grew larger it was definitely coming toward them ted ran from the portholes back to the consoles jerry are you listening jerry electronics are off dr fielding fletcher said well lets try and talk to him for gods sake i think were past the talking stage now sir the squid was faintly luminous the entire body a deep green now norman could see a sharp vertical ridge in the body the moving tentacles and arms were clear the outline grew larger the squid moved laterally its going around the grid yes beth said theyre intelligent animals they have the ability to learn from experience it probably didnt like hitting the grid before and it remembers the squid passed the spacecraft fin and they could gauge its size its as big as a house norman thought the creature slid smoothly through the water toward them he felt a sense of awe despite his pounding heart jerry jerry save your breath ted thirty yards tina said still coming as the squid came closer norman could count the arms and he saw the two long tentacles glowing lines extending far beyond the body the arms and tentacles seemed to move loosely in the water while the body made rhythmic muscular contractions the squid propelled itself with water and did not use the arms for swimming twenty yards god its big harry said you know beth said were the first people in human history to see a freeswimming giant squid this should be a great moment they heard the gurgling the rush of water over the hydrophones as the squid came closer ten yards for a moment the great creature turned sideways to the habitat and they could see its profilethe enormous glowing body thirty feet long with the huge unblinking eye the circle of arms waving like evil snakes the two long tentacles each terminating in a flattened leafshaped section the squid continued to turn until its arms and tentacles stretched toward the habitat and they glimpsed the mouth the sharpedged chomping beak in a mass of glowing green muscle oh god the squid moved forward they could see each other in the glow through the portholes its starting norman thought its starting and this time we cant survive it there was a thump as a tentacle swung against the habitat jerry ted shouted his voice was high strained with tension the squid paused the body moved laterally and they could see the huge eye staring at them jerry listen to me the squid appeared to hesitate hes listening ted shouted and he grabbed a flashlight off a wall bracket and shined it out the porthole he blinked the light once the great body of the squid glowed green then went momentarily dark then glowed green again hes listening beth said of course hes listening hes intelligent ted blinked his light twice in rapid succession the squid blinked back twice how can he do that norman said its a kind of skin cell called a chromatophore beth said the animal can open and close these cells at will and block the light ted blinked three times the squid blinked three times he can do it fast norman said yes fast hes intelligent ted said i keep telling you hes intelligent and he wants to talk ted blinked long short short the squid matched the pattern thats a baby ted said you just keep talking to me jerry he flashed a more complex pattern and the squid answered but then moved off to the left ive got to keep him talking ted said as the squid moved ted moved skipping from porthole to porthole shining his light the squid still blinked its glowing body in reply but norman sensed it had another purpose now they all followed ted from d into c cyl ted flashed his light the squid answered but still moved onward whats he doing maybe hes leading us why they went to b cyl where the lifesupport equipment was located but there were no portholes in b ted moved on to a the airlock there were no portholes here either ted immediately jumped down and opened the hatch in the floor revealing dark water careful ted im telling you hes intelligent ted said the water at his feet glowed a soft green here he comes now they could not see the squid yet only the glow ted blinked his light into the water the green blinked back still talking ted said and as long as hes talking with stunning swiftness the tentacle smashed up through the open water and swung in a great arc around the airlock norman had a glimpse of a glowing stalk as thick as a mans body and a great glowing leaf five feet long swinging blindly past him and as he ducked he saw it hit beth and knock her sideways tina was screaming in terror strong ammonia fumes burned their eyes the tentacle swung back toward norman he held up his hands to protect himself touched slimy cold flesh as the giant arm spun him slammed him against the airlocks metal walls the animal was incredibly strong get out everybody out away from the metal fletcher was shouting ted was scrambling up away from the hatch and the twisting arm and he had almost reached the door when the leaf swung back and wrapped around him covering most of his body ted grunted pushed at the leaf with his hands his eyes were wide with horror norman ran forward but harry grabbed him leave him you cant do anything now ted was being swung back and forth in the air across the airlock banging from wall to wall his head dropped blood ran down his forehead onto the glowing tentacle still the arm swung him back and forth the cylinder ringing like a gong with each impact get out fletcher was shouting everybody out beth scrambled past them harry tugged at norman just as the second tentacle burst above the surface to hold ted in a pincer grip off the metal damn it off the metal fletcher was shouting and they stepped onto the carpet of b cyl and she threw the switch on the green box and there was a hum from the generators and the red heater banks dimmed as two million volts of electricity surged through the habitat the response was instantaneous the floor rocked under their feet as the habitat was struck by an enormous force and norman swore he heard a scream though it might have been rending metal and the tentacles quickly drew down out of the airlock they had a last glimpse of teds body as it was pulled into the inky water and fletcher yanked down the lever on the green box but the alarms had already begun to sound and the warning boards lit up fire fletcher shouted fire in e cyl fletcher gave them gas masks normans kept slipping down his forehead obscuring his vision by the time they reached d cylinder the smoke was dense they coughed and stumbled banged into the consoles stay low tina shouted dropping to her knees she was leading the way fletcher had stayed behind in b up ahead an angry red glow outlined the bulkhead door leading to e tina grabbed an extinguisher and went through the door norman right behind her at first he thought the entire cylinder was burning fierce flames licked up the side padding dense clouds of smoke boiled toward the ceiling the heat was almost palpable tina swung the extinguisher cylinder around began to spray white foam in the light of the fire norman saw another extinguisher grabbed it but the metal was burning hot and he dropped it to the floor fire in d fletcher said over the intercom fire in d jesus norman thought despite the mask he coughed in the acrid smoke he picked the extinguisher off the floor and began to spray it immediately became cooler tina shouted to him but he heard nothing except the roar of the flames he and tina were getting the fire out but there was still a large burning patch near one porthole he turned away spraying the floor burning at his feet he was unprepared for the explosion the concussion pounding his ears painfully he turned and saw that a firehose had been unleashed in the room and then he realized that one of the small portholes had blown or burned out and the water was rushing in with incredible force he couldnt see tina then he saw she had been knocked down she got to her feet shouting something at norman and then she slipped and slid back into the hissing stream of water it picked her up bodily and flung her so hard against the opposite wall that he knew at once she must be dead and when he looked down he saw her floating facedown in the water rapidly filling the room the back of her head was cut open he saw the pulpy red flesh of her brain norman turned and fled water was already trickling over the lip of the bulkhead as he slammed the heavy door shut spun the wheel to lock it he couldnt see anything in d the smoke was worse than before he saw dim patches of red flame hazy through the smoke he heard the hiss of the extinguishers where was his own extinguisher he must have left it in e like a blind man he felt along the walls for another extinguisher coughing in the smoke his eyes and lungs burned despite the mask and then with a great groan of metal the pounding started the habitat rocking under jolts from the squid outside he heard fletcher on the intercom but her voice was scratchy and unclear the pounding continued and the horrible wrenching of metal and norman thought were going to die this time were going to die he couldnt find a fire extinguisher but his hands touched something metal on the wall and norman felt it in the smoky darkness wondering what it was some kind of protrusion and then two million volts surged through his limbs into his body and he screamed once and fell backward aftermath he was staring at a bank of lights in some odd angled perspective he sat up feeling a sharp pain and looked around him he was sitting on the floor in d cylinder a faint smoky haze hung in the air the padded walls were blackened and charred in several places there must have been a fire here he thought staring at the damage in astonishment when had this happened where had he been at the time he got slowly to one knee and then to his feet he turned to e cylinder but for some reason the bulkhead door to e was shut he tried to spin the wheel to unlock it it was jammed shut he didnt see anybody else where were the others then he remembered something about ted ted had died the squid swinging teds body in the airlock and then fletcher had said to get back and she had thrown the power switch it was starting to come back to him the fire there had been a fire in e cylinder he had gone into e with tina to put out the fire he remembered going into the room seeing the flames lick up the side of the walls after that he wasnt sure where were the others for an awful moment he thought he was the only survivor but then he heard a cough in c cyl he moved toward the sound he didnt see anybody so he went to b cyl fletcher wasnt there there was a large streak of blood on the metal pipes and one of her shoes on the carpet that was all another cough from among the pipes fletcher just a minute beth emerged greasestreaked from the pipes good youre up ive got most of the systems going i think thank god the navy has instructions printed on the housings anyway the smokes clearing and the air quality is reading all rightnot great but all rightand all the vital stuff seems to be intact we have air and water and heat and power im trying to find out how much power and air we have left wheres fletcher i cant find her anywhere beth pointed to the shoe on the carpet and the streak of blood tina norman asked he was alarmed at the prospect of being trapped down here without any navy people at all tina was with you beth said frowning i dont seem to remember norman said you probably got a jolt of current beth said that would give you retrograde amnesia you wont remember the last few minutes before the shock i cant find tina either but according to the status sensors e cyl is flooded and shut down you were with her in e i dont know why it flooded what about harry he got a jolt too i think youre lucky the amperage wasnt higher or youd both be fried anyway hes lying on the floor in c either sleeping or unconscious you might want to take a look at him i didnt want to risk moving him so i just left him there did he wake up talk to you no but he seems to be breathing comfortably colors good all that anyway i thought i better get the lifesupport systems going she wiped grease on her cheek i mean its just the three of us now norman you me and harry thats right you me and harry harry was sleeping peacefully on the floor between the bunks norman bent down lifted one eyelid shone a light in harrys pupil the pupil contracted this cant be heaven harry said why not norman said he shone the light in the other pupil it contracted because youre here they dont let psychologists into heaven he gave a weak smile can you move your toes your hands i can move everything i walked up here norman from down in c im okay norman sat back im glad youre okay harry he meant it he had been dreading the thought of an injury to harry from the beginning of the expedition they had all relied on harry at every critical juncture he had supplied the breakthrough the necessary understanding and even now norman took comfort in the thought that if beth couldnt figure out the lifesupport systems harry could yeah im okay he closed his eyes again sighed whos left beth me you jesus yeah you want to get up yeah ill get in the bunk im real tired norman i could sleep for a year norman helped him to his feet harry dropped quickly onto the nearest bunk okay if i sleep for a while sure thats good im real tired norman i could sleep for a year yes you said that he broke off harry was snoring norman reached over to remove something crumpled on the pillow beneath harrys head it was ted fieldings notebook norman suddenly felt overwhelmed he sat on his bunk holding the notebook in his hands finally he looked at a couple of pages filled with teds large enthusiastic scrawl a photograph fell onto his lap he turned it over it was a photo of a red corvette and the feelings just overwhelmed him norman didnt know if he was crying for ted or crying for himself because it was clear to him that one by one they were all dying down here he was very sad and very afraid beth was in d cyl at the communications console turning on all the monitors they did a pretty good job with this place she said everything is marked everything has instructions therere computer help files an idiot could figure it out theres just one problem that i can see whats that the galley was in e cyl and e cyl is flooded weve got no food norman none at all i dont think so water yes plenty of water but no food well we can make it without food how much longer have we got down here it looks like two more days we can make it norman said thinking two days jesus two more days in this place thats assuming the storm clears on schedule beth added ive been trying to figure out how to release a surface balloon and see what its like up there tina used to punch some special code to release a balloon we can make it norman said again oh sure if worse comes to worst we can always get food from the spaceship theres plenty over there you think we can risk going outside well have to she said glancing at the screens sometime in the next three hours why the minisub it has that automatic surfacing timer unless someone goes over and punches the button the hell with the sub norman said let the sub go well dont be too hasty beth said that sub can hold three people you mean we could all get out of here in it yeah thats what i mean christ norman said lets go now there are two problems with that beth said she pointed to the screens ive been going over the specs first the sub is unstable on the surface if there are big waves on the surface itll bounce us around worse than anything weve had down here and the second thing is that we have to link up with a decompression chamber on the surface dont forget we still have ninetysix hours of decompression ahead of us and if we dont decompress norman said he was thinking lets just go to the surface in the sub and throw open the hatch and see the clouds and the sky and breathe some normal earth air we have to decompress beth said your bloodstream is saturated with helium gas in solution right now youre under pressure so everything is fine but if you release that pressure suddenly its just the same as when you pop the top off a soda bottle the helium will bubble explosively out of your system youll die instantly oh norman said ninetysix hours beth said thats how long it takes to get the helium out of you oh norman went to the porthole and looked across at dh and the minisub it was a hundred yards away you think the squid will come back she shrugged ask jerry norman thought no more of that geraldine stuff now or did she prefer to think of this malevolent entity as masculine which monitor is it this one she flicked it on the screen glowed norman said jerry are you there no answer he typed jerry are you there there was no response ill tell you something about jerry beth said he cant really read minds when we were talking to him before i sent him a thought and he didnt respond i did too norman said i sent both messages and images he never responded if we speak he answers but if we just think he doesnt answer beth said so hes not allpowerful he actually behaves as if he hears us thats right norman said although he doesnt seem to be hearing us now no i tried earlier too i wonder why he isnt answering you said he was emotional maybe hes sulking norman didnt think so child kings didnt sulk they were vindictive and whimsical but they didnt sulk by the way she said you might want to look at these she handed him a stack of printouts theyre the record of all the interactions weve had with him they may give us a clue norman said thumbing through the sheets without any real enthusiasm he felt suddenly tired anyway itll occupy your mind true personally beth said id like to go back to the ship what for im not convinced weve found everything thats there its a long way to the ship norman said i know but if we get a clear time without the squid i might try it just to occupy your mind i guess you could say that she glanced at her watch norman im going to get a couple of hours of sleep she said then we can draw straws to see who goes to the submarine okay you seem depressed norman i am me too she said this place feels like a tomband ive been prematurely buried she climbed the ladder to her laboratory but apparently she didnt go to sleep because after a few moments he heard tinas recorded voice on videotape saying do you think theyll ever get the sphere open and beth replied maybe i dont know it scares me the whirr of rewinding and a short delay then do you think theyll ever get the sphere open maybe i dont know it scares me the tape was becoming an obsession with beth he stared at the printouts on his lap and then he looked at the screen jerry he said are you there jerry did not answer the sub she was shaking his shoulder gently norman opened his eyes its time beth said okay he yawned god he was tired how much time is left half an hour beth switched on the sensory array at the communications console adjusted the settings you know how to work all that stuff norman said the sensors pretty well ive been learning it then i should go to the sub he said he knew beth would never agree that she would insist on doing the active thing but he wanted to make the effort okay she said you go that makes sense he covered his surprise i think so too somebody has to watch the array she said and i can give you warning if the squid is coming right he said thinking hell shes serious i dont think this is one for harry norman said no harrys not very physical and hes still asleep i say let him sleep right norman said youll need help with your suit beth said oh thats right my suit norman said the fan is broken in my suit fletcher fixed it for you beth said i hope she did it right maybe i should go instead beth said no no you watch the consoles ill go its only a hundred yards or so anyway it cant be a big deal all clear now she said glancing at the monitors right norman said his helmet clicked in place and beth tapped his faceplate gave him a questioning look was everything all right norman nodded and she opened the floor hatch for him he waved goodbye and jumped into the chilly black water on the sea floor he stood beneath the hatch for a moment and waited to make sure he could hear his circulating fan then he moved out from beneath the habitat there were only a few lights on in the habitat and he could see many thin lines of bubbles streaming upward from the leaking cylinders how are you beth said over the intercom okay you know the place is leaking it looks worse than it is beth said trust me norman came to the edge of the habitat and looked across the hundred yards of open sea floor that separated him from dh how does it look still clear still clear beth said norman set out he walked as quickly as he could but he felt as if his feet were moving in slow motion he was soon short of breath he swore whats the matter i cant go fast he kept looking north expecting at any moment to see the greenish glow of the approaching squid but the horizon remained dark youre doing fine norman still clear he was now fifty yards from the habitathalfway there he could see dh much smaller than their own habitat a single cylinder forty feet high with very few portholes alongside it was the inverted dome and the minisub youre almost there beth said good work norman began to feel dizzy he slowed his pace he could now see markings on the gray surface of the habitat there were all sorts of blockprinted navy stencils coast is still clear beth said congratulations looks like you made it he moved under the dh cylinder looked up at the hatch it was closed he spun the wheel pushed it open he couldnt see much of the interior because most of the lights were out but he wanted to have a look inside there might be something some weapon they could use sub first beth said youve only got ten minutes to push the button right norman moved to the sub standing behind the twin screws he read the name deepstar iii the sub was yellow like the sub that he had ridden down but its configuration was somewhat different he found handholds on the side pulled himself up into the pocket of air trapped inside the dome there was a large acrylic bubble canopy on top of the sub for the pilot norman found the hatch behind opened it and dropped inside im in the sub there was no answer from beth she probably couldnt hear him surrounded by all this metal he looked around the sub thinking im dripping wet but what was he supposed to do wipe his shoes before entering he smiled at the thought he found the tapes secured in an aft compartment there was plenty of room for more and plenty of room for three people but beth was right about going to the surface the interior of the sub was crammed with instruments and sharp edges if you got banged around in here it wouldnt be pleasant where was the delay button he looked at the darkened instrument panel and saw a single flashing red light above a button marked timer hold he pressed the button the red light stopped flashing and now remained steadily on a small amber video screen glowed timer reset counting as he watched the numbers began to run backward he must have done it he thought the video screen switched off still looking at all the instruments a thought occurred to him in an emergency could he operate this sub he slipped into the pilots chair faced the bewildering dials and switches of the instrument array there didnt seem to be any steering apparatus no wheel or joystick how did you work the damned thing the video screen switched on deepstar iii command module do you require help yes no cancel yes he thought i require help he looked around for a yes button near the screen but there wasnt any that he could see finally he thought to touch the screen pressing yes deepstar iii checklist options descend ascend secure shutdown monitor cancel he pressed ascend the screen changed to a small drawing of the instrument panel one particular section of the drawing blinked on and off beneath the picture were the words deepstar iii ascend checklist set ballast blowers to on proceed to next cancel so that was how it worked norman thought a stepbystep checklist stored in the subs computer all you had to do was follow directions he could do that a small surge of current moved the sub swaying it at its tether he pressed the cancel and the screen went blank it flashed timer reset counting the counter was still running backward he thought have i really been here seven minutes another surge of current and the sub swayed again it was time to go he moved to the hatch climbed out into the dome and closed the hatch he lowered himself down the side of the sub touched the bottom out from beneath the shielding metal his radio immediately crackled you there norman are you there answer please it was harry on the radio im here norman said norman for gods sake in that moment norman saw the greenish glow and he knew why the sub had surged and rocked at its moorings the squid was just ten yards away its glowing tentacles writhing out toward him churning up the sediment along the ocean floor norman will you there was no time to think norman took three steps jumped and pulled himself through the open hatch into dh he slammed the hatch door down behind him but the flat spadelike tentacle was already reaching in he pinned the tentacle in the partially closed hatch but the tentacle didnt withdraw it was incredibly strong and muscular writhing as he watched the suckers like small puckered mouths opening and closing norman stomped down on the hatch trying to force the tentacle to withdraw with a muscular flip the hatch flew open knocking him backward and the tentacle reached up into the habitat he smelled the strong odor of ammonium norman fled climbing higher into the cylinder the second tentacle appeared splashing up through the hatch the two tentacles swung in circles beneath him searching he came to a porthole and looked out saw the great body of the animal the huge round staring eye he clambered higher getting away from the tentacles most of the cylinder seemed to be given over to storage it was crammed with equipment boxes tanks many of the boxes were bright red with stencils caution no smoking no electronics tevac explosives there were a hell of a lot of explosives in here he thought stumbling upward the tentacles rose higher behind him somewhere in a detached logical part of his brain he thought the cylinder is only forty feet high and the tentacles are at least forty feet long there will be no place for me to hide he stumbled banged his knee kept going he heard the slap of the tentacles as they struck the walls swung upward toward him a weapon he thought i have to find a weapon he came to the small galley metal counter some pots and pans he pulled the drawers open hastily looking for a knife he could find only a small paring knife threw it away in disgust he heard the tentacles coming closer the next moment he was knocked down his helmet banging on the deck norman scrambled to his feet dodged the tentacle moved up the cylinder a communications section radio set computer a couple of monitors the tentacles were right behind him slithering up like nightmarish vines his eyes burned from the ammonia fumes he came to the bunks a narrow space near the top of the cylinder no place to hide he thought no weapons and no place to hide the tentacles reached the top of the cylinder slapped against the upper curved surface swung sideways in a moment they would have him he grabbed the mattress from one bunk held it up as flimsy protection the two tentacles were swinging erratically around him he dodged the first and then with a whump the second tentacle coiled around him holding both him and the mattress in a cold slimy grip he felt a sickening slow squeeze the dozens of suckers gripping his body cutting into his skin he moaned in horror the second tentacle swung back to grip him along with the first he was trapped in a vise oh god he thought the tentacles swung away from the wall lifting him high in the air into the middle of the cylinder this is it he thought but in the next moment he felt his body sliding downward past the mattress and he slipped through the grip and fell through the air he grabbed the tentacles for support sliding down the giant evilsmelling vines and then he crashed down onto the deck near the galley his head banging on the metal deck he rolled onto his back he saw the two tentacles above gripping the mattress squeezing it twisting it did the squid realize what had happened that he had gotten free norman looked around desperately a weapon a weapon this was a navy habitat there must be a weapon somewhere the tentacles tore the mattress apart shreds of white padding drifted down through the cylinder the tentacles released the mattress the big pieces falling then the tentacles started swinging around the habitat again searching it knows he thought it knows i have gotten away and that i am still in here somewhere it is hunting me but how did it know norman ducked behind the galley as one of the flat tentacles came crashing through the pots and pans sweeping around feeling for him norman scrambled back coming up against a large potted plant the tentacle was still searching moving restlessly across the floor banging the pans norman pushed the plant forward and the tentacle gripped it uprooted it easily sweeping it away into the air the distraction allowed norman to scramble forward a weapon he thought a weapon he looked down to where the mattress had fallen and he saw lining the wall near the bottom hatch a series of silver vertical bars spear guns somehow he had missed them on the way up each spear gun was tipped in a fat bulb like a hand grenade explosive tips he started to climb down the tentacles were sliding down too following him how did the squid know where he was and then as he passed a porthole he saw the eye outside and he thought he can see me for gods sake stay away from the portholes not thinking clearly everything happening fast crawling down past the explosive crates in the storage hold thinking i better not miss in here and he landed with a clang on the airlock deck the arms were slithering down moving down the cylinder toward him he tugged at one of the spear guns it was strapped to the wall with a rubber cord norman pulled at it tried to release it the tentacles drew closer he yanked at the rubber but it wouldnt release what was wrong with these snaps the tentacles were closer coming down swiftly then he realized the cords had safety catches you had to pull the guns sideways not out he did the rubber popped free the spear gun was in his hand he turned and the tentacle knocked him down he flipped onto his back and saw the great flat suckered palm of the tentacle coming straight down on him and the tentacle wrapped over his helmet everything was black and he fired there was tremendous pain in his chest and abdomen for a horrified moment he thought he had shot himself then he gasped and he realized it was just the concussion his chest was burning but the squid released him he still couldnt see he pulled the palm off his face and it fell heavily onto the deck writhing severed from the squid arm the interior walls of the habitat were splattered with blood one tentacle was still moving the other was a bloody ragged stump both arms pulled out through the hatch slipped into the water norman ran for the porthole the squid moved swiftly away the green glow diminishing he had done it hed beaten it off hed done it dh how many did you bring harry said turning the spear gun over in his hands five norman said that was all i could carry but it worked he was examining the bulbous explosive tip yeah it worked blew the whole tentacle off i saw the squid going away harry said i figured you must have done something wheres beth i dont know her suits gone i think she may have gone to the ship gone to the ship norman said frowning all i know is when i woke up she was gone i figured you were over at the habitat and then i saw the squid and i tried to get you on the radio but i guess the metal blocked the transmission beth left norman said he was starting to get angry beth was supposed to stay at the communications console watching the sensors for him while he was outside instead she had gone to the ship her suits gone harry said again son of a bitch norman said he was suddenly furiousreally deeply furious he kicked the console careful there harry said damn it take it easy harry said come on take it easy norman what the hell does she think shes doing come on sit down norman harry steered him to a chair were all tired damn right were tired easy norman easy remember your blood pressure my blood pressures fine not now its not harry said youre purple how could she let me go outside and then just leave worse go out herself harry said but she wasnt watching out for me any more norman said and then it came to him why he was so angryhe was angry because he was afraid at a moment of great personal danger beth had abandoned him there were only three of them left down there and they needed each otherthey needed to depend on each other but beth was unreliable and that made him afraid and angry can you hear me her voice said on the intercom anybody hear me norman reached for the microphone but harry snatched it away ill do this he said yes beth we can hear you im in the ship she said her voice crackling on the intercom ive found another compartment aft behind the crew bunks its quite interesting quite interesting norman thought jesus quite interesting he grabbed the microphone from harry beth what the hell are you doing over there oh hi norman you made it back okay huh barely you have some trouble she didnt sound concerned yes i did are you all right you sound mad you bet im mad beth why did you leave while i was out there harry said hed take over for me he what norman looked at harry harry was shaking his head no harry said hed take over at the console for me he told me to go ahead to the ship since the squid wasnt around it seemed like a good time norman cupped his hand over microphone i dont the remember that harry said did you talk to her i dont remember talking to her beth said just ask him norman hell tell you he says he never said that well then hes full of it beth said what do you think id abandon you when you were outside for christs sake there was a pause id never do that norman i swear harry said to norman i never had any conversation with beth i never talked to her at all im telling you she was gone when i woke up there was nobody here if you ask me she always intended to go to the ship norman remembered how quickly beth had agreed to let norman go to the sub how surprised he had been perhaps harry was right he thought perhaps beth had been planning it all along you know what i think harry said i think shes cracking up over the intercom beth said you guys get it straightened out norman said i think so beth yes good beth said because i have made a discovery over here in the spaceship whats that ive found the crew you both came beth said she was sitting on a console in the comfortable beige flight deck of the spacecraft yes norman said looking at her she looked okay if anything she looked better than ever stronger clearer she actually looked rather beautiful he thought harry thought that the squid wouldnt come back the squid was out there norman briefly told her about his attack jesus im sorry norman id never have left if i had any idea she certainly didnt sound like somebody who was cracking up norman thought she sounded appropriate and sincere anyway he said i injured it and harry thought it wouldnt come back harry said and we couldnt decide who should stay behind so we both came well come this way beth said she led them back through the crew quarters past the twenty bunks for the crew the large galley norman paused at the galley so did harry im hungry harry said eat something beth said i did they have some sort of nut bars or something they taste okay she opened a drawer in the galley produced bars wrapped in metal foil gave them each one norman tore the foil and saw something that looked like chocolate it tasted dry anything to drink sure she threw open a refrigerator door diet coke youre kidding the can design is different and im afraid its warm but its diet coke all right im buying stock in that company harry said now that we know itll still be there in fifty years he read the can official drink of the star voyager expedition yeah its a promo beth said harry turned the can around the other side was printed in japanese wonder what this means it means dont buy that stock after all she said norman sipped the coke with a sense of vague unease the galley seemed subtly changed from the last time he had seen it he wasnt surehed only glanced briefly at the room beforebut he usually had a good memory for room layouts and his wife had always joked that norman could find his way around any kitchen you know he said i dont remember a refrigerator in the galley i never really noticed myself beth said as a matter of fact norman said this whole room looks different to me it looks bigger andi dont knowdifferent its cause youre hungry harry grinned maybe norman said harry could actually be right in the sixties there had been a number of studies of visual perception which demonstrated that subjects interpreted blurred slides according to their predispositions hungry people saw all the slides as food but this room really did look different for instance he didnt remember the door to the galley being to the left as it was now he remembered it as being in the center of the wall separating the galley from the bunks this way beth said leading them farther aft actually the refrigerator was what got me thinking its one thing to store a lot of food on a test ship being sent through a black hole but to stock a refrigeratorwhy bother to do that it made me think there might be a crew after all they entered a short glasswalled tunnel deeppurple lights glowed down on them ultraviolet beth said i dont know what its for disinfection maybe maybe its to get a suntan harry said vitamin d then they came into a large room unlike anything norman had ever seen the floor glowed purple bathing the room in ultraviolet light from beneath mounted on all four walls were a series of wide glass tubes inside each tube was a narrow silver mattress the tubes all appeared empty over here beth said they peered through one glass tube the naked woman had once been beautiful it was still possible to see that her skin was dark brown and deeply wrinkled her body withered mummified harry said beth nodded best i can figure out i havent opened the tube considering the risk of infection what was this room he said looking around it must be some kind of hibernation chamber each tube is separately connected to a lifesupport systempower supply air handlers heaters the worksin the next room harry counted twenty tubes he said and twenty bunks norman said so where is everybody else beth shook her head i dont know this woman is the only one left looks like it i havent found any others i wonder how they all died harry said have you been to the sphere norman asked beth no why just wondered you mean you wondered if the crew died after they picked up the sphere basically yes i dont think the sphere is aggressive or dangerous in any sense beth said its possible that the crew died of natural causes in the course of the journey itself this woman for example is so well preserved it makes you wonder about radiation maybe she got a large dose of radiation theres tremendous radiation around a black hole you think the crew died going through the black hole and the sphere was picked up automatically by the spacecraft later its possible shes pretty goodlooking harry said peering through the glass boy the reporters would go crazy with this wouldnt they sexy woman from the future found nude and mummified film at eleven shes tall too norman said she must be over six feet an amazon woman harry said with great tits all right beth said whats wrongoffended on her behalf harry said i dont think theres any need for comments of that kind actually beth harry said she looks a little like you beth frowned im serious have you looked at her dont be ridiculous norman peered through the glass shielding his hand against the reflection of the purple uv tubes in the floor the mummified woman did indeed look like bethyounger taller stronger but like beth nevertheless hes right norman said maybe shes you from the future harry said no shes obviously in her twenties maybe shes your granddaughter pretty unlikely beth said you never know harry said does jennifer look like you not really but shes at that awkward stage and she doesnt look like that woman and neither do i norman was struck by the conviction with which beth denied any resemblance or association to the mummified woman beth he said what do you suppose happened here why is this woman the only one left i think she was important to the expedition beth said maybe even the captain or the cocaptain the others were mostly men and they did something foolishi dont know whatsomething she advised them againstand as a result they all died she alone remained alive in this spacecraft and she piloted it home but there was something wrong with hersomething she couldnt helpand she died what was wrong with her i dont know something fascinating norman thought hed never really considered it before but this roomfor that matter this entire spacecraftwas one big rorschach or more accurately a tat the thematic apperception test was a psychological test that consisted of a series of ambiguous pictures subjects were supposed to tell what they thought was happening in the pictures since no clear story was implied by the pictures the subjects supplied the stories and the stories told much more about the storytellers than about the pictures now beth was telling them her fantasy about this room that a woman had been in charge of the expedition the men had failed to listen to her they had died and she alone had remained alive the sole survivor it didnt tell them much about this spaceship but it told them a lot about beth i get it harry said you mean shes the one who made the mistake and piloted the ship back too far into the past typical woman driver do you have to make a joke of everything do you have to take everything so seriously this is serious beth said ill tell you a different story harry said this woman screwed up she was supposed to do something and she forgot to do it or else she made a mistake and then she went into hibernation as a result of her mistake the rest of the crew died and she never woke up from the hibernationnever realized what she had done because she was so unaware of what was really happening im sure you like that story better beth said it fits with your typical blackmale contempt for women easy norman said you resent the power of the female beth said what power you call lifting weights power thats only strengthand it comes out of a feeling of weakness not power you skinny little weasel beth said whatre you going to do beat me up harry said is that your idea of power i know what power is beth said glaring at him easy easy norman said lets not get into this harry said what do you think norman do you have a story about the room too no norman said i dont oh come on harry said i bet you do no norman said and im not going to mediate between you two weve all got to stay together on this we have to work as a team as long as were down here its harry whos divisive beth said from the beginning of this trip hes tried to make trouble with everybody all those snide little comments what snide little comments harry said you know perfectly well what snide little comments beth said norman walked out of the room wherere you going your audience is leaving why because youre both boring oh beth said mr cool psychologist decides we are boring thats right norman said walking through the glass tunnel not looking back where do you get off making all these judgments of other people beth shouted at him he kept walking im speaking to you dont you walk away while im speaking to you norman he came into the galley once more and started opening the drawers looking for the nut bars he was hungry again and the search took his mind off the other two he had to admit he was disturbed by the way things were going he found a bar tore the foil ate it disturbed but not surprised in studies of group dynamics he had long ago verified the truth of the old statement threes a crowd for a hightension situation groups of three were inherently unstable unless everybody had clearly defined responsibilities the group tended to form shifting allegiances two against one that was what was happening now he finished the nut bar and immediately ate another one how much longer did they have down here at least thirtysix hours more he looked for a place to carry additional nut bars but his polyester jumpsuit had no pockets beth and harry came into the galley much chagrined want a nut bar he said chewing we want to apologize she said for what for acting like children harry said im embarrassed beth said i feel terrible about losing my temper that way i feel like a complete idiot beth was hanging her head staring at the floor interesting how she flipped he thought from aggressive selfconfidence to the complete opposite abject selfapology nothing in between lets not take it too far he said were all tired i feel just awful beth continued really awful i feel as if ive let you both down i shouldnt be here in the first place im not worthy to be in this group norman said beth have a nut bar and stop feeling sorry for yourself yes harry said i think i like you better angry im sick of those nut bars beth said before you came here i ate eleven of them well make it an even dozen norman said and well go back to the habitat walking back across the ocean floor they were tense watching for the squid but norman derived comfort from the fact that they were armed and something else some inner confidence that came from his earlier confrontation with the squid you hold that spear gun like you mean it beth said yes i guess so all his life he had been an academic a university researcher and had never conceived of himself as a man of action at least nothing beyond the occasional game of golf now holding the spear gun ready he found he rather liked the feeling as he walked he noticed the profusion of sea fans on the path between the spacecraft and the habitat they were obliged to walk around the fans which were sometimes four and five feet tall gaudy purple and blue in their lights norman was quite sure that the fans had not been down here when they first arrived at the habitat now there were not only colorful fans but schools of large fish too most of the fish were black with a reddish stripe across the back beth said they were pacific surgeonfish normal for the region everything is changing he thought its all changing around us but he wasnt sure about that he didnt really trust his memory down here there were too many other things to alter his perceptionsthe highpressure atmosphere the injuries he had received and the nagging tension and fear he lived with something pale caught his eye shining his light down on the bottom he saw a wriggling white streak with a long thin fin and black stripes at first he thought it was an eel then he saw the tiny head the mouth just wait beth said putting her arm on him what is it sea snake are they dangerous not usually poisonous harry said very poisonous the snake stayed close to the bottom apparently looking for food the snake ignored them entirely and norman found it quite beautiful to watch particularly as it moved farther away it gives me the creeps beth said do you know what kind it is norman said it may be a belchers beth said pacific sea snakes are all poisonous but belchers sea snake is the most poisonous in fact some researchers think its the deadliest reptile in the world with venom a hundred times more powerful than the venom of a king cobra or the black tiger snake so if it bit you two minutes tops they watched the snake slither away among the fans then it was gone sea snakes are not usually aggressive beth said some divers even touch them play with them but i never would god snakes why are they so poisonous is it for immobilizing prey you know its interesting beth said but the most toxic creatures in the world are all water creatures the venom of land animals is nothing in comparison and even among land animals the most deadly poison is derived from an amphibian a toad bufotene marfensis in the sea there are poisonous fish like the blowfish which is a delicacy in japan there are poisonous shells like the star cone alaverdis lotensis once i was on a boat in guam and a woman brought up a star cone the shells are very beautiful but she didnt know you have to keep your fingers away from the point the animal extruded its poison spine and stung her in the palm she took three steps before she collapsed in convulsions and she died within an hour there are also poisonous plants poisonous sponges poisonous corals and then the snakes even the weakest of the sea snakes are invariably lethal nice harry said well you have to recognize that the ocean is a much older living environment than the land theres been life in the oceans for three and a half billion years much longer than on land the methods of competition and defense are much more highly developed in the oceantheres been more time you mean a few billion years from now there will be tremendously poisonous animals on land too if we get that far she said lets just get back to the habitat harry said the habitat was now very close they could see all the streaming bubbles rising from the leaks leaking like a bastard harry said i think weve got enough air i think ill check be my guest beth said but i did a thorough job norman thought another argument was about to start but beth and harry dropped it they came to the hatch and climbed up into dh the console jerry norman stared at the console screen it remained blank just a blinking cursor jerry are you there the screen was blank i wonder why we arent hearing from you jerry norman said the screen remained blank trying a little psychology beth said she was checking the controls for the external sensors reviewing the graphs if you ask me the person you should use your psychology on is harry what do you mean what i mean is i dont think harry should be screwing around with our lifesupport systems i dont think hes stable stable thats a psychologists trick isnt it to repeat the last word in a sentence its a way to keep the person talking talking norman said smiling at her okay maybe i am a little stressed out she said but norman seriously before i left for the ship harry came into this room and said he would take over for me i told him you were at the sub but there werent any squid around and that i wanted to go to the ship he said fine hed take over so i left and now he doesnt remember any of that doesnt that strike you as pretty screwy screwy norman said stop it be serious serious norman said are you trying to avoid this conversation i notice how you avoid what you dont want to talk about you keep everybody on an even keel steer the conversation away from hard topics but i think you should listen to what im saying norman theres a problem with harry im listening to what youre saying beth and i wasnt present for this particular episode so i dont really know what i see of harry now looks like the same old harryarrogant disdainful and very very intelligent you dont think hes cracking up no more than the rest of us jesus what do i have to do to convince you i had a whole conversation with the man and now he denies it you think thats normal you think we can trust a person like that beth i wasnt there you mean it might be me i wasnt there you think i might be the one whos cracking up i say there was a conversation when there really wasnt beth norman im telling you there is a problem about harry and you arent facing up to it they heard footsteps approaching im going to my lab she said you think about what ive said she climbed the ladder as harry walked in well guess what beth did an excellent job with the lifesupport systems everything looks fine we have air for fiftytwo hours more at present rates of consumption we should be fine you talking to jerry what norman said harry pointed to the screen hello norman i dont know when he came back he wasnt talking earlier well he is now harry said hello harry hows it going jerry harry said fine thank you how are you i am wanting so much to talk with your entities where is the control entity harald c barnes dont you know i do not sense that entity now hes uh gone i see he was not friendly he did not enjoy to talk with me norman thought what is he telling us did jerry get rid of barnes because he thought he was unfriendly jerry norman said what happened to the control entity he was not friendly i did not like him yes but what happened to him he is not now and the other entities and the other entities they did not enjoy to talking with me harry said you think hes saying he got rid of them i am not happy to talking with them so he got rid of all the navy people harry said norman was thinking thats not quite correct he also got rid of ted and ted was trying to communicate with him or with the squid was the squid related to jerry how would norman ask that jerry yes norman i am here lets talk good i like that much tell us about the squid jerry the entity squid is a manifestation where did it come from do you like it i can manifest it more for you no no dont do that norman said quickly you do not like it no no we like it jerry this is true yes true we like it really we do good i am pleased you like it it is a very impressive entity of large size yes it is norman said wiping sweat from his forehead jesus he thought this is like talking to a child with a loaded gun it is difficult for me to manifest this large entity i am pleased that you like it very impressive norman agreed but you do not need to repeat that entity for us you wish a new entity manifested for you no jerry nothing right now thank you manifesting is happy for me yes im sure it is i am enjoying to manifest for you norman and also for you harry thank you jerry i am enjoying your manifestations also our manifestations norman said glancing at harry apparently jerry thought that the people on the habitat were manifesting something in return jerry seemed to consider it an exchange of some kind yes i am enjoying your manifestations also tell us about our manifestations jerry norman said the manifestations are small and they do not extend beyond your entities but the manifestations are new for me they are happy for me whats he talking about harry said your manifestations harry what manifestations for christs sake dont get mad norman warned stay calm i am liking that one harry do an other norman thought is he reading emotions does he regard our emotions as manifestations but that didnt make sense jerry couldnt read their minds theyd already determined that maybe hed better check again jerry he thought can you hear me i am liking harry his manifestations are red they are witful witful witful full of wit i see harry said he thinks were funny funny full of fun not exactly norman said we entities have the concept of he trailed off how was he going to explain funny what was a joke anyway we entities have the concept of a situation which causes discomfort and we call this situation humorous hume or us no one word norman spelled it for him i see your manifestations are humorous the entity squid makes many humorous manifestations from you we dont think so harry said i think so and that about summed it up norman thought sitting at the console somehow he had to make jerry understand the seriousness of his actions jerry norman explained your manifestations injure our entities some of our entities are already gone yes i know if you continue your manifestations yes i am liking to manifest it is humorous for you then pretty soon all our entities will be gone and then there will be no one to talk to you i do not wish that i know that but many entities are gone already bring them back we cant do that they are gone forever why we cannot bring them back why just like a kid norman thought just exactly like a kid telling the kid you cant do what he wants you cant play the way he wants to play and he refuses to accept it we do not have the power jerry to bring them back i wish you to bring the other entities back now he thinks were refusing to play harry said bring back the entity ted norman said we cant jerry we would if we could i am liking the entity ted he is very humorous yes norman said ted liked you too ted was trying to talk to you yes i am liking his manifestations bring back ted we cant there was a long pause i am offended you no not at all we are friends norman and harry yes we are then bring back the entities he just refuses to understand harry said jerry for gods sake we cant do it you are humorous harry make it again hes definitely reading strong emotional reactions as some kind of manifestation norman thought was this his idea of playto make a provocation to the other party and then to be amused by their responses was he delighted to see the vivid emotions brought on by the squid was this his idea of a game harry make it again harry make it again hey man harry said angrily get off my back thank you i am liking that it was red also now you will please bring back the entities gone norman had an idea jerry he said if you wish the entities back why dont you bring them back i am not pleased to do this but you could do it if you wanted to i can do any thing yes of course you can so why dont you bring back the entities you desire no i am not happy to do this why not harry said hey man get off my back no offense jerry norman said quickly there was no reply on the screen jerry the screen did not respond hes gone again harry said he shook his head god knows what the little bastard will do next further analysis norman went up to the lab to see beth but she was asleep curled up on her couch in sleep she looked quite beautiful it was odd after all the time down here she should seem so radiant it was as if the harshness had gone out of her features her nose did not seem so sharp any more the line of the mouth was softer fuller he looked at her arms which had been sinewy veins bulging the muscles seemed smoother more feminine somehow who knows he thought after so many hours down here youre no judge of anything he climbed back down the ladder and went to his bunk harry was already there snoring loudly norman decided to take another shower as he stepped under the spray he made a startling discovery the bruises which had covered his body were gone anyway almost gone he thought staring down at the remaining patches of yellow and purple they had healed within hours he moved his limbs experimentally and realized that the pain had gone too why what had happened for a moment he thought this was all a dream or a nightmare and then he thought no its just the atmosphere cuts and bruises healing faster in the highpressure environment it wasnt anything mysterious just an atmospheric effect he toweled himself as dry as he could with the damp towel and then went back to his bunk harry was still snoring as loud as ever norman lay on his back stared at the red humming coils of the ceiling heater he had an idea and got out of bed and shifted harrys talker from the base of his throat to one side immediately the snores changed to a soft highpitched hiss much better he thought he lay on the damp pillow and was almost immediately asleep he awoke with no sense of passing timeit might have been only a few secondsbut he felt refreshed he stretched and yawned and got out of bed harry still slept norman moved the talker back and the snores resumed he went into d cyl to the console still on the screen were the words hey man get off my back jerry norman said are you there jerry the screen did not respond jerry wasnt there norman looked at the stack of printouts to one side i really should go over this stuff he thought because something troubled him about jerry norman couldnt put his finger on it but even if one imagined the alien as a spoiled childking jerrys behavior didnt make sense it just didnt add up including the last message hey man get off my back street talk or just imitating harry in any case it wasnt jerrys usual mode of communication usually jerry was ungrammatical and sort of spacy talking about entities and awareness but from time to time he would become sharply colloquial norman looked at the sheets well be right back after a short break for these messages from our sponsor that was one example where had that come from it sounded like johnny carson then why didnt jerry sound like johnny carson all the time what caused the shift then too there was the problem of the squid if jerry liked to scare them if he enjoyed rattling their cage and seeing them jump why use a squid where had that idea come from and why only a squid jerry seemed to enjoy manifesting different things so why hadnt he produced giant squid one time great white sharks another time and so on wouldnt that provide a greater challenge to his abilities then there was the problem of ted ted had been playing with jerry at the time he was killed if jerry liked to play so much why would he kill off a player it just didnt make sense or did it norman sighed his trouble lay in his assumptions norman was assuming that the alien had logical processes similar to his own but that might not be true for one thing jerry might operate at a much faster metabolic rate and thus have a different sense of time kids played with a toy only until they got tired of it then they changed to another the hours that seemed so painfully long to norman might be only a few seconds in the consciousness of jerry he might just be playing with the squid for a few seconds until he dropped it for another toy kids also had a poor idea about breaking things if jerry didnt know about death then he wouldnt mind killing ted because he would think the death was just a temporary event a humorous manifestation by ted he might not realize he was actually breaking his toys and it was also true when he thought about it that jerry had manifested different things assuming that the jellyfish and the shrimps and the sea fans and now the sea snakes were his manifestations were they or were they just normal parts of the environment was there any way to tell and the navy seaman he thought suddenly lets not forget the seaman where had he come from was that seaman another of jerrys manifestations could jerry manifest his playmates at will in that case he really wouldnt care if he killed them all but i think thats clear norman thought jerry doesnt care if he kills us he just wants to play and he doesnt know his own strength yet there was something else he scanned the sheets of printout feeling instinctively some underlying organization to everything something he wasnt getting some connection he wasnt making as he thought about it he kept coming back to one question why a squid why a squid of course he thought they had been talking about a squid during the conversation at dinner jerry must have overheard that he must have decided that a squid would be a provocative item to manifest and he was certainly right about that norman shifted the papers and came upon the very first message that harry had decoded hello how are you i am fine what is your name my name is jerry that was as good a place to begin as any it had been quite a feat for harry to decode it norman thought if harry hadnt succeeded with that they would never have ever started talking to jerry at all norman sat at the console stared at the keyboard what had harry said the keyboard was a spiral the letter g was one and b was two and so on very clever to figure it out norman would never have figured that out in a million years he started trying to find the letters in the first sequence lets see marked the beginning of the message harry had said and that was h and then that was e then was l and was another l and just above it was hello yes it all fitted he continued translating was how how are you so far so good norman experienced a certain pleasure almost as if he were decoding it himself for the first time now that was i i am fine he moved more quickly writing down the letters what is your name now was my my name is but then he found a mistake in one letter was that possible norman kept going found a second mistake then wrote out the message and stared at it in growing shock my name is harry jesus christ he said he went over it again but there was no mistake not by him the message was perfectly clear hello how are you i am fine what is your name my name is harry the power the shadow beth sat up in her bed in the laboratory and stared at the message norman had given her oh my god she said she pushed her thick dark hair away from her face how can it be she said it all goes together norman said just think when did the messages start after harry came out of the sphere when did the squid and the other animals first appear after harry came out of the sphere yes but at first there were little squid but then when we were going to eat them suddenly there were shrimps too just in time for dinner why because harry doesnt like to eat squid beth said nothing she just listened and who as a child was terrified by the giant squid in twenty thousand leagues under the sea harry was she said i remember he said that norman went on in a rush and when does jerry appear on the screen when harry is present not at other times and when does jerry answer us as we talk when harry is in the room to hear what were saying and why cant jerry read our minds because harry cant read our minds and remember how barnes kept asking for the name and harry wouldnt ask for the name why because he was afraid the screen would say harry not jerry and the crewman right the black crewman who shows up just as harry is having a dream of being rescued a black crewman shows up to rescue us beth was frowning thinking what about the giant squid well in the middle of its attack harry hit his head and was knocked unconscious immediately the squid disappeared it didnt come back again until harry woke up from his nap and told you hed take over my god beth said yes norman said it explains a lot she was silent for a while staring at the message but how is he doing it i doubt if he is at least not consciously norman had been thinking about this lets assume he said that something happened to harry when he went inside the spherehe acquired some kind of power while in the sphere like what the power to make things happen just by thinking of them the power to make his thoughts real beth frowned make his thoughts real its not so strange he said just think if you were a sculptor first you would get an idea and then you would carve it in stone or wood to make it real the idea comes first then the execution follows with some added effort to create a reality that reflects your prior thoughts thats the way the world works for us we imagine something and then we try to make it happen sometimes the way we make it happen is unconsciouslike the guy who just happens to go home unexpectedly at lunchtime and catches his wife in bed with another man he doesnt consciously plan it it just sort of happens by itself or the wife who catches the husband in bed with another woman beth said yes of course the point is we manage to make things happen all the time without thinking about them too much i dont think of every word when i talk to you i just intend to say something and it comes out okay yes so we can make complicated creations like sentences without effort but we cant make other complicated creations like sculptures without effort we believe we have to do something besides simply have an idea and we do beth said well harry doesnt harrys gone one step further he doesnt have to carve the statue any more he just gets the idea and things happen by themselves he manifests things harry imagines a frightening squid and suddenly we have a frightening squid outside our window exactly and when he loses consciousness the squid disappears and he got this power from the sphere yes beth frowned why is he doing this is he trying to kill us norman shook his head no i think hes in over his head how do you mean well norman said weve considered lots of ideas of what the sphere from another civilization might be ted thought it was a trophy or a messagehe saw it as a present harry thought it had something insidehe saw it as a container but i wonder if it might be a mine you mean an explosive not exactlybut a defense or a test an alien civilization could strew these things around the galaxy and any intelligence that picks them up would get to experience the power of the sphere which is that whatever you think comes true if you think positive thoughts you get delicious shrimp for dinner if you think negative thoughts you get monsters trying to kill you same process just a matter of content so the same way a land mine blows up if you step on it this sphere destroys people if they have negative thoughts or he said if they simply arent in control of their consciousness because if youre in control of your consciousness the sphere would have no particular effect if youre not in control it gets rid of you how can you control a negative thought beth said she seemed suddenly very agitated how can you say to someone dont think of a giant squid the minute you say that they automatically think of the squid in the course of trying not to think of it its possible to control your thoughts norman said maybe for a yogi or something for anybody norman said its possible to deflect your attention from undesirable thoughts how do people quit smoking how do any of us ever change our minds about anything by controlling our thoughts i still dont see why harry is doing this remember your idea that the sphere might strike us below the belt norman said the way the aids virus strikes our immune system below the belt aids hits us at a level we arent prepared to deal with so in a sense does the sphere because we believe that we can think whatever we want without consequence sticks and stones can break my bones but names can never hurt me we have sayings like that which emphasize the point but now suddenly a name is as real as a stick and it can hurt us in the same way our thoughts get manifestedwhat a wonderful thingexcept that all our thoughts get manifested the good ones and the bad ones and we simply arent prepared to control our thoughts weve never had to do it before when i was a child beth said i was angry with my mother and when she got cancer i was terribly guilty yes norman said children think this way children all believe that their thoughts have power but we patiently teach them that theyre wrong to think that of course he said there has always been another tradition of belief about thoughts the bible says not to covet your neighbors wife which we interpret to mean that the act of adultery is forbidden but thats not really what the bible is saying the bible is saying that the thought of adultery is as forbidden as the act itself and harry do you know anything about jungian psychology beth said that stuff has never struck me as relevant well its relevant now norman said he explained jung broke with freud early in this century and developed his own psychology jung suspected there was an underlying structure to the human psyche that was reflected in an underlying similarity to our myths and archetypes one of his ideas was that everybody had a dark side to his personality which be called the shadow the shadow contained all the unacknowledged personality aspectsthe hateful parts the sadistic parts all that jung thought people had the obligation to become acquainted with their shadow side but very few people do we all prefer to think were nice guys and we dont ever have the desire to kill and maim and rape and pillage yes as jung saw it if you didnt acknowledge your shadow side it would rule you so were seeing harrys shadow side in a sense yes harry needs to present himself as mr arrogant knowitall black man norman said he certainly does so if hes afraid to be down here in this habitatand who isntthen he cant admit his fears but he has the fears anyway whether he admits them or not and so his shadow side justifies the fearscreating things that prove his fears to be valid the squid exists to justify his fears something like that yes i dont know beth said she leaned back and turned her head up and her high cheekbones caught the light she looked almost like a model elegant and handsome and strong im a zoologist norman i want to touch things and hold them in my hands and see that theyre real all these theories about manifestations they just theyre so psychological the world of the mind is just as real and follows rules just as rigorous as the world of external reality norman said yes im sure youre right but she shrugged it isnt very satisfying to me you know everything that has happened since we got down here norman said tell me another hypothesis that explains it all i cant she admitted ive been trying all the time youve been talking i cant she folded the paper in her hands and considered it for a while you know norman i think youve made a brilliant series of deductions absolutely brilliant im seeing you in a whole different light norman smiled with pleasure for most of the time he had been down in the habitat hed felt like a fifth wheel an unnecessary person in this group now someone was acknowledging his contribution and he was pleased thank you beth she looked at him her large eyes liquid and soft youre a very attractive man norman i dont think i ever really noticed before absently she touched her breast beneath the clinging jumpsuit her hands pressed the fabric outlining the hard nipples she suddenly stood and hugged him her body close to him we have to stay together on this she said we have to stay close you and i yes we do because if what you are saying is true then harry is a very dangerous man yes just the fact that he is walking around fully conscious makes him dangerous yes what are we going to do about him hey you guys harry said coming up the stairs is this a private party or can anybody join in sure norman said come on up harry and he moved away from beth was i interrupting something harry said no no i dont want to get in the way of anybodys sex life oh harry beth said she sat at the lab bench moving away from norman well you two sure look all charged up about something do we norman said yeah especially beth i think she gets more beautiful every day shes down here ive noticed that too norman said smiling ill bet you have a woman in love lucky you harry turned to beth why are you staring at me like that im not staring beth said you are too harry im not staring i can tell when someone is staring at me for christs sake norman said harry i just want to know why you two are looking at me like that youre looking at me like im a criminal or something dont get paranoid harry huddling up here whispering we werent whispering you were harry looked around the room so its two white people and one black person now is that it oh harry im not stupid you know somethings going on between you i can tell harry norman said nothing is going on and then they heard a low insistent beeping from the communications console downstairs they exchanged glances and went downstairs to look the console screen was slowly printing out letter groups cqx vdx mop im is that jerry norman asked i dont think so harry said i dont think he would go back to code is it a code i would say so definitely why is it so slow beth said a new letter was added every few seconds in a steady rhythmic way i dont know harry said where is it coming from harry frowned i dont know but the transmission speed is the most interesting characteristic the slowness interesting norman and beth waited for him to figure it out norman thought how can we ever get along without harry we need him he is both the most important intelligence down here and the most dangerous but we need him cqx vdx mop lki xxc vrw tgk piu yqa interesting harry said the letters are coming about every five seconds so i think its safe to say that we know where its coming from wisconsin norman could not have been more surprised wisconsin yeah this is a navy transmission it may or may not be directed to us but it is coming from wisconsin how do you know that because thats the only place in the world it could be coming from harry said you know about elf no well its like this you can send radio waves through the air and as you know they travel pretty well but you cant send radio far through water water is a bad medium so you need an incredibly powerful signal to go even a short distance yes but the ability to penetrate is a function of wavelength an ordinary radio wave is shortshortwave radio all of that the length of the waves are tiny thousands or millions of little waves to an inch but you can also make elf extremely lowfrequency waves which are longeach individual wave is maybe twenty feet long and those waves once generated will go a very great distance thousands of miles through water no problem the only trouble is that since the waves are long theyre also slow thats why were getting one character every five seconds the navy needed a way to communicate with their submarines underwater so they built a big elf antenna in wisconsin to send these long waves and thats what were getting and the code it must be a compression codethreeletter groupings which stand for a long section of predefined message so it wont take so long to send a message because if you sent a plain text message it would literally take hours cqx vdx mop lki xxc vrw tgk piu yqa iyt eeq fvc znb tmk exe mmn opw gew the letters stopped looks like thats it harry said how do we translate it beth said assuming its a navy transmission harry said we dont maybe theres a codebook here somewhere beth said just hold on harry said the screen shifted translating groups one after another hours chief cinccompac to barnes deephab its a message to barnes harry said they watched as the other letter groups were translated surface support vessels steaming nandi and vipati to your location eta hours deep withdraw autoset acknowledge good luck spaulding end does that mean what i think it means beth said yeah harry said the cavalry is on the way hot damn beth clapped her hands the storm must be calming down theyve sent the surface ships and theyll be here in a little more than sixteen hours and autoset they had the answer immediately every screen in the habitat flickered in the upper right corner of each appeared a small box with numbers the numbers ran backward its automatically counting down for us is there some kind of countdown were supposed to follow for leaving the habitat beth said norman watched the numbers they were rolling backward just as they had on the submarine then he said what about the submarine who cares about the submarine harry said i think we should keep it with us beth said she checked her watch we have another four hours before it has to be reset plenty of time yes privately norman was trying to gauge whether they could survive for sixteen more hours harry said well this is great news why are you two so hangdog just wondering if well make it norman said why shouldnt we make it harry said jerry might do something first beth said norman felt a burst of irritation with her didnt she realize that by saying that she was planting the idea in harrys mind we cant survive another attack on the habitat beth said norman thought shut up beth youre making suggestions an attack on the habitat harry said quickly norman said harry i think you and i should talk to jerry again really why i want to see if i can reason with him i dont know if you can harry said reason with him lets try anyway norman said with a glance at beth its worth a try norman knew he would not really be talking to jerry he would be talking to a part of harry an unconscious part a shadow part how should he go about it what could he use he sat in front of the monitor screen thinking what do i know about harry really harry who had grown up in philadelphia as a thin introverted painfully shy boy a mathematical prodigy his gifts denigrated by his friends and family harry had said once that when he cared about mathematics everybody else cared about slamdunking even now harry hated all games all sports as a young man he had been humiliated and neglected and when he finally got proper recognition for his gifts norman suspected it came too late the damage was already done certainly it came too late to prevent the arrogant braggart exterior i am here do not be afraid jerry yes norman i have a request to make you may do so jerry many of our entities are gone and our habitat is weakened i know this make your request would you please stop manifesting no why not i do not wish to stop well norman thought at least we got right down to it no wasting time jerry i know that you have been isolated for a long time for many centuries and that you have felt alone during all that time you have felt that nobody cared about you you have felt that nobody wanted to play with you or shared your interests yes this is true and now at last you can manifest and you are enjoying this you like to show us what you can do to impress us this is true so that we will pay attention to you yes i like it and it works we do pay attention to you yes i know it but these manifestations injure us jerry i do not care and they surprise us too i am glad were surprised jerry because you are merely playing a game with us i do not like games i do not play games yes this is a game for you jerry it is a sport no it is not yes it is norman said it is a stupid sport harry standing beside norman said do you want to contradict him that way you might make him mad i dont think jerry likes to be contradicted im sure you dont norman thought but he said well i have to tell jerry the truth about his own behavior he isnt doing anything very interesting oh not interesting no you are being spoiled and petulant jerry do you dare to speak to me in this fashion yes because you are acting stupidly jeez harry said take it easy with him i can easily make you regret your words norman norman was noticing in passing that jerrys vocabulary and syntax were now flawless all pretense of naivete of an alien quality had been dropped but norman felt stronger more confident as the conversation progressed he knew whom he was talking to now he wasnt talking to any alien there werent any unknown assumptions he was talking to a childish part of another human being i have more power than you can imagine i know you have power jerry norman said big deal harry became suddenly agitated norman for christs sake youre going to get us all killed listen to harry he is wise no jerry norman said harry is not wise he is only afraid harry is not afraid absolutely not norman decided to let that pass im talking to you jerry only to you you are the one who is playing games games are stupid yes they are jerry they are not worthy of you games are not of interest to any intelligent person then stop jerry stop the manifestations i can stop whenever i want i am not sure you can jerry yes i can then prove it stop this sport of manifestations there was a long pause they waited for the response norman your tricks of manipulation are childish and obvious to the point of tedium i am not interested in talking with you further i will do exactly as i please and i will manifest as i wish our habitat cannot withstand more manifestations jerry i do not care if you injure our habitat again harry will die harry said me and everybody else for christs sake i do not care norman why would you kill us jerry you should not be down here in the first place you people do not belong here you are arrogant creatures who intrude everywhere in the world and you have taken a great foolish risk and now you must pay the price you are an uncaring unfeeling species with no love for one another thats not true jerry do not contradict me again norman im sorry but the unfeeling uncaring person is you jerry you do not care if you injure us you do not care for our predicament it is you who are uncaring jerry not us you enough hes not going to talk to you any more harry said hes really mad norman and then the screen printed i will kill you all norman was sweating he wiped his forehead turned away from the words on the screen i dont think you can talk to this guy beth said i dont think you can reason with him you shouldnt have made him angry harry said he was almost pleading why did you make him angry like that norman i had to tell him the truth but you were so mean to him and now hes angry it doesnt matter angry or not beth said harry attacked us before when he wasnt angry you mean jerry norman said to her jerry attacked us yes right jerry thats a hell of a mistake to make beth harry said youre right harry im sorry harry was looking at her in an odd way norman thought harry doesnt miss a trick and he isnt going to let that one go by i dont know how you could make that confusion harry said i know it was a slip of the tongue it was stupid of me ill say im sorry beth said really i am never mind harry said it doesnt matter there was a sudden flatness in his manner a complete indifference in his tone norman thought uhoh harry yawned and stretched you know he said im suddenly very tired i think ill take a nap now and he went off to the bunks hours we have to do something beth said we cant talk him out of it youre right norman said we cant beth tapped the screen the words still glowed i will kill you all do you think he means it yes beth stood clenched her fists so its him or us yes i think so the implications hung in the air unspoken this manifesting process of his beth said do you think he has to be completely unconscious to prevent it from happening yes or dead beth said yes norman said that had occurred to him it seemed so improbable such an unlikely turn of events in his life that he would now be a thousand feet under the water contemplating the murder of another human being yet that was what he was doing id hate to kill him beth said me too i mean i wouldnt even know how to begin to do it maybe we dont have to kill him norman said maybe we dont have to kill him unless he starts some thing beth said then she shook her head oh hell norman whore we kidding this habitat cant survive another attack weve got to kill him i just dont want to face up to it neither do i norman said we could get one of those explosive spear guns and have an unfortunate accident and then just wait for our time to be up for the navy to come and get us out of here i dont want to do that i dont either beth said but what else can we do we dont have to kill him norman said just make him unconscious he went to the firstaid cabinet started going through the medicines you think there might be something there beth said maybe an anesthetic i dont know would that work i think anything that produces unconsciousness will work i think i hope youre right beth said because if he starts dreaming and then manifests the monsters from his dreams that wouldnt be very good no but anesthesia produces a dreamless total state of unconsciousness norman was looking at the labels on the bottles do you know what these things are no beth said but its all in the computer she sat down at the console read me the names and ill look them up for you diphenyl paralene beth pushed buttons scanned a screen of dense text its uh looks like something for burns ephedrine hydrochloride another screen its i guess its for motion sickness valdomet its for ulcers sintag synthetic opium analogue its very shortacting produces unconsciousness norman asked no not according to this anyway it only lasts a few minutes tarazine tranquilizer causes drowsiness good he set the bottle to one side and may also cause bizarre ideation no he said and put the bottle back they didnt need to have any bizarre ideation riordan antihistamine for bites oxalamine antibiotic chloramphenicol another antibiotic damn they were running out of bottles parasolutrine its a soporific whats that causes sleep you mean its a sleeping pill no itsit says you can give it in combination with paracin trichloride and use it as an anesthetic paracin trichloride yes i have it here norman said beth was reading from the screen parasolutrine twenty ccs in combination with paracin six ccs given im produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures no cardiac side effects sleep from which the subject can be awakened only with difficulty rem activity is suppressed how long does it last three to six hours and how fast does it take effect she frowned it doesnt say after appropriate depth of anesthesia is induced even extensive surgical procedures may be begun but it doesnt say how long it takes hell norman said its probably fast beth said but what if it isnt norman said what if it takes twenty minutes and can you fight it fight it off she shook her head nothing about that here in the end they decided on a mixture of parasolutrine paracin dulcinea and sintag the opiate norman filled a large syringe with the clear liquids the syringe was so big it looked like something for horses you think it might kill him beth said i dont know do we have a choice no beth said weve got to do it have you ever given an injection before norman shook his head you only lab animals where do i stick it do it in the shoulder beth said while hes asleep norman turned the syringe up to the light and squirted a few drops from the needle into the air okay he said i better come with you beth said and hold him down no norman said if hes awake and sees both of us coming hell be suspicious remember you dont sleep in the bunks any more but what if he gets violent i think i can handle this okay norman whatever you say the lights in the corridor of c cyl seemed unnaturally bright norman heard his feet padding on the carpet heard the constant hum of the air handlers and the space heaters he felt the weight of the syringe concealed in his palm he came to the door to the sleeping quarters two female navy crewmen were standing outside the bulkhead door they snapped to attention as he approached dr johnson sir norman paused the women were handsome black and muscularlooking at ease men norman said with a smile they did not relax sorry sir we have our orders sir i see norman said well carry on then he started to move past them into the sleeping area beg your pardon dr johnson sir they barred his way what is it norman asked as innocently as he could manage this area is offlimits to all personnel sir but i want to go to sleep very sorry dr johnson sir no one may disturb dr adams while he sleeps sir i wont disturb dr adams sorry dr johnson sir may we see what is in your hand sir in my hand yes there is something in your hand sir their snapping machinegun delivery always punctuated by the sir at the end was getting on his nerves he looked at them again the starched uniforms covered powerful muscles he didnt think he could force his way past them beyond the door he saw harry lying on his back snoring it was a perfect moment to inject him dr johnson may we see what is in your hand sir no damn it you may not very good sir norman turned and walked back to d cyl i saw beth said nodding to the monitor norman looked at the monitor at the two women in the corridor then he looked at the adjacent monitor which showed the sphere the sphere has changed norman said the convoluted grooves of the doorway were definitely altered the pattern more complex and shifted farther up norman felt sure it was changed i think youre right beth said when did that happen we can run the tapes back later she said right now wed better take care of those two how norman said simple beth said bunching her fists again we have five explosive spearheads in b cyl ill go into b get two of them blow the guardian angels away you run in and jab harry her coldblooded determination would have been chilling if she didnt look so beautiful there was a refined quality to her features now she seemed to grow more elegant by the minute the spear guns are in b norman said sure look on video she pressed a button hell in b cyl the spearguns were missing i think the son of a bitch has covered his bases norman said good old harry beth looked at him thoughtfully norman are you feeling okay sure why theres a mirror in the firstaid kit go look he opened the white box of the kit and looked at himself in the mirror he was shocked by what he saw not that he expected to look good he was accustomed to the pudgy contours of his own face and the gray stubble of his beard when he didnt shave on weekends but the face staring back at him was lean with a coarse jetblack beard there were dark circles beneath smoldering bloodshot eyes his hair was lank and greasy hanging over his forehead he looked like a dangerous man i look like dr jekyll he said or rather mr hyde yeah you do youre getting more beautiful he said to beth but im the man who was mean to jerry so im getting meaner you think harrys doing this i think so norman said adding to himself i hope so you feel different norman no i feel exactly the same i just look like hell yes you look a little frightening im sure i do you really feel fine beth okay beth said she turned looked back at the monitors i have one last idea we both get to a cyl put on our suits get into b cyl and shut down the oxygen in the rest of the habitat make harry unconscious his guards will disappear we can go in and jab him what do you think worth a try norman put down the syringe they headed off toward a cyl in c cyl they passed the two guards who again snapped to attention dr halpern sir dr johnson sir carry on men beth said yes sir may we ask where you are going sir routine inspection tour beth said there was a pause very good sir they were allowed to pass they moved into b cyl with its array of pipes and machinery norman glanced at it nervously he didnt like screwing around with the lifesupport systems but he didnt see what else they could do in a cyl there were three suits left norman reached for his you know what youre doing he asked yes beth said trust me she slipped her foot into her suit and started zipping it up and then the alarms began to sound throughout the habitat and the red lights flashed again norman knew without being told that it was the peripheral alarms another attack was beginning hours they ran back through the lateral connecting corridor directly from b cyl into d norman noticed in passing that the crewmen had gone in d the alarms were clanging and the peripheral sensor screens glowed bright red norman glanced at the video monitors i am coming beth quickly scanned the screens inner thermals are activated hes coming all right they felt a thump and norman turned to look out the porthole the green squid was already outside the huge suckered arms coiling around the base of the habitat one great arm slapped flat against the porthole the suckers distorted against the glass i am here harryyy beth shouted there was a tentative jolt as squid arms gripped the habitat the slow agonizing creak of metal harry came running into the room what is it you know what it is harry beth shouted no no what is it its the squid harry oh my god no harry moaned the habitat shook powerfully the room lights flickered and went out there was only flashing red now from the emergency lights norman turned to him stop it harry what are you talking about he cried plaintively you know what im talking about harry i dont yes you do harry its you harry norman said youre doing it no youre wrong its not me i swear its not me yes harry norman said and if you dont stop it well all die the habitat shook again one of the ceiling heaters exploded showering fragments of hot glass and wire come on harry no no theres not much time you know youre doing it the habitat cant take much more norman beth said it cant be me yes harry face it harry face it now even as he spoke norman was looking for the syringe he had left it somewhere in this room but papers were sliding off the desktops monitors crashing to the floor chaos all around him the whole habitat rocked again and there was a tremendous explosion from another cylinder new rising alarms sounded and a roaring vibration that norman instantly recognizedwater under great pressure rushing into the habitat flooding in c beth shouted reading the consoles she ran down the corridor he heard the metal clang of bulkhead doors as she shut them the room was filled with salty mist norman pushed harry against the wall harry face it and stop it it cant be me it cant be me harry moaned another jolting impact staggering them it cant be me harry cried it has nothing to do with me and then harry screamed and his body twisted and norman saw beth withdraw the syringe from his shoulder the needle tipped with blood what are you doing harry cried but already his eyes were glassy and vacant he staggered at the next impact fell drunkenly on his knees to the floor no he said softly no and he collapsed falling facedown on the carpet immediately the wrenching of metal stopped the alarms stopped everything became ominously silent except for the soft gurgle of water from somewhere within the habitat beth moved swiftly reading one screen after another inner off peripherals off everything off all right no readings norman ran to the porthole the squid had disappeared the sea bottom outside was deserted damage report beth shouted main power out e cylinder out c cylinder out b cylinder norman spun looked at her if b cyl was gone their life support would be gone they would certainly die b cylinder holding she said finally her body sagged were okay norman norman collapsed on the carpet exhausted suddenly feeling the strain and tension in every part of his body it was over the crisis had passed they were going to be all right after all norman felt his body relax it was over hours the blood had stopped flowing from harrys broken nose and now he seemed to be breathing more regularly more easily norman lifted the icepack to look at the swollen face and adjusted the flow of the intravenous drip in harrys arm beth had started the intravenous line in harrys hand after several unsuccessful attempts they were dripping an anesthetic mixture into him harrys breath smelled sour like tin but otherwise he was okay out cold the radio crackled im at the submarine beth said going aboard now norman glanced out the porthole at dh saw beth climbing up into the dome beside the sub she was going to press the delay button the last time such a trip would be necessary he turned back to harry the computer didnt have any information about the effects of keeping a person asleep for twelve hours straight but that was what they would have to do either harry would make it or he wouldnt same as the rest of us norman thought he glanced at the monitor clocks they showed hours and counted backward he put a blanket over harry and went over to the console the sphere was still there with its changed pattern of grooves in all the excitement he had almost forgotten his initial fascination with the sphere where it had come from what it meant although they understood now what it meant what had beth called it a mental enzyme an enzyme was something that made chemical reactions possible without actually participating in them our bodies needed to perform chemical reactions but our body temperatures were too cold for most chemical reactions to proceed smoothly so we had enzymes to help the process along speed it up the enzymes made it all possible and she had called the sphere a mental enzyme very clever he thought clever woman her impulsiveness had turned out to be just what was needed with harry unconscious beth still looked beautiful but norman was relieved to find that his own features had returned to pudgy normalcy he saw his own familiar reflection in the screen as he stared at the sphere on the monitor that sphere with harry unconscious he wondered if they would ever know exactly what had happened exactly what it had been like he remembered the lights like fireflies and what had harry said something about foam the foam norman heard a whirring sound and looked out the porthole the sub was moving freed of its tethers the yellow minisub glided across the bottom its lights shining on the ocean floor norman pushed the intercom button beth beth im here norman whatre you doing just take it easy norman whatre you doing in the sub beth just a precaution norman are you leaving she laughed over the intercom a light relaxed laugh no norman just take it easy tell me what youre doing its a secret come on beth this was all he needed he thought to have beth crack up now he thought again of her impulsiveness which moments before he had admired he did not admire it any more beth talk to you later she said the sub turned in profile and he saw red boxes in its claw arms he could not read the lettering on the boxes but they looked vaguely familiar as he watched the sub moved past the high fin of the spacecraft and then settled to the bottom one of the boxes was released plumping softly on the muddy floor the sub started up again churning sediment and glided forward a hundred yards then it stopped again and released another box it continued this way along the length of the spacecraft beth no answer norman squinted at the boxes there was lettering on them but he could not read them at this distance the sub had turned now and was coming directly toward dh the lights shone at him it moved closer and the sensor alarms went off clanging and flashing red lights he hated these alarms he thought going over to the console looking at the buttons how the hell did you turn them off he glanced at harry but harry remained unconscious beth are you there you set off the damn alarms push f what the hell was f he looked around finally saw a row of keys on the keyboard numbered f to f he pushed f and the alarms stopped the sub was now very close lights shining into the porthole windows in the high bubble beth was clearly visible instrument lights shining up on her face then the sub descended out of view he went to the porthole and looked out deepstar iii was resting on the bottom depositing more boxes from its claw hands now he could read the lettering on the boxes caution no smoking no electronics tevac explosives beth what the hell are you doing later norman he listened to her voice she sounded okay was she cracking up no he thought shes not cracking up she sounds okay im sure shes okay but he wasnt sure the sub was moving again its lights blurred by the cloud of sediment churned up by the propellors the cloud drifted up past the porthole obscuring his vision beth everythings fine norman back in a minute as the sediment drifted down to the bottom again he saw the sub heading back to dh moments later it docked beneath the dome then he saw beth climb out and tether the sub fore and aft hours its very simple beth said explosives he pointed to the screen it says here tevacs are weight for weight the most powerful conventional explosives known what the hell are you doing putting them around the habitat norman take it easy she rested her hand on his shoulder her touch was soft and reassuring he relaxed a little feeling her body so close we should have discussed this together first norman im not taking any chances not any more but harry is unconscious he might wake up he wont beth im not taking any chances she said this way if something starts to come out of that sphere we can blow the hell out of the whole ship ive put explosives along the whole length of it but why around the habitat defense how is it defense believe me it is beth its dangerous to have that stuff so close to us its not wired up norman in fact its not wired up around the ship either i have to go out and do that by hand she glanced at the screens i thought id wait a while first maybe take a nap are you tired no norman said you havent slept in a long time norman im not tired she gave him an appraising look ill keep an eye on harry if thats what youre worried about im just not tired beth okay she said suit yourself she brushed her luxuriant hair back from her face with her fingers personally im exhausted im going to get a few hours she started up the stairs to her lab then looked down at him want to join me what he said she smiled at him directly knowingly you heard me norman maybe later beth okay sure she ascended the staircase her body swinging smoothly sensuously in the tight jumpsuit she looked good in that jumpsuit he had to admit it she was a goodlooking woman across the room harry snored in a regular rhythm norman checked harrys icepack and thought about beth he heard her moving around in the lab upstairs hey norm yes he moved to the bottom of the stairs looked up is there another one of these down there a clean one something blue dropped into his hands it was her jumpsuit yes i think theyre in storage in b bring me one would you norm okay he said going to b cyl he found himself inexplicably nervous what was going on of course he thought he knew exactly what was going on but why now beth was exerting a powerful attraction and he mistrusted it in her dealings with men beth was confrontational energetic direct and angry seduction wasnt her method at all it is now he thought fishing a new jumpsuit out of the storage locker he took it back to d cyl and climbed the ladder from above he saw a strange bluish light beth im here norm he came up and saw her lying naked on her back beneath a bank of ultraviolet sunlamps hinged out from the wall she wore opaque cups over her eyes she twisted her body seductively did you bring the suit yes he said thanks a lot just put it anywhere by the lab bench okay he draped it over her chair she rolled back to face the glowing lamps sighed i thought id better get a little vitamin d norm yes you probably should too yeah probably but norman was thinking that he didnt remember a bank of sunlamps in the lab in fact he was sure that there wasnt one he had spent a lot of time in that room he would have remembered he went back down the stairs quickly in fact the staircase was new too it was black anodized metal it hadnt been that way before this was a new descending staircase norm in a minute beth he went to the console and started punching buttons he had seen a file before on habitat parameters or something like that he finally found it deephab mippr design parameters a cylinder a b cylinder b c cylinder c d cylinder d e cylinder e choose one he chose cyl d and another screen appeared he chose design plans he got page after page of architectural drawings he flicked through them stabbing at the keys until he came to the detail plans for the biological laboratory at the top of d cyl clearly shown in the drawings was a large sunlamp bank hinged to fold back against the wall it must have been there all the time he just hadnt ever noticed it there were lots of other details he hadnt noticedlike the emergency escape hatch in the domed ceiling of the lab and the fact that there was a second foldout bunk near the floor entrance and a black anodized descending staircase youre in a panic he thought and it has nothing to do with sunlamps and architectural drawings it doesnt e even have to do with sex youre in a panic because beth is the only one left besides you and beth isnt acting like herself in the corner of the screen he watched the small clock tick backward the seconds clicking off with agonizing slowness twelve more hours he thought ive just got to last twelve more hours and everything will be all right he was hungry but he knew there wasnt any food he was tired but there wasnt anyplace for him to sleep both e and c cylinders were flooded and he didnt want to go upstairs with beth norman lay down on the floor of d cyl beside harry on the couch it was cold and damp on the floor for a long time he couldnt sleep hours the pounding that terrifying pounding and the shaking of the floor awakened him abruptly he rolled over and got to his feet instantly alert he saw beth standing by the monitors what is it he cried what is it what is what beth said she seemed calm she smiled at him norman looked around the alarms hadnt gone off the lights werent flashing i dont know i thoughti dont know he trailed off you thought we were under attack again she said he nodded why would you think that norman she said beth was looking at him again in that odd way an appraising way her stare very direct and cool there was no hint of seductiveness to her if anything she conveyed the suspiciousness of the old beth youre a man and youre a problem harrys still unconscious isnt he so why would you think we were being attacked i dont know i guess i was dreaming beth shrugged maybe you felt the vibration of me walking on the floor she said anyway im glad you decided to sleep that same appraising stare as if there were something wrong with him you havent slept enough norman none of us have you particularly maybe youre right he had to admit he felt better now that he had slept for a couple of hours he smiled did you eat all the coffee and danish there isnt any coffee and danish norman i know then why would you say that she asked seriously it was a joke beth oh just a joke you know a humorous reflection on our condition i see she was working with the screens by the way what did you find out about the balloon the balloon the surface balloon remember we talked about it he shook his head he didnt remember before i went out to the sub i asked about the control codes to send a balloon to the surface and you said youd look in the computer and see if you could find how to do it i did yes norman you did he thought back he remembered how he and beth had lifted harrys inert surprisingly heavy body off the floor setting him on the couch and how they had staunched the flow of blood from his nose while beth had started an intravenous line which she knew how to do from her work with lab animals in fact she had made a joke saying she hoped harry fared better than her lab animals since they usually ended up dead then beth had volunteered to go to the sub and he had said hed stay with harry that was what he remembered nothing about any balloons sure beth said because the communication said we were supposed to acknowledge transmission and that means a radio balloon sent to the surface and we figured with the storm abating the surface conditions must be calm enough to allow the balloon to ride without snapping the wire so it was a question of how to release the balloons and you said youd look for the control commands i really dont remember he said im sorry norman we have to work together in these last few hours beth said i agree beth absolutely how are you feeling now she said okay pretty good in fact good she said hang in there norman its only a few more hours she hugged him warmly but when she released him he saw in her eyes that same detached appraising look an hour later they figured out how to release the balloon they distantly heard a metallic sizzle as the wire unwound from the outside spool trailing behind the inflated balloon as it shot toward the surface then there was a long pause whats happening norman said were a thousand feet down beth said it takes a while for the balloon to get to the surface then the screen changed and they got a readout of surface conditions wind was down to fifteen knots waves were running six feet barometric pressure was sunlight was recorded good news beth said the surface is okay norman was staring at the screen thinking about the fact that sunlight was recorded he had never longed for sunlight before it was funny what you took for granted now the thought of seeing sunlight struck him as unbelievably pleasurable he could imagine no greater joy than to see sun and clouds and blue sky what are you thinking im thinking i cant wait to get out of here me too beth said but it wont be long now pong pong pong pong norman was checking harry and he spun at the sound what is it beth pong pong pong pong take it easy beth said at the console im just figuring out how to work this thing pong pong pong pong work what the sidescanning sonar falseaperture sonar i dont know why they call it falseaperture do you know what that refers to falseaperture pong pong pong pong no i dont norman said turn it off please the sound was unnerving its marked fas which i think stands for falseaperture sonar but it also says side scanning its very confusing beth turn it off pong pong pong pong sure of course beth said why do you want to know how to work that anyway norman said he felt irritable as if shed intentionally annoyed him with that sound just in case beth said in case what for christs sake you said yourself that harrys unconscious there arent going to be any more attacks take it easy norman beth said i want to be prepared thats all hours he couldnt talk her out of it she insisted on going outside and wiring the explosives around the ship it was an absolutely fixed idea in her mind but why beth he kept saying because ill feel better after i do it she said but there isnt any reason to do it ill feel better if i do she insisted and in the end he couldnt stop her he saw her now a small figure with a single glowing light from her helmet moving from one crate of explosives to another she opened each crate and removed large yellow cones which looked rather like the cones that highway repair trucks used these cones were wired together and when the wiring was completed a small red light glowed at the tip he saw small red lights all up and down the length of the ship it made him uneasy when she left he had said to her but you wont wire up the explosives near the habitat no norman i wont promise me i told you i wont if its going to upset you i wont its going to upset me okay okay now the red lights were strung along the length of the ship starting at the dimly visible tail which rose out of the coral bottom beth moved farther north toward the rest of the unopened crates norman looked at harry who snored loudly but who remained unconscious he paced back and forth in d cyl and then went to the monitors the screen blinked i am coming oh god he thought and in the next moment he thought how can this be happening it cant be happening harry was still out cold how could it be happening i am coming for you beth her voice sounded tinny on the intercom yes norman get the hell out of there do not be afraid the screen said what is it norman she said im getting something on the screen check harry he must be waking up hes not get back here beth i am coming now all right norman im heading back she said fast beth but he didnt need to say that already he could see her light bouncing as she ran across the bottom she was at least a hundred yards from the habitat he heard her breathing hard on the intercom can you see anything norman no nothing he was straining to look toward the horizon where the squid had always appeared the first thing had always been a green glow on the horizon but he saw no glow now beth was panting i can feel something norman i feel the water surging strong the screen flashed i will kill you dont you see anything out here beth said no i dont see anything at all he saw beth alone on the muddy bottom her light the solitary focus of his attention i can feel it norman its close jesus god what about the alarms nothing beth jesus her breath came in hissing gasps as she ran beth was in good shape but she couldnt exert herself like that in this atmosphere not for long he thought already he could see she was moving more slowly the helmet lamp bobbing more slowly norman yes beth im here norman i dont know if i can make it beth you can make it slow down its here i can feel it i dont see anything beth he heard a rapid sharp clicking sound at first he thought it was static on the line and then he realized it was her teeth chattering as she shivered with this exertion she should be getting overheated but instead she was getting cold he didnt understand cold norman slow down beth canttalkingclose she was slowing down despite herself she had come into the area of the habitat lights and she was no more than ten yards from the hatch but he could see her limbs moving slowly clumsily and now at last he could see something swirling the muddy sediment behind her in the darkness beyond the lights it was like a tornado a swirling cloud of muddy sediment he couldnt see what was inside the cloud but he sensed the power within it closenor beth stumbled fell the swirling cloud moved toward her i will kill you now beth got to her feet looked back saw the churning cloud bearing down on her something about it filled norman with a deep horror a horror from childhood the stuff of nightmares normannnnnn then norman was running not really knowing what he was going to do but propelled by the vision he had seen thinking only that he had to do something he had to take some action and he went through b into a and looked at his suit but there wasnt time and the black water in the open hatch was spitting and swirling and he saw beths gloved hand below the surface flailing she was right there beneath him and she was the only other one and without thinking he jumped into the black water and went down the shock of the cold made him want to scream it tore at his lungs his whole body was instantly numb and he felt a second of hideous paralysis the water churned and tossed him like a great wave he was powerless to fight it his head banged on the underside of the habitat he could see nothing at all he reached for beth throwing his arms blindly in all directions his lungs burned the water spun him in circles upended him he touched her lost her the water continued to spin him he grabbed her something an arm he was already losing feeling already feeling slower and stupider he pulled he saw a ring of light above him the hatch he kicked his legs but he did not seem to move the circle came no closer he kicked again dragging beth like a dead weight perhaps she was dead his lungs burned it was the worst pain he had ever felt in his life he fought the pain and he fought the angry churning water and he kept kicking toward the light that was his only thought to kick to the light to come closer to the light to reach the light the light the light the light the images were confusing beths suited body clanging on the metal inside the airlock his own knee bleeding on the metal of the hatch the drops of blood spattering beths shaking hands reaching for her helmet twisting it trying to get the helmet unlocked hands shaking water in the hatch sucking surging lights in his eyes a terrible pain somewhere rust very close to his face a sharp edge of metal cold metal cold air lights in his eyes dimming fading blackness the sensation of warmth was pleasant he heard a hissing roar in his ears he looked up and saw beth out of her suit looming large above him adjusting the big space heater turning the power up she was still shivering but she was turning up the heat he closed his eyes we made it he thought were still together were still okay we made it he relaxed there was a crawly sensation over his body from the cold he thought his body warming from the cold the crawly sensation was not pleasant and the hissing was not pleasant either it was sibilant intermittent something slithered softly under his chin as he lay on the deck he opened his eyes and saw a silvery white tube and then he focused and saw the tiny beady eyes and the flicking tongue it was a snake a sea snake he froze he looked down moving only his eyes his entire body was covered with white snakes the crawly sensation came from dozens of snakes coiling around his ankles sliding between his legs over his chest he felt a cool slithering motion across his forehead he closed his eyes feeling horror as the snake body moved over his face down his nose brushed over his lips then moved away he listened to the hissing of the reptiles and thought of how poisonous beth had said they were beth he thought where is beth he did not move he felt snakes coiling around his neck slipping over his shoulder sliding between the fingers of his hands he did not want to open his eyes he felt a surge of nausea god he thought im going to throw up he felt snakes under his armpit and felt snakes slipping past his groin he burst into a cold sweat he fought nausea beth he thought he did not want to speak beth he listened to the hissing and then when he couldnt stand it any more he opened his eyes and saw the mass of coiling writhing white flesh the tiny heads the flicking forked tongues he closed his eyes again he felt one crawling up the leg of his jumpsuit moving against his bare skin dont move norman it was beth he could hear the tension in her voice he looked up could not see her only her shadow he heard her say oh god what time is it and he thought the hell with the time who cares what time it is it didnt make any sense to him i have to know the time beth was saying he heard her feet moving on the deck the time she was moving away leaving him the snakes slid over his ears under his chin past his nostrils the bodies damp and slithering then he heard her feet on the deck and a metallic clang as she threw open the hatch he opened his eyes to see her bending over him grabbing the snakes in great handfuls throwing them down the hatch into the water snakes writhed in her hands twisted around her wrists but she shook them off tossed them aside some of the snakes didnt land in the water and coiled on the deck but most of the snakes were off his body now one more crawling up his leg toward his groin he felt it moving quickly backwardshe was pulling it out by the tail jesus careful the snake was out flung over her shoulder you can get up norman she said he jumped to his feet and promptly vomited hours he had a murderous pounding headache it made the habitat lights seem unpleasantly bright and he was cold beth had wrapped him in blankets and had moved him next to the big space heaters in d cyl so close that the hum of the electrical elements was very loud in his ears but he was still cold he looked down at her now as she bandaged his cut knee how is it he said not good she said its right down to the bone but youll be all right its only a few more hours now yes iouch sorry almost done beth was following firstaid directions from the computer to distract his mind from the pain he read the screen minor medical nonlethal complications trauma microsleep helium tremor otitis toxic contaminants synovial pain choose one thats what i need he said some microsleep or better yet some serious macrosleep yes we all do a thought occurred to him beth remember when you were pulling the snakes off me what was all that you were saying about the time of day sea snakes are diurnal beth said many poisonous snakes are alternately aggressive and passive in twelvehour cycles corresponding to day and night during the day when theyre passive you can handle them and they will never bite for example in india the highly poisonous banded krait has never been known to bite during the day even when children play with them but at night watch out so i was trying to determine which cycle the sea snakes were on until i decided that this must be their passive daytime cycle howd you figure that because you were still alive then she had used her bare hands to remove the snakes knowing that they wouldnt bite her either with your hands full of snakes you looked like medusa what is that a rock star no its a mythological figure the one who killed her children she asked with a quick suspicious glance beth ever alert to a veiled insult no thats somebody else that was medea medusa was a mythical woman with a head full of snakes who turned men to stone if they looked at her perseus killed her by looking at her reflection in his polished shield sorry norman not my field it was remarkable he thought that at one time every educated western person knew these figures from mythology and the stories behind them intimatelyas intimately as they knew the stories of families and friends myths had once represented the common knowledge of humanity and they served as a kind of map of consciousness but now a welleducated person such as beth knew nothing of myths at all it was as if men had decided that the map of human consciousness had changed but had it really changed he shivered still cold norman yeah but the worst thing is the headache youre probably dehydrated lets see if i can find something for you to drink she went to the firstaid box on the wall you know that was a hell of a thing you did beth said jumping in like that without a suit that waters only a couple of degrees above freezing it was very brave stupid but brave she smiled you saved my life norman i didnt think norman said i just did it and then he told her how when he had seen her outside with the churning cloud of sediment approaching her he had felt an old and childish horror something from distant memory you know what it was he said it reminded me of the tornado in the wizard of oz that tornado scared the bejesus out of me when i was a kid i just didnt want to see it happen again and then he thought perhaps these are our new myths dorothy and toto and the wicked witch captain nemo and the giant squid well beth said whatever the reason you saved my life thank you any time norman said he smiled just dont do it again no i wont be going out again she brought back a drink in a paper cup it was syrupy and sweet what is this isotonic glucose supplement drink it he sipped it again but it was unpleasantly sweet across the room the console screen still said i will kill you now he looked at harry still unconscious with the intravenous line running into his arm harry had been unconscious all this time he hadnt faced the implications of that it was time to do it now he didnt want to do it but he had to he said beth why do you think all this is happening all what the screen printing words and another manifestation coming to attack us beth looked at him in a flat neutral way what do you think norman its not harry no its not then why is it happening norman said he got up pulling the blankets tighter around him he flexed his bandaged knee it hurt but not too badly norman moved to the porthole and looked out the window in the distance he could see the string of red lights from the explosives beth had set and armed he had never understood why she had wanted to do that she had acted so strangely about the whole thing he looked down toward the base of the habitat red lights were glowing there too just below the porthole she had armed the explosives around the habitat beth what have you done done you armed the explosives around dh yes norman she said she stood watching him very still very calm beth you promised you wouldnt do that i know i had to how are they wired wheres the button beth there is no button theyre set on automatic vibration sensors you mean theyll go off automatically yes norman beth this is crazy someone is still making these manifestations who is doing that beth she smiled slowly a lazy cat smile as if he secretly amused her dont you really know he did know yes he thought he knew and it chilled him youre making these manifestations beth no norman she said still calm im not doing it you are hours he thought back years ago to the early days of his training when he had worked in the state hospital at borrego norman had been sent by his supervisor to make a progress report on a particular patient the man was in his late twenties pleasant and well educated norman talked to him about all sorts of things the oldsmobile hydramatic transmission the best surfing beaches adlai stevensons recent presidential campaign whitey fords pitching even freudian theory the man was quite charming although he chainsmoked and seemed to have an underlying tension finally norman got around to asking him why he had been sent to the hospital the man didnt remember why he was sorry he just couldnt seem to recall under repeated questioning from norman the man became less charming more irritable finally he turned threatening and angry pounding the table demanding that norman talk about something else only then did it dawn on norman who this man was alan whittier who as a teenager had murdered his mother and sister in their trailer in palm desert and then had gone on to kill six people at a gas station and three others in a supermarket parking lot until he finally turned himself in to the police sobbing hysterical with guilt and remorse whittier had been in the state hospital for ten years and he had brutally attacked several attendants during that time this was the man who was now enraged standing up in front of norman and kicking the table flinging his chair back against the wall norman was still a student he didnt know how to handle it he turned to flee the room but the door behind him was locked they had locked him in which is what they always did during interviews with violent patients behind him whittier lifted the table and threw it against the wall he was coming for norman norman had a moment of horrible panic until he heard the locks rattling and then three huge attendants dashed in grabbed whittier and dragged him away still screaming and swearing norman went directly to his supervisor demanded to know why he had been set up the supervisor said to him set up yes norman had said set up the supervisor said but werent you told the mans name beforehand didnt the name mean anything to you norman replied that he hadnt really paid attention you better pay attention norman the supervisor had said you cant ever let down your guard in a place like this its too dangerous now looking across the habitat at beth he thought pay attention norman you cant let down your guard because youre dealing with a crazy person and you havent realized it i see you dont believe me beth said still very calm are you able to talk sure norman said be logical all of that sure he said thinking im not the crazy one here all right beth said remember when you told me about harryhow all the evidence pointed to harry yes of course you asked me if i could think of another explanation and i said no but there is another explanation norman some points you conveniently overlooked the first time like the jellyfish why the jellyfish it was your little brother who was stung by the jellyfish norman and you who felt guilty afterward and when does jerry speak when youre there norman and when does the squid stop its attack when you were knocked unconscious norman not harry you her voice was so calm so reasonable he struggled to consider what she was saying was it possible she was right step back take the long view beth said youre a psychologist down here with a bunch of scientists dealing with hardware theres nothing for you to do down hereyou said so yourself and wasnt there a time in your life when you felt similarly professionally bypassed wasnt that an uncomfortable time for you didnt you once tell me that you hated that time in your life yes but when all the strange things start to happen the problem isnt hardware any more now its a psychological problem its right up your alley norman your particular area of expertise suddenly you become the center of attention dont you no he thought this cant be right when jerry starts to communicate with us who notices that he has emotions who insists we deal with jerrys emotions none of us are interested in emotions norman barnes only wants to know about armaments ted only wants to talk science harry only wants to play logical games youre the one whos interested in emotions and who manipulates jerryor fails to manipulate him you norman its all you it cant be norman said his mind was reeling he struggled to find a contradiction and found it it cant be mebecause i havent been inside the sphere yes you have beth said you just dont remember he felt battered repeatedly punched and battered he couldnt seem to get his balance and the blows kept coming just the way you dont remember that i asked you to look up the balloon codes beth was saying in her calm voice or the way barnes asked you about the helium concentrations in e cyl he thought what helium concentrations in e cyl when did barnes ask me about that theres a lot you dont remember norman norman said when did i go to the sphere before the first squid attack after harry came out i was asleep i was sleeping in my bunk no norman you werent because fletcher came to get you and you were gone we couldnt find you for about two hours and then you showed up yawning i dont believe you he said i know you dont you prefer to make it somebody elses problem and youre clever youre skilled at psychological manipulation norman remember those tests you conducted putting unsuspecting people up in an airplane then telling them the pilot had a heart attack scaring them half to death thats pretty ruthless manipulation norman and down here in the habitat when all these things started happening you needed a monster so you made harry the monster but harry wasnt the monster norman you are the monster thats why your appearance changed why you became ugly because youre the monster but the message it said my name is harry yes it did and as you yourself pointed out the person causing it was afraid that the real name would come out on the screen harry norman said the name was harry and whats your name norman johnson your full name he paused somehow his mouth wasnt working his brain was blank ill tell you what it is beth said i looked it up its norman harrison johnson no he thought no no no she cant be right its hard to accept beth was saying in her slow patient almost hypnotic voice i understand that but if you think about it youll realize you wanted it to come to this you wanted me to figure it out norman why just a few minutes ago you even told me about the wizard of oz didnt you you helped me along when i wasnt getting the pointor at least your unconscious did are you still calm of course im calm good stay calm norman lets consider this logically will you cooperate with me what do you want to do i want to put you under norman like harry he shook his head its only for a few hours norman she said and then she seemed to decide she moved swiftly toward him and he saw the syringe in her hand the glint of the needle and he twisted away the needle plunged into the blanket and he threw it off and ran for the stairs norman come back here he was climbing the stairs he saw beth running forward with the needle he kicked with his foot got upstairs into her lab and slammed the hatch down on her norman she pounded on the hatch norman stood on it knowing that she could never lift his weight beth continued to pound norman johnson you open that hatch this minute no beth im sorry he paused what could she do nothing he thought he was safe here she couldnt get to him up here she couldnt do anything to him as long as he remained here then he saw the metal pivot move in the center of the hatch between his feet on the other side of the hatch beth was spinning the wheel locking him in hours the only lights in the laboratory shone on the bench next to a row of neatly bottled specimens squid shrimps giant squid eggs he touched the bottles absently he turned on the laboratory monitor and punched buttons until he saw beth downstairs on the video beth was working at the main d cyl console to one side he saw harry still lying unconscious norman can you hear me he said aloud yes beth i hear you norman you are acting irresponsibly you are a menace to this entire expedition was that true he wondered he didnt think he was a menace to the expedition it didnt feel true to him but how often in his life had he confronted patients who refused to acknowledge what was happening in their lives even trivial examplesa man another professor at the university who was terrified of elevators but who steadfastly insisted he always took the stairs because it was good exercise the man would climb fifteenstory buildings he would decline appointments in taller buildings he arranged his entire life to accommodate a problem he would not admit he had the problem remained concealed from him until he finally had a heart attack or the woman who was exhausted from years of caring for her disturbed daughter she gave her daughter a bottle of sleeping pills because she said the girl needed a rest the girl committed suicide or the novice sailor who cheerfully packed his family off on a sailing excursion to catalina in a gale nearly killing them all dozens of examples came to mind it was a psychological truism this blindness about self did he imagine that he was immune three years ago there had been a minor scandal when one of the assistant professors in the psychology department had committed suicide sticking a gun in his mouth over the labor day weekend there had been headlines for that one psych prof kills self colleagues express surprise say deceased was always happy the dean of the faculty embarrassed in his fundraising had berated norman about that incident but the difficult truth was that psychology had severe limitations even with professional knowledge and the best of intentions there remained an enormous amount you never knew about your closest friends your colleagues your wives and husbands and children and your ignorance about yourself was even greater than that selfawareness was the most difficult of all few people attained it or perhaps nobody attained it norman are you there yes beth i think you are a good person norman he said nothing he just watched her on the monitor i think you have integrity and that you believe in telling the truth this is a difficult moment for you to face the reality about yourself i know your mind is struggling now to find excuses to blame someone else but i think you can do it norman harry couldnt do it but you can i think you can admit the hard truththat so long as you remain conscious the expedition is menaced he felt the strength of her conviction heard the quiet force of her voice as beth spoke it felt almost as if her ideas were clothing being draped over his body he began to see things her way she was so calm she must be right her ideas had such power her thoughts had such power beth have you been in the sphere no norman thats your mind trying to evade the point again i havent been in the sphere you have he honestly couldnt remember going into the sphere he had no recollection at all and when harry had been in the sphere he remembered afterward why would norman forget why would he block it youre a psychologist norman she was saying you of all people do not want to admit you have a shadow side you have a professional stake in believing in your own mental health of course you will deny it he didnt think so but how to resolve it how to determine if she was right or not his mind wasnt working well his cut knee throbbed painfully at least there was no doubt about thathis injured knee was real reality testing that was how to resolve it he thought reality testing what was the objective evidence that norman had gone to the sphere they had made tapes of everything that occurred in the habitat if norman had gone to the sphere many hours ago somewhere there was a tape showing him in the airlock alone getting dressed slipping away beth should be able to show him that tape where was that tape in the submarine of course it would long ago have been taken to the submarine norman himself might have taken it when he made his excursion to the sub no objective evidence norman give up please for all our sakes perhaps she was right he thought she was so sure of herself if he was evading the truth if he was putting the expedition in jeopardy then he had to give himself up and let her put him under could he trust her to do that he would have to there wasnt any choice it must be me he thought it must be the thought was so horrible to himthat in itself was suspicious he was resisting it so violentlynot a good sign he thought too much resistance norman okay beth will you do it dont push give me a minute will you sure norman of course he looked at the video recorder next to the monitor he remembered how beth had used this recorder to play the same tape again and again the tape in which the sphere had opened by itself that tape was now lying on the counter beside the recorder he pushed the tape into the slot clicked the recorder on why bother to look at it now he thought youre just delaying youre wasting time the screen flickered and he waited for the familiar image of beth eating cake her back to the monitor but this was a different tape this was a direct monitor feed showing the sphere the gleaming sphere just sitting there he watched for a few seconds but nothing happened the sphere was immobile as always polished perfect immobile he watched a while longer but there was nothing to see norman if i open the hatch now will you come down quietly yes beth he sighed sat back in the chair how long would he be unconscious a little less than six hours it would be okay but in any case beth was right he had to give himself up norman why are you watching that tape he looked around quickly was there a video camera in the room allowing her to see him yes high up in the ceiling next to the upper hatch why are you watching that tape norman it was here who said you could watch that tape nobody norman said it was just here turn the tape off norman turn it off now she didnt sound so calm any more whats the matter beth turn that damned tape off norman he was about to ask her why but then he saw beth enter the video image stand next to the sphere beth closed her eyes and clenched her fists the convoluted grooves of the sphere parted revealing blackness and as he watched beth stepped inside the sphere and the door of the sphere closed behind her you goddamned men beth said in a tight angry voice youre all the same you cant leave well enough alone none of you you lied to me beth why did you watch that tape i begged you not to watch that tape it could only hurt you to watch that tape norman she wasnt angry any more now she was pleading near tears she was undergoing rapid emotional shifts unstable unpredictable and she was in control of the habitat beth im sorry norman i cant trust you any more beth im turning you off norman im not going to listen to beth wait you any more i know how dangerous you are i saw what you did to harry how you twisted the facts so that it was harrys fault oh yes it was harrys fault by the time you got through and now you want to make it beths fault dont you well let me tell you norman you wont be able to do it because i have shut you off norman i cant hear your soft convincing words i cant hear your manipulation so dont waste your breath norman he stopped the tape the monitor now showed beth at the console in the room below pushing buttons on the console beth he said she didnt reply she just went on working at the console muttering to herself youre a real son of a bitch norman do you know that you feel so terrible that you need to make everybody else just as low as you are she was talking about herself he thought youre so big on the unconscious norman the unconscious this the unconscious that jesus christ im sick of you your unconscious probably wants to kill us all just because you want to kill yourself and you think everybody else should die with you he felt a shuddering chill beth with her lack of selfesteem her deep core of selfhate had gone inside the sphere and now she was acting with the power of the sphere but without stability to her thoughts beth saw herself as a victim who struggled against her fate always unsuccessfully beth was victimized by men victimized by the establishment victimized by research victimized by reality in every case she failed to see how she had done it to herself and shes put explosives all around the habitat he thought i wont let you do it norman im going to stop you before you kill us all everything she said was the reverse of the truth he began to see the pattern now beth had figured out how to open the sphere and she had gone there in secret because she had always been attracted to powershe always felt she lacked power and needed more but beth wasnt prepared to handle power once she had it beth still saw herself as a victim so she had to deny the power and arrange to be victimized by it it was very different from harry harry had denied his fears and so fearful images had manifested themselves but beth denied her power and so she manifested a churning cloud of formless uncontrolled power harry was a mathematician who lived in a conscious world of abstraction of equations and thoughts a concrete form like a squid was what harry feared but beth the zoologist who dealt every day with animals creatures she could touch and see created an abstraction a power that she could not touch or see a formless abstract power that was coming to get her and to defend herself she had armed the habitat with explosives it wasnt much of a defense norman thought unless you secretly wanted to kill yourself the horror of his true predicament became clear to him you wont get away with this norman i wont let it happen not to me she was punching keys on the console what was she planning what could she do to him he had to think suddenly the lights in the laboratory went off a moment later the big space heater died the red elements cooling turning dark she had shut off the power with the heater turned off how long could he last he took the blankets from her bed wrapped himself in them how long without heat certainly not six hours he thought grimly im sorry norman but you understand the position im in as long as youre conscious im in danger maybe an hour he thought maybe i can last an hour im sorry norman but i have to do this to you he heard a soft hiss the alarm on his chest badge began to beep he looked down at it even in the darkness he could see it was now gray he knew immediately what had happened beth had turned off his air hours huddled in the darkness listening to the beep of his alarm and the hiss of the escaping air the pressure diminishing rapidly his ears popped as if he were in an airplane taking off do something he thought feeling a surge of panic but there was nothing he could do he was locked in the upper chamber of d cyl he could not get out beth had control of the entire facility and she knew how to run the lifesupport systems she had shut off his power she had shut off his heat and now she had shut off his air he was trapped as the pressure fell the sealed specimen bottles exploded like bombs shooting fragments of glass across the room he ducked under the blankets feeling the glass rip and tug at the cloth breathing was harder now at first he thought it was tension and then he realized that the air was thinner he would lose consciousness soon do something he couldnt seem to catch his breath do something but all he could think about was breathing he needed air needed oxygen then he thought of the firstaid cabinet wasnt there emergency oxygen in the cabinet he wasnt sure he seemed to remember as he got up another specimen bottle exploded and he twisted away from the flying glass he was gasping for breath chest heaving he started to see gray spots before his eyes he fumbled in the darkness looking for the cabinet his hands moving along the wall he touched a cylinder oxygen no too largeit must be the fire extinguisher where was the cabinet his hands moved along the wall where he felt the metal case the embossed cover with the raised cross he pulled it open thrust his hands inside more spots swam before his eyes there wasnt much time his fingers touched small bottles soft bandage packs there was no air bottle damn the bottles fell to the floor and then something large and heavy landed on his foot with a thud he bent down touched the floor felt a shard of glass cut his finger paid no attention his hand closed over a cold metal cylinder it was small hardly longer than the palm of his hand at one end was some fitting a nozzle it was a spray cansome kind of damn spray can he threw it aside oxygen he needed oxygen by the bed he remembered wasnt there emergency oxygen by every bed in the habitat he felt for the couch where beth had slept felt for the wall above where her head would have been surely there was oxygen nearby he was dizzy now he wasnt thinking clearly no oxygen then he realized this wasnt a regular bed it wasnt intended for sleeping they wouldnt have placed any oxygen here damn and then his hand touched a metal cylinder clipped to the wall at one end was something soft soft an oxygen mask quickly he pushed the mask over his mouth and nose he felt the bottle twisted a knurled knob he heard a hissing breathed cold air he felt a wave of intense dizziness and then his head cleared oxygen he was fine he felt the shape of the bottle gauging its size it was an emergency bottle only a few hundred ccs how long would it last not long he thought a few minutes it was only a temporary reprieve do something but he couldnt think of anything to do he had no options he was locked in a room he remembered one of his teachers fat old dr temkin you always have an option there is always something you can do you are never without choice i am now he thought no choices now anyway temkin had been talking about treating patients not escaping from sealed chambers temkin didnt have any experience escaping from sealed chambers and neither did norman the oxygen made him lightheaded or was it already running out he saw a parade of his old teachers before him was this like seeing your life running before you before you died all his teachers mrs jefferson who told him to be a lawyer instead old joe lamper who laughed and said everything is sex trust me it always comes down to sex dr stein who used to say there is no such thing as a resistant patient show me a resistant patient and ill show you a resistant therapist if youre not making headway with a patient then do something else do anything else but do something do something stein advocated crazy stuff if you werent getting through to a patient get crazy dress up in a clown suit kick the patient squirt him with a water pistol do any damned thing that came into your head but do something look he used to say what youre doing now isnt working so you might as well do something else no matter how crazy it seems that was fine back then norman thought hed like to see stein assess this problem what would dr stein tell him to do open the door i cant shes locked it talk to her i cant she wont listen turn on your air i cant she has control of the system get control of the system i cant she is in control find help inside the room i cant there is nothing left to help me then leave i cant i he paused that wasnt true he could leave by smashing a porthole or for that matter by opening the hatch in the ceiling but there was no place to go he didnt have a suit the water was freezing he had been exposed to that freezing water for only a few seconds and he had nearly died if he were to leave the room for the open ocean he would almost surely die hed probably be fatally chilled before the chamber even filled with water he would surely die in his mind he saw stein raise his bushy eyebrows give his quizzical smile so youll die anyway what have you got to lose a plan began to form in normans mind if he opened the ceiling hatch he could go outside the habitat once outside perhaps he could make his way down to a cyl get back in through the airlock and put his suit on then he would be okay if he could make it to the airlock how long would that take thirty seconds a minute could he hold his breath that long could he withstand the cold that long youll die anyway and then he thought you damn fool youre holding an oxygen bottle in your hand you have enough air if you dont stay here wasting time worrying get on with it no he thought theres something else something im forgetting get on with it so he stopped thinking and climbed up to the ceiling hatch at the top of the cylinder then he held his breath braced himself and spun the wheel opening the hatch norman norman what are you doing norman you are insa he heard beth shout and then the rest was lost in the roar of freezing water pouring like a mighty waterfall into the habitat filling the room the moment he was outside he realized his mistake he needed weights his body was buoyant tugging him up toward the surface he sucked a final breath dropped the oxygen bottle and desperately gripped the cold pipes on the outside of the habitat knowing that if he lost his grip there would be nothing to stop him nothing to grab onto all the way to the surface he would reach the surface and explode like a balloon holding the pipes he pulled himself down hand over hand looking for the next pipe the next protrusion to grab it was like mountainclimbing in reverse if he let go he would fall upward and die his hands were long since numb his body was stiff with cold slow with cold his lungs burned he had very little time he reached the bottom swung under d cyl pulled himself along felt in the darkness for the airlock it wasnt there the airlock was gone then he saw he was beneath b cyl he moved over to a felt the airlock the airlock was closed he tugged the wheel it was shut tight he pulled on it but he could not move it he was locked out the most intense fear gripped him his body was almost immobile from cold he knew he had only a few seconds of consciousness remaining he had to open the hatch he pounded it pounded the metal around the rim feeling nothing in his numb hands the wheel began to spin by itself the hatch popped open there must have been an emergency button he must havehe burst above the surface of the water gasped air and sank again he came back up but he couldnt climb out into the cylinder he was too numb his muscles frozen his body unresponsive you have to do it he thought you have to do it his fingers gripped metal slipped off gripped again one pull he thought one last pull he heaved his chest over the metal rim flopped onto the deck he couldnt feel anything he was so cold he twisted his body trying to pull his legs up and fell back into the icy water no he pulled himself up again one last timeagain over the rim again onto the deck and he twisted twisted one leg up his balance precarious then the other leg he couldnt really feel it and then he was out of the water and lying on the deck he was shivering he tried to stand and fell over his whole body was shaking so hard he could not keep his balance across the airlock he saw his suit hanging on the wall of the cylinder he saw the helmet johnson stenciled on it norman crawled toward the suit his body shaking violently he tried to stand and could not the boots of his suit were directly in front of his face he tried to grip them in his hands but his hands could not close he tried to bite the suit to pull himself up with his teeth but his teeth were chattering uncontrollably the intercom crackled norman i know what youre doing norman any minute beth would be here he had to get into the suit he stared at it inches from him but his hands still shook he could not hold anything finally he saw the fabric loops near the waist to clip instruments he hooked one hand into the loop managed to hold on he pulled himself upright he got one foot into the suit then the other norman he reached for the helmet the helmet drummed in a staccato beat against the wall before he managed to get it free of the peg and drop it over his head he twisted it heard the click of the snaplock he was still very cold why wasnt the suit heating up then he realized no power the power was in the tank pack norman backed up against the tank shrugged it on staggered under the weight he had to hook the umbilicushe reached behind him felt itheld ithook it into the suitat the waisthook it he heard a click the fan hummed he felt long streaks of pain all over his body the electrical elements were heating painful against his frozen skin he felt pins and needles all over beth was talkinghe heard her through the intercombut he couldnt listen to her he sat heavily on the deck breathing hard but already he knew that he was going to be all right the pain was lessening his head was clearing and he was no longer shaking so badly he had been chilled but not long enough for it to be central he was recovering fast the radio crackled youll never get to me norman he got to his feet pulled on his weight belt locked the buckles norman he said nothing he felt quite warm now quite normal norman i am surrounded by explosives if you come anywhere near me i will blow you to pieces youll die norman youll never get near me but norman wasnt going to beth he had another plan entirely he heard his tank air hiss as the pressure equalized in his suit he jumped back into the water hours the sphere gleamed in the light norman saw himself reflected in its perfectly polished surface then saw his image break up fragmented on the convolutions as he moved around to the back to the door it looked like a mouth he thought like the maw of some primitive creature about to eat him confronted by the sphere seeing once again the alien unhuman pattern of the convolutions he felt his intention dissolve he was suddenly afraid he didnt think he could go through with it dont be silly he told himself harry did it and beth did it they survived he examined the convolutions as if for reassurance but there wasnt any reassurance to be obtained just curved grooves in the metal reflecting back the light okay he thought finally ill do it ive come this far ive survived everything so far i might as well do it go ahead and open up but the sphere did not open it remained exactly as it was a gleaming polished perfect shape what was the purpose of the thing he wished he understood its purpose he thought of dr stein again what was steins favorite line understanding is a delaying tactic stein used to get angry about that when the graduate students would intellectualize going on and on about patients and their problems he would interrupt in annoyance who cares who cares whether we understand the psychodynamics in this case do you want to understand how to swim or do you want to jump in and start swimming only people who are afraid of the water want to understand it other people jump in and get wet okay norman thought lets get wet he turned to face the sphere and thought open up the sphere did not open open up he said aloud the sphere did not open of course he knew that wouldnt work because ted had tried it for hours when harry and beth went in they hadnt said anything they just did something in their minds he closed his eyes focused his attention and thought open up he opened his eyes and looked at the sphere it was still closed i am ready for you to open up he thought i am ready now nothing happened the sphere did not open norman hadnt considered the possibility that he would be unable to open the sphere after all two others had already done it how had they managed it harry with his logical brain had been the first to figure it out but harry had only figured it out after he had seen beths tape so harry had discovered a clue in the tape an important clue beth had also reviewed the tape watching it again and again until she finally figured it out too something in the tape too bad he didnt have the tape here norman thought but he had seen it often he could probably reconstruct it play it back in his mind how did it go in his mind he saw the images beth and tina talking beth eating cake then tina had said something about the tapes being stored in the submarine and beth said something back then tina had moved away out of the picture but she had said do you think theyll ever get the sphere open and beth said maybe i dont know and the sphere had opened at that moment why do you think theyll ever get the sphere open tina had asked and in response to such a question beth must have imagined the sphere open must have seen an image of the open sphere in her mind there was a deep low rumble a vibration that filled the room the sphere was open the door gaping wide and black thats it he thought visualize it happening and it happens which meant that if he also visualized the sphere door closed with another deep rumble the sphere closed or open the sphere opened again id better not press my luck he said aloud the door was still open he peered in the doorway but saw only deep undifferentiated blackness its now or never he thought he stepped inside the sphere closed behind him there is darkness and then as his eyes adjust something like fireflies it is a dancing luminous foam millions of points of light swirling around him what is this he thinks all he sees is the foam there is no structure to it and apparently no limit it is a surging ocean a glistening multifaceted foam he feels great beauty and peace it is restful to be here he moves his hands scooping the foam his movements making it swirl but then he notices that his hands are becoming transparent that he can see the sparkling foam through his own flesh he looks down at his body his legs his torso everything is becoming transparent to the foam he is part of the foam the sensation is very pleasant he grows lighter soon he is lifted and floats in the limitless ocean foam he puts his hands behind his neck and floats he feels happy he feels he could stay here forever he becomes aware of something else in this ocean some other presence anybody here he says i am here he almost jumps it is so loud or it seems loud then he wonders if he has heard anything at all did you speak no how are we communicating he wonders the way everything communicates with everything else which way is that why do you ask if you already know the answer but i dont know the answer the foam moves him gently peacefully but he receives no answer for a time he wonders if he is alone again are you there yes i thought you had gone away there is nowhere to go do you mean you are imprisoned inside this sphere no will you answer a question who are you i am not a who are you god god is a word i mean are you a higher being or a higher consciousness higher than what higher than me i suppose how high are you pretty low at least i imagine so well then thats your trouble riding in the foam he is disturbed by the possibility that god is making fun of him he thinks are you making a joke why do you ask if you already know the answer am i talking to god you are not talking at all you take what i say very literally is this because you are from another planet no are you from another planet no are you from another civilization no where are you from why do you ask if you already know the answer in another time he thinks he would be irritated by this repetitive answer but now he feels no emotions there are no judgments he is simply receiving information a response he thinks but this sphere comes from another civilization yes and maybe from another time yes and arent you a part of this sphere i am now so where are you from why do you ask if you already know the answer the foam gently shifts him rocking him soothingly are you still there yes there is nowhere to go im afraid i am not very knowledgeable about religion i am a psychologist i deal with how people think in my training i never learned much about religion oh i see psychology doesnt have much to do with religion of course so you agree i agree with you thats reassuring i dont see why who is i who indeed he rocks in the foam feeling a deep peace despite the difficulties of this conversation i am troubled he thinks tell me i am troubled because you sound like jerry that is to be expected but jerry was really harry yes so are you harry too no of course not who are you i am not a who then why do you sound like jerry or harry because we spring from the same source i dont understand when you look in the mirror who do you see i see myself i see isnt that right its up to you i dont understand what you see is up to you i already know that everybody knows that that is a psychological truism a cliche i see are you an alien intelligence are you an alien intelligence i find you difficult to talk to will you give me the power what power the power you gave to harry and beth the power to make things happen by imagination will you give it to me no why not because you already have it i dont feel as if i have it i know then how is it that i have the power how did you get in here i imagined the door opening yes rocking in the foam waiting for a further response but there is no response there is only gentle movement in the foam a peaceful timelessness and a drowsy sensation after a passage of time he thinks i am sorry but i wish you would just explain and stop speaking in riddles on your planet you have an animal called a bear it is a large animal sometimes larger than you and it is clever and has ingenuity and it has a brain as large as yours but the bear differs from you in one important way it cannot perform the activity you call imagining it cannot make mental images of how reality might be it cannot envision what you call the past and what you call the future this special ability of imagination is what has made yourspecies as great as it is nothing else it is not your apenature not your toolusing nature not language or your violence or your caring for young or your social groupings it is none of these things which are all found in other animals your greatness lies in imagination the ability to imagine is the largest part of what you call intelligence you think the ability to imagine is merely a useful step on the way to solving a problem or making something happen but imagining it is what makes it happen this is the gift of your species and this is the danger because you do not choose to control your imaginings you imagine wonderful things and you imagine terrible things and you take no responsibility for the choice you say you have inside you both the power of good and the power of evil the angel and the devil but in truth you have just one thing inside youthe ability to imagine i hope you enjoyed this speech which i plan to give at the next meeting of the american association of psychologists and social workers which is meeting in houston in march i feel it will be quite well received what he thinks startled who did you think you were talking to god who is this he thinks you of course but you are somebody different from me separate you are not me he thinks yes l am you imagined me tell me more there is no more his cheek rested on cold metal he rolled onto his back and looked at the polished surface of the sphere curving above him the convolutions of the door had changed again norman got to his feet he felt relaxed and at peace as if he had been sleeping a long time he felt as if he had had a wonderful dream he remembered everything quite clearly he moved through the ship back to the flight deck and then down the hallway with the ultraviolet lights to the room with all the tubes on the wall the tubes were filled there was a crewman in each one just as he thought beth had manifested a single crewmana solitary womanas a way of warning them now norman was in charge and he found the room full not bad he thought he looked at the room and thought gone one at a time one by one the crew members in the tubes vanished before his eyes until they were all gone back one at a time the crew members popped back in the tubes materializing on demand all men the women were changed into men all women they all became women he had the power hours norman beths voice over the loudspeakers hissing through the empty spacecraft where are you norman i know youre there somewhere i can feel you norman norman was moving through the kitchen past the empty cans of coke on the counter then through the heavy door and into the flight deck he saw beths face on all the console screens beth seeming to see him the image repeated a dozen times norman i know where youve been youve been inside the sphere havent you norman he pressed the consoles with the flat of his hand trying to turn off the screens he couldnt do it the images remained norman answer me norman he moved past the flight deck going toward the airlock it wont do you any good norman im in charge now do you hear me norman in the airlock he heard a click as his helmet ring locked the air from the tanks was cool and dry he listened to the even sound of his own breathing norman beth on the intercom in his helmet why dont you speak to me norman are you afraid norman the repetition of his name irritated him he pressed the buttons to open the airlock water began to flood in from the floor rising swiftly oh there you are norman i see you now and she began to laugh a high cackling laugh norman turned around saw the video camera mounted on the robot still inside the airlock he shoved the camera spinning it away that wont do any good norman he was back outside the spacecraft standing by the air lock the tevac explosives rows of glowing red dots extended away in erratic lines like an airplane runway laid out by some demented engineer norman why dont you answer me norman beth was unstable erratic he could hear it in her voice he had to deprive her of her weapons to turn off the explosives if he could off he thought lets have the explosives off and disarmed all the red lights immediately went off not bad he thought with a burst of pleasure a moment later the red lights blinked back on you cant do it norman beth said laughing not to me i can fight you he knew she was right they were having an argument a test of wills turning the explosives on and off and the argument couldnt ever be resolved not that way he would have to do something more direct he moved toward the nearest of the tevac explosives up close the cone was larger than he had thought four feet high with a red light at the top i can see you norman i see what youre doing there was writing on the cone yellow letters stenciled on the gray surface norman bent to read it his faceplate was slightly fogged but he could still make out the words danger tevac explosives usn constructiondemolition use only default detonate sequence consult manual usnvva authorized personnel only dangertevac explosives there was still more writing beneath that but it was smaller and he couldnt make it out norman whatre you doing with my explosives norman norman didnt answer her he looked at the wiring one thin cable ran into the base of the cone and a second cable ran out the second cable went along the muddy bottom to the next cone where there were again just two cablesone in and one out get away from there norman youre making me nervous one cable in and one cable out beth had wired the cones together in series like christmastree bulbs by pulling out a single cable norman would disconnect the entire line of explosives he reached forward and gripped the cable in his gloved hand norman dont touch that wire norman take it easy beth his fingers closed around the cable he felt the soft plastic coating gripped it tightly norman if you pull that cable youll set off the explosives i swear to youitll blow you and me and harry and everything to hell norman he didnt think it was true beth was lying beth was out of control and she was dangerous and she was lying to him again he drew his hand back he felt the tension in the cable dont do it norman the cable was now taut in his hand im going to shut you down beth for gods sake norman believe me will you youll kill us all still he hesitated could she be telling the truth did she know about wiring explosives he looked at the big gray cone at his feet reaching up to his waist what would it feel like if it exploded would he feel anything at all the hell with it he said aloud he pulled the cable out of the cone the shriek of the alarm ringing inside his helmet made him jump there was a small liquidcrystal display at the top of his faceplate blinking rapidly emergency emergency oh norman god damn it now youve done it he barely heard her voice over the alarm the red cone lights were blinking all down the length of the spacecraft he braced himself for the explosion but then the alarm was interrupted by a deep resonant male voice that said your attention please your attention please all construction personnel clear the blast area immediately tevac explosives are now activated the countdown will begin now mark twenty and counting on the cone a red display flashed then it began counting backward the same display was repeated on the crystal display at the top of his helmet it took him a moment to put it together to understand staring at the cone he read the yellow lettering once again usn constructiondemolition use only of course tevac explosives werent weapons they were made for construction and demolition they had builtin safety timersa programmed twentyminute delay before they went off to allow workers to get away twenty minutes to get away he thought that would give him plenty of time norman turned and began striding quickly toward dh and the submarine hours he walked evenly steadily he felt no strain his breath came easily he was comfortable in his suit all systems working smoothly he was leaving norman please now beth was pleading with him another erratic shift of mood norman ignored her he continued on toward the submarine the deep recorded voice said your attention please all navy personnel clear the blast area nineteen minutes and counting norman felt an enormous sense of purposefulness of power he had no illusions any more he had no questions he knew what he had to do he had to save himself i dont believe youre doing this norman i dont believe youre abandoning us believe it he thought after all what choice did he have beth was out of control and dangerous it was too late to save her nowin fact it was crazy to go anywhere near her beth was homicidal shed already tried to kill him once and had nearly succeeded and harry had been drugged for thirteen hours by now he was probably clinically dead braindead there was no reason for norman to stay there was nothing for him to do the sub was close now he could see the fittings on the yellow exterior norman please i need you sorry he thought im getting out of here he moved around beneath the twin propellor screws the name painted on the curved hull deepstar iii he climbed the footholds moving up into the dome norman now he was out of contact with the intercom he was on his own he opened the hatch climbed inside the submarine he unlocked his helmet pulled it off your attention please eighteen minutes and counting norman sat in the pilots padded seat faced the controls the instruments blinked on and the screen directly before him glowed deepstar iii command module do you require help yes no cancel he pressed yes he waited for the next screen to flash up it was too bad about harry and beth he was sorry to leave them behind but they had both in their own ways failed to explore their inner selves thus making them vulnerable to the sphere and its power it was a classic scientific error this socalled triumph of rational thought over irrational thought scientists refused to acknowledge their irrational side refused to see it as important they dealt only with the rational everything made sense to a scientist and if it didnt make sense it was dismissed as what einstein called the merely personal the merely personal he thought in a burst of contempt people killed each other for reasons that were merely personal deepstar iii checklist options descend ascend secure shutdown monitor cancel norman pressed ascend the screen changed to the drawing of the instrument panel with the flashing point he waited for the next instruction yes he thought it was true scientists refused to deal with the irrational but the irrational side didnt go away if you refused to deal with it irrationality didnt atrophy with disuse on the contrary left unattended the irrational side of man had grown in power and scope and complaining about it didnt help either all those scientists whining in the sunday supplements about mans inherent destructiveness and his propensity for violence throwing up their hands that wasnt dealing with the irrational side that was just a formal admission that they were giving up on it the screen changed again deepstar iii ascend checklist set ballast blowers to on proceed to next cancel norman pushed buttons on the panel setting the ballast blowers and waited for the next screen after all how did scientists approach their own research the scientists all agreed scientific research cant be stopped if we dont build the bomb someone else will but then pretty soon the bomb was in the hands of new people who said if we dont use the bomb someone else will at which point the scientists said those other people are terrible people theyre irrational and irresponsible we scientists are okay but those other people are a real problem yet the truth was that responsibility began with each individual person and the choices he made each person had a choice well norman thought there was nothing he could do for harry or beth any longer he had to save himself he heard a deep hum as the generators turned on and the throb of the propellors the screen flashed deepstar iii pilot instruments activated here we go he thought resting his hands confidently on the controls he felt the submarine respond beneath him your attention please seventeen minutes and counting muddy sediment churned up around the canopy as the screws engaged and then the little submarine slipped out from beneath the dome it was just like driving a car he thought there was nothing to it he turned in a slow arc away from dh toward dh he was twenty feet above the bottom high enough for the screws to clear the mud there were seventeen minutes left at a maximum ascent rate of feet per secondhe did the mental calculation quickly effortlesslyhe would reach the surface in two and a half minutes there was plenty of time he moved the submarine close to dh the exterior habitat floodlights were yellow and pale power must be dropping he could see the damage to the cylindersstreams of bubbles rising from the weakened a and b cylinders the dents in the d and the gaping hole in e cyl which was flooded the habitat was battered and dying why had he come so close he squinted at the portholes then realized he was hoping to catch sight of harry and beth one last time he wanted to see harry unconscious and unresponsive he wanted to see beth standing at the window shaking her fist at him in maniacal rage he wanted confirmation that he was right to leave them but he saw only the fading yellow light inside the habitat he was disappointed norman yes beth he felt comfortable answering her now he had his hands on the controls of the submarine ready to make his ascent there was nothing she could do to him now norman you really are a son of a bitch you tried to kill me beth i didnt want to kill you i had no choice norman yeah well me too i have no choice as he spoke he knew he was right better for one person to survive better than nothing youre just going to leave us thats right beth his hand moved to the ascentrate dial he set it to feet ready to ascend youre just going to run away he heard the contempt in her voice thats right beth you the one who kept talking about how we had to stay together down here sorry beth you must be very afraid norman im not afraid at all and indeed he felt strong and confident setting the controls preparing for his ascent he felt better than he had felt for days norman she said please help us please her words struck him at some deep level arousing feelings of caring of professional competence of simple human kindness for a moment he felt confusion his strength and conviction weakened but then he got a grip on himself and shook his head the strength flew back into his body sorry beth its too late for that and he pressed the ascend button heard the roar as the ballast tanks blew and deepstar iii swayed the habitat slipped away below him and he started toward the surface a thousand feet above black water no sense of movement except for the readings on the glowing green instrument panel he began to review the events in his mind as if he were already facing a navy inquiry had he done the right thing leaving the others behind unquestionably he had the sphere was an alien object which gave a person the power to manifest his thoughts well and good except that human beings had a split in their brains a split in their mental processes it was almost as if men had two brains the conscious brain could be consciously controlled and presented no problem but the unconscious brain wild and abandoned was dangerous and destructive when its impulses were manifested the trouble with people like harry and beth was that they were literally unbalanced their conscious brains were overdeveloped but they had never bothered to explore their unconscious that was the difference between norman and them as a psychologist norman had some acquaintance with his unconscious it held no surprises for him that was why harry and beth had manifested monsters but norman had not norman knew his unconscious no monsters awaited him no wrong he was startled by the suddenness of the thought the abruptness of it was he really wrong he considered carefully and decided once again that he was correct after all beth and harry were at risk from the products of their unconscious but norman was not norman knew himself the others did not the fears unleashed by contact with a new life form are not understood the most likely consequence of contact is absolute terror the statements from his own report popped into his head why should he think of them now it had been years since he had written his report under circumstances of extreme terror people make decisions poorly yet norman wasnt afraid far from it he was confident and strong he had a plan he was carrying it out why should he even think of that report at the time hed agonized over it thinking of each sentence why was it coming to mind now it troubled him your attention please sixteen minutes and counting norman scanned the gauges before him he was at nine hundred feet rising swiftly there was no turning back now why should he even think of turning back why should it enter his mind as he rose silently through black water he increasingly felt a kind of split inside himself an almost schizophrenic internal division something was wrong he sensed there was something he hadnt considered yet but what could he have overlooked nothing he decided because unlike beth and harry i am fully conscious i am aware of everything that is happening inside me except norman didnt really believe that complete awareness might be a philosophical goal but it was not really attainable consciousness was like a pebble that rippled the surface of the unconscious as consciousness widened there was still more unconsciousness beyond there was always more just beyond reach even for a humanistic psychologist stein his old professor you always have your shadow what was normans shadow side doing now what was happening in the unconscious denied parts of his own brain nothing keep going up he shifted uneasily in the pilots chair he wanted to go to the surface so badly he felt such conviction i hate beth i hate harry i hate worrying about these people caring for them i dont want to care any more its not my responsibility i want to save myself i hate them i hate them he was shocked shocked by his own thoughts the vehemence of them i must go back he thought if i go back i will die but some other part of himself was growing stronger with each moment what beth had said was true norman had been the one who kept saying that they had to stay together to work together how could he abandon them now he couldnt it was against everything he believed in everything that was important and human he had to go back i am afraid to go back at last he thought there it is fear so strong he had denied its existence fear that had caused him to rationalize abandoning the others he pressed the controls halting his ascent as he started back down he saw that his hands were shaking hours the sub came to rest gently on the bottom beside the habitat norman stepped into the submarine airlock flooded the chamber moments later he climbed down the side and walked toward the habitat the tevac explosives cones with their blinking red lights looked oddly festive your attention please fourteen minutes and counting he estimated the time he would need one minute to get inside five maybe six minutes to dress beth and harry in the suits another four minutes to reach the sub and get them aboard two or three minutes to make the ascent it was going to be close he moved beneath the big support pylons under the habitat so you came back norman beth said over the intercom yes beth thank god she said she started to cry he was beneath a cyl hearing her sobs over the intercom he found the hatch cover spun the wheel to open it it was locked shut beth open the hatch she was crying over the intercom she didnt answer him beth can you hear me open the hatch crying like a child sobbing hysterically norman she said please help me please im trying to help you beth open the hatch i cant what do you mean you cant it wont do any good beth he said come on now i cant do it norman of course you can open the hatch beth you shouldnt have come back norman there was no time for this now beth pull yourself together open the hatch no norman i cant and she began crying again he tried all the hatches one after another b cyl locked c cyl locked d cyl locked your attention please thirteen minutes and counting he was standing by e cyl which had been flooded in an earlier attack he saw the gaping jagged tear in the outer cylinder surface the hole was large enough for him to climb through but the edges were sharp and if he tore his suit no he decided it was too risky he moved beneath e cyl was there a hatch he found a hatch spun the wheel it opened easily he pushed the circular lid upward heard it clang against the inner wall norman is that you he hauled himself up into e cyl he was panting from the exertion on his hands and knees on the deck of e cyl he shut the hatch and locked it again then took a moment to get his breath your attention please twelve minutes and counting jesus he thought already something white drifted past his faceplate startling him he pulled back realized it was a box of corn flakes when he touched it the cardboard disintegrated in his hands the flakes like yellow snow he was in the kitchen beyond the stove he saw another hatch leading to d cyl d cyl was not flooded which meant that he must somehow pressurize e cyl he looked up saw an overhead bulkhead hatch leading to the living room with the gaping tear he climbed up quickly he needed to find gas some kind of tanks the living room was dark except for the reflected light from the floodlights which filtered in through the tear cushions and padding floated in the water something touched him and he spun and saw dark hair streaming around a face and as the hair moved he saw part of the face was missing torn away grotesquely tina norman shuddered pushed her body away it drifted off moving upward your attention please eleven minutes and counting it was all happening too fast he thought there was hardly enough time left he needed to be inside the habitat now no tanks in the living room he climbed back down to the kitchen shutting the hatch above he looked at the stove the ovens he opened the oven door and a burst of gas bubbled out air trapped in the oven but that couldnt be right he thought because gas was still coming out a trickle of bubbles continued to come from the open oven a steady trickle what had barnes said about cooking under pressure there was something unusual about it he couldnt remember exactly did they use gas yes but they also needed more oxygen that meant he pulled the stove away from the wall grunting with exertion and then he found it a squat bottle of propane and two large blue tanks oxygen tanks he twisted the yvalves his gloved fingers clumsy gas began to roar out the bubbles rushed up to the ceiling where the gas was trapped the big air bubble that was forming he opened the second oxygen tank the water level fell rapidly to his waist then his knees then it stopped the tanks must be empty no matter the level was low enough your attention please ten minutes and counting norman opened the bulkhead door to d cyl and stepped through into the habitat the light was dim a strange green slimy mold covered the walls on the couch harry lay unconscious the intravenous line still in his arm norman pulled the needle out with a spurt of blood he shook harry trying to rouse him harrys eyelids fluttered but he was otherwise unresponsive norman lifted him put him over his shoulder carried him through the habitat on the intercom beth was still crying norman you shouldnt have come where are you beth on the monitors he read detonation sequence counting backward the numbers seemed too to move fast take harry and go norman both of you go leave me behind tell me where you are beth he was moving through the habitat from d to c cyl he didnt see her anywhere harry was a dead weight on his shoulder making it difficult to get through the bulkhead doors it wont do any good norman come on beth i know im bad norman i know i cant be helped beth he was hearing her through the helmet radio so he could not locate her by the sound but he could not risk removing his helmet not now i deserve to die norman cut it out beth attention please nine minutes and counting a new alarm sounded an intermittent beeping that became louder and more intense as the seconds ticked by he was in b cyl a maze of pipes and equipment once clean and multicolored now the slimy mold coated every surface in some places fibrous mossy strands hung down b cyl looked like a jungle swamp beth she was silent now she must be in this room he thought b cyl had always been beths favorite place the place where the habitat was controlled he put harry on the deck propped him against a wall but the wall was slippery and harry slid down banged his head he coughed opened his eyes jesus norman norman held his hand up signaling harry to be quiet beth norman said no answer norman moved among the slimy pipes beth leave me norman i cant do that beth im taking you too no im staying norman beth he said theres no time for this im staying norman i deserve to stay he saw her beth was huddled in the back wedged among pipes crying like a child she held one of the explosivetipped spear guns in her hand she looked at him tearfully oh norman she said you were going to leave us im sorry i was wrong he started toward her holding out his hands to her she swung the spear gun around no you were right you were right i want you to leave now above her head he saw a glowing monitor the numbers clicking inexorably backward he thought i can change this i want the numbers to stop counting the numbers did not stop you cant fight me norman she said huddled in the corner her eyes blazed with furious energy i can see that there isnt much time norman i want you to leave she held the gun pointed firmly toward him he had a sudden sense of the absurdity of it all that he had come back to rescue someone who didnt want to be rescued what could he do now beth was wedged back in there beyond his reach beyond his help there was barely enough time for him to get away let alone to take harry harry he thought suddenly where was harry now i want harry to help me but he wondered if there was time the numbers were clicking backward there was hardly more than eight minutes now i came back for you beth go she said go now norman but beth no norman i mean it go why dont you go and then she began to get suspicious she started to look around and at that moment harry stood up behind her and swung the big wrench down on her head and there was a sickening thud and she fell did i kill her harry said and the deep male voice said attention please eight minutes and counting norman concentrated on the clock as it ticked backwards stop stop the countdown but when he looked again the clock was still ticking backwards and the alarm was the alarm interfering with his concentration he tried again stop now the countdown will stop now the countdown has stopped forget it harry said it wont work but it should work norman said no harry said because shes not completely unconscious on the floor at their feet beth groaned her leg moved shes still able to control it somehow norman said shes very strong can we inject her norman shook his head there was no time to go back for the syringe anyway if they injected her and it didnt work it would be time wasted hit her again harry said harder kill her no norman said killing her is the only way no norman said thinking we didnt kill you harry when we had the chance if you wont kill her then you cant do anything about that timer harry said so we better get the hell out they ran for the airlock how much time is left harry said they were in the a cyl airlock trying to put the suit on beth she was groaning blood was matted on the back of her head beth struggled a little making it more difficult jesus bethhow much time norman seven and a half minutes maybe less her legs were in they quickly pushed her arms in zipped up the chest they turned on her air norman helped harry with his suit attention please seven minutes and counting harry said how much time you figure to get to the surface two and a half minutes after we get inside the sub norman said great harry said norman snapped harrys helmet locked lets go harry descended into the water and norman lowered beths unconscious body she was heavy with the tank and weights come on norman norman plunged into the water at the submarine norman climbed up to the hatch entrance but the untethered sub rolled unpredictably with his weight harry standing on the bottom tried to push beth up toward norman but beth kept bending over at the waist norman grabbing for her fell off the sub and slid to the bottom attention please six minutes and counting hurry norman six minutes i heard damn it norman got to his feet climbed back on the sub but now his suit was muddy his gloves slippery harry was counting five twentynine five twentyeight five twentyseven norman caught beths arm but she slipped away again damn it norman hold on to her im trying here here she is again attention please five minutes and counting the alarm was now highpitched beeping insistently they had to shout over it to be heard harry give her to me well here take her missed here norman finally caught beths air hose in his hand just behind the helmet he wondered if it would pull out but he had to risk it gripping the hose he hauled beth up until she lay on her back on the top of the sub then he eased her down into the hatch four twentynine four twentyeight norman had trouble keeping his balance he got one of beths legs into the hatch but the other knee was bent jammed against the lip of the hatch he couldnt get her down every time he leaned forward to unbend her leg the whole submarine tipped and he would start to lose his balance again four sixteen four fifteen would you stop counting and do something harry pressed his body against the side of the submarine countering the rolling with his weight norman leaned forward and pressed beths knee straight she slid easily into the open hatch norman climbed in after her it was a oneman airlock but beth was unconscious and could not work the controls he would have to do it for her attention please four minutes and counting he was cramped in the airlock his body pressed up against beth chest to chest her helmet banging against his with difficulty he pulled the hatch closed over his head he blew out the water in a furious rush of compressed air unsupported by the water beths body now sagged heavily against him he reached around her for the handle to the inner hatch beths body blocked his way he tried to twist her around sideways in the confined space he couldnt get any leverage on the body beth was like a dead weight he tried to shift her body around to get to the hatch the whole submarine began to sway harry was climbing up the side what the hells going on in there harry will you shut up well whats the delay normans hand closed on the inner latch handle he shoved it down but the door didnt move the door was hinged to swing inward he couldnt open it with beth in the hatch with him it was too crowded her body blocked the movement of the door harry weve got a problem jesus christ three minutes thirty norman began to sweat they were really in trouble now harry ive got to pass her out to you and go in alone jesus norman norman flooded the airlock opened the upper hatch once again harrys balance atop the submarine was precarious he grabbed beth by the air hose dragged her up norman reached up to close the hatch harry can you get her feet out of the way im trying to keep my balance here cant you see her feet are blocking irritably norman pushed beths feet aside the hatch clanged down the air blasted past him the hatch pressurized attention please two minutes and counting he was inside the submarine the instruments glowed green he opened the inner hatch norman try and get her down norman said do it as fast as you can but he was thinking they were in terrible trouble at least thirty seconds to get beth into the hatch and thirty seconds more for harry to come down a minute all together shes in vent it norman jumped for the air vent blew out the water howd you get her in so fast harry natures way harry said to get people through tight spaces and before norman could ask what that meant he had opened the hatch and saw that harry had pushed beth into the airlock head first he grabbed her shoulders and eased her onto the floor of the submarine then slammed the hatch shut moments later he heard the blast of air as harry too vented the airlock the submarine hatch clanged harry came forward christ one minute forty harry said do you know how to work this thing yes norman sat in the seat placed his hands on the controls they heard the whine of the props felt the rumble the sub lurched moved off the bottom one minute thirty seconds how long did you say to the surface two thirty norman said cranking up the ascent rate he pushed it past to the far end of the dial they heard a highpitched shriek of air as the ballast tanks blew the sub nosed up sharply began to rise swiftly is this as fast as it goes yes jesus take it easy harry looking back down they could see the habitat with its lights and then the long lines of explosives set over the spaceship itself they rose past the high fin of the spacecraft leaving it behind seeing only black water now one minute twenty nine hundred feet norman said there was very little sensation of movement only the changing dials on the instrument panel to tell them they were moving its not fast enough harry said thats a hell of a lot of explosive down there it is fast enough norman thought correcting him the shock wave will crush us like a can of sardines harry said shaking his head the shock wave will not harm us eight hundred feet forty seconds harry said well never make it well make it they were at seven hundred feet rising fast the water now had a faint blue color sunlight filtering down thirty seconds harry said where are we twentynine eight six hundred twenty feet norman said six ten they looked back down the side of the sub they could barely discern the habitat faint pinpricks of light far beneath them beth coughed its too late now harry said i knew from the beginning wed never make it yes we will norman said ten seconds harry said nine eight brace yourself norman pulled beth to his chest as the explosion rocked the submarine spinning it like a toy upending it then righting it again and lifting it in a giant upward surge mama harry shouted but they were still rising they were okay we did it two hundred feet norman said the water outside was now light blue he pushed buttons slowing the ascent they were going up very fast harry was screaming pounding norman on the back we did it god damn it you son of a bitch we did it we survived i never thought we would we survived norman was having trouble seeing the instruments for tears in his eyes and then he had to squint as bright sunlight streamed into the bubble canopy as they surfaced and they saw calm seas sky and fluffy clouds do you see that harry cried he was screaming in normans ear do you see that it is a perfect goddamned day hours norman awoke to see a brilliant shaft of light streaming through the single porthole shining down on the chemical toilet in the corner of the decompression chamber he lay on his bunk and looked around the chamber a horizontal cylinder fifty feet long bunks a metal table and chairs in the center of the cylinder toilet behind a small partition harry snored in the bunk above him across the chamber beth slept one arm flung over her face faintly from a distance he heard men shouting norman yawned and swung off the bunk his body was sore but he was otherwise all right he walked to the shining porthole and looked out squinting in the bright pacific sun he saw the rear deck of the research ship john hawes the white helicopter pad heavy coiled cables the tubular metal frame of an underwater robot a navy crew was lowering a second robot over the side with a lot of shouting and swearing and waving of hands norman had heard their voices faintly through the thick steel walls of the chamber near the chamber itself a muscular seaman rolled a large green tank marked oxygen alongside a dozen other tanks on the deck the threeman medical crew which supervised the decompression chamber played cards looking through the inchthick glass of the porthole norman felt as if he were peering into a miniature world to which he had little connection a kind of terrarium populated by interesting and exotic specimens this new world was as alien to him as the dark ocean world had once seemed from inside the habitat he watched the crew slap down their cards on a wooden packing crate watched them laugh and gesture as the game proceeded they never glanced in his direction never looked at the decompression chamber norman didnt understand these young men were they supposed to be paying attention to the decompression they looked young and inexperienced to norman focused on their card game they seemed indifferent to the huge metal chamber nearby indifferent to the three survivors inside the chamberand indifferent to the larger meaning of the mission to the news the survivors had brought back to the surface these cheerful navy cardplayers didnt seem to give a damn about normans mission but perhaps they didnt know he turned back to the chamber sat down at the table his knee throbbed and the skin was swollen around the white bandage he had been treated by a navy physician during their transfer from the submarine to the decompression chamber they had been taken off the minisub deepstar iii in a pressurized diving bell and from there had been transferred to the large chamber on the deck of the shipthe sdc the navy called it the surface decompression chamber they were going to spend four days here norman wasnt sure how long he had been here so far they had all immediately gone to sleep and there was no clock in the chamber the face of his own wristwatch was smashed although he didnt remember it happening on the table in front of him someone had scratched usn sucks into the surface norman ran his fingers over the grooves and remembered the grooves in the silver sphere but he and harry and beth were in the hands of the navy now and he thought what are we going to tell them what are we going to tell them beth said it was several hours later beth and harry had awakened and now they were all sitting around the scarred metal table none of them had made any attempt to talk to the crew outside it was norman thought as if they shared an unspoken agreement to remain in isolation a while longer i think well have to tell them everything harry said i dont think we should norman said he was surprised by the strength of his conviction the firmness of his own voice i agree beth said im not sure the world is ready for that sphere i certainly wasnt she gave norman a sheepish look he put his hand on her shoulder thats fine harry said but look at it from the standpoint of the navy the navy has mounted a large and expensive operation six people have died and two habitats have been destroyed theyre going to want answersand theyre going to keep asking until they get them we can refuse to talk beth said that wont make any difference harry said remember the navy has all the tapes thats right the tapes norman said he had forgotten about the videotapes they had brought up in the submarine dozens of tapes documenting everything that had happened in the habitat during their time underwater documenting the squid the deaths the sphere documenting everything we should have destroyed those tapes beth said perhaps we should have harry said but its too late now we cant prevent the navy from getting the answers they want norman sighed harry was right at this point there was no way to conceal what had happened or to prevent the navy from finding out about the sphere and the power it conveyed that power would represent a kind of ultimate weapon the ability to overcome your enemies simply by imagining it had happened it was frightening in its implications and there was nothing they could do about it unless i think we can prevent them from knowing norman said how harry said we still have the power dont we i guess so and that power norman said consists of the ability to make anything happen simply by thinking it yes then we can prevent the navy from knowing we can decide to forget the whole thing harry frowned thats an interesting question whether we have the power to forget the power i think we should forget it beth said that sphere is too dangerous they fell silent considering the implications of forgetting the sphere because forgetting would not merely prevent the navy from knowing about the sphereit would erase all knowledge of it including their own make it vanish from human consciousness as if it had never existed in the first place remove it from the awareness of the human species forever big step harry said after all weve been through just to forget about it its because of all weve been through harry beth said lets face itwe didnt handle ourselves very well norman noticed that she spoke without rancor now her previous combative edge gone im afraid thats true norman saidthe sphere was built to test whatever intelligent life might pick it up and we simply failed that test is that what you think the sphere was made for h said i dont then what norman said well harry said look at it this way suppose you were an intelligent bacterium floating in space and you came upon one of our communication satellites in orbit around the earth you would think what a strange alien object this is lets explore it suppose you opened it up and crawled inside you would find it very interesting in there with lots of huge things to puzzle over but eventually you might climb into one of the fuel cells and the hydrogen would kill you and your last thought would be this alien device was obviously made to test bacterial intelligence and to kill us if we make a false step now that would be correct from the standpoint of the dying bacterium but that wouldnt be correct at all from the standpoint of the beings who made the satellite from our point of view the communications satellite has nothing to do with intelligent bacteria we dont even know that there are intelligent bacteria out there were just trying to communicate and weve made what we consider a quite ordinary device to do it you mean the sphere might not be a message or a trophy or a trap at all thats right harry said the sphere may have nothing to do with the search for other life forms or testing life as we might imagine those activities to occur it may be an accident that the sphere causes such profound changes in us but why would someone build such a machine norman said thats the same question an intelligent bacterium would ask about a communications satellite why would anyone build such a thing for that matter beth said it may not be a machine the sphere may be a life form it may be alive possible harry said nodding beth said so if the sphere is alive do we have an obligation to keep it alive we dont know if it is alive norman sat back in the chair all this speculation is interesting he said but when you get down to it we dont really know anything about the sphere in fact we shouldnt even be calling it the sphere we probably should just call it sphere because we dont know what it is we dont know where it came from we dont know whether its living or dead we dont know how it came to be inside that spaceship we dont know anything about it except what we imagineand what we imagine says more about us than it does about the sphere right harry said because its literally a sort of mirror for us norman said speaking of which theres another possibility harry said it may not be alien at all it may be manmade that took norman completely by surprise harry explained consider harry said a ship from our own future went through a black hole into another universe or another part of our universe we cannot imagine what would happen as a result of that but suppose there were some major distortion of time suppose that ship which left with a human crew in the year actually has been in transit for thousands and thousands of years couldnt the human crew have invented it during that time i dont think thats likely beth said well lets consider for a moment beth harry said gently norman noticed that harry wasnt arrogant any more they were all in this together norman thought and they were working together in a way they never had before all the time underwater they had been at odds but now they functioned smoothly together coordinated a team there is a real problem about the future harry was saying and we dont admit it we assume we can see into the future better than we really can leonardo da vinci tried to make a helicopter five hundred years ago and jules verne predicted a submarine a hundred years ago from instances like that we tend to believe that the future is predictable in a way that it really isnt because neither leonardo nor jules verne could ever have imagined say a computer the very concept of a computer implies too much knowledge that was simply inconceivable at the time those men were alive it was if you will information that came out of nowhere later on and were no wiser sitting here now we couldnt have guessed that men would send a ship through a black holewe didnt even suspect the existence of black holes until a few years agoand we certainly cant guess what men might accomplish thousands of years in the future assuming the sphere was made by men yes assuming that and if it wasnt if its really a sphere from an alien civilization are we justified in erasing all human knowledge of this alien life i dont know harry said shaking his head if we decide to forget the sphere then itll be gone norman said beth stared at the table i wish we could ask someone she said finally there isnt anybody to ask norman said but can we really forget it beth said will it work there was a long silence yes harry said finally theres no question about it and i think we already have evidence that we will forget about it that solves a logical problem that bothered me from the beginning when we first explored the ship because something very important was missing from that ship yes what any sign that the builders of the ship already knew travel through a black hole was possible i dont follow you norman said well harry said the three of us have already seen a spaceship that has been through a black hole weve walked through it so we know that such travel is possible yes yet fifty years from now men are going to build that ship in a very tentative experimental way with apparently no knowledge that the ship has already been found fifty years in their past there is no sign on the ship that the builders already know of its existence in the past maybe its one of those time paradoxes beth said you know how you cant go back and meet yourself in the past harry shook his head i dont think its a paradox he said i think that all knowledge of that ship is going to be lost you mean we are going to forget it yes harry said and frankly i think its a much better solution for a long time while we were down there i assumed none of us would ever get back alive that was the only explanation i could think of thats why i wanted to make out my will but if we decide to forget exactly harry said if we decide to forget that will produce the same result the knowledge will be gone forever norman said quietly he found himself hesitating now that they had arrived at this moment he was strangely reluctant to proceed he ran his fingertips over the scarred table touching the surface as if it might provide an answer in a sense he thought all we consist of is memories our personalities are constructed from memories our lives are organized around memories our cultures are built upon the foundation of shared memories that we call history and science but now to give up a memory to give up knowledge to give up the past its not easy harry said shaking his head no norman said its not in fact he found it so difficult he wondered if he was experiencing a human characteristic as fundamental as sexual desire he simply could not give up this knowledge the information seemed so important to him the implications so fascinating his entire being rebelled against the idea of forgetting well harry said i think we have to do it anyway i was thinking of ted beth said and barnes and the others were the only ones who know how they really died what they gave their lives for and if we forget when we forget norman said firmly she has a point harry said if we forget how do we handle all the details all the loose ends i dont think thats a problem norman said the unconscious has tremendous creative powers as weve seen the details will be taken care of unconsciously its like the way we get dressed in the morning when we dress we dont necessarily think of every detail the belt and the socks and so on we just make a basic overall decision about how we want to look and then we get dressed even so harry said we still better make the overall decision because we all have the power and if we imagine different stories well get confusion all right norman said lets agree on what happened why did we come here i thought it was going to be an airplane crash me too okay suppose it was an airplane crash fine and what happened the navy sent some people down to investigate the crash and a problem developed wait a minute what problem the squid no better a technical problem something to do with the storm lifesupport systems failed during the storm yes good lifesupport systems failed during the storm and several people died as a result wait a minute lets not go so fast what made the lifesupport systems fail beth said the habitat developed a leak and sea water corrupted the scrubber canisters in b cyl releasing a toxic gas could that have happened norman said yes easily and several people died as a result of that accident okay but we survived yes why norman said we were in the other habitat norman shook his head the other habitat was destroyed too maybe it was destroyed later with the explosives too complicated norman said lets keep it simple it was an accident which happened suddenly and unexpectedly the habitat sprang a leak and the scrubbers failed and as a result most of the people died but we didnt because we were in the sub okay norman said we were in the sub when the systems failed so we survived and the others didnt why were we in the sub we were transferring the tapes according to the schedule and what about the tapes harry said what will they show the tapes will confirm our story norman said everything will be consistent with the story including the navy people who sent us down in the first place and including us toowe wont remember anything but this story and we wont have the power any more beth said frowning no norman said not any more okay harry said beth seemed to think about it longer biting her lip but finally she nodded okay norman took a deep breath and looked at beth and harry are we ready to forget the sphere and the fact that we once had the power to make things happen by thinking them they nodded beth became suddenly agitated twisting in her chair but how do we do it exactly we just do it norman said close your eyes and tell yourself to forget it beth said but are you sure we should do it really sure she was still agitated moving nervously yes beth you just give up the power then we have to do it all together she said at the same time okay harry said on the count of three they closed their eyes one with his eyes closed norman thought people always forget that they have power anyway twoharry said and then norman focused his mind with a sudden intensity he saw the sphere again shining like a star perfect and polished and he thought i want to forget i ever saw the sphere and in his minds eye the sphere vanished three harry said three what norman said his eyes ached and burned he rubbed them with his thumb and forefinger then opened them beth and harry were sitting around the table in the decompression chamber with him they all looked tired and depressed but that was to be expected he thought considering what they had all been through three what norman said again oh harry said i was just thinking out loud only three of us left beth sighed norman saw tears in her eyes she fumbled in her pocket for a kleenex blew her nose you cant blame yourselves norman said it was an accident there was nothing we could do about it i know harry said but those people suffocating while we were in the submarine i keep hearing the screams god i wish it had never happened there was a silence beth blew her nose again norman wished it had never happened too but wishing wasnt going to make a difference now we cant change what happened norman said we can only learn to accept it i know beth said ive had a lot of experience with accident trauma he said you simply have to keep telling yourself that you have no reason to be guilty what happened happenedsome people died and you were spared it isnt anybodys fault its just one of those things it was an accident i know that harry said but i still feel bad keep telling yourself its just one of those things norman said keep reminding yourself of that he got up from the table they ought to eat he thought they ought to have food im going to ask for food im not hungry beth said i know that but we should eat anyway norman walked to the porthole the attentive navy crew saw him at once pressed the radio intercom do anything for you dr johnson yes norman said we need some food right away sir norman saw the sympathy on the faces of the navy crew these senior men understood what a shock it must be for the three survivors dr johnson are your people ready to talk to somebody now talk yes sir the intelligence experts have been reviewing the videotapes from the submarine and they have some questions for you what about norman asked without much interest well when you were transferred to the sdc dr adams mentioned something about a squid did he yes sir only there doesnt seem to be any squid recorded on the tapes i dont remember any squid norman said puzzled he turned to harry did you say something about a squid harry harry frowned a squid i dont think so norman turned back to the navy man what do the videotapes show exactly well the tapes go right up to the time when the air in the habitat you know the accident yes norman said i remember the accident from the tapes we think we know what happened apparently there was a leak in the habitat wall and the scrubber cylinders got wet they became inoperable and the ambient atmosphere went bad i see it must have happened very suddenly sir yes johnson said yes it did so are you ready to talk to someone now i think so yes norman turned away from the porthole he put his hands in the pockets of his jacket and felt a piece of paper he pulled out a picture and stared at it curiously it was a photograph of a red corvette norman wondered where the picture had come from probably a car that belonged to someone else who had worn the jacket before norman probably one of the navy people who had died in the underwater disaster norman shivered crumpled the picture in his fist and tossed it into the trash he didnt need any mementos he remembered that disaster only too well he knew he would never forget it for the rest of his life he glanced back at beth and harry they both looked tired beth stared into space preoccupied with her own thoughts but her face was serene despite the hardships of their time underwater norman thought she looked almost beautiful you know beth he said you look lovely beth did not seem to hear but then she turned toward him slowly why thank you norman she said and she smiled
