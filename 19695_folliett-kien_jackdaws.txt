ken follett jackdaws exactly fifty women were sent into france as secret agents by the special operations executive during the second world war of those thirtysix survived the war the other fourteen gave their lives this book is dedicated to all of them the first day sunday may chapter i one minute before the explosion the square at sainteccile was at peace the evening was warm and a layer of still air covered the town like a blanket the church bell tolled a lazy beat calling worshipers to the service with little enthusiasm to felicity clairet it sounded like a countdown the square was dominated by the seventeenthcentury chfteau a small version of versailles it had a grand projecting front entrance and wings on both sides that turned right angles and tailed off rearwards there was a basement and two main floors topped by a tall roof with arched dormer windows felicity who was always called flick loved france she enjoyed its graceful buildings its mild weather its leisurely lunches its cultured people she liked french paintings french literature and stylish french clothes visitors often found the french people unfriendly but flick had been speaking the language since she was six years old and no one could tell she was a foreigner it angered her that the france she loved no longer existed there was not enough food for leisurely lunches the paintings had all been stolen by the nazis and only the whores had pretty clothes like most women flick was wearing a shapeless dress whose colors had long ago been washed to dullness her hearts desire was that the real france would come back it might return soon if she and people like her did what they were supposed to she might not live to see itindeed she might not survive the next few minutes she was no fatalist she wanted to live there were a hundred things she planned to do after the war finish her doctorate have a baby see new york own a sports car drink champagne on the beach at cannes but if she was about to die she was glad to be spending her last few moments in a sunlit square looking at a beautiful old house with the lilting sounds of the french language soft in her ears the chfteau had been built as a home for the local aristocracy but the last comte de sainteccile had lost his head on the guillotine in the ornamental gardens had long ago been turned into vineyards for this was wine country the heart of the champagne district the building now housed an important telephone exchange sited here because the government minister responsible had been born in sainteccile when the germans came they enlarged the exchange to provide connections between the french system and the new cable route to germany they also sited a gestapo regional headquarters in the building with offices on the upper floors and cells in the basement four weeks ago the chfteau had been bombed by the allies such precision bombing was new the heavy fourengined lancasters and flying fortresses that roared high over europe every night were inaccuratethey sometimes missed an entire citybut the latest generation of fighterbombers the lightnings and thunderbolts could sneak in by day and hit a small target a bridge or a railway station much of the west wing of the chfteau was now a heap of irregular seventeenthcentury red bricks and square white stones but the air raid had failed repairs were made quickly and the phone service had been disrupted only as long as it took the germans to install replacement switchboards all the automatic telephone equipment and the vital amplifiers for the longdistance lines were in the basement which had escaped serious damage that was why flick was here the chfteau was on the north side of the square surrounded by a high wall of stone pillars and iron railings guarded by uniformed sentries to the east was a small medieval church its ancient wooden doors wide open to the summer air and the arriving congregation opposite the church on the west side of the square was the town hall run by an ultraconservative mayor who had few disagreements with the occupying nazi rulers the south side was a row of shops and a bar called caf des sports flick sat outside the bar waiting for the church bell to stop on the table in front of her was a glass of the local white wine thin and light she had not drunk any she was a british officer with the rank of major officially she belonged to the first aid nursing yeomanry the allfemale service that was inevitably called the fanys but that was a cover story in fact she worked for a secret organization the special operations executive responsible for sabotage behind enemy lines at twentyeight she was one of the most senior agents this was not the first time she had felt herself close to death she had learned to live with the threat and manage her fear but all the same she felt the touch of a cold hand on her heart when she looked at the steel helmets and powerful rifles of the chfteau guards three years ago her greatest ambition had been to become a professor of french literature in a british university teaching students to enjoy the vigor of hugo the wit of flaubert the passion of zola she had been working in the war office translating french documents when she had been summoned to a mysterious interview in a hotel room and asked if she was willing to do something dangerous she had said yes without thinking much there was a war on and all the boys she had been at oxford with were risking their lives every day so why shouldnt she do the same two days after christmas she had started her soe training six months later she was a courier carrying messages from soe headquarters at baker street in london to resistance groups in occupied france in the days when wireless sets were scarce and trained operators even fewer she would parachute in move around with her false identity papers contact the resistance give them their orders and note their replies complaints and requests for guns and ammunition for the return journey she would rendezvous with a pickup plane usually a threeseater westland lysander small enough to land on six hundred yards of grass from courier work she had graduated to organizing sabotage most soe agents were officers the theory being that their men were the local resistance in practice the resistance were not under military discipline and an agent had to win their cooperation by being tough knowledgeable and authoritative the work was dangerous six men and three women had finished the training course with flick and she was the only one still operating two years later two were known to be dead one shot by the milice the hated french security police and the second killed when his parachute failed to open the other six had been captured interrogated and tortured and had then disappeared into prison camps in germany flick had survived because she was ruthless she had quick reactions and she was careful about security to the point of paranoia beside her sat her husband michel leader of the resistance circuit codenamed bollinger which was based in the cathedral city of reims ten miles from here although about to risk his life michel was sitting back in his chair his right ankle resting on his left knee holding a tall glass of pale watery wartime beer his careless grin had won her heart when she was a student at the sorbonne writing a thesis on molieres ethics that she had abandoned at the outbreak of war he had been a disheveled young philosophy lecturer with a legion of adoring students he was still the sexiest man she had ever met he was tall and he dressed with careless elegance in rumpled suits and faded blue shirts his hair was always a little too long he had a cometobed voice and an intense blueeyed gaze that made a girl feel she was the only woman in the world this mission had given flick a welcome chance to spend a few days with her husband but it had not been a happy time they had not quarreled exactly but michels affection had seemed halfhearted as if he were going through the motions she had felt hurt her instinct told her he was interested in someone else he was only thirtyfive and his unkempt charm still worked on young women it did not help that since their wedding they had been apart more than together because of the war and there were plenty of willing french girls she thought sourly in the resistance and out of it she still loved him not in the same way she no longer worshiped him as she had on their honeymoon no longer yearned to devote her life to making him happy the morning mists of romantic love had lifted and in the clear daylight of married life she could see that he was vain selfabsorbed and unreliable but when he chose to focus his attention on her he could still make her feel unique and beautiful and cherished his charm worked on men too and he was a great leader courageous and charismatic he and flick had figured out the battle plan together they would attack the chfteau in two places dividing the defenders then regroup inside to form a single force that would penetrate the basement find the main equipment room and blow it up they had a floor plan of the building supplied by antoinette dupert supervisor of the group of local women who cleaned the chfteau every evening she was also michels aunt the cleaners started work at seven oclock the same time as vespers and flick could see some of them now presenting their special passes to the guard at the wroughtiron gate antoinettes sketch showed the entrance to the basement but no further details for it was a restricted area open to germans only and cleaned by soldiers michels attack plan was based on reports from mi the british intelligence service which said the chfteau was guarded by a waffen ss detachment working in three shifts each of twelve men the gestapo personnel in the building were not fighting troops and most would not even be armed the bollinger circuit had been able to muster fifteen fighters for the attack and they were now deployed either among the worshipers in the church or posing as sunday idlers around the square concealing their weapons under their clothing or in satchels and duffel bags if mi was right the resistance would outnumber the guards but a worry nagged at flicks brain and made her heart heavy with apprehension when she had told antoinette of mis estimate antoinette had frowned and said it seems to me there are more antoinette was no foolshe had been secretary to joseph laperrišre the head of a champagne house until the occupation reduced his profits and his wife became his secretaryand she might be right michel had been unable to resolve the contradiction between the mi estimate and antoinettes guess he lived in reims and neither he nor any of his group was familiar with saintecdcile there had been no time for further reconnaissance if the resistance were outnumbered flick thought with dread they were not likely to prevail against disciplined german troops she looked around the square picking out the people she knew apparently innocent strollers who were in fact waiting to kill or be killed outside the haberdashery studying a bolt of dull green cloth in the window stood genevieve a tall girl of twenty with a sten gun under her light summer coat the sten was a submachine gun much favored by the resistance because it could be broken into three parts and carried in a small bag genevieve might well be the girl michel had his eye on but all the same flick felt a shudder of horror at the thought that she might be mowed down by gunfire in a few seconds time crossing the cobbled square heading for the church was bertrand even younger at seventeen a blond boy with an eager face and acaliber colt automatic hidden in a folded newspaper under his arm the allies had dropped thousands of colts by parachute flick had at first forbidden bertrand from the team because of his age but he had pleaded to be included and she had needed every available man so she had given in she hoped his youthful bravado would survive once the shooting started loitering on the church porch apparently finishing his cigarette before going in was albert whose wife had given birth to their first child this morning a girl albert had an extra reason to stay alive today he carried a cloth bag that looked full of potatoes but they were no mark i mills hand grenades the scene in the square looked normal but for one element beside the church was parked an enormous powerful sports car it was a frenchbuilt hispanosuiza type bl with a v aeroengine one of the fastest cars in the world it had a tall arrogantlooking silver radiator topped by the flyingstork mascot and it was painted sky blue it had arrived half an hour ago the driver a handsome man of about forty was wearing an elegant civilian suit but he had to be a german officerno one else would have the nerve to flaunt such a car his companion a tall striking redhead in a green silk dress and highheeled suede shoes was too perfectly chic to be anything but french the man had set up a camera on a tripod and was taking photographs of the chfteau the woman wore a defiant look as if she knew that the shabby townspeople who stared at her on their way to church were calling her whore in their minds a few minutes ago the man had scared flick by asking her to take a picture of him and his lady friend against the background of the chfteau he had spoken courteously with an engaging smile and only the trace of a german accent the distraction at a crucial moment was absolutely maddening but flick had felt it might have caused trouble to refuse especially as she was pretending to be a local resident who had nothing better to do than lounge around at a pavement caf so she had responded as most french people would have in the circumstances she had put on an expression of cold indifference and complied with the germans request it had been a farcically frightening moment the british secret agent standing behind the camera the german officer and his tart smiling at her and the church bell tolling the seconds until the explosion then the officer had thanked her and offered to buy her a drink she had refused very firmly no french girl could drink with a german unless she was prepared to be called a whore he had nodded understandingly and she had returned to her husband the officer was obviously offduty and did not appear to be armed so he presented no danger but all the same he bothered flick she puzzled over this feeling in the last few seconds of calm and finally realized that she did not really believe he was a tourist there was a watchful alertness in his manner that was not appropriate for soaking up the beauty of old architecture his woman might be exactly what she seemed but he was something else before flick could figure out what the bell ceased to toll michel drained his glass then wiped his mouth with the back of his hand flick and michel stood up trying to look casual they strolled to the caf entrance and stood in the doorway inconspicuously taking cover chapter dieter franck had noticed the girl at the caf table the moment he drove into the square he always noticed beautiful women this one struck him as a tiny bundle of sex appeal she was a pale blonde with light green eyes and she probably had german bloodit was not unusual here in the northeast of france so close to the border her small slim body was wrapped in a dress like a sack but she had added a bright yellow scarf of cheap cotton with a flair for style that he thought enchantingly french when he spoke to her he had observed the initial flash of fear usual in a french person on being approached by one of the german occupiers but then immediately afterwards he had seen on her pretty face a look of illconcealed defiance that had piqued his interest she was with an attractive man who was not very interested in herprobably her husband dieter had asked her to take a photo only because he wanted to talk to her he had a wife and two pretty children in cologne and he shared his paris apartment with stphame but that would not stop him making a play for another girl beautiful women were like the gorgeous french impressionist paintings he collected having one did not stop you wanting another french women were the most beautiful in the world but everything french was beautiful their bridges their boulevards their furniture even their china tableware dieter loved paris nightclubs champagne foie gras and warm baguette he enjoyed buying shirts and ties at charvet the legendary chemisier opposite the ritz hotel he could happily have lived in paris forever he did not know where he had acquired such tastes his father was a professor of musicthe one art form of which the germans not the french were the undisputed masters but to dieter the dry academic life his father led seemed unbearably dull and he had horrified his parents by becoming a policeman one of the first university graduates in germany so to do by he was head of the criminal intelligence department of the cologne police in may when general heinz gudenans panzer tanks crossed the river meuse at sedan and swept triumphantly through france to the english channel in a week dieter impulsively applied for a commission in the army because of his police experience he was given an intelligence posting immediately he spoke fluent french and adequate english so he was put to work interrogating captured prisoners he had a talent for the work and it gave him profound satisfaction to extract information that could help his side win battles in north africa his results had been noticed by rommel himself he was always willing to use torture when necessary but he liked to persuade people by subtler means that was how he had got stephanie poised sensual and shrewd she had been the owner of a paris store selling ladies hats that were devastatingly chic and obscenely expensive but she had a jewish grandmother she had lost the store and spent six months in a french prison and she had been on her way to a camp in germany when dieter rescued her he could have raped her she had certainly expected that no one would have raised a protest let alone punished him but instead he had fed her given her new clothes installed her in the spare bedroom in his apartment and treated her with gentle affection until one evening after a dinner of foie de veau and a bottle of la tache he had seduced her deliciously on the couch in front of a blazing coal fire today though she was part of his camouflage he was working with rommel again field marshal erwin rommel the desert fox was now commander of army group b defending northern france german intelligence expected an allied invasion this summer rommel did not have enough men to guard the hundreds of miles of vulnerable coastline so he had adopted a daring strategy of flexible response his battalions were miles inland ready to be swiftly deployed wherever needed the british knew thisthey had intelligence too their counterplan was to slow rommels response by disrupting his communications night and day british and american bombers pounded roads and railways bridges and tunnels stations and marshaling yards and the resistance blew up power stations and factories derailed trains cut telephone lines and sent teenage girls to pour grit into the oil reservoirs of trucks and tanks dieters brief was to identify key communications targets and assess the ability of the resistance to attack them in the last few months from his base in paris he had ranged all over northern france barking at sleepy sentries and putting the fear of god into lazy captains tightening up security at railway signal boxes train sheds vehicle parks and airfield control towers today he was paying a surprise visit to a telephone exchange of enormous strategic importance through this building passed all telephone traffic from the high command in berlin to german forces in northern france that included teleprinter messages the means by which most orders were sent nowadays if the exchange was destroyed german communications would be crippled the allies obviously knew that and had tried to bomb the place with limited success it was the perfect candidate for a resistance attack yet security was infuriatingly lax by dieters standards that was probably due to the influence of the gestapo who had a post in the same building the geheime staatspolizei was the state security service and men were often promoted by reason of loyalty to hitler and enthusiasm for fascism rather than because of their brains or ability dieter had been here for half an hour taking photographs his anger mounting as the men responsible for guarding the place continued to ignore him however as the church bell stopped ringing a gestapo officer in majors uniform came strutting through the tall iron gates of the chfteau and headed straight for dieter in bad french he shouted give me that camera dieter turned away pretending not to hear it is forbidden to take photographs of the chfteau imbecile the man yelled cant you see this is a military installation dieter turned to him and replied quietly in german you took a damn long time to notice me the man was taken aback people in civilian clothing were usually frightened of the gestapo what are you talking about he said less aggressively dieter checked his watch ive been here for thirtytwo minutes i could have taken a dozen photographs and driven away long ago are you in charge of security who are you major dieter franck from field marshal rommels personal staff franck said the man i remember you dieter looked harder at him my god he said as recognition dawned willi weber sturmbannfuhrer weber at your service like most senior gestapo men weber held an ss rank which he felt was more prestigious than his ordinary police rank well im damned dieter said no wonder security was slack weber and dieter had been young policemen together in cologne in the twenties dieter had been a high flyer weber a failure weber resented dieters success and attributed it to his privileged background dieters background was not extraordinarily privileged but it seemed so to weber the son of a stevedore in the end weber had been fired the details began to come back to dieter there had been a road accident a crowd had gathered weber had panicked and fired his weapon and a rubbernecking bystander had been killed dieter had not seen the man for fifteen years but he could guess the course of webers career he had joined the nazi party become a volunteer organizer applied for a job with the gestapo citing his police training and risen swiftly in that community of embittered secondraters weber said what are you doing here checking your security on behalf of the field marshal weber bristled our security is good good enough for a sausage factory look around you dieter waved a hand indicating the town square what if these people belonged to the resistance they could pick off your guards in a few seconds he pointed to a tall girl wearing a light summer coat over her dress what if she had a gun under her coat what if he stopped this was not just a fantasy he was weaving to illustrate a point he realized his unconscious mind had seen the people in the square deploying in battle formation the tiny blonde and her husband had taken cover in the bar the two men in the church doorway had moved behind pillars the tall girl in the summer coat who had been staring into a shop window until a moment ago was now standing in the shadow of dieters car as dieter looked her coat flapped open and to his astonishment he saw that his imagination had been prophetic under the coat she had a submachine gun with a skeletonframe butt exactly the type favored by the resistance my god he said he reached inside his suit jacket and remembered he was not carrying a gun where was stephanie he looked around momentarily shocked into a state close to panic but she was standing behind him waiting patiently for him to finish his conversation with weber get down he yelled then there was a bang chapter flick was in the doorway of the caf des sports behind michel standing on tiptoe to look over his shoulder she was alert her heart pounding her muscles tensed for action but in her brain the blood flowed like ice water and she watched and calculated with cool detachment there were eight guards in sight two at the gate checking passes two just inside the gate two patrolling the grounds behind the iron railings and two at the top of the short flight of steps leading to the chfteaus grand doorway but michels main force would bypass the gate the long north side of the church building formed part of the wall surrounding the chfteaus grounds the north transept jutted a few feet into the parking lot that had once been part of the ornamental garden in the days of the ancien rgime the comte had had his own personal entrance to the church a little door in the transept wall the doorway had been boarded up and plastered over more than a hundred years ago and had remained that way until today an hour ago a retired quarryman called gaston had entered the empty church and carefully placed four halfpound sticks of yellow plastic explosive at the foot of the blocked doorway he had inserted detonators connected them together so that they would all go off at the same instant and added a fivesecond fuse ignited by a thumb plunger then he had smeared everything with ash from his kitchen fire to make it inconspicuous and moved an old wooden bench in front of the doorway for additional concealment satisfied with his handiwork he had knelt down to pray when the church bell had stopped ringing a few seconds ago gaston had got up from his pew walked a few paces from the nave into the transept depressed the plunger and ducked quickly back around the corner the blast must have shaken centuries of dust from the gothic arches but the transept was not occupied during services so no one would have been injured after the boom of the explosion there was a long moment of silence in the square everyone froze the guards at the chfteau gate the sentries patrolling the fence the gestapo major and the welldressed german with the glamorous mistress flick taut with apprehension looked across the square and through the iron railings into the grounds in the parking lot was a relic of the seventeenthcentury garden a stone fountain with three mossy cherubs sporting where jets of water had once flowed around the dry marble bowl were parked a truck an armored car a mercedes sedan painted the graygreen of the german army and two black citrons of the traction avant type favored by the gestapo in france a soldier was filling the tank of one of the citrons using a gas pump that stood incongruously in front of a tall chfteau window for a few seconds nothing moved flick waited holding her breath among the congregation in the church were ten armed men the priest who was not a sympathizer and therefore had no warning must have been pleased that so many people had shown up for the evening service which was not normally very popular he might have wondered why some of them wore topcoats despite the warm weather but after four years of austerity lots of people wore odd clothes and a man might wear a raincoat to church because he had no jacket by now flick hoped the priest understood it all at this moment the ten would be leaping from their seats pulling out their guns and rushing through the brandnew hole in the wall at last they came into view around the end of the church flicks heart leaped with pride and fear when she saw them a motley army in old caps and wornout shoes running across the parking lot toward the grand entrance of the chfteau feet pounding the dusty soil clutching their assorted weaponspistols revolvers rifles and one submachine gun they had not yet begun firing them for they were trying to get as close as possible to the building before the shooting started michel saw them at the same time he made a noise between a grunt and a sigh and flick knew he felt the same mixture of pride at their bravery and fear for their lives now was the moment to distract the guards michel raised his rifle a leeenfield no mark i the kind the resistance called a canadian rifle because many of them were made in canada he drew a bead took up the slack of the twostage trigger then fired he worked the bolt action with a practiced movement so that the weapon was immediately ready to be fired again the crash of the rifle ended the moment of shocked silence in the square at the gate one of the guards cried out and fell and flick felt a savage moment of satisfaction there was one less man to shoot at her comrades michels shot was the signal for everyone else to open fire on the church porch young bertrand squeezed off two shots that sounded like firecrackers he was too far from the guards for accuracy with a pistol and he did not hit anyone beside him albert pulled the ring of a grenade and hurled it high over the railing to land inside the grounds where it exploded in the vineyard uselessly scattering vegetation in the air flick wanted to yell angrily at them dont fire for the sake of the noise youll just reveal your position but only the best and most highly trained troops could exercise restraint once the shooting started from behind the parked sports car genevieve opened up and the deafening rattie of her sten gun filled flicks ears her shooting was more effective and another guard fell at last the germans began to act the guards took cover behind the stone pillars or lay flat and brought their rifles to bear the gestapo major fumbled his pistol out of its holster the redhead turned and ran but her sexy shoes slipped on the cobblestones and she fell her man lay on top of her protecting her with his body and flick decided she had been right to suppose he was a soldier for a civilian would not know that it was safer to lie down than to run the sentries opened fire almost immediately albert was hit flick saw him stagger and clutch his throat a hand grenade he had been about to throw dropped from his grasp then a second round hit him this time in the forehead he fell like a stone and flick thought with sudden grief of the baby girl born this morning who now had no father beside albert bertrand saw the turtleshell grenade roll across the ageworn stone step of the church porch he hurled himself through the doorway as the grenade exploded flick waited for him to reappear but he did not and she thought with anguished uncertainty that he could be dead wounded or just stunned in the parking lot the team from the church stopped running turned on the remaining six sentries and opened up the four guards near the gate were caught in a crossfire between those inside the grounds and those outside in the square and they were wiped out in seconds leaving only the two on the chfteau steps michels plan was working flick thought with a surge of hope but the enemy troops inside the building had now had time to seize their weapons and rush to the doors and windows and they began to shoot changing the odds again everything depended on how many of them there were for a few moments the bullets poured like rain and flick stopped counting then she realized with dismay that there were many more guns in the chfteau than she had expected fire seemed to be coming from at least twelve doors and windows the men from the church who should by now be inside the building retreated to take cover behind the vehicles in the parking lot antoinette had been right and mi wrong about the number of troops stationed here twelve was the mi estimate yet the resistance had downed six for certain and there were at least fourteen still firing flick cursed passionately in a fight like this the resistance could win only by sudden overwhelming violence if they did not crush the enemy right away they were in trouble as the seconds ticked by army training and discipline began to tell in the end regular troops would always prevail in a drawnout conflict on the upper floor of the chfteau a tall seventeenthcentury window was smashed open and a machine gun began to fire because of its high position it caused horrible carnage among the resistance in the parking lot flick was sickened as one after another the men there fell and lay bleeding beside the dry fountain until there were only two or three still shooting it was all over flick realized in despair they were outnumbered and they had failed the sour taste of defeat rose in her throat michel had been shooting at the machinegun position we cant take out that machine gunner from the ground he said he looked around the square his gaze flying to the tops of the buildings the bell tower of the church and the upper floor of the town hall if i could get into the mayors office id have a clear shot wait flicks mouth was dry she could not stop him risking his life much as she wanted to but she could improve the odds she yelled at the top of her voice genevieve genevieve turned to look at her cover michel genevieve nodded vigorously then dashed out from behind the sports car spraying bullets at the chfteau windows thanks michel said to flick then he broke cover and sprinted across the square heading for the town hall genevieve ran on heading for the church porch her fire distracted the men in the chfteau giving michel a chance of crossing the square unscathed but then there was a flash on flicks left she glanced that way and saw the gestapo major flattened against the wall of the town hail aiming his pistol at michel it was hard to hit a moving target with a handgun at anything but close rangebut the major might be lucky flick thought fearfully she was under orders to observe and report back and not to join the fighting under any circumstances but now she thought to hell with that in her shoulder bag she carried her personal weapon a browning ninemillimeter automatic which she preferred to the soe standard colt because it had thirteen rounds in the clip instead of seven and because she could load it with the same ninemillimeter parabellum rounds used in the sten submachine gun she snatched it out of the bag she released the safety catch cocked the hammer extended her arm and fired two hasty shots at the major she missed him but her bullets chipped fragments of stone from the wall near his face and he ducked michel ran on the major recovered quickly and raised his weapon again as michel approached his destination he also came closer to the major shortening the range michel fired his rifle in the majors direction but the shot went wild and the major kept his head and fired back this time michel went down and flick let out a yell of fear michel hit the ground tried to get up and collapsed flick calmed herself and thought fast michel was still alive genevieve had reached the church porch and her submachine gun fire continued to draw the attention of the enemy inside the chfteau flick had a chance of rescuing michel lt was against her orders but no orders could make her leave her husband bleeding on the ground besides if she left him there he would be captured and interrogated as leader of the bollinger circuit michel knew every name every address every code word his capture would be a catastrophe there was no choice she shot at the major again again she missed but she pulled the trigger repeatedly and the steady fire forced the man to retreat along the wall looking for cover she ran out of the bar into the square from the corner of her eye she saw the owner of the sports car still protecting his mistress from gunfire by lying on top of her flick had forgotten him she realized with sudden fear was he armed if so he could shoot her easily but no bullets came she reached the supine michel and went down on one knee she turned toward the town hall and fired two wild shots to keep the major busy then she looked at her husband to her relief she saw that his eyes were open and he was breathing he seemed to be bleeding from his left buttock her fear receded a little you got a bullet in your bum she said in english he replied in french it hurts like hell she turned again to the town hail the major had retreated twenty meters and crossed the narrow street to a shop doorway this time flick took a few seconds to aim carefully she squeezed off four shots the shop window exploded in a storm of glass and the major staggered back and fell to the ground flick spoke to michelin french try to get up she said he rolled over groaning in pain and got to one knee but he could not move his injured leg come on she said harshly if you stay here youll be killed she grabbed him by the front of his shirt and heaved him upright with a mighty effort he stood on his good leg but he could not bear his own weight and leaned heavily against her she realized that he was not going to be able to walk and she groaned in despair she glanced over to the side of the town hall the major was getting up he had blood on his face but he did not seem badly injured she guessed that he had been cut superficially by flying glass but might still be capable of shooting there was only one thing for it she would have to pick michel up and carry him to safety she bent in front of him grasped him around the thighs and eased him on to her shoulder in the classic firemans lift he was tall but thinmost french people were thin these days all the same she thought she would collapse under his weight she staggered and felt dizzy for a second but she stayed upright after a moment she took a step forward she lumbered across the cobblestones she thought the major was shooting at her but she could not be sure as there was so much gunfire from the chfteau from genevieve and from the resistance fighters still alive in the parking lot the fear that a bullet might hit her at any second gave her strength and she broke into a lurching run she made for the road leading out of the square to the south the nearest exit she passed the german lying on top of the redhead and for a startled moment she met his eye and saw an expression of surprise and wry admiration then she crashed into a caf table sending it flying and she almost fell but managed to right herself and run on a bullet hit the window of the bar and she saw a cobweb of fracture lines craze the glass a moment later she was around the corner and out of the majors line of sight alive she thought gratefully both of usfor a few more minutes at least until now she had not thought where to go once she was clear of the battlefield two getaway vehicles were waiting a couple of streets away but she could not carry michel that far however antoinette dupert lived on this street just a few steps farther antoinette was not in the resistance but she was sympathetic enough to have provided michel with a plan of the chfteau and michel was her nephew so she surely would not turn him away anyway flick had no alternative antoinette had a groundfloor apartment in a building with a courtyard flick came to the open gateway a few yards along the street from the square and staggered under the archway she pushed open a door and lowered michel to the tiles she hammered on antoinettes door panting with effort she heard a frightened voice say what is it antoinette had been scared by the gunfire and did not want to open the door breathlessly flick said quickly quickly she tried to keep her voice low some of the neighbors might be nazi sympathizers the door did not open but antoinettes voice came nearer whos there flick instinctively avoided speaking a name aloud she replied your nephew is wounded the door opened antoinette was a straightbacked woman of fifty wearing a cotton dress that had once been chic and was now faded but crisply pressed she was pale with fear michel she said she knelt beside him is it serious it hurts but im not dying michel said through clenched teeth you poor thing she brushed his hair off his sweaty forehead with a gesture like a caress flick said impatiently lets get him inside she took michels arms and antoinette lifted him by the knees he grunted with pain together they carried him into the living room and put him down on a faded velvet sofa take care of him while i fetch the car flick said she ran back into the street the gunfire was dying down she did not have long she raced along the street and turned two corners outside a closed bakery two vehicles were parked with their engines running one a rusty renault the other a van with a faded sign on the side that had once read blanchisserie bissetbissets laundry the van was borrowed from the father of bertrand who was able to get fuel because he washed sheets for hotels used by the germans the renault had been stolen this morning in chflons and michel had changed its license plates flick decided to take the car leaving the van for any survivors who might get away from the carnage in the chfteau grounds she spoke briefly to the driver of the van wait here for five minutes then leave she ran to the car jumped into the passenger seat and said lets go quickly at the wheel of the renault was gilberte a nineteenyearold girl with long dark hair pretty but stupid flick did not know why she was in the resistanceshe was not the usual type instead of pulling away gilberte said where to ill direct youfor the love of christ move gilberte put the car in gear and drove off left then right flick said in the two minutes of inaction that followed the full realization of her failure hit her most of the bollinger circuit was wiped out albert and others had died genevieve bertrand and any others who survived would probably be tortured and it was all for nothing the telephone exchange was undamaged and german communications were intact flick felt worthless she tried to think what she had done wrong had it been a mistake to try a frontal attack on a guarded military installation not necessarilythe plan might have worked but for the inaccurate intelligence supplied by mi however it would have been safer she now thought to get inside the building by some clandestine means that would have given the resistance a better chance of getting to the crucial equipment gilberte pulled up at the courtyard entrance turn the car around flick said and jumped out michel was lying facedown on antoinettes sofa trousers pulled down looking undignified antoinette knelt beside him holding a bloodstained towel a pair of glasses perched on her nose peering at his backside the bleeding has slowed but the bullet is still in there she said on the floor beside the sofa was her handbag she had emptied the contents onto a small table presumably while hurriedly searching for her spectacles flicks eye was caught by a sheet of paper typed on and stamped with a small photograph of antoinette pasted to it the whole thing in a little cardboard folder it was the pass that permitted her to enter the chfteau in that moment flick had the glimmer of an idea ive got a car outside flick said antoinette continued to study the wound he shouldnt be moved if he stays here the boche will kill him flick casually picked up antoinettes pass as she did so she asked michel how do you feel i might be able to walk now he said the pain is easing flick slipped the pass into her shoulder bag antoinette did not notice flick said to her help me get him up the two women raised michel to his feet antoinette pulled up his blue canvas trousers and fastened his worn leather belt stay inside flick said to antoinette i dont want anyone to see you with us she had not yet begun to work out her idea but she already knew it would be blighted if any suspicion were to fall on antoinette and her cleaners michel put his arm around flicks shoulders and leaned heavily on her she took his weight and he hobbled out of the building into the street by the time they reached the car he was white with pain gilberte stared through the window at them looking terrified flick hissed at her get out and open the fucking door dimwit gilberte leaped out of the car and threw open the rear door with her help flick bundled mitel onto the the two women jumped in the front lets get out of here said flick chapter dieter was dismayed and appalled as the shooting began to peter out and his heartbeat returned to normal he started to reflect on what he had seen he had not thought the resistance capable of such a wellplanned and carefully executed attack from everything he had learned in the last few months he believed their raids were normally hitandrun affairs but this had been his first sight of them in action they had been bristling with guns and obviously not short of ammunitionunlike the german army worst of all they had been courageous dieter had been impressed by the rifleman who had dashed across the square by the girl with the sten gun who had given him covering fire and most of all by the little blonde who had picked up the wounded rifleman and had carried hima man six inches taller than sheout of the square to safety such people could not fail to be a profound threat to the occupying military force these were not like the criminals dieter had dealt with as a cop in cologne before the war criminals were stupid lazy cowardly and brutish these french resistance people were fighters but their defeat gave him a rare opportunity when he was sure the shooting had stopped he got to his feet and helped stephanie up her cheeks were flushed and she was breathing hard she held his hands and looked into his faceyou protected me she said tears came to her eyes you made yourself a shield for me he brushed dirt from her hip he was surprised by his own gallantry the action had been instinctive when he thought about it he was not at all sure he would really be willing to give his life to save stephanie he tried to pass over it lightly no harm should come to this perfect body he said she began to cry he took her hand and led her across the square to the gates lets go inside he said you can sit down for a while they entered the grounds dieter saw a hole in the wall of the church that explained how the main force had got inside the waffenss troops had come out of the building and were disarming the attackers dieter looked keenly at the resistance fighters most were dead but some were only wounded and one or two appeared to have surrendered unhurt there should be several for him to interrogate until now his work had been defensive the most he had been able to do was fortify key installations against the resistance by beefing up security the occasional prisoner had yielded little information but having several prisoners all from one large and evidently wellorganized circuit was a different matter this might be his chance of going on the attack he thought eagerly he shouted at a sergeant youget a doctor for these prisoners i want to interrogate them dont let any die although dieter was not in uniform the sergeant assumed from his manner that he was a superior officer and said very good sir dieter took stephanie up the steps and through the stately doorway into the wide hall it was a breathtaking sight a pink marble floor tall windows with elaborate curtains walls with etniscan motifs in plaster picked out in dusty shades of pink and green and a ceiling painted with fading cherubs once dieter assumed the room had been filled with gorgeous furniture pier tables under high mirrors sideboards encrusted with ormolu dainty chairs with gilded legs oil paintings huge vases little marble statuettes all that was gone now of course instead there were rows of switchboards each with its chair and a snakes nest of cables on the floor the telephone operators seemed to have fled into the grounds at the rear but now that the shooting had stopped a few of them were standing at the glazed doors still wearing their headsets and breast microphones wondering if it was safe to come back inside dieter sat stephanie at one of the switchboards then beckoned a middleaged woman telephonist madame he said in a polite but commanding voice he spoke french please bring a cup of hot coffee for this lady the woman came forward shooting a look of hatred at stephanie very good monsieur and some cognac shes had a shock we have no cognac they had cognac but she did not want to give it to the mistress of a german dieter did not argue the point just coffee then but be quick or there will be trouble he patted stephanies shoulder and left her he passed through double doors into the east wing the chfteau was laid out as a series of reception rooms one leading into the next on the versailles pattern he found the rooms were full of switchboards but these had a more permanent look the cables bundled into neatly made wooden trunking that disappeared through the floor into the cellar beneath dieter guessed the hail looked messy only because it had been brought into service as an emergency measure after the west wing had been bombed some of the windows were permanently blacked out no doubt as an airraid precaution but others had heavy curtains drawn open and dieter supposed the women did not like to work in permanent night at the end of the east wing was a stairwell dieter went down at the foot of the staircase he passed through a steel door a small desk and a chair stood just inside and dieter assumed a guard normally sat there the man on duty had presumably left his post to join in the fighting dieter entered unchallenged and made a mental note of a security breach this was a different environment from that of the grand principal floors designed as kitchens storage and accommodation for the dozens of staff who would have serviced this house three hundred years ago it had low ceilings bare walls and floors of stone or even in some rooms beaten earth dieter walked along a broad corridor every door was clearly labeled in neat german signwriting but dieter looked inside anyway on his left at the front of the building was the complex equipment of a major telephone exchange a generator enormous batteries and rooms full of tangled cables on his right toward the back of the house were the gestapos facilities a photo lab a large wireless listening room for eavesdropping on the resistance and prison cells with peepholes in the doors the basement had been bombproofed all windows were blocked the walls were sandbagged and the ceilings had been reinforced with steel girders and poured concrete obviously that was to prevent allied bombers from putting the phone system out of action at the end of the corridor was a door marked interrogation center he went inside the first room had bare white walls bright lights and the standard furniture of a simple interview room a cheap table hard chairs and an ashtray dieter went through to the next room here the lights were less bright and the walls bare brick there was a bloodstained pillar with hooks for tying people up an umbrella stand holding a selection of wooden clubs and steel bars a hospital operating table with a head clamp and straps for the wrists and ankles an electric shock machine and a locked cabinet that probably contained drugs and hypodermic syringes it was a torture chamber dieter had been in many similar but still they sickened him he had to remind himself that intelligence gathered in places such as this helped save the lives of decent young german soldiers so that they could eventually go home to their wives and children instead of dying on battlefields all the same the place gave him the creeps there was a noise behind him startling him he spun around when he saw what was in the doorway he took a frightened step back christ he said he was looking at a squat figure its face thrown into shadow by the strong light from the next room who are you he said and he could hear the fear in his own voice the figure stepped into the light and turned into a man in the uniform shirt of a gestapo sergeant he was short and pudgy with a fleshy face and ashblond hair cropped so short that he looked bald what are you doing here he said in a frankfurt accent dieter recovered his composure the torture chamber had unnerved him but he regained his habitual tone of authority and said i am major franck your name the sergeant became deferential at once becker sir at your service get the prisoners down here as soon as possible becker said dieter those who can walk should be brought immediately the others when they have been seen by a doctor very good major becker went away dieter returned to the interview room and sat in the hard chair he wondered how much information he would get out of the prisoners their knowledge might be limited to their own town if his luck was bad and their security good each individual might know only a little about what went on in their own circuit on the other hand there was no such thing as perfect security a few individuals inevitably amassed a wide knowledge of their own and other resistance circuits his dream was that one circuit might lead him to another in a chain and he might be able to inflict enormous damage on the resistance in the weeks remaining before the allied invasion he heard footsteps in the corridor and looked out the prisoners were being brought in the first was the woman who had concealed a sten gun beneath her coat dieter was pleased it was so useful to have a woman among the prisoners under interrogation women could be as tough as men but often the way to make a man talk was to beat a woman in front of him this one was tall and sexy which was all the better she seemed to be uninjured dieter held up a hand to the soldier escorting her and spoke to the woman in french what is your name he said in a friendly tone she looked at him with haughty eyes why should i tell you he shrugged this level of opposition was easy to overcome he used an answer that had served him well a hundred times your relatives may inquire whether you are in custody if we know your name we may tell them i am genevieve delys a beautiful name for a beautiful woman he waved her on next came a man in his sixties bleeding from a head injury and limping too dieter said youre a little old for this sort of thing arent you the man looked proud i set the charges he said defiantly name gaston lefšvre just remember one thing gaston dieter said in a kindly voice the pain lasts as long as you choose when you decide to end it it will stop fear came into the mans eyes as he contemplated what faced him dieter nodded satisfied carry on a youngster was next no more than seventeen dieter guessed a goodlooking boy who was absolutely terrified name he hesitated seeming dazed by shock after thinking he said bertrand bisset good evening bertrand dieter said pleasantly welcome to hell the boy looked as if he had been slapped dieter pushed him on willi weber appeared with becker pacing behind him like a dangerous dog on a chain how did you get in here weber said rudely to dieter i walked in dieter said your security stinks ridiculous youve just seen us beat off a major attack by a dozen men and some girls we defeated them thats all that counts think about it willi dieter said reasonably they were able to assemble close by quite unnoticed by you then force their way into the grounds and kill at least six good german soldiers i suspect the only reason you defeated them was that they had underestimated the numbers against them and i entered this basement unchallenged because the guard had left his post hes a brave german he wanted to join the fighting god give me strength dieter said in despair a soldier in battle doesnt leave his post to join the fighting he follows orders i dont need a lecture from you on military discipline dieter gave up for now and i have no desire to give one what do you want im going to interview the prisoners thats the gestapos job dont be idiotic field marshal rommel has asked me not the gestapo to limit the capacity of the resistance to damage his communications in the event of an invasion these prisoners can give me priceless information i intend to question them not while theyre in my custody weber said stubbornly i shall interrogate them myself and send the results to the field marshal the allies are probably going to invade this summerisnt it time to stop fighting turf wars it is never time to abandon efficient organization dieter could have screamed in desperation he swallowed his pride and tried for a compromise lets interrogate them together weber smiled sensing victory absolutely not this means ill have to go over your head if you can of course i can all you will achieve is a delay so you say you damned fool dieter said savagely god preserve the fatherland from patriots such as you he turned on his heel and stalked out chapter cilberte and flick left the town of sainteccile behind heading for the city of reims on a country back road gilberte drove as fast as she could along the narrow lane flicks eyes apprehensively raked the road ahead it rose and fell over low hills and wound through vineyards as it made its leisurely way from village to village their progress was slowed by many crossroads but the number of junctions made it impossible for the gestapo to block every route away from sainteccile all the same flick gnawed her lip worrying about the chance of being stopped at random by a patrol she could not explain away a man in the backseat bleeding from a bullet wound thinking ahead she realized she could not take michel to his home after france surrendered in and michel was demobilized he had not returned to his lectureship at the sorbonne but had come back to his hometown to be deputy head of a high school andhis real motiveto organize a resistance circuit he had moved into the home of his late parents a charming town house near the cathedral but flick decided he could not go there now it was known to too many people although resistance members often did not know one anothers addressesfor the sake of security they revealed them only if necessary for a delivery or rendezvousmichel was leader and most people knew where he lived back in sainteccile some of the team must have been taken alive before long they would be under interrogation unlike british agents the french resistance did not carry suicide pills the only reliable rule of interrogation was that everybody would talk in the long run sometimes the gestapo ran out of patience and sometimes they killed their subjects by overenthusiasm but if they were careful and determined they could make the strongest personality betray his or her dearest comrades no one could bear agony forever so flick had to treat michels house as known to the enemy where could she take him instead how is he said gilberte anxiously flick glanced into the backseat his eyes were closed but he was breathing normally he had fallen into a sleep the best thing for him she looked at him fondly he needed someone to take care of him at least for a day or two she turned to gilberte young and single she was probably still with her parents where do you live flick asked her on the outskirts of town on the route de cernay on your own for some reason gilberte looked scared yes of course on my own a house an apartment a bedsitting room an apartment two rooms well go there no why not are you scared she looked injured no not scared what then i dont trust the neighbors is there a back entrance reluctantly gilberte said yes an alley that runs along the side of a little factory it sounds ideal okay youre right we should go to my place i just you surprised me thats all im sorry flick was scheduled to return to london tonight she was to rendezvous with a plane in a meadow outside the village of chatelle five miles north of reims she wondered if the plane would make it navigating by the stars it was extraordinarily difficult to find a specific field near a small village pilots often went astrayin fact it was a miracle they ever arrived where they were supposed to she looked at the weather a clear sky was darkening to the deep blue of evening there would be moonlight provided the weather held if not tonight then tomorrow she thought as always her mind went to the comrades she had left behind was young bertrand dead or alive what about genevieve they might be better off dead alive they faced the agony of torture flicks heart seemed to convulse with grief as she thought again that she had led them to defeat bertrand had a crush on her she guessed he was young enough to feel guilty about secretly loving the wife of his commander she wished she had ordered him to stay at home it would have made no difference to the outcome and he would have remained a bright likable youth for a little longer instead of a corpse or worse no one could succeed every time and war meant that when leaders failed people died it was a hard fact but still she cast about for consolation she longed for a way to make sure their suffering was not in vain perhaps she could build on their sacrifice and get some kind of victory out of it after all she thought about the pass she had stolen from antoinette and the possibility of getting into the chfteau clandestinely a team could enter disguised as civilian employees she swiftly dismissed the idea of having them pose as telephone operators it was a skilled job that took time to learn but anyone could use a broom would the germans notice if the cleaners were strangers they probably paid no attention to the women who mopped the floor what about the french telephonistswould they give the game away it might be a risk worth taking soe had a remarkable forgery department that could copy any kind of document sometimes even making their own paper to match the original in a couple of days they could soon produce counterfeits of antoinettes pass flick suffered a guilty pang at having stolen it at this moment antoinette might be looking for it frantically searching under the couch and in all her pockets going out into the courtyard with a flashlight when she told the gestapo she had lost it she would be in trouble but in the end they would just give her a replacement and this way she was not guilty of helping the resistance if interrogated she could steadfastly maintain that she had mislaid it for she believed that to be the truth besides flick thought grimly if she had asked permission to borrow the thing antoinette might have said no of course there was one major snag with this plan all the cleaners were women the resistance team that went in disguised as cleaners would have to be allfemale but then flick thought why not they were entering the suburbs of reims it was dark when gilberte pulled up near a low industrial building surrounded by a high wire fence she killed the engine flick spoke sharply to michel wake up we have to get you indoors he groaned we must be quick she added were breaking the curfew the two women got him out of the car gilberte pointed to the narrow alley that led along the back of the factory michel put his arms over their shoulders and they helped him along the alley gilberte opened a door in a wall that led to the backyard of a small apartment building they crossed the yard and went in through a back door it was a block of cheap flats with five floors and no lift unfortunately gilbertes rooms were on the attic floor flick showed her how to make a carrying chair crossing their arms they linked hands under michels thighs and took his weight he put an arm around the shoulders of each woman to steady himself that way they carried him up four flights luckily they met no one on the stairs they were blowing hard by the time they reached gilbertes door they stood michel on his feet and he managed to limp inside where he collapsed into an armchair flick looked around it was a girls place pretty and neat and clean more importantly it was not overlooked that was the advantage of the top floor no one could see in michel should be safe gilberte fussed about michel trying to make him comfortable with cushions wiping his face gently with a towel offering him aspirins she was tender but impractical as antoinette had been michel had that effect on women though not on flickwhich was partly why he had fallen for her he could not resist a challenge you need a doctor flick said brusquely what about claude bouler he used to help us but last time i spoke to him he didnt want to know me i thought he was going to run away he was so nervous hes become scared since he got married michel replied but hell come for me flick nodded lots of people would make exceptions for michel gilberte go and fetch dr bouler id rather stay with michel flick groaned inwardly someone like gilberte was no good for anything but carrying messages yet she could make difficulties about that please do as i ask flick said firmly i need time alone with michel before i return to london what about the curfew if youre stopped say youre fetching a doctor its an accepted excuse they may accompany you to claudes house to make sure youre telling the truth but they wont come here gilberte looked troubled but she pulled on a cardigan and went out flick sat on the arm of michels chair and kissed him that was a catastrophe she said i know he grunted with disgust so much for mi there must have been double the number of men they told us ill never trust those clowns again we lost albert ill have to tell his wife im going back tonight ill get london to send you another radio operator thanks youll have to find out who else is dead and whos alive if i can he sighed she held his hand how are you feeling foolish its an undignified place for a bullet wound but physically a little giddy you need something to drink i wonder what she has scotch would be nice flicks friends in london had taught michel to like whisky before the war thats a little strong the kitchen was in a corner of the living room flick opened a cupboard to her surprise she saw a bottle of dewars white label agents from britain often brought whisky with them for their own use or for their comradesinarms but it seemed an unlikely drink for a french girl there was also an opened bottle of red wine much more suitable for a wounded man she poured half a glass and topped it up with water from the tap michel drank greedily loss of blood had made him thirsty he emptied the glass then leaned back and closed his eyes flick would have liked some of the scotch but it seemed unkind to deny it to michel then drink it herself besides she still needed her wits about her she would have a drink when she was back on british soil she looked around the room there were a couple of sentimental pictures on the wall a stack of old fashion magazines no books she poked her nose into the bedroom michel said sharply where are you going just looking around dont you think its a little rude when shes not here flick shrugged not really anyway i need the bathroom its outside down the stairs and along the corridor to the end if i remember rightly she followed his instructions while she was in the bathroom she realized that something was bothering her something about gilbertes apartment she thought hard she never ignored her instincts they had saved her life more than once when she returned she said to michel somethings wrong here what is it he shrugged looking uncomfortable i dont know you seem edgy perhaps its because ive just been wounded in a gunfight no its not that its the apartment it had something to do with gilbertes unease something to do with michels knowing where the bathroom was something to do with the whisky she went into the bedroom exploring this time michel did not reprove her she looked around on the bedside table stood a photograph of a man with gilbertes big eyes and black eyebrows perhaps her father there was a doll on the counterpane in the corner was a washbasin with a mirrored cabinet over flick opened the cabinet door inside was a mans razor bowl and shaving brush gilberte was not so innocent some man stayed overnight often enough to leave his shaving tackle here flick looked more closely the razor and brush were a set with polished bone handles she recognized them she had given the set to michel for his thirtysecond birthday so that was it she was so shocked that for a moment she could not move she had suspected him of being interested in someone else but she had not imagined it had gone this far yet here was the proof in front of her eyes shock turned to hurt how could he cuddle up to another woman when flick was lying in bed alone in london she turned and looked at the bed they had done it right here in this room it was unbearable then she became angry she had been loyal and faithful she had borne the lonelinessbut he had not he had cheated she was so furious she felt she would explode she strode into the other room and stood in front of him you bastard she said in english you lousy rotten bastard michel replied in the same language dont angry yourself at me he knew that she found his fractured english endearing but it was not going to work this time she switched to french how could you betray me for a nineteenyearold nitwit it doesnt mean anything shes just a pretty girl do you think that makes it better flick knew she had originally attracted michels attention back in the days when she was a student and he a lecturer by challenging him in classfrench students were deferential by comparison with their english counterparts and on top of that flick was by nature disrespectful of authority if someone similar had seduced michelperhaps genevieve a woman who would have been his equalshe could have borne it better it was more hurtful that he had chosen gilberte a girl with nothing on her mind more interesting than nail polish i was lonely michel said pathetically spare me the sob story you werent lonelyyou were weak dishonest and faithless flick my darling lets not quarrel half our friends have just been killed youre going back to england we could both die soon dont go away angry how can i not be angry im leaving you in the arms of your floozie shes not a floozie skip the technicalities im your wife but youre sharing her bed michel moved in his chair and winced with pain then he fixed flick with his intense blue eyes plead guilty he said im a louse but im a louse who loves you and im just asking you to forgive me this once in case i never see you again it was hard to resist flick weighed five years of marriage against a fling with a popsie and gave in she moved a step toward him he put his arms around her legs and pressed his face into the worn cotton of her dress she stroked his hair all right she said all right im so sorry he said i feel awful youre the most wonderful woman i ever met or even heard of i wont do it any more i promise the door opened and gilberte came in with claude flick gave a guilty start and released michels head from her embrace then she felt stupid he was her husband not gilbertes why should she feel guilty about hugging him even in gilbertes apartment she was angry with herself gilberte looked shocked to see her lover embracing his wife here but she swiftly recovered her composure and her face assumed a frozen expression of indifference claude a handsome young doctor followed her in looking anxious flick went to claude and kissed him on both cheeks thank you for coming she said were truly grateful claude looked at michel how do you feel old buddy ive got a bullet in my arse then id better take it out he lost his worried air and became briskly professional turning to flick he said put some towels on the bed to soak up the blood then get his trousers off and lay him facedown ill wash my hands gilberte put old magazines on her bed and towels over the paper while flick got michel up and helped him hobble to the bed as he lay down she could not help wondering how many other times he had lain here claude inserted a metal instrument into the wound and felt around for the slug michel cried out with pain im sorry old friend claude said solicitously flick almost took pleasure in the sight of michel in agony on the bed where he had formerly cried out with guilty pleasure she hoped he would always remember gilbertes bedroom this way michel said just get it over with flicks vengeful feeling passed quickly and she felt sorry for michel she moved the pillow closer to his face saying bite on this it will help michel stuffed the pillow into his mouth claude probed again and this time got the bullet out blood flowed freely for a few seconds then slowed and claude put a dressing on keep as still as you can for a few days he advised michel that meant michel would have to stay at gilbertes place however he would be too sore for sex flick thought with grim satisfaction thank you claude she said glad to be able to help i have another request claude looked scared what im meeting a plane at a quarter to midnight i need you to drive me to chatelle why cant gilberte take you in the car she used to come to my place because of the curfew but well be safe with you youre a doctor why would i have two people with me three we need michel to hold a torch there was an unvarying procedure for pickups four resistance people held flashlights in the shape of a giant letter l indicating the direction of the wind and where the plane should come down the small batteryoperated torches needed to be directed at the aircraft to make sure the pilot saw them they could simply be placed in position on the ground but that was less sure and if the pilot did not see what he expected he might suspect a trap and decide not to land it was better to have four people if at all possible claude said how would i explain you all to the police a doctor on emergency call doesnt travel with three people in his car well think of some story its too dangerous it will take only a few minutes at this time of night mariejeanne will kill me she says i have to think of the children you dont have any shes pregnant flick nodded that would explain why he had become so jumpy michel rolled over and sat upright he reached out and grasped claudes arm claude im begging you this is really important do it for me will you it was hard to say no to michel claude sighed when flick looked at her watch it was almost eleven now claude looked at michel his wound may reopen i know flick said let it bleed the village of chatelle consisted of a few buildings clustered around a crossroads three farmhouses a strip of laborers cottages and a bakery that served the surrounding farms and hamlets flick stood in a cow pasture a mile from the crossroads holding in her hand a flashlight about the size of a pack of cigarettes she had been on a weeklong course run by the pilots of squadron to train her for the task of guiding an aircraft in this location fitted the specifications they had given her the field was almost a kilometer longa lysander needed six hundred meters to land and take off the ground beneath her feet was firm and there was no slope a nearby pond was clearly visible from the air in the moonlight providing a useful landmark for pilots michel and gilberte stood upwind of flick in a straight line also holding flashlights and claude stood a few yards to one side of gilberte making a flare path in the shape of an upsidedown l to guide the pilot in remote areas bonfires could be used instead of electric lights but here close to a village it was too dangerous to leave the telltale burn mark on the ground the four people formed what the agents called a reception committee flicks were always silent and disciplined but lesswellorganized groups sometimes turned the landing into a party with groups of men shouting jokes and smoking cigarettes and spectators from nearby villages turning up to watch this was dangerous if the pilot suspected that the landing had been betrayed to the germans and thought the gestapo might be lying in wait he had to react quickly the instructions to reception committees warned that anyone approaching the plane from the wrong angle was liable to be shot by the pilot this had never actually happened but on one occasion a spectator had been run over by a hudson bomber and killed waiting for the plane was always hell if it did not arrive flick would face another twentyfour hours of unremitting tension and danger before the next opportunity but an agent never knew whether a plane would show up this was not because the raf was unreliable rather as the pilots of squadron had explained to flick the task of navigating a plane by moonlight across hundreds of miles of country was monumentally difficult the pilot used dead reckoningcalculating his position by direction speed and elapsed timeand tried to verify the result by landmarks such as rivers towns railway lines and forests the problem with dead reckoning was that it was impossible to make an exact adjustment for the drift caused by wind and the trouble with landmarks was that one river looked very much like another by moonlight getting to roughly the right area was difficult enough but these pilots had to find an individual field if there was a cloud hiding the moon it was impossible and the plane would not even take oft however this was a fine night and flick was hopeful sure enough a couple of minutes before midnight she heard the unmistakable sound of a singleengined plane faint at first then rapidly growing louder like a burst of applause and she felt a home going thrill she began to flash her light in the morse letter x if she flashed the wrong letter the pilot would suspect a trap and go away without landing the plane circled once then came down steeply it touched down on flicks right braked turned between michel and claude taxied back to flick and turned into the wind again completing a long oval and finishing up ready for takeoff the aircraft was a westland lysander a small highwinged monoplane painted matte black it was flown by a crew of one it had two seats for passengers but flick had known a lizzie to carry four one on the floor and one on the parcel shelf the pilot did not stop the engine his aim was to remain on the ground no more than a few seconds flick wanted to hug michel and wish him well but she also wanted to slap his face and tell him to keep his hands off other women perhaps it was just as well that she had no time for either with a brief wave flick scrambled up the metal ladder threw open the hatch and climbed aboard the pilot glanced behind and flick gave him the thumbsup the little plane jerked forward and picked up speed then rose into the air and climbed steeply flick could see one or two lights in the village country people were careless about the blackout when flick had flown in perilously late at four in the morning she had been able to see from the air the red glare of the bakers oven and driving through the village she had smelled the new bread the essence of france the plane banked to turn and flick saw the moonlit faces of michel gilberte and claude as three white smears on the black background of the pasture as the plane leveled and headed for england she realized with a sudden surge of grief that she might never see them again the second day monday may chapter dieter franck drove through the night in the big hispanosuiza accompanied by his young assistant lieutenant hans hesse the car was ten years old but its massive elevenliter engine was tireless yesterday evening dieter had found a neat row of bullet holes stitched in the generous curve of its offside fender a souvenir of the skirmish in the square at sainteccile but there was no mechanical damage and he felt the holes added to the cars glamour like a dueling scar on the cheek of a prussian officer lieutenant hesse masked the headlights to drive through the blackedout streets of paris then removed the covers when they got on the road to normandy they took turns at the wheel two hours each though hesse who adored the car and heroworshiped its owner would gladly have driven the whole way half asleep in the passenger seat mesmerized by the country roads unwinding in the headlights dieter tried to picture his future would the allies reconquer france driving the occupying forces out the thought of germany defeated was dismal perhaps there would be some kind of peace settlement with germany surrendering france and poland but keeping austria and czechoslovakia that seemed not much better he found it hard to imagine everyday life back in cologne with his wife and family after the excitement and sensual indulgence of paris and stephanie the only happy ending for dieter and for germany would be for rommels army to push the invaders back into the sea before dawn on a damp morning hesse drove into the small medieval village of la rocheguyon on the seine river between paris and rouen he stopped at the roadblock at the edge of the village but they were expected and were quickly waved on they went past silent shuttered houses to another checkpoint at the gates of the ancient castle at last they parked in the great cobbled courtyard dieter left hesse with the car and went into the building the german commander in chief west was field marshal gerd von runstedt a reliable senior general from the old officer class under him charged with the defense of the french coast was field marshal erwin rommel the castle of la rocheguyon was rommels headquarters dieter franck felt an affinity with rommel both were the sons of teachersrommels father had been a headmasterand consequently both had felt the icy breath of german military snobbery from such men as von runstedt but otherwise they were very different dieter was a sybarite enjoying all the cultural and sensual pleasures france had to offer rommel was an obsessive worker who did not smoke or drink and often forgot to eat he had married the only girlfriend he had ever had and he wrote to her three times a day in the hall dieter met rommels aidedecamp major walter goedel a cold personality with a formidable brain dieter respected him but could never like him they had spoken on the phone late last night dieter had outlined the problem he was having with the gestapo and said he wanted to see rommel as soon as possible be here at four am goedel had said rommel was always at his desk by four oclock in the morning now dieter wondered if he had done the right thing rommel might say how dare you bother me with trivial details dieter thought not commanders liked to feel they were on top of the details rommel would almost certainly give dieter the support he was asking for but you could never be sure especially when the commander was under strain goedel nodded a curt greeting and said he wants to see you right now come this way as they walked along the hallway dieter said what do you hear from italy nothing but bad news goedel said were withdrawing from arce dieter gave a resigned nod the germans were fighting fiercely but they had been depressingly unable to halt the northward advance of the enemy a moment later dieter entered rommels office it was a grand room on the ground floor dieter noticed with envy a priceless seventeenthcentury gobelin tapestry on one wall there was little furniture but for a few chairs and a huge antique desk that looked to dieter as if it might be the same age as the tapestry on the desk stood a single lamp behind the desk sat a small man with receding sandy hair goedel said major franck is here field marshal dieter waited nervously rommel continued reading for a few seconds then made a mark on the sheet of paper he might have been a bank manager reviewing the accounts of his more important customersuntil he looked up dieter had seen the face before but it never failed to make him feel threatened it was a boxers face with a flat nose and a broad chin and closeset eyes and it was suffused with the naked aggression that had made rommel a legendary commander dieter recalled the story of rommels first military engagement during the first world war leading an advance guard of three men rommel had come upon a group of twenty french troops instead of retreating and calling for reinforcements rommel had opened fire and dashed at the enemy he had been lucky to survivebut dieter recalled napoleons dictum send me lucky generals since then rommel had always favored the sudden bold assault over the cautious planned advance in that he was the polar opposite of his desert opponent montgomery whose philosophy was never to attack until you were certain of victory sit down franck said rommel briskly whats on your mind dieter had rehearsed this on your instructions ive been visiting key installations that might be vulnerable to attack by the resistance and upgrading their security ive also been trying to assess the potential of the resistance to inflict serious damage can they really hamper our response to an invasion and your conclusion the situation is worse than we imagined rommel grunted with distaste as if an unpleasant suspicion had been confirmed reasons rommel was not going to bite his head off dieter relaxed a little he recounted yesterdays attack at sainteccile the imaginative planning the plentiful weaponry and most of all the bravery of the fighters the only detail he left out was the beauty of the blonde girl rommel stood up and walked across to the tapestry he stared at it but dieter was sure he did not see it i was afraid of this rommel said he spoke quietly almost to himself i can beat off an invasion even with the few troops i have if only i can remain mobile and flexiblebut if my communications fail im lost goedel nodded agreement dieter said i believe we can turn the attack on the telephone exchange into an opportunity rommel turned to him with a wry smile by god i wish all my officers were like you go on how will you do this dieter began to feel the meeting was going his way if i can interrogate the captured prisoners they may lead me to other groups with luck we might inflict a lot of damage on the resistance before the invasion rominel looked skeptical that sounds like bragging dieters heart sank then rommel went on if anyone else said it i might send him packing but i remember your work in the desert you got men to tell you things they hardly realized they knew dieter was pleased seizing his advantage he said unfortunately the gestapo is refusing me access to the prisoners they are such imbeciles i need you to intervene of course rommel looked at goedel call avenue foch the gestapos french headquarters was at avenue foch in paris tell them that major franck will interrogate the prisoners today or their next phone call will come from berchtesgaden he was referring to hitlers bavarian fortress rommel never hesitated to use the field marshals privilege of direct access to hitler very good said goedel rommel walked around his seventeenthcentury desk and sat down again keep me informed please franck he said and returned his attention to his papers dieter and goedel left the room goedel walked dieter to the main door of the castle outside it was still dark chapter flick landed at raf tempsford an airstrip fifty miles north of london near the village of sandy in bedfordshire she would have known just from the cool damp taste of the night air in her mouth that she was back in england she loved france but this was home walking across the airfield she remembered coming back from holidays as a child her mother would always say the same thing as the house came into view its nice to go away but its nice to come home the things her mother said came back to her at the oddest moments a young woman in the uniform of a fany corporal was waiting with a powerful jaguar to drive her to london this is luxurious flick said as she settled into the leather seat im to take you directly to orchard court the driver said theyre waiting to debrief you flick rubbed her eyes christ she said feelingly do they think we dont need sleep the driver did not respond to that instead she said i hope the mission went well major it was a snafu i beg pardon snafu flick repeated its an acronym it stands for situation normal all fucked up the woman fell silent flick guessed she was embarrassed it was nice she thought ruefully that there were still girls to whom the language of the barracks was shocking dawn broke as the fast car sped through the hertfordshire villages of stevenage and knebworth flick looked out at the modest houses with vegetables growing in the front gardens the country post offices where grumpy postmistresses resentfully doled out penny stamps and the assorted pubs with their warm beer and battered pianos and she felt profoundly grateful that the nazis had not got this far the feeling made her all the more determined to return to france she wanted another chance to attack the chfteau she pictured the people she had left behind at sainteccile albert young bertrand beautiful genevieve and the others dead or captured she thought of their families distraught with worry or stunned by grief she resolved that their sacrifice should not have been fruitless she would have to start right away it was a good thing she was to be debriefed immediately she would have a chance to propose her new plan today the men who ran soe would be wary at first for no one had ever sent an allfemale team on such a mission there were all sorts of snags but there were always snags by the time they reached the north london suburbs it was full daylight and the special people of the early morning were out and about postmen and milkmen making their deliveries train drivers and bus conductors walking to work the signs of war were everywhere a poster warning against waste a notice in a butchers window saying no meat today a woman driving a rubbish cart a whole row of small houses bombed into rubble but no one here would stop flick and demand to see her papers and put her in a cell and torture her for information then send her in a cattle truck to a camp where she would starve she felt the highvoltage tension of living undercover drain slowly out of her and she slumped in the car seat and closed her eyes she woke up when the car turned into baker street it went past no agents were kept out of the headquarters building so that they could not reveal its secrets under interrogation indeed many agents did not know its address the car turned into portman square and stopped outside orchard court an apartment building the driver sprang out to hold the door open flick went inside and made her way to soes flat her spirits lifted when she saw percy thwaite a balding man of fifty with a toothbrush mustache he was paternally fond of flick he wore civilian clothing and neither of them saluted for soe was impatient of military formalities i can tell by your face that it went badly percy said his sympathetic tone of voice was too much for flick to bear the tragedy of what had happened overwhelmed her suddenly and she burst into tears percy put his arms around her and patted her back she buried her face in his old tweed jacket all right he said i know you did your best oh god im sorry to be such a girl i wish all my men were such girls percy said with a catch in his voice she detached herself from his embrace and wiped her eyes with her sleeve take no notice he turned away and blew his nose into a big handkerchief tea or whisky he said tea i think she looked around the room was full of shabby furniture hastily installed in and never replaced a cheap desk a worn rug mismatched chairs she sank into a sagging armchair ill fall asleep if i have booze she watched percy as he made tea he could be tough as well as compassionate much decorated in the first world war he had become a rabblerousing labor organizer in the twenties and was a veteran of the battle of cable street when cockneys attacked fascists who were trying to march through a jewish neighborhood in londons east end he would ask searching questions about her plan but he would be open minded he handed her a mug of tea with milk and sugar theres a meeting later this morning he said i have to get a briefing note to the boss by nine ack emma hence the hurry she sipped the sweet tea and felt a pleasant jolt of energy she told him what had happened in the square at sainteccile he sat at the desk and made notes with a sharp pencil i should have called it off she finished based on antoinettes misgivings about the intelligence i should have postponed the raid and sent you a radio message saying we were outnumbered percy shook his head sadly this is no time for postponements the invasion cant be more than a few days away if you had consulted us i doubt it would have made any difference what could we do we couldnt send you more men i think we would have ordered you to go ahead regardless it had to be tried the telephone exchange is too important well thats some consolation flick was glad she did not have to believe albert had died because she had made a tactical error but that would not bring him back and michel is all right percy said mortified but recovering when soe had recruited flick she had not told them her husband was in the resistance if they had known they might have steered her toward different work but she had not really known it herself though she had guessed in may she had been in england visiting her mother and michel had been in the army like most ablebodied young frenchmen so the fall of france had left them stranded in different countries by the time she returned as a secret agent and learned for certain what role her husband was playing too much training had been invested in her and she was already too useful to soe for her to be fired on account of hypothetical emotional distractions everyone hates a bullet in the backside percy mused people think you must have been running away he stood up well youd better go home and get some sleep not yet flick said first i want to know what were going to do next im going to write this report no i mean about the telephone exchange if it s so important we have to knock it out he sat down again and looked at her shrewdly what have you got in mind she took antoinettes pass out of her bag and threw it on his desk heres a better way to get inside thats used by the cleaners who go in every night at seven oclock percy picked up the pass and scrutinized it clever girl he said with something like admiration in his voice go on i want to go back a look of pain passed briefly over percys face and flick knew he was dreading her risking her life again but he said nothing this time ill take a full team with me she went on each of them will have a pass like that well substitute for the cleaners in order to get into the chfteau i take it the cleaners are women yes id need an allfemale team he nodded not many people around here will object to thatyou girls have proved yourselves but where would you find the women virtually all our trained people are over there already get approval for my plan and ill find the women ill take soe rejects people who failed the training course anybody we must have a file of people who have dropped out for one reason or another yesbecause they were physically unfit or couldnt keep their mouths shut or enjoyed violence too much or lost their nerve in parachute training and refused to jump out of the plane it doesnt matter if theyre secondraters flick argued earnestly i can deal with that at the back of her mind a voice said can you really but she ignored it if the invasion fails weve lost europe we wont try again for years this is the turning point we have to throw everything at the enemy you couldnt use french women who are already there resistance fighters flick had already considered and rejected that idea if i had a few weeks i might put together a team from women in half a dozen different resistance circuits but it would take too long to find them and get them to reims it might still be possible and then we have to have a forged pass with a photo for each woman thats hard to arrange over there here we can do it in a day or two its not that easy percy held antoinettes pass up to the light of a naked bulb hanging from the ceiling but youre right our people do work miracles in that department he put it down all right it has to be soe rejects then flick felt a surge of triumph he was going for it percy went on but assuming you can find enough frenchspeaking girls will it work what about the german guards dont they know the cleaners its probably not the same women every nightthey must have days off and men never notice who cleans up after them im not sure soldiers are generally sexhungry youngsters who pay great attention to all the women with whom they come into contact i imagine the men in this chfteau flirt with the younger ones at least i watched these women entering the chfteau last night and i didnt see any signs of flirting still you cant be sure the men wont notice the appearance of a completely strange crew i cant be certain but im confident enough to take the chance all right what about the french people inside the telephone operators are local women arent they some are local but most are brought in from reims by bus not every french person likes the resistance we both know that there are some who approve of the nazis ideas god knows there were plenty of fools in britain who thought hitler offered the kind of strong modernizing government we all neededalthough you dont hear much from those people nowadays flick shook her head percy had not been to occupied france the french have had four years of nazi rule remember everyone over there is hoping desperately for the invasion the switchboard girls will keep mum even though the raf bombed them flick shrugged there may be a few hostile ones but the majority will keep them under control you hope once again i think its a chance worth taking you still dont know how heavily guarded that basement entrance is that didnt stop us trying yesterday yesterday you had fifteen resistance fighters some of them seasoned next time youll have a handful of dropouts and rejects flick played her trump card listen all kinds of things could go wrong but so what the operation is lowcost and were risking the lives of people who arent contributing to the war effort anyway what have we got to lose i was coming to that look i like this plan im going to put it up to the boss but i think he will reject it for a reason we havent yet discussed what no one but you could lead this team but the trip youve just returned from should be your last you know too much youve been going in and out for two years youve had contact with most of the resistance circuits in northern france we cant send you back if you were captured you could give them all away i know flick said grimly thats why i carry a suicide pill chapter general sir bernard montgomery commander of the st army group which was about to invade france had set up improvised headquarters in west london at a school whose pupils had been evacuated to safer accommodation in the countryside by coincidence it was the school monty himself had attended as a boy meetings were held in the model room and everyone sat on the schoolboys hard wooden benchesgenerals and politicians and on one famous occasion the king himself the brits thought this was cute paul chancellor from boston massachusetts thought it was bullshit what would it have cost them to bring in a few chairs he liked the british by and large but not when they were showing off how eccentric they were paul was on montys personal staff a lot of people thought this was because his father was a general but that was an unfair assumption paul was comfortable with senior officers partly because of his father partly because before the war the us army had been the biggest customer for his business which was making educational gramophone records language courses mainly he liked the military virtues of obedience punctuality and precision but he could think for himself too and monty had come to rely on him more and more his area of responsibility was intelligence he was an organizer he made sure the reports monty needed were on his desk when he wanted them chased those that came late set up meetings with key people and made supplementary inquiries on the bosss behalf he did have experience of clandestine work he had been with the office of strategic services the american secret agency and had served under cover in france and frenchspeaking north africa as a child he had lived in paris where pa was military attach at the us embassy paul had been wounded six months ago in a shootout with the gestapo in marseilles one bullet had taken off most of his left ear but harmed nothing other than his looks the other smashed his right kneecap which would never be the same again and that was the real reason he had a desk job the work was easy by comparison with living on the run in occupied territory but never dull they were planning operation overlord the invasion that would end the war paul was one of a few hundred people in the world who knew the date although many more could guess in fact there were three possible dates based on the tides the currents the moon and the hours of daylight the invasion needed a laterising moon so that the armys initial movements would be shrouded in darkness but there would be moonlight later when the first paratroopers jumped from their planes and gliders a low tide at dawn was necessary to expose the obstacles rommel had scattered on the beaches and another low tide before nightfall was needed for the landing of followup forces these requirements left only a narrow window the fleet could sail next monday june or on the following tuesday or wednesday the final decision would be made at the last minute depending on the weather by the allied supreme commander general eisenhower three years ago paul would have been desperately scheming for a place in the invasion force he would have been itching for action and embarrassed at being a stayathome now he was older and wiser for one thing he had paid his dues in high school he had captained the side that won the massachusetts championship but he would never again kick a ball with his right foot more importantly he knew that his organizational talents could do more to win the war than his ability to shoot straight he was thrilled to be part of the team that was planning the greatest invasion of all time with the thrill came anxiety of course battles never went according to plan although it was a weakness of montys to pretend that his did paul knew that any error he madea slip of the pen a detail overlooked a piece of intelligence not doublecheckedcould kill allied troops despite the huge size of the invasion force the battle could still go either way and the smallest of mistakes could tip the balance today at ten am paul had scheduled fifteen minutes on the french resistance it was montys idea he was nothing if not a detail man the way to win battles he believed was to refrain from fighting until all preparations were in place at five to ten simon fortescue came into the model room he was one of the senior men at mi the secret intelligence department a tall man in a pinstriped suit he had a smoothly authoritative manner but paul doubted if he knew much about clandestine work in the real world he was followed by john graves a nervouslooking civil servant from the ministry of economic warfare the government department that oversaw soe graves wore the whitehall uniform of black jacket and striped gray pants paul frowned he had not invited graves mr graves he said sharply i didnt know you had been asked to join us ill explain in a second graves said and he sat down on a schoolboy bench looking flustered and opened his briefcase paul was irritated monty hated surprises but paul could not throw graves out of the room a moment later monty walked in he was a small man with a pointed nose and receding hair his face was deeply lined either side of his closeclipped mustache he was fiftysix but looked older paul liked him monty was so meticulous that some people became impatient with him and called him an old woman paul believed that montys fussiness saved mens lives with monty was an american paul did not know monty introduced him as general pickford wheres the chap from sue monty snapped looking at paul graves answered im afraid he was summoned by the prime minister and sends his profound apologies i hope ill be able to help i doubt it monty said crisply paul groaned inwardly it was a snafu and he would be blamed but there was something else going on here the brits were playing some game he did not know about he watched them carefully looking for clues simon fortescue said smoothly im sure i can fill in the gaps monty looked angry he had promised general pickford a briefing and the key person was absent but he did not waste time on recriminations in the coming battle he said without further ado the most dangerous moments will be the first it was unusual for him to speak of dangerous moments paul thought his way was to talk as if everything would go like clockwork we will be hanging by our fingertips from a cliff edge for a day or two days paul said to himself or a week or more this will be the enemys best opportunity he has only to stamp on our fingers with the heel of his jackboot so easy paul thought overlord was the largest military operation in human history thousands of boats hundreds of thousands of men millions of dollars tens of millions of bullets the future of the world depended on the outcome yet this vast force could be repelled so easily if things went wrong in the first few hours anything we can do to slow the enemys response will be of crucial importance monty finished and he looked at graves well f section of sue has more than a hundred agents in francein fact virtually all our people are over there graves began and under them of course are thousands of french resistance fighters over the last few weeks we have dropped them many hundreds of tons of guns ammunition and explosives it was a bureaucrats answer paul thought it said everything and nothing graves would have gone on but monty interrupted with the key question how effective will they be the civil servant hesitated and fortescue jumped in my expectations are modest he said the performance of soe is nothing if not uneven there was a subtext here paul knew the oldtime professional spies at mi hated the newcomers of sue with their swashbuckling style when the resistance struck at german installations they stirred up gestapo investigations which then sometimes caught mis people paul took sues side striking at the enemy was the whole point of war was that the game here a bureaucratic spat between mi and soe any particular reason for your pessimism monty asked fortescue take last nights fiasco fortescue replied promptly a resistance group under an sue commander attacked a telephone exchange near reims general pickford spoke for the first time i thought it was our policy not to attack telephone exchangeswere going to need them ourselves if the invasion is successful youre quite right monty said but sainteccile has been made an exception its an access node for the new cable route to germany most of the telephone and telex traffic between the high command in berlin and german forces in france passes through that building knocking it out wouldnt do us much harmwe wont be calling germanybut would wreak havoc with the enemys communications pickford said theyll switch to wireless communication exactly said monty then well be able to read their signals fortescue put in thanks to our code breakers at bletchley paul knew though not many other people did that british intelligence had cracked the codes used by the germans and therefore could read much of the enemys radio traffic mi was proud of this although in truth they deserved little credit the work had been done not by intelligence staff but by an irregular group of mathematicians and crosswordpuzzle enthusiasts many of whom would have been arrested if they had entered an mi office in normal times sir stewart menzies the foxhunting head of mi hated intellectuals communists and homosexuals but alan turing the mathematical genius who led the code breakers was all three however pickford was right if the germans could not use the phone lines they would have to use radio and then the allies would know what they were saying destroying the telephone exchange at saintecdcile would give the allies a crucial advantage but the mission had gone wrong who was in charge monty asked graves said i havent seen a full report i can tell you fortescue interjected major clairet he paused a girl paul had heard of felicity clairet she was something of a legend among the small group who knew the secret of the allies clandestine war she had survived under cover in france longer than anyone her code name was leopardess and people said she moved around the streets of occupied france with the silent footsteps of a dangerous cat they also said she was a pretty girl with a heart of stone she had killed more than once and what happened monty said poor planning an inexperienced commander and a lack of discipline among the men all played their part fortescue replied the building was not heavily guarded but the germans there are trained troops and they simply wiped out the resistance force monty looked angry pickford said looks like we shouldnt rely too heavily on the french resistance to disrupt rommels supply lines fortescue nodded bombing is the more reliable means to that end im not sure thats quite fair graves protested feebly bomber command has its successes and failures too and soe is a good deal cheaper were not here to be fair to people for gods sake monty growled we just want to win the war he stood up i think weve heard enough he said to general pickford graves said but what shall we do about the telephone exchange soe has come up with a new plan good god fortescue interrupted we dont want another ballsup do we bomb it said monty weve tried that graves said they hit the building but the damage was not sufficient to put the telephone exchange out of action for longer than a few hours then bomb it again said monty and he walked out graves threw a look of petulant fury at the man from mi really fortescue he said i mean to say really fortescue did not respond they all left the room in the hallway outside two people were waiting a man of about fifty in a tweed jacket and a short blonde woman wearing a worn blue cardigan over a faded cotton dress standing in front of a display of sporting trophies they looked almost like a head teacher chatting to a schoolgirl except that the girl wore a bright yellow scarf tied with a touch of style that looked to paul distinctly french fortescue hurried past them but graves stopped they turned you down he said theyre going to bomb it again paul guessed that the woman was the leopardess and he looked at her with interest she was small and slim with curly blonde hair cut short andpaul noticedrather lovely green eyes he would not have called her pretty her face was too grownup for that the initial schoolgirl impression was fleeting there was an aggressive look to her straight nose and chiselshaped chin and there was something sexy about her something that made paul think about the slight body under the shabby dress she reacted with indignation to graves statement theres no point in bombing the place from the air the basement is reinforced for gods sake why did they make that decision perhaps you should ask this gentleman graves said turning to paul major chancellor meet major clairet and colonel thwaite paul was annoyed at being put in the position of defending someone elses decision caught off guard he replied with undiplomatic frankness i dont see that theres much to explain he said brusquely you screwed up and youre not being given a second chance the woman glared up at himshe was a foot shorter than heand spoke angrily screwed up she said what the hell do you mean by that paul felt himself flush maybe general montgomery was misinformed but wasnt this the first time you had commanded an action of this kind major is that what youve been told that it was my lack of experience she was beautiful he saw now anger made her eyes wide and her cheeks pink but she was being very rude so he decided to give it to her with both barrels that and poor planning there was nothing wrong with the damn plan and the fact that trained troops were defending the place against an undisciplined force you arrogant pig paul took an involuntary step back he had never been spoken to this way by a woman she may be five feet nothing he thought but i bet she scares the damn nazis looking at her furious face he realized that she was most angry with herself you think its your fault he said no one gets this mad about other peoples mistakes it was her turn to be taken aback her mouth dropped open and she was speechless colonel thwaite spoke for the first time calm down flick for gods sake he said turning to paul he went on let me guessthis account was given to you by simon fortescue of mi was it not thats correct paul said stiffly did he mention that the attack plan was based on intelligence supplied by his organization i dont believe he did i thought not said thwaite thank you major i dont need to trouble you any further paul did not feel the conversation was really over but he had been dismissed by a senior officer and he had no choice but to walk away he had obviously got caught in the crossfire of a turf war between mi and soe he felt most angry with fortescue who had used the meeting to score points had monty made the right decision in choosing to bomb the telephone exchange rather than let soe have another go at it paul was not sure as he turned into his own office he glanced back major clairet was still arguing with colonel thwaite her voice low but her face animated expressing outrage with large gestures she stood like a man hand on hip leaning forward making her point with a belligerent forefinger but all the same there was something enchanting about her paul wondered what it would be like to hold her in his arms and run his hands over her lithe body although shes tough he thought shes all woman but was she right was bombing futile he decided to ask some more questions chapter the vast sooty bulk of the cathedral loomed over the center of reims like a divine reproach dieter francks skyblue hispanosuiza pulled up at midday outside the hotel frankfort taken over by the german occupiers dieter got out and glanced up at the stubby twin towers of the great church the original medieval design had featured elegant pointed spires which had never been built for lack of money so mundane obstacles frustrated the holiest of aspirations dieter told lieutenant hesse to drive to the chfteau at sainteccile and make sure the gestapo were ready to cooperate he did not want to risk being repulsed a second time by major weber hesse drove off and dieter went up to the suite where he had left stephanie last night she got up from her chair as he walked in he drank in the welcome sight her red hair fell on bare shoulders and she wore a chestnut silk negligee and highheeled slippers he kissed her hungrily and ran his hands over her slim body grateful for the gift of her beauty how nice that youre so pleased to see me she said with a smile they spoke french together as always dieter inhaled the scent of her well you smell better than hans hesse especially when hes been up all night she brushed his hair back with a soft hand you always make fun but you wouldnt have protected hans with your own body true he sighed and let her go christ im tired come to bed he shook his head i have to interrogate the prisoners hesses coming back for me in an hour he slumped on the couch ill get you something to eat she pressed the bell and a minute later an elderly french waiter tapped at the door stephanie knew dieter well enough to order for him she asked for a plate of ham with warm rolls and potato salad some wine she asked him noitll send me to sleep a pot of coffee then she told the waiter when the man had gone she sat on the couch beside dieter and took his hand did everything go according to plan yes rommel was quite complimentary to me he frowned anxiously i just hope i can live up to the promises i made him im sure you will she did not ask for details she knew he would tell her as much as he wanted to and no more he looked fondly at her wondering whether to say what was on his mind it might spoil the pleasant atmospherebut it needed to be said he sighed again if the invasion is successful and the allies win back france it will be the end for you and me you know that she winced as if at a sudden pain and let go of his hand do i he knew that her husband had been killed early in the war and they had had no children do you have any family at all he asked her my parents died years ago i have a sister in montreal maybe we should be thinking about how to send you over there she shook her head no why she would not meet his eye i just wish the war would be over she muttered no you dont she showed a rare flash of irritation of course i do how uncharacteristically conventional of you he said with a hint of scorn you cant possibly think war is a good thing you and i would not be together were it not for the war but what about all the suffering im an existentialist war enables people to be what they really are the sadists become torturers the psychopaths make brave frontline troops the bullies and the victims alike have scope to play their roles to the hilt and the whores are always busy she looked angry that tells me pretty clearly what part i play he stroked her soft cheek and touched her lips with the tip of his finger youre a courtesanand very good at it she moved her head away you dont mean any of this youre improvising on a tune the way you do when you sit at the piano he smiled and nodded he could play a little jazz much to his fathers dismay the analogy was apt he was trying out ideas rather than expressing a firm conviction perhaps youre right her anger evaporated and she looked sad did you mean the part about us separating if the germans leave france he put his arm around her shoulders and pulled her to him she relaxed and laid her head on his chest he kissed the top of her head and stroked her hair its not going to happen he said are you certain i guarantee it it was the second time today he had made a promise he might not be able to keep the waiter returned with his lunch and the spell was broken dieter was almost too tired to be hungry but he ate a few mouthfuls and drank all the coffee afterwards he washed and shaved and then he felt better as he was buttoning a clean uniform shirt lieutenant hesse tapped at the door dieter kissed stephanie and went out the car was diverted around a blocked street there had been another bombing raid overnight and a whole row of houses near the railway station had been destroyed they got out of town and headed for sainteccile dieter had told rommel that the interrogation of the prisoners might enable him to cripple the resistance before the invasionbut rommel like any military commander took a maybe for a promise and would now expect results unfortunately there was nothing guaranteed about an interrogation clever prisoners told lies that were impossible to check some found ingenious ways to kill themselves before the torture became unbearable if security was really tight in their particular resistance circuit each would know only the minimum about the others and have little information of value worst of all they might have been fed false information by the perfidious allies so that when they finally broke under torture what they said was part of a deception plan dieter began to put himself in the mood he needed to be completely hardhearted and calculating he must not allow himself to be touched by the physical and mental suffering he was about to inflict on human beings all that mattered was whether it worked he closed his eyes and felt a profound calm settle over him a familiar bonedeep chill that he sometimes thought must be like the cold of death itself the car pulled into the grounds of the chfteau workmen were repairing the smashed glass in the windows and filling the holes made by grenades in the ornate hall the telephonists murmured into their microphones in a perpetual undertone dieter marched through the perfectly proportioned rooms of the east wing with hans hesse in tow they went down the stairs to the fortified basement the sentry at the door saluted and made no attempt to detain dieter who was in uniform he found the door marked interrogation center and went in in the outer room willi weber sat at the table dieter barked heil hitler and saluted forcing weber to stand then dieter pulled out a chair sat down and said please be seated major weber was furious at being invited to sit in his own headquarters but he had no choice dieter said how many prisoners do we have three dieter was disappointed so few we killed eight of the enemy in the skirmish two more died of their wounds overnight dieter grunted with dismay he had ordered that the wounded be kept alive but there was no point now in questioning weber about their treatment weber went on i believe two escaped yes dieter said the woman in the square and the man she carried away exactly so from a total of fifteen attackers we have three prisoners where are they weber looked shifty two are in the cells dieter narrowed his eyes and the third weber inclined his head toward the inner room the third is under interrogation at this moment dieter got up apprehensive and opened the door the hunched figure of sergeant becker stood just inside the room holding in his hand a wooden club like a large policemans truncheon he was sweating and breathing hard as if he had been taking vigorous exercise he was staring at a prisoner who was tied to a post dieter looked at the prisoner and his fears were confirmed despite his selfimposed calm he grimaced with revulsion the prisoner was the young woman genevieve who had carried a sten gun under her coat she was naked tied to the pillar by a rope that passed under her arms and supported her slumped weight her face was so swollen that she could not have opened her eyes blood from her mouth covered her chin and most of her chest her body was discolored with angry bruises one arm hung at an odd angle apparently dislocated at the shoulder her pubic hair was matted with blood dieter said to becker what has she told you becker looked embarrassed nothing dieter nodded suppressing his rage it was as he had expected he went close to the woman genevieve listen to me he said in french she showed no sign of having heard would you like to rest now he tried there was no response he turned around weber was standing in the doorway looking defiant dieter coldly furious said you were expressly told that i would conduct the interrogation we were ordered to give you access weber replied with smug pedantry we were not prohibited from questioning the prisoners ourselves and are you satisfied with the results you have achieved weber did not answer dieter said what about the other two we have not yet begun their interrogation thank god for that dieter was nonetheless dismayed he had expected half a dozen subjects not two take me to them weber nodded at becker who put down his club and led the way out of the room in the bright lights of the corridor dieter could see the bloodstains on beckers uniform the sergeant stopped at a door with a judas peephole dieter slid back the panel and looked inside it was a bare room with a dirt floor the only item of furniture was a bucket in the corner two men sat on the ground not talking staring into space dieter studied them carefully he had seen both yesterday the older one was gaston who had set the charges he had a large piece of stickingplaster covering a scalp wound that looked superficial the other was very young about seventeen and dieter recalled that his name was bertrand he had no visible injuries but dieter recalling the skirmish thought he might have been stunned by the explosion of a hand grenade dieter watched them for a while taking time to think he had to do this right he could not afford to waste another captive these two were the only assets left the kid would be scared he foresaw but might withstand a lot of pain the other was too old for serious torturehe might die before he crackedbut he would be softhearted dieter began to see a strategy for interrogating them he closed the judas and returned to the interview room becker followed reminding him again of a stupid but dangerous dog dieter said sergeant becker untie the woman and put her in the cell with the other two weber protested a woman in a mans cell dieter stared at him incredulously do you think she will feel the indignity becker went into the torture chamber and reemerged carrying the broken body of genevieve dieter said make sure the old man gets a good look at her then bring him here becker went out dieter decided he would prefer to get rid of weber however he knew that if he gave a direct order weber would resist so he said i think you should remain here to witness the interrogation you could learn a lot from my techniques as dieter had expected weber did the opposite i dont think so he said becker can keep me informed dieter faked an indignant expression and weber went out dieter caught the eye of lieutenant hesse who had quietly taken a seat in the corner hesse understood how dieter had manipulated weber and was looking admiringly at dieter dieter shrugged sometimes its too easy he said becker returned with gaston the older man was pale no doubt he had been badly shocked by the sight of genevieve dieter said in german please have a seat do you like to smoke gaston looked blank that established that he did not understand german which was worth knowing dieter motioned him to a seat and offered him cigarettes and matches gaston took a cigarette and lit it with shaking hands some prisoners broke at this stage before torture just from fear of what would happen dieter hoped that might be the case today he had shown gaston the alternatives on one hand the dreadful sight of genevieve on the other cigarettes and kindness now he spoke in french using a friendly tone im going to ask you some questions i dont know anything gaston said oh i think you do dieter said youre in your sixties and youve probably lived in or around reims all your life gaston did not deny this dieter went on i realize that the members of a resistance cell use code names and give one another the minimum of personal information as a security precaution gaston involuntarily gave a slight nod of agreement but youve known most of these people for decades a man may call himself elephant or priest or aubergine when the resistance meet but you know his face and you recognize him as jeanpierre the postman who lives in the rue du parc and surreptitiously visits the widow martineau on tuesdays when his wife thinks he is playing bowls gaston looked away unwilling to meet dieters eye confirming that dieter was right dieter went on i want you to understand that you are in control of everything that happens here pain or the relief of pain the sentence of death or reprieve all depend on your choices he saw with satisfaction that gaston looked even more terrified you will answer my questions he went on everyone does in the end the only imponderable is how soon this was the moment when a man might break down but gaston did not i cant tell you anything he said in a nearwhisper he was scared but he still had some courage left and he was not going to give up without a fight dieter shrugged it was to be the hard way then he spoke to becker in german go back to the cell make the boy strip naked bring him here and tie him to the pillar in the next room very good major becker said eagerly dieter turned back to gaston youre going to tell me the names and code names of all the men and women who were with you yesterday and any others in your resistance circuit gaston shook his head but dieter ignored that i want to know the address of every member and of every house used by members of the circuit gaston drew hard on his cigarette and stared at the glowing end in fact these were not the most important questions dieters main aim was to get information that would lead him to other resistance circuits but he did not want gaston to know that a moment later becker returned with bertrand gaston stared openmouthed as the naked boy was marched through the interview room into the chamber beyond dieter stood up he said to hesse keep an eye on this old man then he followed becker into the torture chamber he was careful to leave the door a little ajar so that gaston could hear everything becker tied bertrand to the pillar before dieter could intervene becker punched bertrand in the stomach it was a powerful blow from a strong man and it made a sickening thud the young man groaned and writhed in agony no no no dieter said as he had expected beckers approach was completely unscientific a strong young man could withstand being punched almost indefinitely first you blindfold him he produced a large cotton bandana from his pocket and tied it over bertrands eyes this way every blow comes as a dreadful shock and every moment between blows is an agony of anticipation becker picked up his wooden club dieter nodded and becker swung the club hitting the side of the victims head with a loud crack of solid wood on skin and bone bertrand cried out in pain and fear no no dieter said again never hit the head you may dislocate the jaw preventing the subject from speaking worse you may damage the brain then nothing he says will be of any value he took the wooden club from becker and replaced it in the umbrella stand from the selection of weapons there he chose a steel crowbar and handed it to becker now remember the object is to inflict unbearable agony without endangering the subjects life or his ability to tell us what we need to know avoid vital organs concentrate on the bony parts ankles shins kneecaps fingers elbows shoulders ribs a crafty look came over beckers face he walked around the pillar then taking careful aim struck hard at bertrands elbow with the steel bar the boy gave a scream of real agony a sound dieter recognized becker looked pleased god forgive me dieter thought for teaching this brute how to inflict pain more efficiently on dieters orders becker struck at bertrands bony shoulder then his hand then his ankle dieter made becker pause between blows allowing just enough time for the pain to ease slightly and for the subject to begin to dread the next stroke bertrand began to appeal for mercy no more please he implored hysterical with pain and fear becker raised the crowbar but dieter stopped him he wanted the begging to go on please dont hit me again bertrand cried please please dieter said to becker it is often a good idea to break a leg early in the interview the pain is quite excruciating especially when the broken bone is struck again he selected a sledgehammer from the umbrella stand just below the knee he said handing it to becker as hard as you can becker took careful aim and swung mightily the crack as the shin broke was loud enough to hear bertrand screamed and fainted becker picked up a bucket of water that stood in a corner and threw the water in bertrands face the young man came to and screamed again eventually the screams subsided to heartrending groans what do you want bertrand implored please tell me what you want from me dieter did not ask him any questions instead he handed the steel crowbar to becker and pointed to the broken leg where a jagged white edge of bone stuck through the flesh becker struck the leg at that point bertrand screamed and passed out again dieter thought that might be enough he went into the next room gaston sat where dieter had left him but he was a different man he was bent over in his chair face in his hands crying with great sobs moaning and praying to god dieter knelt in front of him and prized his hands away from his wet face gaston looked at him through tears dieter said softly only you can make it stop please stop it please gaston moaned will you answer my questions there was a pause bertrand screamed again yes gaston yelled yes yes ill tell you everything if you just stop dieter raised his voice sergeant becker yes major no more for now yes major becker sounded disappointed dieter reverted to french now gaston lets begin with the leader of the circuit name and code name who is he gaston hesitated dieter looked toward the open door of the torture chamber gaston quickly said michel clairet code name monet it was the breakthrough the first name was the hardest the rest would follow effortlessly concealing his satisfaction dieter gave gaston a cigarette and held a match where does he live in reims gaston blew out smoke and his shaking began to subside he gave an address near the cathedral dieter nodded to lieutenant hesse who took out a notebook and began to record gastons responses patiently dieter took gaston through each member of the attack team in a few cases gaston knew only the code names and there were two men he claimed never to have seen before sunday dieter believed him there had been two getaway drivers waiting a short distance away gaston said a young woman called gilberte and a man codenamed marchal there were others in the group which was known as the bollinger circuit dieter asked about relationships between resistance members were there any love affairs were any of them homosexual was anyone sleeping with someone elses wife although the torture had stopped bertrand continued to groan and sometimes scream with the agony of his wounds and now gaston said is he going to be looked after dieter shrugged please get a doctor for him very well when we have finished our talk gaston told dieter that michel and gilberte were lovers even though michel was married to flick the blond girl in the square so far gaston had been talking about a circuit that was mostly destroyed so his information had been mainly of academic interest now dieter moved on to more important questions when allied agents come to this district how do they make contact no one was supposed to know how that was handled gaston said there was a cutout however he knew part of the story the agents were met by a woman codenamed bourgeoise gaston did not know where she met them but she took them to her home then she passed them on to michel no one had ever met bourgeoise not even michel dieter was disappointed that gaston knew so little about the woman but that was the idea of a cutout do you know where she lives gaston nodded one of the agents gave it away she has a house in the rue du bois number eleven dieter tried not to look jubilant this was a key fact the enemy would probably send more agents in an attempt to rebuild the bollinger circuit dieter might be able to catch them at the safe house and when they leave they were picked up by plane in a field codenamed champ de pierre actually a pasture near the village of chatelle gaston revealed there was an alternative landing field codenamed champ dor but he did not know where it was dieter asked gaston about liaison with london who had ordered the attack on the telephone exchange gaston explained that flickmajor clairetwas the circuits commanding officer and she had brought orders from london dieter was intrigued a woman in command but he had seen her courage under fire she would make a good leader in the next room bertrand began to pray aloud for death to come please gaston said a doctor just tell me about major clairet dieter said then ill get someone to give bertrand an injection she is a very important person gaston said eager now to give dieter information that would satisfy him they say she has survived longer than anyone else undercover she has been all over northern france dieter was spellbound she has contact with different circuits so i believe that was unusualand it meant she could be a fountain of information about the french resistance dieter said she got away yesterday after the skirmish where do you think she went back to london im sure gaston said to report on the raid dieter cursed silently he wanted her in france where he could catch her and interrogate her if he got his hands on her he could destroy half the french resistanceas he had promised rommel but she was out of reach he stood up thats all for now he said hans get a doctor for the prisoners i dont want any of them to die todaythey may have more to tell us then type up your notes and bring them to me in the morning very good major make a copy for major weberbut dont give it to him until i say so understood ill drive myself back to the hotel dieter went out the headache began as he stepped into the open air rubbing his forehead with his hand he made his way to the car and drove out of the village heading for reims the afternoon sun seemed to reflect off the road surface straight into his eyes these migraines often struck him after an interrogation in an hour he would be blind and helpless he had to get back to the hotel before the attack reached its peak reluctant to brake he sounded his horn constantly vineyard workers making their slow way home scattered out of his path horses reared and a cart was driven into the ditch his eyes watered with the pain and he felt nauseous he reached the town without crashing the car he managed to steer into the center outside the hotel frankfort he did not so much park the car as abandon it staggering inside he made his way to the suite stephanie knew immediately what had happened while he stripped off his uniform tunic and shirt she got the field medical kit out of her suitcase and filled a syringe with the morphine mixture dieter fell on the bed and she plunged the needle into his arm almost immediately the pain eased stephanie lay down beside him stroking his face with gentle fingertips a few moments later dieter was unconscious chapter flicks home was a bedsitter in a big old house in bayswater her room was in the attic if a bomb came through the roof it would land on her bed she spent little time there not for fear of bombs but because real life went on elsewherein france at soe headquarters or at one of soes training centers around the country there was little of her in the room a photo of michel playing a guitar a shelf of flaubert and moliere in french a watercolor of nice she had painted at the age of fifteen the small chest had three drawers of clothing and one of guns and ammunition feeling weary and depressed she undressed and lay down on the bed looking through a copy of parade magazine berlin had been bombed by a force of planes last wednesday she read it was hard to imagine she tried to picture what it must have been like for the ordinary germans living there and all she could think of was a medieval painting of hell with naked people being burned alive in a hail of fire she turned the page and read a silly story about secondrate vcigarettes being passed off as woodbines her mind kept returning to yesterdays failure she reran the battle in her mind imagining a dozen decisions she might have made differently leading to victory instead of defeat as well as losing the battle she feared she might be losing her husband and she wondered if there was a link inadequate as a leader inadequate as a wife perhaps there was some flaw deep in her character now that her alternative plan had been rejected there was no prospect of redeeming herself all those brave people had died for nothing eventually she drifted into an uneasy sleep she was awakened by someone banging on the door and calling flick telephone the voice belonged to one of the girls in the flat below the clock on flicks bookshelf said six who is it she called he just said the office im coming she pulled on a dressing gown unsure whether it was six in the morning or evening she glanced out of her little window the sun was setting over the elegant terraces of ladbroke grove she ran downstairs to the phone in the hail percy thwaites voice said sorry to wake you thats all right she was always glad to hear percys voice on the other end of the phone she had become very fond of him even though he constantly sent her into danger running agents was a heartbreaking job and some senior officers anaesthetized themselves by adopting a hardhearted attitude toward the death or capture of their people but percy never did that he felt every loss as a bereavement consequently flick knew he would never take an unnecessary risk with her she trusted him can you come to orchard court she wondered if the authorities had reconsidered her new plan for taking out the telephone exchange and her heart leaped with hope has monty changed his mind im afraid not but i need you to brief someone she bit her lip suppressing her disappointment ill be there in a few minutes she dressed quickly and took the underground to baker street percy was waiting for her in the flat in portman square ive found a radio operator no experience but hes done the training im sending him to reims tomorrow flick glanced reflexively at the window to check the weather as agents always did when a flight was mentioned percys curtains were drawn for security but anyway she knew the weather was fine reims why weve heard nothing from michel today i need to know how much of the bollinger circuit is left flick nodded pierre the radio operator had been in the attack squad presumably he was captured or dead michel might have been able to locate pierres radio transceiver but he had not been trained to operate it and he certainly did not know the codes but whats the point weve sent them tons of explosives and ammunition in the last few months i want them to light some fires the telephone exchange is the most important target but its not the only one even if theres no one left but michel and a couple of others they can blow up railway lines cut telephone wires and shoot sentriesit all helps but i cant direct them if i have no communication flick shrugged to her the chfteau was the only target that mattered everything else was chicken feed but what the hell ill brief him of course percy gave her a hard look he hesitated then said how was michelapart from his bullet wound fine flick was silent for a moment percy stared at her she could not deceive him he knew her too well at last she sighed and said theres a girl i was afraid of that i dont know whether theres anything left of my marriage she said bitterly im sorry it would help if i could tell myself that id made a sacrifice for a purpose struck a magnificent blow for our side made the invasion more likely to succeed youve done more than most over the last two years but theres no second prize in a war is there no she stood up she was grateful for percys fond sympathy but it was making her maudlin id better brief the new radioman code name helicopter hes waiting in the study not the sharpest knife in the box im afraid but a brave lad this seemed sloppy to flick if hes not too bright why send him he might endanger others as you said earlierthis is our big chance if the invasion fails weve lost europe weve got to throw everything we have at the enemy now because we wont get another chance flick nodded grimly he had turned her own argument against her but he was right the only difference was that the lives being endangered in this case included michels okay she said id better get on with it hes eager to see you she frowned eager why percy gave a wry smile go and find out for yourself flick left the drawing room of the apartment where percy had his desk and went along the corridor his secretary was typing in the kitchen and she directed flick to another room flick paused outside the door this is how it is she told herself you pick yourself up and carry on working hoping you will eventually forget she entered the study a small room with a square table and a few mismatched chairs helicopter was a fairskinned boy of about twentytwo wearing a tweed suit in a checked pattern of mustard orange and green you could tell he was english from a distance of a mile fortunately before he got on the plane he would be kitted out in clothing that would look inconspicuous in a french town soe employed french tailors and dressmakers who sewed continentalstyle clothes for agents then spent hours making the clothes look worn and shabby so that they would not attract attention by their newness there was nothing they could do about helicopters pink complexion and redblond hair except hope that the gestapo would think he must have some german blood flick introduced herself and he said yes weve met before actually im sorry i dont remember you were at oxford with my brother charles charlie standishof course flick remembered another fair boy in tweeds taller and slimmer than helicopter but probably no clevererhe had not taken a degree charlie spoke fluent french she recalledsomething they had had in common you came to our house in gloucestershire once actually flick recalled a weekend in a country house in the thirties and a family with an amiable english father and a chic french mother charlie had had a kid brother brian an awkward adolescent in knee shorts very excited about his new camera she had talked to him a bit and he had developed a little crush on her so how is charlie i havent seen him since we graduated hes dead actually brian looked suddenly griefstricken died in fortyone killed in the bbbloody desert actually flick was afraid he would cry she took his hand in both of hers and said brian im so terribly sorry jolly nice of you he swallowed hard with an effort he brightened ive seen you since then just once you gave a lecture to my soe training group i didnt get a chance to speak to you afterwards i hope my talk was useful you spoke about traitors within the resistance and what to do about them its quite simple you said you put the barrel of your pistol to the back of the bastards head and pull the trigger twice scared us all to death actually he was looking at her with something like heroworship in his eyes and she began to see what percy had been hinting at it looked as if brian still had a crush on her she moved away from him sat at the other side of the table and said well wed better begin you know youre going to make contact with a resistance circuit that has been largely wiped out yes im to find out how much of it is left and what it is still capable of doing if anything its likely that some members were captured during the skirmish yesterday and are under gestapo interrogation as we speak so youll have to be especially careful your contact in reims is a woman codenamed bourgeoise every day at three in the afternoon she goes to the crypt of the cathedral to pray shes generally the only person there but in case there are others shell be wearing odd shoes one black and one brown easy enough to remember you say to her pray for me she replies i pray for peace thats the code he repeated the words shell take you to her house then put you in touch with the head of the bollinger circuit whose code name is monet she was talking about her husband but brian did not need to know that dont mention the address or real name of bourgeoise to other members of the circuit when you meet them please for security reasons its better they dont know flick herself had recruited bourgeoise and set up the cutout even michel had not met the woman i understand is there anything you want to ask me im sure there are a hundred things but i cant think of any she stood up and came around the table to shake his hand well good luck he kept hold of her hand i never forgot that weekend you came to our house he said i expect i was a frightful bore but you were very kind to me she smiled and said lightly you were a nice kid i fell in love with you actually she wanted to jerk her hand out of his and walk away but he might die tomorrow and she could not bring herself to be so cruel im flattered she said trying to maintain an amiably bantering tone it was no good he was in earnest i was wondering would you just for luck give me a kiss she hesitated oh hell she thought she stood on tiptoe and kissed him lightly on the lips she let the kiss linger for a second then broke away he looked transfixed by joy she patted his cheek softly with her hand stay alive brian she said then she went out she returned to percys room he had a pile of books and a scatter of photographs on his desk all done he said she nodded but hes not perfect secret agent material percy percy shrugged hes brave he speaks french like a parisian and he can shoot straight two years ago you would have sent him back to the army true now im going to send him off to sandy at a large country house in the village of sandy near the tempsford airstrip brian would be dressed in frenchstyle clothes and given the forged papers he needed to pass through gestapo checkpoints and buy food percy got up and went to the door while im seeing him off have a look at that rogues gallery will you he pointed to the photos on the desk those are all the pictures mi has of german officers if the man you saw in the square at saintecdcile should happen to be among them id be interested to know his name he went out flick picked up one of the books it was a graduation yearbook from a military academy showing postage stampsized photos of a couple of hundred freshfaced young men there were a dozen or more similar books and several hundred loose photos she did not want to spend all night looking at mug shots but perhaps she could narrow it down the man in the square had seemed about forty he would have graduated at the age of twentytwo roughly so the year must have been about none of the books was that old she turned her attention to the loose photographs as she flicked through she recalled all she could of the man he was quite tall and well dressed but that would not show in a photo he had thick dark hair she thought and although he was cleanshaven he looked as if he could grow a heavy beard she remembered dark eyes clearly marked eyebrows a straight nose a square chin quite the matinee idol in fact the loose photos had been taken in all sorts of different situations some were news pictures showing officers shaking hands with hitler inspecting troops or looking at tanks and airplanes a few seemed to have been snapped by spies these were the most candid shots taken in crowds from cars or through windows showing the officers shopping talking to children hailing a taxi lighting a pipe she scanned the photos as fast as she could tossing them to one side she hesitated over each darkhaired man none was as handsome as the one she recalled from the square she passed over a photo of a man in police uniform then went back to it the uniform had at first put her off but on careful study she thought this was him she turned the photograph over pasted to the back was a typewritten sheet she read franck dieter wolfgang sometimes frankie born cologne june educ humboldt university of berlin koin police academy mar waltraud loewe son dtr superintendent criminal investigation department cologne police to major intelligence section afrika korps to a star of rommels intelligence staff this officer is said to be a skilled interrogator and a ruthless torturer flick shuddered to think she had been so near to such a dangerous man an experienced police detective who had turned his skills to military intelligence was a frightening enemy the fact that he had a family in cologne did not prevent his having a mistress in france it seemed percy returned and she handed him the picture this is the man dieter franck said percy we know of him how interesting from what you overheard of his conversation in the square rommel seems to have given him some kind of counterresistance job he made a note on his pad id better let mi know as they loaned us their photos there was a tap at the door and percys secretary looked in theres someone to see you colonel thwaite the girl looked coquettish the fatherly percy never inspired that sort of behavior in secretaries so flick guessed the visitor must be an attractive man an american the girl added that might explain it flick thought americans were the height of glamour to secretaries at least how did he find this place percy said orchard court was supposed to be a secret address he went to number sixtyfour baker street and they sent him here they shouldnt do that he must be very persuasive who is he major chancellor percy looked at flick she did not know anyone called chancellor then she remembered the arrogant major who had been so rude to her this morning at montys headquarters oh god him she said in disgust what does he want send him in said percy paul chancellor came in he walked with a limp that flick had not noticed this morning it probably got worse as the day wore on he had a pleasant american face with a big nose and a jutting chin any chance he might have had of being handsome was spoiled by his left ear or what remained of it which was the lower onethird mostly lobe flick assumed he had been wounded in action chancellor saluted and said good evening colonel good evening major percy said we dont do a lot of saluting at soe chancellor please sit down what brings you here chancellor took a chair and removed his uniform cap im glad i caught you both he said ive spent most of the day thinking about this mornings conversation he gave a selfeffacing grin part of the time i have to confess i was composing wittily crushing remarks i could have made if only i had thought of them in time flick could not help smiling she had done the same chancellor went on you hinted colonel thwaite that mi might not have told the whole truth about the attack on the telephone exchange and that played on my mind the fact that major clairet here was so rude to me did not necessarily mean she was lying about the facts flick had been halfway to forgiving him but now she bridled rude me percy said shut up flick she closed her mouth so i sent for your report colonel of course the request came from montys office not me personally so it was brought to our headquarters by a fany motorcyclist in doublequick time he was a nononsense type who knew how to pull the levers of the military machine flick thought he might be an arrogant pig but he would make a useful ally when i read it i realized the main reason for defeat was wrong intelligence supplied by mi flick said indignantly yes i noticed that chancellor said with mild sarcasm obviously mi was covering up its own incompetence im not a career soldier myself but my father is so im familiar with the tricks of military bureaucrats oh said percy thoughtfully are you the son of general chancellor yes go on mi would never have gotten away with it if your boss had been at the meeting this morning to tell soes side of the story it seemed too much of a coincidence that he had been called away at the last minute percy looked dubious he was summoned by the prime minister i dont see how mi could have arranged that the meeting was not attended by churchill a downing street aide took the chair and it had been arranged at the instigation of mi well im damned flick said angrily theyre such snakes percy said i wish they were as clever about gathering intelligence as they are about deceiving their colleagues chancellor said i also looked in detail at your plan major clairet for taking the chfteau by stealth with a team disguised as cleaners its risky of course but it could work did that mean it would be reconsidered flick hardly dared to ask percy gave chancellor a level look so what are you going to do about all this by chance i had dinner with my father tonight i told him the whole story and asked him what a generals aide should do in these circumstances we were at the savoy what did he say flick asked impatiently she did not care which restaurant they had gone to that i should go to monty and tell him we had made a mistake he grimaced not easy with any general they never like to revisit decisions but sometimes it has to be done and will you flick said hopefully i already have the third day tuesday may chapter flick left london at dawn driving a vincent comet motorcycle with a powerful cc engine the roads were deserted gas was severely rationed and drivers could be jailed for making unnecessary journeys she drove very fast it was dangerous but exciting the thrill was worth the risk she felt the same about the mission scared but eager she had stayed up late last night with percy and paul drinking tea and planning there must be six women in the team they had decided as it was the unvarying number of cleaners on a shift one had to be an explosives expert another a telephone engineer to decide exactly where the charges should be placed to ensure the exchange was crippled she wanted one good marksman and two tough soldiers with herself that would make six she had one day to find them the team would need a minimum of two days trainingthey had to learn to parachute if nothing else that would take up wednesday and thursday they would be dropped near reims on friday night and enter the chfteau on saturday evening or sunday that left one spare day as a margin for error she crossed the river at london bridge her motorbike roared through the bombravaged wharves and tenements of bermondsey and rotherhithe then she took the old kent road traditional route of pilgrims toward canterbury as she left the suburbs behind she opened the throttle and gave the bike its head for a while she let the wind blow the worries out of her hair it was not yet six oclock when she reached somersholme the country house of the barons of colefield the baron himself william was in italy fighting his way toward rome with the eighth army flick knew his sister the honorable diana colefield was the only member of the family living here now the vast house with its dozens of bedrooms for houseguests and their servants was being used as a convalescent home for wounded soldiers flick slowed the bike to walking speed and drove up the avenue of hundredyearold lime trees gazing at the great pile of pink granite ahead with its bays balconies gables and roofs acres of windows and scores of chimneys she parked on the gravel forecourt next to an ambulance and a scatter of jeeps in the hall nurses bustled about with cups of tea the soldiers might be here to convalesce but they still had to be wakened at daybreak flick asked for mrs riley the housekeeper and was directed to the basement she found her staring worriedly at the furnace in the company of two men in overalls hello ma said flick her mother hugged her hard she was even shorter than her daughter and just as thin but like flick she was stronger than she looked the hug squeezed the breath out of flick gasping and laughing she extricated herself ma youll crush me i never know if youre alive until i see you her mother said in her voice there was still a trace of the irish accent she had left cork with her parents fortyfive years ago whats the matter with the furnace it was never designed to produce so much hot water these nurses are mad for cleanliness they force the poor soldiers to bathe every day come to my kitchen and ill make you some breakfast flick was in a hurry but she told herself she had time for her mother anyway she had to eat she followed ma up the stairs and into the servants quarters flick had grown up in this house she had played in the servants hail run wild in the woods attended the village school a mile away and returned here from boarding school and university for the vacations she had been extraordinarily privileged most women in her mothers position were forced to give up their jobs when they had a child ma had been allowed to stay partly because the old baron had been somewhat unconventional but mainly because she was such a good housekeeper that he had dreaded losing her flicks father had been butler but he had died when she was six years old every february flick and her ma had accompanied the family to their villa in nice which was where flick had learned french the old baron father of william and diana had been fond of flick and had encouraged her to study even paying her school fees he had been very proud when she had won a scholarship to oxford university when he died soon after the start of the war flick had been as heartbroken as if he had been her real father the family now occupied only a small corner of the house the old butlers pantry had become the kitchen flicks mother put the kettle on just a piece of toast will be fine ma said flick her mother ignored her and started frying bacon well i can see youre all right she said how is that handsome husband michels alive flick said she sat at the kitchen table the smell of bacon made her mouth water alive is he but not well evidently wounded he got a bullet in his bum it wont kill him youve seen him then flick laughed ma stop it im not supposed to say of course not is he keeping his hands off other women if thats not a military secret flick never ceased to be startled by the accuracy of her mothers intuition it was quite eerie i hope he is hmm anyone in particular that you hope hes keeping his hands off flick did not answer the question directly have you noticed ma that men sometimes dont seem to realize when a girl is really stupid ma made a disgusted noise so thats the way of it shes pretty i suppose young nineteen have you had it out with him yes he promised to stop he might keep his promiseif youre not away too long im hopeful ma looked crestfallen so youre going back i cant say have you not done enough we havent won the war yet so no i suppose i havent ma put a plate of bacon and eggs in front of flick it probably represented a weeks rations but flick suppressed the protest that came to her lips better to accept the gift gracefully besides she was suddenly ravenous thanks ma she said you spoil me her mother smiled satisfied and flick tucked in hungrily as she ate she reflected wryly that ma had effortlessly got out of her everything she wanted to know despite flicks attempts to avoid answering questions you should work for military intelligence she said through a mouthful of fried egg they could use you as an interrogator youve made me tell you everything im your mother ive a right to know it didnt much matter ma would not repeat any of it she sipped a cup of tea as she watched flick eat youve got to win the war all on your own of course she said with fond sarcasm you were that way from a childindependent to a fault i dont know why i was always looked after when you were busy there were half a dozen housemaids doting on me i think i encouraged you to be selfsufficient because you didnt have a father whenever you wanted me to do something for you like fix a bicycle chain or sew on a button i used to say try it yourself and if you cant manage ill help you nine times out of ten i heard no more about it flick finished the bacon and wiped her plate with a slice of bread a lot of the time mark used to help me mark was flicks brother a year older her mothers face froze is that right she said flick suppressed a sigh ma had quarreled with mark two years ago he worked in the theater as a stage manager and lived with an actor called steve ma had long known that mark was not the marrying kind as she put it but in a burst of excessive honesty mark had been foolish enough to tell ma that he loved steve and they were like husband and wife she had been mortally offended and had not spoken to her son since flick said mark loves you ma does he now i wish youd see him no doubt ma picked up flicks empty plate and washed it in the sink flick shook her head in exasperation youre a bit stubborn ma i daresay thats where you get it from then flick had to smile she had often been accused of stubbornness mulish was percys word she made an effort to be conciliatory well i suppose you cant help the way you feel anyway im not going to argue with you especially after such a wonderful breakfast all the same it was her ambition to get the two of them to make up but not today she stood up ma smiled its lovely to see you i worry about you ive got another reason for coming i need to talk to diana whatever for cant say i hope youre not thinking of taking her to france with you ma hush who said anything about going to france i suppose its because shes so handy with a gun i cant say shell get you killed she doesnt know what discipline is why should she she wasnt brought up that way not her fault of course but youd be a fool to rely on her yes i know flick said impatiently she had made a decision and she was not going to review it with ma shes had several war jobs and been sacked from every one i know but diana was a crack shot and flick did not have time to be fussy she had to take what she could get her main worry was that diana might refuse no one could be forced to do undercover work it was strictly for volunteers where is diana now do you know i believe shes in the woods ma said she went out early after rabbits of course diana loved all the blood sports foxhunting deerstalking hare coursing grouse shooting even fishing if there was nothing else to do she would shoot rabbits just follow the sound of gunfire flick kissed her mothers cheek thanks for breakfast she went to the door and dont get on the wrong side of her gun ma called after her flick left by the staff door crossed the kitchen garden and entered the woods at the rear of the house the trees were bright with new leaves and the nettles grew waisthigh flick tramped through the undergrowth in her heavy motorcycle boots and leather trousers the best way to attract diana she thought would be by issuing a challenge when she had gone a quarter of a mile into the woods she heard the report of a shotgun she stopped listened and shouted diana there was no reply she walked toward the sound calling out every minute or so eventually she heard over here you noisy idiot whoever you are coming just put down the gun she came upon diana in a clearing sitting on the ground with her back against an oak tree smoking a cigarette a shotgun lay across her knees broken open for reloading and there were half a dozen dead rabbits beside her oh its you she said you scared all the game away theyll come back tomorrow flick studied her childhood companion diana was pretty in a boyish way with dark hair cut short and freckles across her nose she wore a shooting jacket and corduroy trousers how are you diana bored frustrated depressed otherwise fine flick sat on the grass beside her this might be easier than she had thought whats the matter im rotting away in the english countryside while my brothers conquering italy how is william hes all right hes part of the war effort but no one will give me a proper job i might be able to help you there youre in the fanys diana drew on her cigarette and blew out smoke darling i cant be a chauffeuse flick nodded diana was too grand to do the menial war work that most women were offered well im here to propose something more interesting what you might not like it its very difficult and dangerous diana looked skeptical what does it involve driving in the blackout i cant tell you much about it because its secret flick darling dont tell me youre involved in cloak anddagger stuff i didnt get promoted to major by driving generals to meetings diana looked hard at her do you mean this absolutely good lord against her will diana was impressed flick had to get her positive agreement to volunteer soare you willing to do something very dangerous i mean it you really are quite likely to get killed diana looked excited rather than discouraged of course im willing williams risking his life why shouldnt i you mean it im very serious flick concealed her relief she had recruited her first team member diana was so keen that flick decided to press her advantage theres a condition and you may find it worse than the danger what youre two years older than i and all our lives youve been my social superior youre the barons daughter and im the housekeepers brat nothing wrong with that and im not complaining ma would say thats how it should be yes dear so whats your point im in charge of the operation youll have to defer to me diana shrugged thats fine it will be a problem flick insisted youll find it strange but ill be hard on you until you get used to it this is a warning yes sir we dont bother too much about the formalities in my department so you wont need to call me sir or maam but we do enforce military discipline especially once an operation has begun if you forget that my anger will be the least of your worries disobeying orders can get you killed in my line of work darling how dramatic but of course i understand flick was not at all sure diana did understand but she had done her best she took a scratch pad from her blouse and wrote down an address in hampshire pack a case for three days this is where you need to go you get the train from waterloo to brockenhurst diana looked at the address why this is lord montagues estate most of it is occupied by my department now what is your department the inter services research bureau flick said using the usual cover name i trust its more exciting than it sounds you can bet on that when do i start you need to get there today flick got to her feet your training starts at dawn tomorrow ill come back to the house with you and start packing diana stood up tell me something if i can diana fiddled with her shotgun seeming embarrassed when she looked at flick her face showed an expression of frankness for the first time why me she said you must know ive been turned down by everyone flick nodded ill be blunt she looked at the bloodstained rabbit corpses on the ground then lifted her gaze to dianas pretty face youre a killer she said and thats what i need chapter dieter slept until ten he woke with a headache from the morphine but otherwise he felt good excited optimistic confident yesterdays bloody interrogation had given him a hot lead the woman codenamed bourgeolse with her house in the rue du bois could be his way into the heart of the french resistance or it might go nowhere he drank a liter of water and took three aspirins to get rid of the morphine hangover then he picked up the phone first he called lieutenant hesse who was staying in a less grand room at the same hotel good morning hans did you sleep well yes thank you major sir i went to the town hall to check out the address in the rue du bois good lad dieter said what did you find out the house is owned and occupied by one person a mademoiselle jeanne lemas but there may be other people staying there i also drove past just to have a look and the place seemed quiet be ready to leave with my car in an hour very good and hanswell done for using your initiative thank you sir dieter hung up he wondered what mademoiselle lemas was like gaston said no one in the bollinger circuit had ever met her and dieter believed him the house was a security cutout incoming agents knew nothing more than where to contact the woman if caught they could not reveal any information about the resistance at least that was the theory there was no such thing as perfect security presumably mademoiselle lemas was unmarried she could be a young woman who had inherited the house from her parents a middleaged spinster looking for a husband or an old maid it might help to take a woman with him he decided he returned to the bedroom stephanie had brushed her abundant red hair and was sitting up in bed with her breasts showing over the top of the sheet she really knew how to look tempting but he resisted the impulse to get back into bed would you do something for me he said i would do anything for you anything he sat on the bed and touched her bare shoulder would you watch me with another woman of course she said i would lick her nipples while you made love to her you would i know he laughed with pleasure he had had mistresses before but none like her its not that though i want you to come with me while i arrest a woman in the resistance her face showed no emotion very well she said calmly he was tempted to press her for a reaction to ask her how she felt about this and was she sure she was happy about it but he decided to take her consent at face value thank you he said and he returned to the living room mademoiselle lemas might be alone but on the other hand the house could be crawling with allied agents all armed to the teeth he needed some backup he consulted his notebook and gave the hotel operator rommels number in la rocheguyon when the germans had first occupied the country the french telephone system had been swamped since then the germans had improved the equipment adding thousands of kilometers of cable and installing automatic exchanges the system was still overloaded but it was better than it had been he asked for rommels aide major goedel a moment later he heard the familiar cold precise voice goedel this is dieter franck he said how are you walter busy goedel said crisply what is it im making rapid progress here i dont want to give details because im speaking on a hotel phone but im about to arrest at least one spy perhaps several i thought the field marshal might like to know that i shall tell him but i could use some assistance im doing all this with one lieutenant im so desperate im using my french girlfriend to help me that seems unwise oh shes trustworthy but she wont be much use against trained terrorists can you get me half a dozen good men use the gestapothats what theyre for theyre unreliable you know theyre cooperating with us only reluctantly i need people i can rely on its out of the question goedel said look walter you know how important rommel feels this ishes given me the job of making sure the resistance cant hamper our mobility yes but the field marshal expects you to do it without depriving him of combat troops im not sure i can for gods sake man goedel raised his voice were trying to defend the entire atlantic coastline with a handful of soldiers and youre surrounded by ablebodied men who have nothing better to do than track down scared old jews hiding in barns get on with the job and dont pester me there was a click as the phone was hung up dieter was startled it was uncharacteristic for goedel to blow his top no doubt they were all tense about the threat of invasion but the upshot was clear dieter had to do this on his own with a sigh he jiggled the rest and placed a call to the chfteau at sainteccile he reached willi weber im going to raid a resistance house he said i may need some of your heavyweights will you send four men and a car to the hotel frankfort or do i need to speak to rommel again the threat was unnecessary weber was keen to have his men along on the operation that way the gestapo could claim the credit for any success he promised a car in half an hour dieter was worried about working with the gestapo he could not control them but he had no choice while shaving he turned on the radio which was tuned to a german station he learned that the firstever tank battle in the pacific theater had developed yesterday on the island of biak the occupying japanese had driven the invading american d infantry back to their beachhead push them into the sea dieter thought he dressed in a dark gray worsted suit a fine cotton shirt with pale gray stripes and a black tie with small white dots the dots were woven into the fabric rather than printed on it a detail that gave him pleasure he thought for a moment then removed the jacket and strapped on a shoulder holster he took his walther p automatic pistol from the bureau and slid it into the holster then put his jacket back on he sat down with a cup of coffee and watched stephanie dressing the french made the most beautiful underwear in the world he thought as she stepped into silk camiknickers the color of clotted cream he loved to see her pull on her stockings smoothing the silk over her thighs why did the old masters not paint this moment he said because renaissance women didnt have sheer silk stockings said stephanie when she was ready they left hans hesse was waiting outside with dieters hispanosuiza the young man gazed at stephanie with awestruck admiration to him she was infinitely desirable and at the same time untouchable he made dieter think of a poor woman staring into cartiers shop window behind dieters car was a black citron traction avant containing four gestapo men in plain clothes major weber had decided to come himself dieter saw he sat in the front passenger seat of the citron wearing a green tweed suit that made him look like a farmer on his way to church follow me dieter told him when we get there please stay in your car until i call you weber said where the hell did you get a car like that it was a bribe from a jew dieter said i helped him escape to america weber grunted in disbelief but in fact the story was true bravado was the best attitude to take with men such as weber if dieter had tried to keep stephanie hidden away weber would immediately have suspected that she was jewish and might have started an investigation but because dieter flaunted her the thought never crossed webers mind hans took the wheel and they headed for the rue du bois reims was a substantial country town with a population of more than but there were few motor vehicles on the streets cars were used only by those on official business the police doctors firemen and of course the germans the citizens went about by bicycle or on foot petrol was available for deliveries of food and other essential supplies but many goods were transported by horsedrawn cart champagne was the main industry here dieter loved champagne in all its forms the nutty older vintages the fresh light nonvintage cuves the refined blanc de blancs the demisec dessert varieties even the playful pink beloved of paris courtesans the rue du bois was a pleasant treelined street on the outskirts of town hans pulled up outside a tall house at the end of a row with a little courtyard to one side this was the home of mademoiselle lemas would dieter be able to break her spirit women were more difficult than men they cried and screamed but held out longer he had sometimes failed with a woman though never with a man if this one defeated him his investigation was dead come if i wave to you he said to stephanie as he got out of the car webers citron drew up behind but the gestapo men stayed in the car as instructed dieter glanced into the courtyard beside the house there was a garage beyond that he saw a small garden with clipped hedges rectangular flower beds and a raked gravel path the owner had a tidy mind beside the front door was an oldfashioned redandyellow rope he pulled it and heard from inside the metallic ring of a mechanical bell the woman who opened the door was about sixty she had white hair tied up at the back with a tortoiseshell clasp she wore a blue dress with a pattern of small white flowers over it she had a crisp white apron good morning monsieur she said politely dieter smiled she was an irreproachably genteel provincial lady already he had thought of a way to torture her his spirits lifted with hope he said good morning mademoiselle lemas she took in his suit noticed the car at the curb and perhaps heard the trace of a german accent and fear came into her eyes there was a tremor in her voice as she said how may i help you are you alone mademoiselle he watched her face carefully yes she said quite alone she was telling the truth he was sure a woman such as this could not lie without betraying herself with her eyes he turned and beckoned stephanie my colleague will join us he was not going to need webers men i have some questions to ask you questions about what may i come in very well the front parlor was furnished with dark wood highly polished there was a piano under a dust cover and an engraving of reims cathedral on the wall the mantelpiece bore a selection of ornaments a spunglass swan a china flower girl a transparent globe containing a model of the palace at versailles and three wooden camels dieter sat on a plush upholstered couch stephanie sat beside him and mademoiselle lemas took an upright chair opposite she was plump dieter observed not many french people were plump after four years of occupation food was her vice on a low table was a cigarette box and a heavy lighter dieter flipped the lid and saw that the box was full please feel free to smoke he said she looked mildly offended women of her generation did not use tobacco i dont smoke then who are these for she touched her chin a sign of dishonesty visitors and what kind of visitors do you get friends neighbors she looked uncomfortable and british spies that is absurd dieter gave her his most charming smile you are obviously a respectable lady who has become mixed up in criminal activities from misguided motives he said in a tone of friendly candor im not going to toy with you and i hope you will not be so foolish as to lie to me i shall tell you nothing she said dieter feigned disappointment but he was pleased to be making such rapid progress she had already abandoned the pretense that she did not know what he was talking about that was as good as a confession im going to ask you some questions he said if you dont answer them i shall ask you again at gestapo headquarters she gave him a defiant look he said where do you meet the british agents she said nothing how do they recognize you her eyes met his in a steady gaze she was no longer flustered but resigned a brave woman he thought she would be a challenge what is the password she did not answer who do you pass the agents on to how do you contact the resistance who is in charge of it silence dieter stood up come with me please very well she said staunchly perhaps you will permit me to put on my hat of course he nodded to stephanie go with mademoiselle please make sure she does not use the telephone or write anything down he did not want her to leave any kind of message he waited in the hail when they returned mademoiselle lemas had taken off her apron and wore a light coat and a cloche hat that had gone out of fashion long before the outbreak of war she carried a sturdy tan leather handbag as the three of them were heading for the front door mademoiselle lemas said oh i forgot my key you dont need it dieter said the door locks itself she said i need a key to get back in dieter looked her in the eye dont you understand he said youve been sheltering british terrorists in your house you have been caught and you are in the hands of the gestapo he shook his head in an expression of sorrow that was not entirely fake whatever happens mademoiselle youre never coming home again she realized the full horror of what was happening to her her face turned white and she staggered she steadied herself by grabbing the edge of a kidneyshaped table a chinese vase containing a spray of dried grasses wobbled dangerously but did not fall then mademoiselle lemas recovered her poise she straightened up and let go of the table she gave him that defiant look again then walked out of her house with her head held high dieter asked stephanie to take the front passenger seat while he sat in the back of the car with the prisoner as hans drove them to sainteccile dieter made polite conversation were you born in reims mademoiselle yes my father was choirmaster at the cathedral a religious background this was good news for the plan that was forming in dieters mind is he retired he died five years ago after a long illness and your mother died when i was quite young so i imagine you nursed your father through his illness for twenty years au that explained why she was single she had spent her life caring for an invalid father and he left you the house she nodded small reward some might think for a life of dedicated service dieter said sympathetically she gave him a haughty look one does not do such things for reward indeed not he did not mind the implied rebuke it would help his plan if she could convince herself that she was somehow dieters superior morally and socially do you have brothers and sisters none dieter saw the picture vividly the agents she sheltered all young men and women must have been like her children she had fed them done their laundry talked to them and probably kept an eye on the relationships between the sexes making sure there was no immorality at least not under her root and now she would die for it but first he hoped she would tell him everything the gestapo citron followed dieters car to sainteccile when they had parked in the grounds of the chfteau dieter spoke to weber im going to take her upstairs and put her in an office he said why there are cells in the basement youll see dieter led the prisoner up the stairs to the gestapo offices dieter looked into all the rooms and picked the busiest a combination typing pool and post room it was occupied by young men and women in smart shirts and ties leaving mademoiselle lemas in the corridor he closed the door and clapped his hands for attention in a quiet voice he said im going to bring a french woman in here she is a prisoner but i want you all to be friendly and polite to her is that understood treat her as a guest its important that she feels respected he brought her in sat her at a table and with a murmured apology handcuffed her ankle to the table leg he left stephanie with her and took hesse outside go to the canteen and ask them to prepare lunch on a tray soup a main course a little wine a bottle of mineral water and plenty of coffee bring cutlery glasses a napkin make it look nice the lieutenant grinned admiringly he had no idea what his boss was up to but he felt sure it would be something clever a few minutes later he returned with a tray dieter took it from him and carried it into the office he set it in front of mademoiselle lemas please he said its lunchtime i couldnt eat anything thank you perhaps just a little soup he poured wine into her glass she added water to the wine and sipped it then tried a mouthful of soup how is it very good she admitted french food is so refined we germans cannot imitate it dieter talked nonsense to her trying to relax her and she drank most of the soup he poured her a glass of water major weber came in and stared incredulously at the tray in front of the prisoner speaking german he said are we now rewarding people for harboring terrorists dieter said mademoiselle is a lady we must treat her correctly god in heaven weber said and he turned on his heel she refused the main course but drank all the coffee dieter was pleased everything was going according to plan when she had finished he asked her all the questions again where do you meet the allied agents how do they recognize you what is the password she looked worried but she still refused to answer he looked sadly at her i am very sorry that you refuse to cooperate with me after i have treated you kindly she looked somewhat bewildered i appreciate your kindness but i cannot tell you anything stephanie sitting beside dieter also looked puzzled he guessed that she was thinking did you really imagine that a nice meal would be sufficient to make this woman talk very well he said he stood up as if to go and now monsieur said mademoiselle lemas she looked embarrassed i must ask to ah visit the ladies powder room in a harsh voice dieter said you want to go to the toilet she reddened in a word yes im sorry mademoiselle dieter said that will not be possible chapter the last thing monty had said to paul chancellor late on monday night had been if you only do one thing in this war make sure that telephone exchange is destroyed paul had woken this morning with those words echoing in his mind it was a simple instruction if he could fulfill it he would have helped win the war if he failed men would dieand he might spend the rest of his life reflecting that he had helped lose the war he went to baker street early but percy thwaite was already there sitting in his office puffing his pipe and staring at six boxes of files he seemed a typical military duffer with his check jacket and toothbrush mustache he looked at paul with mild hostility i dont know why montys put you in charge of this operation he said i dont mind that youre only a major and im a colonelthats all stuff and nonsense but youve never run a clandestine operation whereas ive been doing it for three years does it make sense to you yes paul said briskly when you want to make absolutely sure that a job gets done you give it to someone you trust monty trusts me but not me he doesnt know you i see percy said grumpily paul needed percys cooperation so he decided to mollify him looking around the office he saw a framed photograph of a young man in lieutenants uniform and an older woman in a big hat the boy could have been percy thirty years ago your son paul guessed percy softened immediately davids out in cairo he said we had some bad moments during the desert war especially after rommel reached tobruk but now of course hes well out of the line of fire and i must say im glad the woman was darkhaired and darkeyed with a strong face handsome rather than pretty and mrs thwaite rosa mann she became famous as a suffragette in the twenties and shes always used her maiden name suffragette campaigner for votes for women percy liked formidable women paul concluded that was why he was fond of flick you know youre right about my shortcomings he said candidly i have been at the sharp end of clandestine operations but this will be my first time as an organizer so ill be very grateful for your help percy nodded i begin to see why you have a reputation for getting things done he said with a hint of a smile but if youll hear a word of advice please be guided by flick no one else has spent as much time under cover and survived her knowledge and experience are matchless i may be in charge of her in theory but what i do is give her the support she needs i would never try to tell her what to do paul hesitated he had been given command by monty and he was not about to hand it over on anyones advice ill bear that in mind he said percy seemed satisfied he gestured to the files shall we get started what are these records of people who were considered by us as possible agents then rejected for some reason paul took off his jacket and rolled back his cuffs they spent the morning going through the files together some of the candidates had not even been interviewed others had been rejected after they had been seen and many had failed some part of the soe training coursebaffled by codes hopeless with guns or frightened to the point of hysteria when asked to jump out of a plane with a parachute they were mostly in their early twenties and they had only one other thing in common they all spoke a foreign language with native fluency there were a lot of files but few suitable candidates by the time percy and paul had eliminated all the men and the women whose language was something other than french they were left with only three names paul was disheartened they had run into a major obstacle when they had hardly begun four is the minimum number we need even assuming that flick recruits the woman she has gone to see this morning diana colefield and none of these is either an explosives expert or a telephone engineer percy was more optimistic they werent when soe interviewed them but they might be now women have learned to do all sorts of things well lets find out it took a while to track the three down a further disappointment was that one was dead the other two were in london ruby romain unfortunately was in his majestys prison for women at holloway three miles north of baker street awaiting trial for murder and maude valentine whose file said simply psychologically unsuitable was a driver with the fanys down to two paul said despondently its not the numbers but the quality that bothers me percy said we knew from the start wed be looking at rejects percys tone became angry but we cant risk flicks life with people like these percy was desperate to protect flick paul realized the older man had been willing to hand over control of the operation but was not able to give up his role as flicks guardian angel their argument was interrupted by a phone call it was simon fortescue the pinstriped spook from mi who had blamed soe for the failure at sainteccile what can i do for you paul said guardedly fortescue was not a man to trust i think i may be able to do something for you fortescue said i know youre going ahead with major clairets plan who told you paul asked suspiciously it was supposed to be a secret lets not go into that i naturally wish you success with your mission even though i was against it and id like to help paul was angry that the mission was being talked about but there was no point in pursuing that do you know a female telephone engineer who speaks perfect french he asked not quite but theres someone you should see her name is lady denise bowyer terribly nice girl her father was the marquess of inverlocky paul was not interested in her pedigree how did she learn french brought up by her french stepmother lord inverlockys second wife shes ever so keen to do her bit paul was suspicious of fortescue but he was desperate for suitable recruits where do i find her shes with the raf at hendon the word hendon meant nothing to paul but fortescue explained its an airfield in the north london suburbs thank you let me know how she gets on fortescue hung up paul explained the call to percy who said fortescue wants a spy in our camp we cant afford to turn her down for that reason quite they saw maude valentine first percy arranged for them to meet her at the fenchurch hotel around the corner from soe headquarters strangers were never brought to number sixtyfour he explained if we reject her she may guess that shes been considered for secret work but she wont know the name of the organization that interviewed her nor where its office is so even if she blabs she cant do much harm very good whats your mothers maiden name paul was mildly startled and had to think for a moment thomas she was edith thomas so youll be major thomas and ill be colonel cox no point in giving our real names percy was not such a duffer paul reflected he met maude in the hotel lobby she piqued his interest right away she was a pretty girl with a flirtatious manner her uniform blouse was tight across the chest and she wore her cap at a jaunty angle paul spoke to her in french my colleague is waiting in a private room she gave him an arch look and replied in the same language i dont usually go to hotel rooms with strange men she said pertly but in your case major ill make an exception he blushed its a meeting room with a table and so on not a bedroom oh well thats all right then she said mocking him he decided to change the subject he had noticed that she spoke with a south of france accent so he said where are you from i was born in marseilles and what do you do in the fanys i drive monty do you paul was not supposed to give any information about himself but he could not help saying i worked for monty for a while but i dont recall seeing you oh its not always monty i drive all the top generals ah well come this way please he took her to the room and poured her a cup of tea maude was enjoying the attention paul realized while percy asked questions he studied the girl she was petite though not as tiny as flick and she was cute she had a rosebud mouth accentuated with red lipstick and there was a beauty spotwhich might even have been fakeon one cheek her dark hair was wavy my family came to london when i was ten years old she said my papa is a chef and where does he work hes the head pastry cook at claridges hotel very impressive maudes file was on the table and percy discreetly moved it an inch closer to paul pauls eye was caught by the slight movement and his eye fell on a note made when maude was first interviewed father armand valentin kitchen porter at claridges he read when they had finished they asked her to wait outside she lives in a fantasy world percy said as soon as she was outside the door shes promoted her father to chef and changed her name to valentine paul nodded agreement in the lobby she told me she was montys driverwhich i know shes not no doubt that was why she was rejected before paul thought percy was getting ready to reject maude but now we cant afford to be so particular he said percy looked at him in surprise shed be a menace on an undercover operation paul made a helpless gesture we dont have any choice this is mad percy was half in love with flick paul decided but being older and married he expressed his love in a paternal protective way paul liked him better for that but realized at the same time that he would have to fight percys caution if he was going to get this job done listen he said we shouldnt eliminate maude flick can make up her own mind when she meets her i suppose youre right percy said reluctantly and the ability to invent stories can be useful under interrogation all right lets get her on board paul called her back in id like you to be part of a team im setting up he told her how would you feel about taking on something dangerous would we be going to paris maude said eagerly it was an odd response paul hesitated then said why do you ask id love to go to paris ive never been they say its the most beautiful city in the world wherever you go you wont have time for sightseeing percy said letting his irritation show maude did not seem to notice shame she said id still like to go though how do you feel about the danger paul persisted thats all right maude said airily im not scared well you should be paul thought but he kept his mouth shut they drove north from baker street and passed through a workingclass neighborhood that had suffered heavily from the bombing in every street at least one house was a blackened shell or a pile of rubble paul was to meet flick outside the prison and they would interview ruby romain together percy would go on to hendon to see lady denise bowyer percy at the wheel confidently wound his way through the grimy streets paul said you know london well i was born in this neighborhood percy replied paul was intrigued he knew it was unusual for a boy from a poor family to rise as high as colonel in the british army what did your father do for a living sold coal off the back of a horsedrawn cart he had his own business no he worked for a coal merchant did you go to school around here percy smiled he knew he was being probed but he did not seem to mind the local vicar helped me get a scholarship to a good school that was where i lost my london accent intentionally not willingly ill tell you something before the war when i was involved in politics people would sometimes say to me how can you be a socialist with an accent like that i explained that i was flogged in school for dropping my aitches that silenced one or two smug bastards percy stopped the car on a treelined street paul looked out and saw a fantasy castle with battlements and turrets and a high tower this is a jail percy made a gesture of helplessness victorian architecture flick was waiting at the entrance she wore her fany uniform a fourpocket tunic a divided skirt and a little cap with a turnedup brim the leather belt that was tightly cinched around her small waist emphasized her diminutive figure and her fair curls spilled out from under the cap for a moment she took pauls breath away shes such a pretty girl he said shes married percy remarked crisply im being warned off paul thought with amusement to whom percy hesitated then said you need to know this i think michel is in the french resistance hes the leader of the bollinger circuit ah thanks paul got out of the car and percy drove on he wondered if flick would be angry that he and percy had turned up so few prospects from the files he had met her only twice and on both occasions she had yelled at him however she seemed cheerful and when he told her about maude she said so we have three team members including me that means were halfway there and its only two pip emma paul nodded that was one way of looking at it he was worried but there was nothing to be gained by saying so the entrance to holloway was a medieval lodge with arrow slit windows why didnt they go the whole way and build a portcullis and a drawbridge said paul they passed through the lodge into a courtyard where a few women in dark dresses were cultivating vegetables every patch of waste ground in london was planted with vegetables the prison loomed up in front of them the entrance was guarded by stone monsters massive winged griffins holding keys and shackles in their claws the main gatehouse was flanked by fourstory buildings each story represented by a long row of narrow pointed windows what a place said paul this is where the suffragettes went on hunger strike flick told him percys wife was forcefed in here my god they went in the air smelled of strong bleach as if the authorities hoped that disinfectant would kill the bacteria of crime paul and flick were shown to the office of miss lindleigh a barrelshaped assistant governor with a hard fat face i dont know why you wish to see romain she said with a note of resentment she added apparently im not to be told a scornful look came over flicks face and paul could see that she was about to say something derisory so he hastily intervened i apologize for the secrecy he said with his most charming smile were just following orders i suppose we all have to do that said miss lindleigh somewhat mollified anyway i must warn you that romain is a violent prisoner i understand shes a killer yes she should be hanged but the courts are too soft nowadays they sure are said paul although he did not really think so she was in here originally for drunkenness then she killed another prisoner in a fight in the exercise yard so now shes awaiting trial for murder a tough customer flick said with interest yes major she may seem reasonable at first but dont be fooled shes easily riled and loses her temper faster than you can say knife and deadly when she does paul said youve got the picture were short of time flick said impatiently id like to see her now paul added hastily if thats convenient to you miss lindleigh very well the assistant governor led them out the hard floors and bare walls made the place echo like a cathedral and there was a constant background accompaniment of distant shouts slamming doors and the clang of boots on iron catwalks they went via narrow corridors and steep stairs to an interview room ruby romain was already there she had nutbrown skin straight dark hair and fierce black eyes however she was not the traditional gypsy beauty her nose was hooked and her chin curved up giving her the look of a gnome miss lindleigh left them with a warder in the next room watching through a glazed door flick paul and the prisoner sat around a cheap table with a dirty ashtray on it paul had brought a pack of lucky strikes he put them on the table and said in french help yoursell ruby took two putting one in her mouth and the other behind her ear paul asked a few routine questions to break the ice she replied clearly and politely but with a strong accent my parents are traveling folk she said when i was a girl we went around france with a funfair my father had a rifle range and my mother sold hot pancakes with chocolate sauce how did you come to england when i was fourteen i fell in love with an english sailor i met in calais his name was freddy we got marriedi lied about my age of courseand came to london he was killed two years ago his ship was sunk by a uboat in the atlantic she shivered a cold grave poor freddy flick was not interested in the family history tell us why youre in here she said i got myself a little brazier and sold pancakes in the street but the police kept harassing me one night id had some cognaca weakness of mine i admitand anyway i got into a dispute she switched to cockneyaccented english the copper told me to fuck off out of it and i gave him a mouthful of abuse he shoved me and i knocked him down paul looked at her with a touch of amusement she was no more than average height and wiry but she had big hands and muscular legs he could imagine her flattening a london policeman flick asked what happened next his two mates came around the corner and i was a bit slow to leave on account of the brandy so they gave me a kicking and took me down the nick seeing pauls frown of incomprehension she added the police station that is anyway the first copper was ashamed to do me for assault didnt want to admit hed been floored by a girl so i got fourteen days for drunk and disorderly and then you got into another fight she gave flick an appraising look i dont know if i can explain to someone of your sort what its like in here half the girls are mad and theyve all got weapons you can file the edge of a spoon to make a blade or sharpen the end of a bit of wire for a stiletto or twist threads together for a garotte and the warders never intervene in a fight between convicts they like to watch us tear each other apart thats why so many of the inmates have scars paul was shocked he had never had contact with people in jail the picture painted by ruby was horrifying perhaps she was exaggerating but she seemed quietly sincere she did not appear to care whether she was believed or not but recited the facts in the dry unhurried manner of someone who is not greatly interested but has nothing better to do flick said what happened with the woman you killed she stole something of mine what a cake of soap my god thought paul she killed her for a piece of soap flick said what did you do i took it back and then she went for me she had a chair leg that shed made into a club with a bit of plumbers lead fixed to the business end she hit me over the head with it i thought she was going to kill me but i had a knife id found a long pointed sliver of glass like a shard from a broken window pane and i wrapped the broad end in a length of wornout bicycle tire for a handle i stuck it in her throat so she didnt get to hit me a second time flick suppressed a shudder and said it sounds like selfdefense no youve got to prove you couldnt possibly have run away and id premeditated the murder by making a knife out of a piece of glass paul stood up wait here with the guard for a moment please he said to ruby well just step outside ruby smiled at him and for the first time she looked not quite pretty but pleasant youre so polite she said appreciatively in the corridor paul said what a dreadful story remember everyone in here says theyre innocent flick said guardedly all the same i think she might be more sinned against than sinning doubt it i think shes a killer so we reject her on the contrary said flick shes exactly what i want they went back into the room flick said to ruby if you could get out of here would you be willing to do dangerous war work she responded with another question would we be going to france flick raised her eyebrows what leads you to ask that you spoke french to me at the start i assume you were checking if i speak the language well i cant tell you much about the job i bet it involves sabotage behind enemy lines paul was startled ruby was very quick on the uptake seeing his surprise ruby went on look at first i thought you might want me to do a bit of translation for you but theres nothing dangerous about that so we must be going to france and what would the british army do there except blow up bridges and railway lines paul said nothing but he was impressed by her powers of deduction ruby frowned what i cant figure out is why its an allwoman team flicks eyes widened what makes you think that if you could use men why would you be talking to me you must be desperate it cant be that easy to get a murderess out of jail even for vital war work so whats special about me im tough but there must be hundreds of tough men who speak perfect french and would be gungho for a bit of cloakanddagger stuff the only reason for picking me rather than one of them is that im female perhaps women are less likely to be questioned by the gestapo is that it i cant say flick said well if you want me ill do it can i have another one of those cigarettes sure said paul flick said you do understand that the job is dangerous yeah said ruby lighting a lucky strike but not as dangerous as being in this fucking prison t h e y r e t u r n e d to the assistant governors office after leaving ruby i need your help miss lindleigh paul said once again flattering her tell me what you would need in order to be able to release ruby romain release her but shes a murderer why would she be released im afraid i cant tell you but i can assure you that if you knew where she was going you wouldnt think shed had a lucky escapequite the contrary i see she said not entirely mollified i must have her out of here tonight paul went on but i dont want to put you in any kind of awkward position thats why i need to know exactly what authorization you require what he really wanted was to make sure she would have no excuse to be obstructive i cant release her under any circumstances said miss lindleigh she has been remanded here by a magistrates court so only the court can free her paul was patient and what do you think that would require she would have to be taken in police custody before a magistrate the public prosecutor or his representative would have to tell the magistrate that all charges against romain had been dropped then the magistrate would be obliged to say she was free to go paul frowned looking ahead for snags she would have to sign her army joiningup papers before seeing the magistrate so that she would be under military discipline as soon as the court released her otherwise she might just walk away miss lindleigh was still incredulous why would they drop the charges this prosecutor is a government official yes then it wont be a problem paul stood up i will be back here later this evening with a magistrate someone from the prosecutors department and an army driver to take ruby to her next port of call can you foresee any snags miss lindleigh shook her head i follow orders major just as you do good they took their leave when they got outside paul stopped and looked back ive never been to a prison before he said i dont know what i expected but it wasnt something out of a fairy tale he was making an inconsequential remark about the building but flick looked sour several women have been hanged here she said not much of a fairy tale he wondered why she was grumpy i guess you identify with the prisoners he said suddenly he realized why its because you might end up in a jail in france she looked taken aback i think youre right she said i didnt know why i hated that place so much but thats it she might be hanged too he realized but he kept that thought to himself they walked away heading for the nearest thbe station flick was thoughtful youre very perceptive she said you understood how to keep miss lindleigh on our side i would have made an enemy of her no point in that exactly and you turned ruby from a tigress into a pussycat i wouldnt want a woman like that to dislike me flick laughed then you told me something that i hadnt figured out about myself paul was pleased that he had impressed her but he was already looking ahead to the next problem by midnight we should have half a team at the training center in hampshire we call it the finishing school flick said yes diana colefield maude valentine and ruby romain paul nodded grimly an undisciplined aristocrat a pretty flirt who cant tell fantasy from reality and a murdering gypsy with a short temper when he thought of the possibility that flick could be hanged by the gestapo he felt as worried as percy about the caliber of the recruits beggars cant be choosers flick said cheerfully her sour mood had vanished but we still dont have an explosives expert or a telephone engineer flick glanced at her wrist its still only four pip emma and maybe the raf has taught denise bowyer how to blow up a telephone exchange paul grinned flicks optimism was irresistible they reached the station and caught a train they could not talk about the mission because there were other passengers within earshot paul said i learned a little about percy this morning we drove through the neighborhood where he was brought up hes adopted the manners and even the accent of the british upper class but dont be fooled under that old tweed jacket beats the heart of a real street brawler he told me he was flogged at school for speaking with a lowclass accent he was a scholarship boy they generally have a hard time in swanky british schools i know i was a scholarship girl did you have to change your accent no i grew up in an earls household i always spoke like this paul guessed that was why flick and percy got on so well they were both lowerclass people who had climbed the social ladder unlike americans the british thought there was nothing wrong with class prejudice yet they were shocked at southerners who told them negroes were inferior i think percys very fond of you paul said i love him like a father the sentiment seemed genuine paul thought but she was also firmly setting him straight about her relationship with percy flick had arranged to meet percy back at orchard court when they arrived there was a car outside the building paul recognized the driver one of montys entourage sir theres someone in the car waiting for you the man said the back door opened and out stepped pauls younger sister caroline he grinned with delight well ill be damned he said she stepped into his arms and he hugged her what are you doing in london i cant say but i have a couple of hours off and i persuaded montys office to lend me a car to come and see you want to buy me a drink i dont have a minute to spare he said not even for you but you can drive me to whitehall i have to find a man called a public prosecutor then ill take you there and well catch up in the car of course he said lets go chapter flick turned at the building door and saw a pretty girl wearing the uniform of an american lieutenant step out of the car and throw her arms around paul she noted the delighted smile on his face and the force of his hug this was obviously his wife girlfriend or fiance probably making an unexpected visit to london she must be with the us forces in britain preparing for the invasion paul jumped into her car flick went into orchard court feeling a little sad paul had a girl they were nuts about one another and they had been granted a surprise meeting flick wished michel could show up just like that out of the blue but he was lying wounded on a couch in reims with a shameless nineteenyearold beauty nursing him percy was already back from hendon she found him making tea how was your raf girl she asked lady denise bowyershes on her way to the finishing school he said wonderful now we have four but im worried shes a braggart she boasted about the work shes doing in the air force told me all sorts of details she should have kept quiet about youll have to see what you think of her in training i dont suppose she knows anything about telephone exchanges not a thing nor explosives tea please he handed her a cup and sat behind the cheap old desk wheres paul gone to find the public prosecutor hes hoping to get ruby romain out of jail this evening percy gave her a quizzical glance do you like him more than i did initially me too flick smiled he charmed the socks off the old battleaxe running the prison how was ruby romain terrifying she slit the throat of another inmate in a quarrel over a bar of soap jesus percy shook his head in incredulity what the hell kind of a team are we putting together flick dangerous which is what its supposed to be thats not the problem besides the way things are going we may have the luxury of eliminating the least satisfactory one or two during training my worry is that we dont have the experts we need theres no point taking a team of tough girls into france then destroying the wrong cables percy drained his teacup and began to fill his pipe i know a woman explosives expert who speaks french flick was surprised but this is great why didnt you say so before when i first thought of her i dismissed her out of hand shes not at all suitable but i hadnt realized how desperate wed be how is she unsuitable shes about forty soe rarely uses anyone so old especially on a parachute mission he struck a match age was not going to be an obstacle at this stage flick thought excited she said will she volunteer i should think theres a good chance especially if i ask her youre friends he nodded how did she become an explosives expert percy looked embarrassed still holding the burning match he said shes a safebreaker i met her years ago when i was doing political work in the east end the match burned down and he struck another percy i had no idea your past was so raffish where is she now percy looked at his watch its six oclock at this time of the evening shell be in the private bar of the mucky duck a pub yes then get that damn pipe alight and lets go there now in the car flick said how do you know shes a safebreaker percy shrugged everyone knows everyone even the police yes in the east end police and villains grow up together go to the same schools live in the same streets they all know one another but if they know who the criminals are why dont they put them in jail i suppose they cant prove anything this is the way it works percy said when they need a conviction they arrest someone who is in that line of business if its a burglary they arrest a burglar it doesnt matter whether he was responsible for that particular crime because they can always manufacture a case suborn witnesses counterfeit confessions manufacture forensic evidence of course they sometimes make mistakes and jail innocent people and they often use the system to pay off personal grudges and so on but nothing in life is perfect is it so youre saying the whole rigmarole of courts and juries is a farce a highly successful longrunning farce that provides lucrative employment for otherwise useless citizens who act the parts of detectives solicitors banisters and judges has your friend the safebreaker been to jail no you can escape prosecution if youre willing to pay hefty bribes and youre careful to cultivate warm friendships with detectives lets say you live in the same street as detectiveinspector callahans dear old mum you drop in once a week ask her if she needs any shopping done look at photos of her grandchildren makes it hard for di callahan to put you in jail flick thought of the story ruby had told a few hours ago for some people life in london was almost as bad as being under the gestapo could things really be so different from what she had imagined i cant tell if youre serious she said to percy i dont know what to believe oh im serious he said with a smile but i dont expect you to believe me they were in stepney not far from the docks the bomb damage here was the worst flick had seen whole streets were flattened percy turned into a narrow culdesac and parked outside a pub mucky duck was a humorous sobriquet the pub was called the white swan the private bar was not private but was so called to distinguish it from the public bar where there was sawdust on the floor and the beer was a penny a pint cheaper flick found herself thinking about explaining these idiosyncrasies to paul he would be amused geraldine knight sat on a stool at the end of the bar looking as if she might own the place she had vivid blonde hair and heavy makeup expertly applied her plump figure had the apparent firmness that could only have come from a corset the cigarette burning in the ashtray bore a ring of bright lipstick around the end it was hard to imagine anyone who looked less like a secret agent flick thought despondently percy thwaite as i live and breathe the woman said she sounded like a cockney who had been to elocution lessons what are you doing slumming around here you bloody old communist she was obviously delighted to see him hello jelly meet my friend flick percy said pleased to know you im sure she said shaking flicks hand jelly flick inquired no one knows where i got that nickname oh said flick jelly knight gelignite jelly ignored that ill have a ginandit percy while youre buying flick spoke to her in french do you live in this part of london since i was ten she replied speaking french with a north american accent i was born in quebec that was not so good flick thought germans might not notice the accent but the french certainly would jelly would have to pose as a canadianborn french citizen it was a perfectly plausible history but just unusual enough to attract curiosity damn but you consider yourself british english not british said jelly with arch indignation she switched back to the english language im church of england i vote conservative and i dislike foreigners heathens and republicans with a glance at percy she added present company excepted of course percy said you ought to live in yorkshire on a hill farm someplace where they havent seen a foreigner since the vikings came i dont know how you can bear to live in london surrounded by russian bolsheviks german jews irish catholics and nonconformist welshmen building little chapels all over the place like moles disfiguring the lawn londons not what it was perce not what it was when you were a foreigner this was obviously a familiar old argument flick interrupted it impatiently im very glad to hear that youre so patriotic jelly and why would you be interested in such a thing may i ask because theres something you could do for your country percy put in i told flick about your expertise jelly she looked at her vermilion fingernails discretion percy please discretion is the better part of valor it says in the bible flick said i expect you know that there have been some fascinating recent developments in the field plastic explosives i mean i try to keep up to date jelly said with airy modesty her expression changed and she looked shrewdly at flick this is something to do with the war isnt it yes count me in ill do anything for england youll be away for a few days no problem you might not come back what the hell does that mean it will be very dangerous flick said quietly jelly looked dismayed oh she swallowed well that makes no difference she said unconvincingly are you sure jelly looked thoughtful as if she were calculating you want me to blow something up flick nodded silently its not overseas is it could be jelly paled beneath her makeup oh my gordon you want me to go to france dont you flick said nothing behind enemy lines gods truth im too bloody old for that sort of thing im she hesitated im thirtyseven she was about five years older than that flick thought but she said well were almost the same age im nearly thirty were not too old for a bit of adventure are we speak for yourself dear flicks heart sank jelly was not going to agree the whole scheme had been misconceived she decided it was never going to be possible to find women who could do these jobs and speak perfect french the plan had been doomed from the start she turned away from jelly she felt like crying percy said jelly were asking you to do a job thats really crucial for the war effort pull the other leg perce its got bells on she said but her mockery was halfhearted and she looked solemn he shook his head no exaggeration it could make a difference to whether we win or lose she stared at him saying nothing conflict twisted her face into a grimace of indecision percy said and youre the only person in the country who can do it get off she said skeptically youre a female safebreaker who speaks frenchhow many others do you think there are ill tell you none you mean this dont you i was never more serious in my life bloody hell perce jelly fell silent she did not speak for a long moment flick held her breath at last jelly said all right you bastard ill do it flick was so pleased she kissed her percy said god bless you jelly jelly said when do we start now said percy if youll finish up that gin ill take you home to pack a case then ill drive you to the training center what tonight i told you it was important she swallowed the remains of her drink all right im ready she slid her ample bottom off the bar stool and flick thought i wonder how shell manage with a parachute they left the pub percy said to flick youll be all right going back on the thbe of course then well see you tomorrow at the finishing school ill be there said flick and they parted company she headed for the nearest station feeling jubilant it was a mild summer evening and the east end was alive a group of dirtyfaced boys played cricket with a stick and a bald tennis ball a tired man in soiled work clothes headed home for a late tea a uniformed soldier on leave with a packet of cigarettes and a few shillings in his pocket strode along the pavement with a jaunty air as if all the worlds pleasures were his for the taking three pretty girls in sleeveless dresses and straw hats giggled at the soldier the fate of all these people would be decided in the next few days flick thought somberly on the train to bayswater her spirits fell again she still did not have the most crucial member of the team without a telephone engineer jelly might place the explosives in the wrong location they would still do damage but if the damage could be repaired in a day or two the enormous effort and risk of life would have been wasted when she returned to her bedsitting room she found her brother mark waiting there she hugged and kissed him what a nice surprise she said ive got a night off so i thought id take you for a drink he said wheres steve giving his lago to the troops in lyme regis we both work for ensa most of the time now ensa was the entertainments national service association which organized shows for the armed forces where shall we go flick was tired and her first inclination was to turn him down then she remembered that she was going to france on friday and this could be the last time she ever saw her brother how about the west end she said well go to a nightclub perfect they left the house and walked arminarm along the street flick said i saw ma this morning how is she all right but she hasnt softened her attitude to you and steve im sorry to say i didnt expect it how did you happen to see her i went down to somersholme it would take too long to explain why something hushhush i suppose she smiled acknowledgment then sighed as she remembered her problem dont suppose you happen to know a female telephone engineer who speaks french do you he stopped well he said sort of chapter mademoiselle lemas was in agony she sat rigid on the hard upright chair behind the little table her face frozen into a mask of selfcontrol she did not dare to move she still wore her cloche hat and clutched her sturdy leather handbag on her lap her fat little hands squeezed the handle of the bag rhythmically her fingers bore no rings in fact she wore only one piece of jewelry a small silver cross on a chain around her lateworking clerks and secretaries in their wellpressed uniforms carried on typing and filing following dieters instructions they smiled politely when they caught her eye and every now and again one of the girls would speak a word to her offering her water or coffee dieter sat watching her with lieutenant hesse on one side of him and stephanie on the other hans hesse was the best type of sturdy unflappable workingclass german he looked on stoically he had seen many tortures stephanie was more excitable but she was exercising selfcontrol she looked unhappy but said nothing her aim in life was to please dieter mademoiselle lemass pain was not just physical dieter knew even worse than her bursting bladder was the tenor of soiling herself in a room full of polite welldressed people going about their normal business for a respectable elderly lady that was the worst of nightmares he admired her fortitude and wondered if she would break and tell him everything or hold out a young corporal clicked his heels beside dieter and said pardon me major i have been sent to ask you to step into major webers office dieter considered sending a reply saying if you want to talk to me come and see me but he decided there was nothing to be gained by being combative before it was strictly necessary weber might even become a little more cooperative if he was allowed to score a few points very well he turned to hesse hans you know what to ask her if she breaks yes major in case she doesnt stephanie would you go to the caf des sports and get me a bottle of beer and a glass please of course she seemed grateful for a reason to leave the room dieter followed the corporal to willi webers office it was a grand room at the front of the chfteau with three tall windows overlooking the square dieter gazed out at the sun setting over the town the slanting light picked out the curved arches and buttresses of the medieval church he saw stephanie crossing the square in her high heels walking like a racehorse dainty and powerful at the same time soldiers were at work in the square erecting three stout wooden pillars in a neat row dieter frowned a firing squad for the three terrorists who survived sundays skirmish weber answered i understand you have finished interrogating them dieter nodded they have told me all they know they will be shot in public as a warning to others who may think of joining the resistance good idea dieter said however though gaston is fit both bertrand and genevieve are seriously injuredill be surprised if they can walk then they will be carried to their fate but i did not summon you to discuss them my superiors in paris have been asking me what further progress has been made and what did you tell them willi that after fortyeight hours of investigation you have arrested one old woman who may or may not have sheltered allied agents in her house and who has so far told us nothing and what would you wish to tell them weber banged his desk theatrically that we have broken the back of the french resistance that may take longer than fortyeight hours why dont you torture this old cow i am torturing her by refusing to let her go to the toilet what kind of torture is that in this case the most effective one i believe you think you know best you always were arrogant but this is the new germany major you are no longer assumed to have superior judgment just because you are the son of a professor dont be ridiculous do you really think you would have become the youngestever head of the cologne criminal intelligence department if your father had not been an important man in the university i had to pass the same exams as everyone else how strange that other people just as capable as you never seemed to do quite so well was that the fantasy weber told himself for gods sake willi you cant believe the entire cologne police force conspired to give me better marks than you because my father was professor of musicits risible such things were commonplace in the old days dieter sighed weber was half right patronage and nepotism had existed in germany but that was not why willi had failed to win promotion the truth was that he was stupid he would never get on anywhere except in an organization where fanaticism was more important than ability dieter had had enough of this stupid talk dont worry about mademoiselle lemas he said shell talk soon he went to the door and we will break the back of the french resistance too just wait a little longer he returned to the main office mademoiselle lemas was now making low moaning noises weber had made dieter impatient and he decided to speed up the process when stephanie returned he put the glass on the table opened the bottle and poured the beer slowly in front of the prisoner tears of pain squeezed from her eyes and rolled down her plump cheeks dieter took a long drink of beer and put the glass down your agony is almost over mademoiselle he said relief is at hand in a few moments you will answer my questions then you will find ease she closed her eyes where do you meet the british agents he paused how do you recognize one another she said nothing what is the password he waited a moment then said have the answers ready in the forefront of your mind and make sure they are clear so that when the time comes you can tell me quickly without hesitation or explanations then you can seek rapid release from your pain he took the key to the handcuffs from his pocket hans hold her wrist firmly he bent down and unlocked the cuffs that fastened her ankle to the table leg he took her by the arm come with us stephanie he said were going to the ladies toilet they left the room stephanie leading the way dieter and hans holding the prisoner who hobbled along with difficulty bent at the waist biting her lip they went to the end of the corridor and stopped at a door marked damen mademoiselle lemas groaned loudly when she saw it dieter said to stephanie open the door she did so it was a clean whitetiled room with a washbasin a towel on a rail and a row of cubicles now said dieter the pain is about to end please she whispered let me go where do you meet the british agents mademoiselle lemas began to cry dieter said gently where do you meet these people in the cathedral she sobbed in the crypt please let me go dieter breathed a long sigh of satisfaction she had broken when do you meet them three oclock any afternoon i go every day and how do you recognize one another i wear odd shoes black and brown now can i go one more question what is the password pray for me she tried to move forward but dieter held her tightly and hans did the same pray for me dieter repeated is that what you say or what the agent says the agentoh i beg you and your reply i pray for peace thats my reply thank you dieter said and released her she rushed inside dieter nodded at stephanie who followed her in and closed the door he could not conceal his satisfaction there hans we make progress hans too was pleased the cathedral crypt three pm any day black and brown shoes pray for me and the response i pray for peace very good when they come out put the prisoner in a cell and turn her over to the gestapo theyll arrange for her to disappear into a camp somewhere hans nodded it seems harsh sir her being an elderly lady i mean it doesuntil you think of the german soldiers and french civilians killed by the terrorists she sheltered then it seems hardly punishment enough that does throw a different light on it yes sir you see how one thing leads to another dieter said reflectively gaston gives us a house the house gives us mademoiselle lemas she gives us the crypt and the crypt will give us who knows he began to think about the best way to exploit the new information the challenge was to capture agents without letting london know if the thing was handled right the allies would send more people along the same route wasting vast resources it had been done in holland more than fifty expensively trained saboteurs had parachuted straight into the arms of the germans ideally the next agent sent by london would go to the crypt of the cathedral and find mademoiselle lemas waiting there she would take the agent home and he would send a wireless message to london saying all was well then when he was out of the house dieter could get hold of his code books after that dieter could arrest the agent but continue to send messages to london in his nameand read the replies in effect he would be running a resistance circuit that was entirely fictional it was a thrilling prospect willi weber walked by well major has the prisoner talked she has not a moment too soon did she say anything useful you may tell your superiors that she has revealed the location of her rendezvous and the passwords used we can pick up any further agents as they arrive weber looked interested despite his hostility and where is the rendezvous dieter hesitated he would have preferred not to tell weber anything but it was difficult to refuse without giving offense and he needed the mans help he had to tell him the cathedral crypt afternoons at three i shall inform paris weber walked on dieter resumed thinking about his next step the house in the rue du bois was a cutout no one in the bollinger circuit had met mademoiselle lemas agents coming in from london did not know what she looked likehence the need for recognition signals and passwords if he could get someone to impersonate her but who stephanie came out of the ladies toilet with mademoiselle lemas she could do it she was much younger than mademoiselle lemas and looked completely different but the agents would not know that she was obviously french all she had to do was take care of the agent for a day or so he took stephanies arm hans will deal with the prisoner now come let me buy you a glass of champagne he walked her out of the chfteau in the square the soldiers had done their work and the three stakes threw long shadows in the evening light a handful of local people stood silent and watchful outside the church door dieter and stephanie went into the caf dieter ordered a bottle of champagne thank you for helping me today he said i appreciate it i love you she said and you love me i know even though you never say it but how do you feel about what we did today youre french and you have that grandmother whose race we mustnt speak of and as far as i know youre not a fascist she shook her head violently i no longer believe in nationality or race or politics she said passionately when i was arrested by the gestapo no french people helped me no jews helped me no socialists or liberals or communists either and i was so cold in that prison her face changed her lips lost the sexy half smile she wore most of the time and the glint of teasing invitation went from her eyes she was looking at another scene in another time she crossed her arms and shivered although it was a warm summer evening not just cold on the outside not just the skin i felt cold in my heart and my bowels and my bones i felt i would never be warm again i would just go cold to my grave she was silent for a long moment her face drawn and pale and dieter felt at that instant that war was a terrible thing then she said ill never forget the fire in your apartment a coal fire i had forgotten what it was like to feel that blazing warmth it made me human again she came out of her trance you saved me you gave me food and wine you bought me clothes she smiled her old smile the one that said you can if you dare and you loved me in front of that coal fire he held her hand it wasnt difficult you keep me safe in a world where almost no one is safe so now i believe only in you if you really mean that of course theres something else you could do for me anything i want you to impersonate mademoiselle lemas she raised one perfectly plucked eyebrow pretend to be her go to the cathedral crypt every afternoon at three oclock wearing one black shoe and one brown when someone approaches you and says pray for me reply i pray for peace take the person to the house in the rue du bois then call me it sounds simple the champagne arrived and he poured two glasses he decided to level with her it should be simple but there is a slight risk if the agent has met mademoiselle lemas before he will know youre an impostor then you could be in danger will you take that chance is it important to you its important for the war i dont care about the war its important to me too then ill do it he raised his glass thank you he said they clinked glasses and drank outside in the square there was a volley of gunfire dieter looked through the window he saw three bodies tied to the wooden pillars slumped in death a row of soldiers lowering their rifles and a crowd of citizens looking on silent and still chapter wartime a u ste r i t y had made little real difference to soho the redlight district in the heart of londons west end the same groups of young men staggered through the streets drunk on beer though most of them were in uniform the same painted girls in tight dresses strolled along the pavements eyeing potential customers the illuminated signs outside clubs and bars were switched off because of the blackout but all the establishments were open mark and flick arrived at the crisscross club at ten oclock in the evening the manager a young man wearing a dinner jacket with a red bow tie greeted mark like a friend flicks spirits were high mark knew a female telephone engineer flick was about to meet her and she felt optimistic mark had not said much about her except that her name was greta like the film star when flick tried to question him he just said you have to see her for yourself as mark paid the entrance fee and exchanged commonplaces with the manager flick saw an alteration come over him he grew more extrovert his voice took on a lilt and his gestures became theatrical flick wondered if her brother had another persona that he put on after dark they went down a flight of stairs to a basement the place was dimly lit and smoky flick could see a fivepiece band on a low stage a small dance floor a scatter of tables and a number of booths around the dark perimeter of the room she had wondered if it would be a menonly club the kind of place that catered to chaps like mark who were not the marrying kind although the patrons were mostly male there was a good sprinkling of girls some of them very glamorously dressed a waiter said hello markie and put a hand on marks shoulder but gave flick a hostile glare robbie meet my sister mark said her names felicity but weve always called her flick the waiters attitude changed and he gave flick a friendly smile very nice to meet you he showed them to a table flick guessed that robbie had suspected she might be a girlfriend and had resented her for persuading mark to change sides as it were then he had warmed to her when he learned she was marks sister mark smiled up at robbie and said hows kit oh all right i suppose robbie said with the hint of a flounce youve had a row havent you mark was being charming he was almost flirting this was a side of him flick had never seen in fact she thought it might be the real mark the other persona his discreet daytime self was probably the pretense when have we not had a row robbie said he doesnt appreciate you mark said with exaggerated melancholy touching robbies hand youre right bless you something to drink flick ordered scotch and mark asked for a martini flick did not know much about men such as these she had been introduced to marks friend steve and had visited the flat they shared but had never met any of their friends although she was madly curious about their world it seemed prurient to ask questions she didnt even know what they called themselves all the words she knew were more or less unpleasant queer homo fairy nancyboy mark she said what do you call men who you know prefer men he grinned musical darling he said waving his hand in a feminine gesture i must remember that flick thought now i can say to mark is he musical she had learned the first word of their secret code a tall blonde in a red cocktail dress came swishing onto the stage to a burst of applause this is greta said mark shes a telephone engineer by day greta began to sing nobody knows you when youre down and out she had a powerful bluesy voice but flick noticed immediately that she had a german accent shouting into marks ear over the sound of the band she said i thought you said she was french she speaks french he corrected but shes german flick was bitterly disappointed this was no good greta would have just as much of a german accent when she spoke french the audience loved greta clapping each number enthusiastically cheering and whistling when she accompanied the music with bumpandgrind movements but flick could not relax and enjoy the show she was too worried she still did not have her telephone engineer and she had wasted the latter half of the evening coming here on a wildgoose chase but what was she going to do she wondered how long it would take her to pick up the rudiments of telephone engineering herself she had no difficulty with technical things she had built a radio at school anyway she needed to know only enough to destroy the equipment effectively could she do a twoday course maybe with some people from the general post office the trouble was nobody could be quite sure what kind of equipment the saboteurs would find when they entered the chfteau it could be french or german or a mixture possibly even including imported american machinerythe usa was far ahead of france in phone technology there were many kinds of equipment and the chfteau served several different functions it had a manual exchange an automatic exchange a tandem exchange for connecting other exchanges to one another and an amplification station for the allimportant new trunk route to germany but only an experienced engineer could be confident of recognizing whatever he saw when he walked in there were engineers in france of course and she might find a womanif she had time it was not a promising idea but she thought it through soe could send a message to every resistance circuit if there was a woman who could fit the bill it would take her a day or two to get to reims which was all right but the plan was so uncertain was there a woman telephone engineer in the french resistance if not flick would waste two days to learn that the mission was doomed no she needed something more sure she thought again about greta she could not pass for french the gestapo might not notice her accent since they spoke french the same way but the french police would did she have to pretend to be french there were plenty of german women in france officers wives young women in the armed services drivers and typists and wireless operators flick began to feel excited again why not greta could pose as an army secretary no that could cause problemsan officer might start giving her orders it would be safer for her to pose as a civilian she could be the young wife of an officer living with her husband in parisno vichy it was farther away there would have to be a story about why greta was traveling with a group of french women perhaps one of the team could pose as her french maid what about when they entered the chfteau flick was pretty sure there were no german women working as cleaners in france how could greta evade suspicion once again germans probably would not notice her accent but french people would could she avoid speaking to any french people pretend she had laryngitis she might be able to get away with it for a few minutes flick thought it was not exactly watertight but it was better than any other option greta finished her act with a hilariously suggestive blues song called kitchen man full of doubleentendres the audience loved the line when i eat his doughnuts all i leave is the hole she left the stage to gales of applause mark got up saying we can talk to her in her dressing room flick followed him through a door beside the stage down a smelly concrete corridor into a dingy area crammed with cardboard boxes of beer and gin it was like the cellar of a rundown pub they came to a door that had a pink paper cutout star fixed to it with thumbtacks mark knocked and opened it without waiting for a reply the tiny room had a dressing table a mirror surrounded by bright makeup lights a stool and a movie poster showing greta garbo in twofaced woman an elaborate blonde wig rested on a stand shaped like a head the red dress greta had worn on stage hung from a hook on the wall sitting on the stool in front of the mirror flick saw to her utter astonishment was a young man with a hairy chest she gasped it was greta no question the face was heavily made up with vivid lipstick and false eyelashes plucked eyebrows and a layer of makeup hiding the shadow of a dark beard the hair was cut brutally short no doubt to accommodate the wig the false bosom was presumably fixed inside the dress but greta still wore a halfslip stockings and red highheeled shoes flick rounded on mark you didnt tell me she accused he laughed delightedly flick meet gerhard he said he loves it when people dont realize flick saw that gerhard was looking pleased of course he would be happy that she had taken him for a real woman it was a tribute to his art she did not need to worry that she had insulted him but he was a man and she needed a woman telephone engineer flick was painfully disappointed greta would have been the last piece in the jigsaw the woman who made the team complete now the mission was in doubt again she was angry with mark this was so mean of you she said i thought youd solved my problem but you were just playing a joke its not a joke mark said indignantly if you need a woman take greta i couldnt flick said it was a ridiculous idea or was it greta had convinced her she could probably do the same to the gestapo if they arrested her and stripped her they would learn the truth but if they got to that stage it was generally all over anyway she thought of the hierarchy at soe and simon fortescue at mi the top brass would never agree to it dont tell them mark suggested not tell them flick was at first shocked then intrigued by that idea if greta was to fool the gestapo she ought also to be able to deceive everyone at soe why not said mark why not flick repeated gerhard said mark sweetie what is all this about his german accent was stronger in speech than in song i dont really know mark told him my sister is involved in something hushhush ill explain flick said but first tell me about yourself how did you come to london well sweetheart where shall i begin gerhard lit a cigarette im from hamburg twelve years ago when i was a boy of sixteen and an apprentice telephone engineer it was a wonderful town bars and nightclubs full of sailors making the most of their shore leave i had the best time and when i was eighteen i met the love of my life his name was manfred tears came to gerhards eyes and mark held his hand gerhard sniffed in a very unladylike fashion and carried on ive always adored womens clothes lacy underwear and high heels hats and handbags i love the swish of a full skirt but i did it so crudely in those days i really didnt even know how to put on eyeliner manfred taught me everything he wasnt a crossdresser himself you know a fond look came over gerhards face he was extremely masculine in fact he worked in the docks as a stevedore but he loved me in drag and he taught me how to do it right why did you leave they took manfred away the bloody fucking nazis sweetheart we had five years together but one night they came for him and i never saw him again hes probably dead i think prison would kill him but i dont know anything for sure tears dissolved his mascara and ran down his powdered cheeks in black streaks he could still be alive in one of their bloody flicking camps you know his grief was infectious and flick found herself fighting back tears what got into people that made them persecute one another she asked herself what made the nazis torment harmless eccentrics like gerhard so i came to london gerhard said my father was english he was a sailor from liverpool who got off his ship in hamburg and fell in love with a pretty german girl and married her he died when i was two so i never really knew him but he gave me my surname which is oreilly and i always had dual nationality it still cost me all my savings to get a passport in as things turned out i was just in time happily theres always work for a telephone engineer in any city so here i am the toast of london the deviant diva its a sad story flick said im very sorry thank you sweetheart but the world is full of sad stories these days isnt it why are you interested in mine i need a female telephone engineer what on earth for i cant tell you much as mark said its hushhush one thing i can say is that the job is very dangerous you might get killed how absolutely chilling but you can imagine that im not very good at rough stuff they said i was psychologically unsuited to service in the army and quite bloody rightly half the squaddies would have wanted to beat me up and the other half would have been sneaking into bed with me at night ive got all the tough soldiers i need what i want from you is your expertise would it mean a chance to hurt those bloody flicking nazis absolutely if we succeed it will do a very great deal of damage indeed to the hitler regime then sweetheart im your girl flick smiled my god she thought ive done it the fourth day wednesday may chapter in the middle of the night the roads of southern england were thronged with traffic great convoys of army trucks rumbled along every highway roaring through the darkened towns heading for the coast bemused villagers stood at their bedroom windows staring in incredulity at the endless stream of traffic that was stealing their sleep my god said greta there really is going to be an invasion she and flick had left london shortly after midnight in a borrowed car a big white lincoln continental that flick loved to drive greta wore one of her less eyepopping outfits a simple black dress with a brunette wig she would not be gerhard again until the mission was over flick hoped greta was as expert as mark had claimed she worked for the general post office as an engineer so presumably she knew what she was talking about but flick had not been able to test her now as they crawled along behind a tank transporter flick explained the mission anxiously hoping the conversation would not reveal gaps in gretas knowledge the chfteau contains a new automatic exchange put in by the germans to handle all the extra telephone and teleprinter traffic between berlin and the occupying forces at first greta was skeptical about the plan but sweetheart even if we succeed whats to stop the germans just rerouting calls around the network volume of traffic the system is overloaded the army command center called zeppelin outside berlin handles one hundred twenty thousand longdistance calls and twenty thousand telex messages a day there will be more when we invade france but much of the french system still consists of manual exchanges now imagine that the main automatic exchange is out of service and all those calls have to be made the oldfashioned way by hello girls taking ten times as long ninety percent of them will never get through the military could prohibit civilian calls that wont make much difference civilian traffic is only a tiny fraction anyway all right greta was thoughtful well we could destroy the common equipment racks what do they do provide the tones and ringing voltages and so on for automatic calls and the register translators they transform the dialed area code into a routing instruction would that make the whole exchange unworkable no and the damage could be repaired you need to knock out the manual exchange the automatic exchange the longdistance amplifiers the telex exchange and the telex amplifierswhich are probably all in different rooms remember we cant carry a great quantity of explosives with usonly what six women could hide in their everyday bags thats a problem michel had been through all this with arnaud a member of the bollinger circuit who worked for the french ptfpostes telegraphes tlphonesbut flick had not queried the details and arnaud was dead killed in the raid there must be some equipment common to all the systems yes there isthe mdf whats that the main distribution frame two sets of terminals on large racks all the cables from outside come to one side of the frame all the cables from the exchange come to the other and theyre connected by jumper links where would that be in a room next to the cable chamber ideally youd want a fire hot enough to melt the copper in the cables how long would it take to reconnect the cables a couple of days are you sure when the cables in my street were severed by a bomb one old post office engineer had us reconnected in a few hours street repairs are simple just a matter of connecting broken ends together red to red and blue to blue but an mdf has hundreds of crossconnections two days is conservative and that assumes the repairmen have the record cards record cards they show how the cables are connected theyre normally kept in a cabinet in the mdf room if we burn them too it will take weeks of trial and error to figure out the connections flick now recalled michel saying the resistance had someone in the pt who was ready to destroy the duplicate records kept at headquarters this is sounding good now listen in the morning when i explain our mission to the others im going to tell them something completely different a cover story why so that our mission wont be jeopardized if one of us is captured and interrogated oh greta found this a sobering thought how dreadful youre the only one who knows the true story so keep it to yourself for now dont worry us queers are used to keeping secrets flick was startled by her choice of words but made no comment the finishing school was located on the grounds of one of englands grandest stately homes beaulieu pronounced bewly was a sprawling estate in the new forest near the south coast the main residence palace house was the home of lord montagu hidden away in the surrounding woods were numerous large country houses in extensive grounds of their own most of these had been vacated early in the war younger owners had gone on active service and older ones generally had the means to flee to safer locations twelve of the houses had been requisitioned by soe and were used for training agents in security wireless operation map reading and dirtier skills such as burglary sabotage forgery and silent killing they reached the place at three oclock in the morning flick drove down a rough track and crossed a cattle grid before pulling up in front of a large house coming here always felt like entering a fantasy world one where deception and violence were talked of as commonplace the house had an appropriate air of unreality although it had about twenty bedrooms it was built in the style of a cottagean architectural affectation that had been popular in the years before the first world war it looked quaint in the moonlight with its chimneys and dormer windows hipped roofs and tilehung bays it was like an illustration in a childrens novel a big rambling house where you could play hideandseek all day the place was silent the rest of the team was here flick knew but they would be asleep she was familiar with the house and found two vacant rooms on the attic floor she and greta went gratefully to bed flick lay awake for a while wondering how she would ever weld this bunch of misfits into a fighting unit but she soon fell asleep she got up again at six from her window she could see the estuary of the solent the water looked like mercury in the gray morning light she boiled a kettle for shaving and took it to gretas room then she roused the others percy and paul were first to arrive in the big kitchen at the back of the house percy demanding tea and paul coffee flick told them to make it themselves she had not joined soe to wait on men i make tea for you sometimes percy said indignantly you do it with an air of noblesse oblige she replied like a duke holding a door for a housemaid paul laughed you guys he said you crack me up an army cook arrived at half past six and before long they were sitting around the big table eating fried eggs and thick rashers of bacon food was not rationed for secret agents they needed to build up their reserves once they went into action they might have to go for days without proper nourishment the girls came down one by one flick was startled by her first sight of maude valentine neither percy nor paul had said how pretty she was she appeared immaculately dressed and scented her rosebud mouth accentuated by bright lipstick looking as if she were off to lunch at the savoy she sat next to paul and said with a suggestive air sleep well major flick was relieved to see the dark pirate face of ruby romain she would not have been surprised to learn that ruby had run off in the night never to be seen again of course ruby could then be rearrested for the murder she had not been pardoned rather the charges had been dropped they could always be picked up again that ought to keep ruby from disappearing but she was as tough as a boot and she might have decided to take the chance jelly knight looked her age this early in the morning she sat beside percy and gave him a fond smile i suppose you slept like a top she said clear conscience he replied she laughed you havent got a bloody conscience the cook offered her a plate of bacon and eggs but she made a face no thank you dear she said ive got to watch my figure her breakfast was a cup of tea and several cigarettes when greta came through the door flick held her breath she wore a pretty cotton dress with a small false bosom a pink cardigan softened her shoulder line and a chiffon scarf concealed her masculine throat she wore the short dark wig her face was heavily powdered but she had used only a little lipstick and eye makeup by contrast with her sassy onstage personality today she was playing the part of a rather plain young woman who was perhaps a little embarrassed about being so tall flick introduced her and watched the reactions of the other women this was the first test of gretas impersonation they all smiled pleasantly showing no sign that they saw anything wrong and flick breathed easier along with maude the other woman flick had not met before was lady denise bowyer percy had interviewed her at hendon and had recruited her despite signs that she was indiscreet she turned out to be a plain girl with a lot of dark hair and a defiant air although she was the daughter of a marquess she lacked the easy selfconfidence typical of upperclass girls flick felt a little sorry for her but denise was too charmless to be likable this is my team flick thought one flirt one murderess one safebreaker one female impersonator and one awkward aristocrat there was someone missing she realized the other aristocrat diana had not appeared and it was now half past seven flick said to percy you did tell diana that reveille was at six i told everyone and i banged on her door at a quarter past flick stood up id better check on her bedroom ten right she went upstairs and knocked at dianas door there was no response so she went in the room looked as if a bomb had hit ita suitcase open on the rumpled bed pillows on the floor knickers on the dressing tablebut flick knew this was normal diana had always been surrounded by people whose job it was to tidy up after her flicks mother had been one of those people no diana had simply gone off somewhere she was going to have to realize that her time was no longer her own flick thought with irritation shes disappeared she told the others well start without her she stood at the head of the table we have two days training in front of us then on friday night we parachute into france were an allfemale team because it is much easier for women to move around occupied francethe gestapo are less suspicious our mission is to blow up a railway tunnel near the village of marles not far from reims on the main railway line between frankfurt and paris flick glanced at greta who knew the story was false she sat quietly buttering toast and did not meet flicks eye the agents course is normally three months flick went on but this tunnel has to be destroyed by monday night in two days we hope to give you some basic security rules teach you how to parachute do some weapons training and show you how to kill people without making a noise maude looked pale despite her makeup kill people she said surely you dont expect girls to do that jelly gave a grunt of disgust there is a bloody war on you know diana came in from the garden with bits of vegetation clinging to her corduroy trousers ive been for a tramp in the woods she said enthusiastically marvelous and look what the greenhouse man gave me she took a handful of ripe tomatoes from her pocket and rolled them onto the kitchen table flick said sit down diana youre late for the briefing im sorry darling have i missed your lovely talk youre in the military now flick said with exasperation when youre told to be in the kitchen by seven its not a suggestion youre not going to get all headmistressy with me are you sit down and shut up frightfully sorry darling flick raised her voice diana when i say shut up you dont say frightfully sorry to me and you dont call me darling ever just shut up diana sat down in silence but she looked mutinous oh hell flick thought i didnt handle that very well the kitchen door opened with a bang and a small muscular man of about forty came in he had sergeants chevrons on his uniform shirt good morning girls he said heartily flick said this is sergeant bill griffiths one of the instructors she did not like bill an army pt instructor he showed an unpleasant relish in physical combat and never seemed sorry enough when he hurt someone she had noticed that he was worse with women were just about ready for you sergeant so why dont you begin she moved aside and leaned against the wall your wish is my command he said unnecessarily he took her place at the head of the table landing with a parachute he began is like jumping off a wall fourteen feet high the ceiling of this kitchen is a bit less than that so its like leaping into the garden from upstairs flick heard jelly say quietly oh my gordon you cannot come down on your feet and stay upright bill continued if you try to land in a standing position you will break your legs the only safe way is to fall so the first thing were going to teach you is how to fall if anyone wishes to keep their clothing clean please go into the boot room just there and put on overalls if you will assemble outside in three minutes we will begin while the women were changing paul took his leave we need a parachute training flight tomorrow and theyre going to tell me there are no planes available he said to flick im going to london to kick ass ill be back tonight flick wondered if he was going to see his girl as well in the garden were an old pine table an ugly mahogany wardrobe from the victorian era and a stepladder fourteen feet high jelly was dismayed youre not going to make us jump off the top of that bloody wardrobe are you she said to flick not before we show you how she said youll be surprised how easy it is jelly looked at percy you bugger she said what have you let me in for when they were all ready bill said first were going to learn to fall from zero height there are three ways forwards backwards and sideways he demonstrated each method dropping to the ground effortlessly and springing up again with a gymnasts agility you must keep your legs together he looked arch and added as all young ladies should no one laughed do not throw out your arms to break your fall but keep them at your sides do not worry about hurting yourself if you break an arm it will hurt a hell of a lot worse as flick expected the younger girls had no difficulty diana maude ruby and denise were all able to fall like athletes as soon as they were shown how ruby having done it once from the standing position lost patience with the exercise she climbed to the top of the stepladder not yet bill shouted at her but he was too late she jumped off the top and landed perfectly then she walked off sat under a tree and lit a cigarette i think shes going to give me trouble flick thought flick was more worried about jelly she was a key member of the team the only one who knew about explosives but she had lost her girlish suppleness some years ago parachuting was going to be difficult for her however she was game falling from the standing position she hit the ground with a grunt and cursed as she got up but she was ready to try again to flicks surprise the worst student was greta i cant do this she said to flick i told you im no good at rough stuff it was the first time greta had spoken more than a couple of words and jelly frowned and muttered funny accent let me help you bill said to greta stand still just relax he took her by the shoulders then with a sudden strong motion he threw her to the ground she landed heavily and gave a gasp of pain she struggled to her feet and to flicks dismay she began to cry for gods sake bill said disgustedly what kind of people are they sending us flick glared at him she did not want to lose her telephone engineer through bills brutishness just go easy she snapped at him he was unrepentant the gestapo are a lot worse than me flick would have to mend the damage herself she took greta by the hand well do a little special training on our own they went around the house to another part of the garden im sorry greta said i just hate that little man i know now lets do this together kneel down they knelt facing one another and held hands just do what i do flick leaned slowly sideways greta mirrored her action together they fell to the ground still holding hands there flick said that was all right wasnt it greta smiled why cant he be like you flick shrugged men she said with a grin now are you ready to try faffing from a standing position well do it the same way holding hands she took greta through all the exercises bill was doing with the others greta quickly gained confidence they returned to the group the others were jumping off the table greta joined in and landed perfectly and they gave her a round of applause they progressed to jumping from the top of the wardrobe then finally the stepladder when jelly jumped off the ladder rolled perfectly and stood upright flick hugged her im proud of you she said well done bill looked disgusted he turned to percy what the hell kind of army is it when you get a hug for doing what youre bloody well told get used to it bill said percy chapter at the tall house in the rue du bois dieter carried stephanies suitcase up the stairs and into mademoiselle lemass bedroom he looked at the tightly made single bed the oldfashioned walnut chest of drawers and the prayer stool with the rosary on its lectern its not going to be easy to pretend this is your house he said anxiously putting the case on the bed ill say ive inherited it from a maiden aunt and ive been too lazy to fix it up to my taste she said clever all the same youll need to mess it up a little she opened the case took out a black negligee and draped it carelessly over the prayer stool better already dieter said what will you do if the phone rings stephanie thought for a minute when she spoke her voice was lower and her highclass paris accent had been replaced by the tones of provincial gentility hello yes this is mademoiselle lemas who is calling please very good said dieter the impersonation might not fool a close friend or relative but a casual caller would notice nothing wrong especially with the distortion of a telephone line they explored the house there were four more bedrooms each ready to receive a guest the beds made up a clean towel on each washstand in the kitchen where there should have been a selection of small saucepans and a onecup coffee pot they found large casserole dishes and a sack of rice that would have fed mademoiselle lemas for a year the wine in the cellar was cheap viii ordinaire but there was half a case of good scotch whisky the garage at the side of the house contained a little prewar simca cinq the french version of the fiat the italians called the topolino it was in good condition with a tank full of petrol he cranked the starting handle and the engine turned over immediately there was no way the authorities would have allowed mademoiselle lemas to buy scarce petrol and spare parts for a car to take her shopping the vehicle must have been fueled and maintained by the resistance he wondered what cover story she had used to explain her ability to drive around perhaps she pretended to be a midwife the old cow was well organized dieter remarked stphame made lunch they had shopped on the way there was no meat or fish in the shops but they had bought some mushrooms and a lettuce and a loaf of pain noir the bread the french bakers made with the poor flour and bran which was all they could get stephanie prepared a salad and used the mushrooms to make a risotto and they found some cheese in the larder to finish off with crumbs on the dining room table and dirty pans in the kitchen sink the house began to look more lived in the war must have been the best thing that ever happened to her dieter said as they drank coffee how can you say that shes on her way to a prison camp think of the life she led before a woman alone no husband no family her parents dead then into her life come all these young people brave boys and girls on daredevil missions they probably tell her all about their loves and their fears she hides them in her house gives them whisky and cigarettes and sends them on their way wishing them luck it was probably the most exciting time of her life i bet shes never been so happy perhaps she would have preferred a peaceful life shopping for hats with a woman friend arranging the flowers for the cathedral going to paris once a year for a concert nobody really prefers a peaceful life dieter glanced out of the dining room window damn a young woman was coming up the path pushing a bicycle with a large basket over its front wheel who the hell is this stephanie stared at the approaching visitor what shall i do dieter did not answer for a moment the intruder was a plain fitlooking girl in muddy trousers and a work shirt with big sweat patches under the armpits she did not ring the doorbell but pushed her bicycle into the courtyard he was dismayed was his charade to be exposed so soon shes coming to the back door she must be a friend or relation youll just have to improvise go and meet her ill stay here and listen they heard the kitchen door open and close and the girl called out in french good morning its me stephanie went into the kitchen dieter stood by the dining room door he could hear everything clearly the girls startled voice said who are you im stephanie the niece of mademoiselle lemas the visitor did not bother to conceal her suspicion didnt know she had a niece she didnt tell me about you either dieter heard the note of amiable amusement in stephanies voice and realized she was being charming would you like to sit down whats in that basket some provisions im marie i live in the country im able to get extra food and i bring some for for mademoiselle ah said stephanie for her guests there was a rustling sound and dieter guessed stephanie was looking through the paperwrapped food in the basket this is wonderful eggs pork strawberries this explained how mademoiselle lemas managed to remain plump dieter thought you know then said marie i know about aunties secret life yes hearing her say auntie dieter realized that neither he nor stephanie had ever asked mademoiselle lernass first name the pretense would be over if marie found out that stephanie did not even know the name of her aunt where is she she went to aix do you remember charles menton who used to be dean at the cathedral no i dont perhaps youre too young he was the best friend of aunties father until he retired and went to live in provence stphame was improvising brilliantly dieter thought with admiration she had cool nerves and she was imaginative he has suffered a heart attack and she has gone to nurse him she asked me to take care of any guests while shes away when will she come back charles is not expected to live long on the other hand the war may be over soon she didnt tell anyone about this charles she told me it looked as if stephanie might get away with it dieter thought if she could keep this up a little longer marie would go away convinced she would report what had happened to someone or other but stephanies story was plausible and exactly the kind of thing that happened in resistance movements it was not like the army someone like mademoiselle lemas could easily make a unilateral decision to leave her post and put someone else in charge it drove resistance leaders mad but there was nothing they could do all their troops were volunteers he began to feel hopeful where are you from said marie i live in paris does your aunt valerie have any other nieces hidden away so dieter thought mademoiselle lemass name is valerie i dont think sonone that i know youre a liar maries tone had changed something had gone wrong dieter sighed and drew the automatic pistol from beneath his jacket stephanie said what on earth are you talking about youre lying you dont even know her name its not valerie its jeanne dieter thumbed the safety lever on the left of the slide up to the fire position stephanie carried on gamely i always call her auntie youre being very rude marie said scornfully i knew from the start jeanne would never trust someone like you with your high heels and perfume dieter stepped into the kitchen what a shame marie he said if you had been more trusting or less clever you might have got away as it is youre under arrest marie looked at stephanie and said youre a gestapo whore it was a wounding gibe and stephanie blushed dieter was so infuriated that he almost pistolwhipped marie youll regret that remark when youre in the hands of the gestapo he said coldly theres a man called sergeant becker who is going to question you when youre screaming and bleeding and begging for mercy remember that careless insult marie looked poised to flee dieter almost hoped she would then he could shoot her and the problem would be solved but she did not run after a long moment her shoulders slumped and she began to cry her tears did not move him lie facedown on the floor with your hands behind your back she obeyed he put away the gun i think i saw a rope in the cellar he said to stephanie ill get it she returned with a length of washing line dieter tied maries hands and feet ill have to take her to sainteccile he said we cant have her here in case a british agent comes in today he looked at his watch it was two oclock he had time to take her to the chfteau and be back by three youll have to go to the crypt on your own he told stephanie use the little car in the garage ill be in the cathedral though you may not see me he kissed her almost like a husband going to the office he thought with grim amusement he picked marie up and slung her over his shoulder ill have to hurry he said and went to the back door he stepped outside then turned back hide the bicycle dont worry stephanie replied he carried the bound girl through the courtyard and into the street he opened the trunk of his car and put her inside had it not been for the whore comment he would have put her on the backseat he slammed the lid and looked around he saw no one but there were always watchers in a street such as this peering through their shutters they would have seen mademoiselle lemas being taken away yesterday and would have remarked the big skyblue car as soon as he drove away they would be talking about the man who had put a girl into the trunk of his car in normal times they would have called the police but no one in occupied territory would talk to the police unless they had to especially where the gestapo might be involved the key question for dieter was would the resistance hear of the arrest of mademoiselle lemas reims was a city not a village people were arrested every day thieves murderers smugglers black marketeers communists jews there was a good chance that no report of the events in the rue du bois would reach the ears of michel clairet but there was no guarantee dieter got into the car and headed for sainteccile chapter the team had got through the mornings instruction reasonably well to flicks relief everyone had learned the falling technique which was the hardest part of parachuting the mapreading session had been less successful ruby had never been to school and could barely read a map was like a page of chinese to her maude was baffled by directions such as northnortheast and fluttered her eyelids prettily at the instructor denise despite her expensive education proved completely incapable of understanding coordinates if the group got split up in france flick thought worriedly she would not be able to rely on them finding their own way in the afternoon they moved on to the rough stuff the weapons instructor was captain jim cardwell a character quite different from bill griffiths jim was an easygoing man with a craggy face and a thick black mustache he grinned amiably when the girls discovered how difficult it was to hit a tree at six paces with acaliber colt automatic pistol ruby was comfortable with an automatic in her hand and could shoot accurately flick suspected she had used handguns before ruby was even more comfortable when jim put his arms around her to show her how to hold the leeenfield canadian rifle he murmured something in her ear and she smiled up at him with a wicked gleam in her black eyes she had been in a womens prison for three months flick reflected no doubt she was enjoying being touched by a man jelly too handled the firearms with relaxed familiarity but diana was the star of the session using the rifle she hit the center of the target with every shot emptying the magazine of both its fiveround clips in a steady burst of deadly fire very good jim said in surprise you can have my job diana looked triumphantly at flick there are some things youre not best at she said what the heck did i do to deserve that flick asked herself was diana thinking of their schooldays when flick had always done so much better did that childhood rivalry still rankle greta was the only failure once again she was more feminine than the real women she put her hands over her ears jumped nervously at every bang and closed her eyes in terror as she pulled the trigger jim worked with her patiently giving her earplugs to muffle the noise holding her hand to teach her how to squeeze the trigger gently but it was no good she was too skittish ever to be a good shot im just not cut out for this kind of thing she said in despair jelly said then what the hell are you doing here flick interposed quickly gretas an engineer shes going to tell you where to place the charges why do we need a german engineer im english greta said my father was born in liverpool jelly snorted skeptically if thats a liverpool accent im the duchess of devonshire save your aggression for the next session flick said were about to do handtohand combat this bickering bothered her she needed them to trust one another they returned to the garden of the house where bill griffiths was waiting he had changed into shorts and tennis shoes and was doing pushups on the grass with his shirt off when he stood up flick got the feeling he wanted them to admire his physique bill liked to teach selfdefense by giving the student a weapon and saying attack me then he would demonstrate how an unarmed man could repel an attacker it was a dramatic and memorable lesson bill was sometimes unnecessarily violent but flick always thought the agents might as well get used to that today he had a selection of weapons laid out on the old pine table a wickedlooking knife that he claimed was ss equipment a walther p automatic pistol of the kind flick had seen german officers carrying a french policemans truncheon a length of blackand yellow electrical cord that he called a garotte and a beer bottle with the neck snapped to leave a rough circle of sharp glass he put his shirt back on for the training session how to escape from a man who is pointing a gun at you he began he picked up the waither thumbed the safety catch up to the firing position and handed the gun to maude she pointed it at him sooner or later your captor is going to want you to go somewhere he turned and put his hands in the air chances are hell follow close behind you poking the gun in your back he walked around in a wide circle with maude behind now maude i want you to pull the trigger the moment you think im trying to escape he quickened his pace slightly forcing maude to step out a little faster to keep up with him and as she did so he moved sideways and back he caught her right wrist under his arm and hit her hand with a sharp downwardchopping motion she cried out and dropped the gun this is where you can make a bad mistake he said as maude rubbed her wrist do not run away at this point otherwise your kraut copper will just pick up his gun and shoot you in the back what you have to do is he picked up the walther pointed it at maude and pulled the trigger there was a bang maude screamed and so did greta this gun is loaded with blanks of course bill said sometimes flick wished bill would not be quite so dramatic in his demonstrations well practice all these techniques on one another in a few minutes he went on he picked up the electrical cord and turned to greta put that around my neck when i give the word pull it as tight as you can he handed her the cord your gestapo man or your traitorous collaborationist french gendarme could kill you with the cord but he cant hold your weight with it all right greta strangle me greta hesitated then pulled the cord tight it dug into bills muscular neck he kicked out forward with both feet and fell to the ground landing on his back greta lost her grip on the cord unfortunately bill said this leaves you lying on the ground with your enemy standing over you which is an unfavorable situation he got up well do it again but this time before i drop to the ground im going to take hold of my captor by one wrist they resumed the position and greta pulled the cord tight bill grabbed her wrist fell to the ground pulling her forward and down as she fell on top of him he bent one leg and kneed her viciously in the stomach she rolled off him and curled up gasping for breath and retching flick said for christs sake bill thats a bit rough he looked pleased the gestapo are a lot worse than me he said she went to greta and helped her up im sorry she said hes a bloody fucking nazi greta gasped flick helped greta into the house and sat her down in the kitchen the cook who was peeling potatoes for lunch offered her a cup of tea and greta accepted gratefully when flick returned to the garden bill had picked his next victim ruby and handed her the policemans truncheon there was a cunning look on rubys face and flick thought if i were bill id be careful with her flick had seen bill demonstrate this technique before when ruby raised her right hand to hit him with the truncheon bill was going to grab her arm turn and throw her over his shoulder she would land flat on her back with a painful thump right gypsy girl bill said hit me with the truncheon as hard as you like ruby lifted her arm and bill moved toward her but the action did not follow the usual pattern when bill reached for rubys arm it was not there the truncheon fell to the ground ruby moved close to bill and brought her knee up hard into his groin he gave a sharp cry of pain she grabbed his shirtfront pulled him toward her sharply and butted his nose then with her sturdy black laced shoe she kicked his shin and he fell to the ground blood pouring from his nose you bitch you werent supposed to do that he yelled the gestapo are a lot worse than me said ruby chapter it was a minute before three when dieter parked outside the hotel frankfort he hurried across the cobbled square to the cathedral under the stony gaze of the carved angels in the buttresses it was almost too much to hope that an allied agent would show up at the rendezvous the first day on the other hand if the invasion really were imminent the allies would be throwing in every last asset he saw mademoiselle lemass simca cinq parked to one side of the square which meant that stephanie was already here he was relieved to have arrived in time if anything should go wrong he would not want her to have to deal with it alone he passed through the great west door into the cool gloom of the interior he looked for hans hesse and saw him sitting in the back row of pews they nodded briefly to one another but did not speak right away dieter felt like a violator the business he was engaged upon should not take place in this atmosphere he was not very devoutless so than the average german he thoughtbut he was certainly no unbeliever he felt uncomfortable catching spies in a place that had been a holy sanctuary for hundreds of years he shook off the feeling as superstitious he crossed to the north side of the building and walked up the long north aisle his footsteps ringing on the stone floor when he reached the transept he saw the gate railing and steps leading down to the crypt which was below the high altar stephanie was down there he assumed wearing one black shoe and one brown from here he could see in both directions back the way he had come the length of the north aisle and forward around the curved ambulatory at the other end of the building he knelt down and folded his hands in prayer he said lord forgive me for the suffering i inflict on my prisoners you know im trying my best to do my duty and forgive me for my sin with stephanie i know its wrong but you made her so lovely that i cant resist the temptation watch over my dear waltraud and help her to care for rudi and little mausi and protect them from the bombs of the rae and be with field marshal rommel when the invasion comes and give him the power to push the allied invaders back into the sea its a short prayer to have so much in it but you know that i have a lot to do right now amen he looked around there was no service going on but a handful of people were scattered around the pews in the side chapels praying or just sitting quietly in the sacred stillness a few tourists walked around the aisles talking in hushed voices about the medieval architecture bending their necks to peer up into the vastness of the vaulting if an allied agent showed up today dieter planned simply to watch and make sure nothing went wrong ideally he would not have to do anything stephanie would talk to the agent exchange passwords and take him home to the rue du bois after that his plans were vaguer somehow the agent would lead him to others at some point there would be a breakthrough an unwise person would be found to have a written list of names and addresses a wireless set and a code book would fall into dieters hands or he would capture someone like flick clairet who would under torture betray half the french resistance he checked his watch it was five past three probably no one would come today he looked up to his horror he saw will weber what the hell was he doing here weber was in plain clothes wearing his green tweed suit with him was a younger gestapo man in a check jacket they were coming from the east end of the church walking around the ambulatory toward dieter though they had not seen him they drew level with the crypt door and stopped dieter cursed under his breath this could ruin everything he almost hoped that no british agent would come today looking along the north aisle he saw a young man carrying a small suitcase dieter narrowed his eyes most of the people in the church were older the man was wearing a shabby blue suit of french cut but he looked like a viking with red hair blue eyes and pale pink skin it was a very english combination but could also be german at first glance the young man might be an officer in mufti seeing the sights or even intending to pray however his behavior gave him away he walked purposefully along the aisle neither looking at the pillars like a tourist nor taking a seat like a worshiper dieters heart beat faster an agent on the first day and the bag he carried was almost certainly a suitcase radio that meant he had a code book too this was more than dieter had dared to hope for but weber was here to mess everything up the agent passed dieter and slowed his walk obviously looking for the crypt weber saw the man gave him a hard look then turned and pretended to study the fluting on a column maybe it was going to be all right dieter thought weber had done a stupid thing in coming here but perhaps he was just planning to observe surely he was not such an imbecile as to interfere he could ruin a unique opportunity the agent found the crypt gate and disappeared down the stone steps weber looked across the north transept and gave a nod following his gaze dieter saw two more gestapo men lurking beneath the organ loft that was a bad sign weber did not need four men just to observe dieter wondered if he had time to speak to weber get him to call his men off but weber would argue and there would be a row and thenas it turned out there was no time almost immediately stephanie came up from the crypt with the agent right behind her when she reached the top of the steps she saw weber a look of shock came over her face she was disoriented by his unexpected presence as if she had walked on stage and found herself in the wrong play she stumbled and the young agent caught her elbow and steadied her she recovered her composure with characteristic speed and gave him a grateful smile well done my girl dieter thought then weber stepped forward no dieter said involuntarily no one heard him weber took the agent by the arm and said something dieters heart sank as he realized weber was making an arrest stephanie backed away from the little tableau looking bewildered dieter got up and walked quickly toward the group he could only think that weber had decided to grab the glory by capturing an agent it was insane but possible before dieter got close the agent shook off webers hand and bolted webers young companion in the check jacket reacted fast he took two big strides after the agent flung himself forward in a flying tackle and threw his arms around the agents knees the agent stumbled but he was moving strongly and the gestapo man could not hold him the agent recovered his balance straightened up and ran on still clutching his suitcase the sudden running steps and the grunts made by both men sounded loud in the hushed cathedral and everyone looked the agent ran toward dieter dieter saw what was going to happen and groaned the second pair of gestapo men stepped out of the north transept the agent saw them and seemed to guess what they were for he swerved left but he was too late one of the men stuck out a foot and tripped him he fell headlong his chunky body hitting the stone floor with a thwack the suitcase went flying both gestapo men jumped on him weber came running up looking pleased shit dieter said aloud forgetting where he was the mad fools were ruining everything maybe he could still save the situation he reached into his jacket drew his walther p thumbed the safety catch and pointed it at the gestapo men who were holding the agent down speaking french he yelled at the top of his voice get off him now or i shoot weber said major i dieter fired into the air the report of the pistol crashed around the cathedral vaults drowning webers giveaway words silence dieter shouted in german weber looked scared and shut up dieter poked the nose of the pistol hard into the face of one of the gestapo men reverting to french he screamed off off get off him with terrified faces the two men stood up and backed away dieter looked at stephanie calling her by mademoiselle lemass name he shouted jeanne go get away stephanie began to run she circled widely around the gestapo men and dashed for the west door the agent was scrambling to his feet go with her go with her dieter shouted at him pointing the man grabbed his suitcase and ran vaulting over the backs of the wooden choir stalls and haring down the middle of the nave weber and his three associates looked bemused lie facedown dieter ordered them as they obeyed he backed away still threatening them with the gun then he turned and ran after stephanie and the agent as the other two fled through the doorway dieter stopped and spoke to hans who stood near the back of the church looking stolid talk to those damn fools dieter said breathlessly explain what were doing and make sure they dont follow us he holstered the pistol and ran outside the engine of the simca was turning over dieter pushed the agent into the cramped backseat and got into the front passenger seat stephanie stamped on the pedal and the little car shot out of the square like a champagne cork as they raced along the street dieter turned and looked through the back window no one following he said slow down we dont want to get stopped by a gendarme the agent said in french im helicopter what the hell happened in there dieter realized that helicopter must be a code name he recalled that gaston had told him mademoiselle lemass code name this is bourgeoise he said indicating stphame and im charenton he improvised thinking for some reason of the prison where the marquis de sade had been incarcerated bourgeoise has become suspicious in the last few days that the cathedral rendezvous might be watched so she asked me to come with her im not part of the bollinger circuitbourgeoise is a cutout yes i understand that anyway we now know the gestapo had set a trap and its just fortunate that she had asked me to be there as backup for her you were brilliant helicopter said enthusiastically god i was so scared i thought id blown it on my first day you have dieter thought silently it seemed to dieter that he might have saved the situation helicopter now firmly believed that dieter was a member of the resistance helicopters french sounded perfect but obviously he was not quite good enough to identify dieters slight accent was there anything else that might cause him to be suspicious perhaps later when he thought things over dieter had stood up and said no right at the start of the rumpus but a plain no did not mean much and anyway he did not think anyone had heard him willi weber had shouted major in german at dieter and dieter had fired his weapon to drown out any further indiscretion had helicopter heard that one word did he know what it meant and would he remember it later and puzzle over it no dieter decided if helicopter had understood the word he would have assumed weber was addressing one of the other gestapo men they were all in plain clothes so could be any rank helicopter would now trust dieter in all things being convinced dieter had snatched him from the clutches of the gestapo others might not be quite so easy to fool the existence of a new resistance member codenamed charenton and recruited by mademoiselle lemas would have to be plausibly explained both to london and to the leader of the bollinger circuit michel clairet both might ask questions and run checks dieter would just have to deal with them in due course it was not possible to anticipate everything he allowed himself a moment of triumph he was one step closer to his goal of crippling the resistance in northern france he had pulled it off despite the stupidity of the gestapo and it had been exhilarating the challenge now was to make maximum use of helicopters trust the agent must continue to operate believing himself unsuspected that way he could lead dieter to more agents perhaps dozens more but it was a subtle trick to pull off they arrived at the rue du bois and stephanie drove into mademoiselle lemass garage they entered the house by the back door and sat in the kitchen stephanie got a bottle of scotch from the cellar and poured them all a drink dieter was desperately anxious to confirm that helicopter had a radio he said youd better send a message to london right away im supposed to broadcast at eight pm and receive at eleven dieter made a mental note but you need to tell them as soon as possible that the cathedral rendezvous is compromised we dont want them to send any more men there and there could be someone else on his way tonight oh my god yes the young man said ill use the emergency frequency you can set up your wireless right here in the kitchen helicopter lifted the heavy case onto the table and opened it dieter hid a sigh of profound satisfaction there it was the interior of the case was divided into four two side compartments and in the middle one front and one back dieter could see immediately that the rear middle compartment contained the transmitter with the morse key in the lower righthand corner and the front middle was the receiver with a socket for headphone connections the rightside compartment was the power supply the function of the leftside compartment became clear when the agent lifted the lid to reveal a selection of accessories and spare parts a power lead adaptors aerial wire connection cables a headset spare tubes fuses and a screwdriver it was a neat compact set dieter thought admiringly the kind of thing the germans would have made not at all what he would expect from the untidy british he already knew helicopters times for transmission and reception now he had to learn the frequencies used andmost importantthe code helicopter plugged a lead into the power socket dieter said i thought it was batteryoperated battery or mains power i believe the gestapos favorite trick when theyre trying to locate the source of an illicit radio transmission is to switch off the towns electricity block by block until the broadcast is cut off dieter nodded well with this set if you lose the house current you just have to reverse this plug and it switches to battery operation very good dieter would pass that on to the gestapo in case they did not already know helicopter plugged the power lead into an electrical outlet then took the aerial wire and asked stephanie to drape it over a tall cupboard dieter looked in the kitchen drawers and found a pencil and a scratch pad that mademoiselle lemas had probably used to make shopping lists you can use this to encode your message he said helpfully first id better figure out what to say helicopter scratched his head then began to write in english arrived ok stop crypt rendezvous unsafe stop nabbed by gestapo but got away over i suppose thats it for now he said dieter said we should give them a new rendezvous for future incomers say the caf de la gare next to the railway station helicopter wrote it down he took from the case a silk handkerchief printed with a complex table showing letters in pairs he also took out a pad of a dozen or so sheets of paper printed with fiveletter nonsense words dieter recognized the makings of a onetimepad encryption system it was unbreakableunless you had the pad over the words of his message helicopter wrote the fiveletter groups from the pad then he used the letters he had written to select transpositions from the silk handkerchief over the first five letters of arrived he had written the first group from his onetime pad which was bgkru the first letter b told him which column to use from the grid on the silk handkerchief at the top of column b were the letters ae that told him to replace the a of arrived with the letter e the code could not be broken in the usual way because the next a would be represented not by e but by some other letter in fact any letter could stand for any other letter and the only way to decrypt the message was by using the pad with the fiveletter groups even if the code breakers could get hold of a coded message and its plainlanguage original they could not use them to read another message because the next message would be encoded with a different sheet from the padwhich was why it was called a onetime pad each sheet was used once then burned when he had encrypted his message helicopter flicked the onoff switch and turned a knob marked in english crystal selector looking carefully dieter saw that the dial bore three faint markings in yellow wax crayon helicopter had mistrusted his memory and had marked his broadcast positions the crystal he was using would be reserved for emergencies of the other two one would be for transmission and the other for reception finally he tuned in and dieter saw that the frequency dial was also marked with yellow crayon before sending his message he checked in with the receiving station by sending hlcp dxdx qtc qrk k dieter frowned figuring the first group had to be the call sign helicopter the next one dxdx was a mystery the number one at the end of qtc suggested that this group meant something like i have one message to send you the question mark at the end of qrk made him think this asked if he was being received loud and clear k meant over he knew that left the mysterious dxdx he tried a guess dont forget your security tag he said i havent helicopter said that must be dxdx dieter concluded helicopter turned to receive and they all heard the morse reply hlcp qrk qrv k once again the first group was helicopters call sign the second group qrk had appeared in the original message without the question mark it presumably meant i am receiving you loud and clear he was not sure about qrv but he guessed it must mean go ahead as helicopter tapped out his message in morse dieter watched feeling elated this was the spy catchers dream he had an agent in his hands and the agent did not know he had been captured when the message was sent helicopter shut down the radio quickly because the gestapo used radio directionfinding equipment to track down spies it was dangerous to operate a set for more than a few minutes in england the message had to be transcribed decoded and passed to helicopters controller who might have to consult with others before replying all of which could take several hours so helicopter would wait until the appointed hour for a response now dieter had to separate him from the wireless set and more importantly from his coding materials i presume you want to contact the bollinger circuit now he said yes london needs to know how much of it is left well put you in touch with monet thats the code name of the leader he looked at his wristwatch and suffered a moment of sheer panic it was a standard issue german army officers watch and if helicopter recognized it the game would be up trying to keep the tremor out of his voice dieter said weve got time ill drive you to his house is it far helicopter said eagerly center of town monet whose real name was michel clairet would not be at home he was no longer using the house dieter had checked the neighbors claimed to have no idea where he was dieter was not surprised monet had guessed that his name and address would be given away by one of his comrades under interrogation and he had gone into hiding helicopter began to close up the radio dieter said does that battery need recharging from time to time yesin fact they tell us to plug it in at every opportunity so that its always fully charged so why dont you leave it where it is for now we can come back for it later by which time it will be charged if anyone should come in the meantime bourgeoise can hide it away in a few seconds good idea then lets go dieter led the way to the garage and backed the simca cinq out then he said wait here a minute i have to tell bourgeoise something he went back into the house stephanie was in the kitchen staring at the suitcase radio on the kitchen table dieter took the onetime pad and the silk handkerchief from the accessories compartment how long will it take you to copy these he said she made a face all those gibberish letters at least an hour do it as fast as you can but dont make any mistakes ill keep him out for an hour and a half he returned to the car and drove helicopter into the city center michel clairets home was a small elegant town house near the cathedral dieter waited in the car while helicopter went to the door after a few minutes the agent came back and said no answer you can try again in the morning dieter said meanwhile i know a bar used by the resistance he knew no such thing lets go there and see if i recognize anyone he parked near the station and picked a bar at random the two of them sat drinking watery beer for an hour then returned to the rue du bois when they entered the kitchen stephanie gave dieter a slight nod he took it to mean she had succeeded in copying everything now dieter said to helicopter youd probably like a bath having spent a night in the open and you certainly should shave ill show you your room and bourgeoise will run your bath how kind you are dieter put him in an attic room the one farthest from the bathroom as soon as he heard the man splashing in the bath he went into the room and searched his clothes helicopter had a change of underwear and socks all bearing the labels of french shops in his jacket pockets were french cigarettes and matches a handkerchief with a french label and a wallet in the wallet was a lot of cashhalf a million francs enough to buy a luxury car if there had been any new cars for sale the identity papers seemed impeccable though they had to be forgeries there was also a photograph dieter stared at it in surprise it showed flick clairet there was no mistake it was the woman he had seen in the square at sainteccile finding it was a wonderful piece of luck for dieterand a disaster for her she was wearing a swimsuit that revealed muscular legs and suntanned arms beneath the costume she had neat breasts a small waist and delightfully rounded hips there was a glimmer of moisture either water or perspiration at her throat and she was looking into the camera with a faint smile behind her and slightly out of focus two young men in bathing trunks seemed about to dive into a river the picture had obviously been taken at an innocent swimming party but her semi nakedness the wetness at her throat and the slight smile combined to make a picture that seemed sexually charged had it not been for the boys in the background she might have been about to take the swimsuit off and reveal her body to the person behind the camera that was how a woman smiled at her man when she wanted him to make love to her dieter thought he could see why a young fellow would treasure the photo agents were not supposed to carry photos with them into enemy territoryfor very good reasons helicopters passion for flick clairet might destroy her and much of the french resistance too dieter slipped the photo into his pocket and left the room all in all he thought he had done a very good days work chapter paul chancellor spent the day fighting the military bureaucracypersuading threatening pleading cajoling and as a last resort using the name of montyand in the end he got a plane for the teams parachute training tomorrow when he caught the train back to hampshire he found he was eager to see flick again he liked her a lot she was smart tough and a pleasure to look at he wished to hell she was single on the train he read the war news in the paper the long lull on the eastern front had been broken yesterday by a surprisingly powerful german attack in rumania the continuing resilience of the germans was formidable they were in retreat everywhere but they kept fighting back the train was delayed and he missed six oclock dinner at the finishing school after dinner there was always another lecture then at nine the students were free to relax for an hour or so before bed paul found most of the team gathered in the drawing room of the house which had a bookcase a cupboard full of games a wireless set and a halfsize billiards table he sat on the sofa beside flick and said quietly how did it go today better than we had a right to expect she said but everything is so compressed i dont know how much theyre going to remember when theyre in the field i guess anything is better than nothing percy thwaite and jelly were playing poker for penflies jelly was a real character paul thought how could a professional safebreaker consider herself a respectable english lady how was jelly he asked flick not bad she has more difficulty than the others with the physical training but my goodness she just grit her teeth and got on with it and in the end she did everything the youngsters did flick paused and frowned paul said what her hostility to greta is a problem its not surprising that an englishwoman should hate germans its illogical thoughgreta has suffered more from the nazis than jelly has jelly doesnt know that she knows that gretas prepared to fight against the nazis people arent logical about these things too bloody right greta herself was talking to denise or rather paul thought denise was talking and greta was listening my stepbrother lord foules pilots fighterbombers he heard her say in her halfswallowed aristocratic accent hes been training to fly support missions for the invasion troops paul frowned did you hear that he asked flick yes either shes making it up or shes being dangerously indiscreet he studied denise she was a rawboned girl who always looked as if she had just been insulted he did not think she was fantasizing she doesnt seem the imaginative type he said i agree i think shes giving away real secrets id better arrange a little test tomorrow okay paul wanted to get flick to himself so that they could talk more freely lets take a stroll around the garden he said they stepped outside the air was warm and there was an hour of daylight left the house had a large garden with several acres of lawn dotted with trees maude and diana were sitting on a bench under a copper beech maude had flirted with paul at first but he had given her no encouragement and she seemed to have given up now she was listening avidly to something diana was saying looking into dianas face with an attitude almost of adoration i wonder what dianas saying paul said shes got maude fascinated maude likes to hear about the places shes been flick said the fashion shows the balls the ocean liners paul recalled that maude had surprised him by asking whether the mission would take them to pans maybe she wanted to go to america with me he said i noticed her making a play for you flick said shes pretty not my type though why not candidly shes not smart enough good flick said im glad he raised an eyebrow at her why i would have thought less of you otherwise he thought this was a little condescending im glad to have your approval he said dont be ironic she reprimanded him i was paying you a compliment he grinned he could not help liking her even when she was being highhanded then ill quit while im ahead he said they passed close to the two women and heard diana say so the contessa said keep your painted claws off my husband then poured a glass of champagne over jennifers head whereupon jennifer pulled the contessas hairand it came off in her hand because it was a wig maude laughed i wish id been there paul said to flick they all seem to be making friends im pleased i need them to work as a team the garden merged gradually with the forest and they found themselves walking through woodland it was only half light under the canopy of leaves why is it called the new forest paul said it looks old do you still expect english names to be logical he laughed i guess i dont they walked in silence for a while paul felt quite romantic he wanted to kiss her but she was wearing a wedding ring when i was four years old i met the king flick said the present king no his father george v he came to somersholme i was kept out of his way of course but he wandered into the kitchen garden on sunday morning and saw me he said good morning little girl are you ready for church he was a small man but he had a booming voice what did you say i said who are you he replied im the king and then according to family legend i said you cant be youre not big enough fortunately he laughed even as a child you had no respect for authority so it seems paul heard a low moan frowning he looked toward the sound and saw ruby romam with jim cardwell the firearms instructor ruby had her back to a tree and jim was embracing her they were kissing passionately ruby moaned again they were not just embracing paul realized and he felt both embarrassed and aroused jims hands were busy inside rubys blouse her skirt was up around her waist paul could see all of one brown leg and a thick patch of dark hair at her groin the other leg was raised and bent at the knee and rubys foot rested high on jims hip the movement they were making together was unmistakable paul looked at flick she had seen the same thing she stared for a moment her expression showing shock and something else then she turned quickly away paul followed suit and they went back the way they had come walking as quietly as they could when they were out of earshot he said im terribly sorry about that not your fault she said still im sorry i led you that way i really dont mind ive never seen anyone doing that it was rather sweet sweet it was not the word he would have chosen you know youre kind of unpredictable have you only just noticed dont be ironic i was paying you a compliment he said repeating her own words she laughed then ill quit while im ahead they emerged from the woods daylight was fading fast and the blackout curtains were drawn in the house maude and diana had gone from their seat under the copper beech lets sit here for a minute paul said he was in no hurry to go inside flick complied without speaking he sat sideways looking at her she bore his scrutiny without comment but she was thoughtful he took her hand and stroked her fingers she looked at him her face unreadable but she did not pull away her hand he said i know i shouldnt but i really want to kiss you she made no reply but continued to look at him with that enigmatic expression half amused and half sad he took silence for assent and kissed her her mouth was soft and moist he closed his eyes concentrating on the sensation to his surprise her lips parted and he felt the tip of her tongue he opened his mouth he put his arms around her and pulled her to him but she slipped out of his embrace and stood up enough she said she turned away and walked toward the house he watched her go in the fading light her small neat body suddenly seemed the most desirable thing in the world when she had disappeared inside he followed in the drawing room diana sat alone smoking a cigarette looking thoughtful on impulse paul sat close to her and said youve known flick since you were kids diana smiled with surprising warmth shes adorable isnt she paul did not want to give away too much of what was in his heart i like her a lot and i wish i knew more about her she always yearned for adventure diana said she loved those long trips we made to france every february we would spend a night in paris then take the blue train all the way to nice one winter my father decided to go to morocco i think it was the best time of flicks life she learned a few words of arabic and talked to the merchants in the souks we used to read the memoirs of those doughty victorian lady explorers who traveled the middle east dressed as men she got on well with your father better than i did whats her husband like all flicks men are slightly exotic at oxford her best friend was a nepalese boy rajendra which caused great consternation in the senior common room at st hildas i can tell you although im not sure she ever you know misbehaved with him a boy called charlie standish was desperately in love with her but he was just too boring for her she fell for michel because hes charming and foreign and clever which is what she likes exotic paul repeated diana laughed dont worry youll do youre american youve only got one and a half ears and youre as smart as a whip youre in with a chance at least paul stood up the conversation was taking an uncomfortably intimate turn ill take that as a compliment he said with a smile goodnight on his way upstairs he passed flicks room there was a light under the door he put on his pajamas and got into bed but he lay awake he was too excited and happy to sleep he relived the kiss again and again he wished he and flick could be like ruby and jim and give in to their desires shamelessly why not he thought why the hell not the house fell quiet a few minutes after midnight paul got up he went along the corridor to flicks room he tapped gently on the door and stepped inside hello she said quietly its me i know she lay on her back in the single bed her head propped up on two pillows the curtains were drawn back and moonlight came in at the small window he could see quite clearly the straight line of her nose and the chisel chin that he had once thought not to be pretty now they seemed angelic he knelt by the bed the answer is no she said he took her hand and kissed her palm please he said i do he leaned over her to kiss her but she turned her head away just a kiss he said if i kiss you ill be lost that pleased him it told him she was feeling the same way he did he kissed her hair then her forehead and her cheek but she kept her face averted he kissed her shoulder through the cotton of her nightdress then brushed his lips over her breast you want to he said out she commanded dont say that she turned to him he bent his face to kiss her but she put a finger on his lips as if to hush him go she said i mean it he looked at her lovely face in the moonlight her expression was set with determination although he hardly knew her he understood that her will could not be overridden reluctantly he stood up he gave it one more try look lets no more talk go he turned away and left the room the fifth day thursday june chapter dieter slept a few hours at the hotel frankfort and got up at two am he was alone stephanie was at the house in the rue du bois with the british agent helicopter some time this morning helicopter would go in search of the head of the bollinger circuit and dieter had to follow him he knew helicopter would start at michel clairets house so he had decided to put a surveillance team there by first light he drove to sainteccile in the early hours winding through the moonlit vineyards in his big car and parked in front of the chfteau he went first to the photo lab in the basement there was no one in the darkroom but his prints were there pegged on a line to dry like laundry he had asked for two copies of helicopters picture of flick cjairet he took them off the line and studied one remembering the way she had run through gunfire to rescue her husband he tried to see some of that steely nerve in the carefree expression of the pretty girl in the swimsuit but there was no sign of it no doubt it had come with war he pocketed the negative and picked up the original photo which would have to be returned surreptitiously to helicopter he found an envelope and a sheet of plain paper thought for a moment and wrote my darling while helicopter is shaving please put this in his inside jacket pocket so that it will look as if it slipped out of his wallet thank you d he put the note and the picture in the envelope sealed it and wrote mlle lemas on the front he would drop it off later he passed the cells and looked through a judas at marie the girl who had surprised him yesterday by showing up at the house in the rue du bois with food for mademoiselle lemass guests she lay on a bloodstained sheet staring at the wall with a wideeyed gaze of horror emitting a constant low moan like a piece of machinery that was broken but not switched off dieter had interrogated marie last night she had had no useful information she had claimed she knew no one in the resistance only mademoiselle lemas dieter had been inclined to believe her but he had let sergeant becker torture her just in case however she had not changed her story and he now felt confident that her disappearance would not alert the resistance to the impostor in the rue du bois he suffered a moment of depression as he stared at the wrecked body he remembered her coming up the path yesterday with her bicycle a picture of vigorous health she had been a happy girl albeit foolish she had made a simple mistake and now her life was coming to a ghastly end she deserved her fate of course she had helped terrorists all the same it was horrible to contemplate he put her out of his mind and went up the stairs on the ground floor the night shift telephonists were at their switchboards above that on what had once been a floor of impossibly grand bedrooms were the gestapo offices dieter had not seen weber since the fiasco in the cathedral and assumed the man was licking his wounds somewhere however he had spoken to webers deputy and asked for four gestapo men to be here in plain clothes at three am ready for a days surveillance dieter had also ordered lieutenant hesse to be here now he pulled aside a blackout blind and looked out moonlight illuminated the parking lot and he could see hans walking across the yard but there was no sign of anyone else he went to webers office and was surprised to find him there alone behind his desk pretending to work on some papers by the light of a greenshaded lamp where are the men i asked for dieter said weber stood up you pulled a gun on me yesterday he said what the devil do you mean by threatening an officer dieter had not expected this weber was being aggressive about an incident in which he had made a fool of himself was it possible that he did not understand what a dreadful mistake he had made it was your own damn fault you idiot dieter said in exasperation i didnt want that man arrested you can be courtmartialed for what you did dieter was about to ridicule the idea then he stopped himself it was true he realized he had simply done what was necessary to rescue the situation but it was not impossible in the bureaucratic third reich for an officer to be arraigned for using his initiative his heart sank and he had to feign confidence go ahead report me i think i can justify myself in front of a tribunal you actually fired your gun dieter could not resist saying i suppose thats something you havent often witnessed in your military career weber flushed he had never seen action guns should be used against the enemy not fellow officers i fired into the air im sorry if i frightened you you were in the process of ruining a firstclass counterintelligence coup dont you think a military court would take that into account what orders were you following you were the one who showed lack of discipline i arrested a british terrorist spy and whats the point of that hes just one they have plenty more but left to go free he will lead us to othersperhaps many others your insubordination would have destroyed that chance fortunately for you i saved you from a ghastly error weber looked sly certain people in authority would find it highly suspicious that youre so keen to free an allied agent dieter sighed dont be stupid im not some wretched jewish shopkeeper to be frightened by the threat of malicious gossip you cant pretend im a traitor no one will believe you now where are my men the spy must be arrested immediately no he mustnt and if you try ill shoot you where are the men i refuse to assign muchneeded men to such an irresponsible task you rejlse yes dieter stared at him he had not thought weber brave enough or foolish enough to do this what do you imagine will happen to you when the field marshal hears about this weber looked scared but defiant i am not in the army he said this is the gestapo unfortunately he was right dieter thought despondently it was all very well for walter goedel to order dieter to use gestapo personnel instead of taking muchneeded fighting troops from the coast but the gestapo were not obliged to take orders from dieter the name of rommel had frightened weber for a while but the effect had worn off and now dieter was left with no staff but lieutenant hesse could he and hans manage the shadowing of helicopter without assistance it would be difficult but there was no alternative he tried one more threat are you sure youre willing to bear the consequences of this refusal willi youre going to get into the most dreadful trouble on the contrary i think it is you who are in trouble dieter shook his head in despair there was no more to be said he had already spent too much time arguing with this idiot he went out he met hans in the hall and explained the situation they went to the back of the chfteau where the engineering section was housed in the former servants quarters last night hans had arranged to borrow a ptt van and a moped the kind of motorized bicycle whose small engine was started by pedaling dieter wondered whether weber might have found out about the vehicles and ordered the engineers not to lend them he hoped not dawn was due in half an hour and he did not have time for more arguments but there was no trouble dieter and hans put on overalls and drove away with the moped in the back of the van they went to reims and drove along the rue du bois they parked around the corner and hans walked back in the faint light of dawn and put the envelope containing the photo of flick into the letter box helicopters bedroom was at the back so there was no serious risk that he might see hans and recognize him later the sun was rising when they arrived outside michel clairets house in the center of town hans parked a hundred meters down the road and opened a ptt manhole he pretended to be working while watching the house it was a busy street with numerous parked vehicles so the van was not conspicuous dieter stayed in the van keeping out of sight brooding over the row with weber the man was stupid but he had a point dieter was taking a dangerous risk helicopter could give him the slip and disappear then dieter would have lost the thread the safe and easy course would be to torture helicopter but though letting him go was risky it promised rich rewards if things went right helicopter could be solid gold when dieter thought of the triumph that hung just beyond his grasp he lusted for it with a passion that made his pulse race on the other hand if things went wrong weber would make the most of it he would tell everyone how he had opposed dieters risky plan but dieter would not allow himself to worry about such bureaucratic pointscoring men such as weber who played those games were the most contemptible people on earth the town came slowly to life first to appear were the women walking to the bakery opposite michels house the shop was closed but they stood patiently outside waiting and talking bread was rationed but dieter guessed it sometimes ran out anyway so dutiful housewives shopped early to make sure they got their share when eventually the doors opened they all tried to get in at onceunlike german housewives who would have formed an orderly queue dieter thought with a feeling of superiority when he saw them come out with their loaves he wished he had eaten some breakfast after that the working men appeared in their boots and berets each carrying a bag or cheap fiber case containing his lunch the children were just beginning to set out for school when helicopter appeared pedaling the bicycle that had belonged to marie dieter sat upright in the bicycles basket was a rectangular object covered with a rag the suitcase radio dieter guessed hans put his head up out of the manhole and watched helicopter went to michels door and knocked there was no reply of course he stood on the step for a while then looked in at the windows then walked up and down the street looking for a back entrance there was none dieter knew dieter had suggested to helicopter what to do next go to the bar along the street chez regis order coffee and rolls and wait dieters hope was that the resistance might be watching michels house alert for an emissary from london he did not expect fulltime surveillance but perhaps a sympathetic neighbor might have agreed to keep an eye on the place helicopters evident guilelessness would reassure such a watcher anyone could tell just by the way he walked around that he was not a gestapo man or an agent of the milice the french security police dieter felt sure that somehow the resistance would be alerted and before too long someone would show up and speak to helicopterand that person might lead dieter to the heart of the resistance a minute later helicopter did as dieter had suggested he wheeled his bicycle along the street to the bar and sat at a pavement table apparently enjoying the sunshine he got a cup of coffee it had to be ersatz made with roasted grain but he drank it with apparent relish after twenty minutes or so he got another coffee and a newspaper from inside he began to read the paper thoroughly he had a patient air as if he was prepared to wait all day that was good the morning wore on dieter began to wonder whether this was going to work maybe the bollinger circuit had been so decimated by the slaughter at sainteccile that it was no longer operational and there was no one left to perform even the most essential tasks it would be a profound disappointment if helicopter did not lead him to other terrorists and it would please weber no end the time approached when helicopter would have to order lunch to justify continuing to use the table a waiter came out and spoke to him then brought him a pastis that too would be ersatz made with a synthetic substitute for aniseed but all the same dieter licked his lips he would have liked a drink another customer sat down at the table next to helicopters there were five tables and it would have been natural to take one farther away dieters hopes rose the newcomer was a longlimbed man in his thirties he wore a blue chambray shirt and navy canvas trousers but to dieters intuition he did not have the air of a workingman he was something else perhaps an artist who affected a proletarian look he sat back in his chair and crossed his legs resting his right ankle on his left knee and the pose struck dieter as familiar had he seen this man before the waiter came out and the customer ordered something for a minute or so nothing happened was the man covertly studying helicopter or just waiting for his drink the waiter brought a glass of pale beer on a tray the man took a long pull and wiped his mouth with a satisfied air dieter began to think gloomily that he was just a man with a thirst but at the same time he felt he had seen that mouthwiping gesture before then the newcomer spoke to helicopter dieter tensed could this be what he had been waiting for they exchanged a few casual words even at this distance dieter sensed that the newcomer had an engaging personality helicopter was smiling and talking with enthusiasm after a few moments helicopter pointed to michels house and dieter guessed he was asking where the owner might be found the other man gave a typical french shrug and dieter could imagine him saying me i dont know but helicopter seemed to persist the newcomer drained his beer glass and dieter had a flash of recollection he suddenly knew exactly who this man was and the realization so startled him that he jumped in his seat he had seen the man in the square at sainteccile at another caf table sitting with flick clairet just before the skirmishfor this was her husband michel himself yes dieter said and he thumped the dashboard with his fist in satisfaction his strategy had been proved righthelicopter had led him to the heart of the local resistance but he had not been expecting this degree of success he had thought a messenger might come and the messenger might take helicopterand dieterto michel now dieter had a dilemma michel was a very big prize should dieter arrest him right away or follow him in the hope of catching even bigger fish hans replaced the manhole cover and got into the van contact sir yes what next dieter did not know what to do nextarrest michel or follow him michel stood up and helicopter did the same dieter decided to follow them what shall i do hans said anxiously get out the bike quick hans opened the back doors of the van and took out the moped the two men put money on the caf tables and moved away dieter saw that michel walked with a limp and recalled that he had taken a bullet during the skirmish he said to hans you follow them ill follow you he started the engine of the van hans climbed on the moped and started pedaling which fired the engine he drove slowly along the street keeping a hundred meters behind his quarry dieter followed hans michel and helicopter turned a corner following a minute later dieter saw that they had stopped to look in a shop window it was a pharmacy they were not shopping for medicines of course this was a precaution against surveillance as dieter drove by they turned and headed back the way they had come they would be watching for a vehicle that made a uturn so dieter could not pursue them however he saw hans pull behind a truck and turn back remaining on the far side of the street but keeping the two men in sight dieter went around the block and caught up with them again michel and helicopter were approaching the railway station with hans still following dieter asked himself whether they knew they were being followed the trick at the pharmacy might indicate that they were suspicious he did not think they had noticed the ptj van for he had been out of their sight most of the time but they could have spotted the moped most likely dieter thought the reversal of direction was a precaution taken routinely by michel who was presumably an experienced undercover operator the two men crossed the gardens in front of the station there were no flowers in the beds but a few trees were blossoming in defiance of the war the station was a solidly classical building with pilasters and pediments heavyweight and over decorated no doubt like the nineteenthcentury businessmen who had built it what would dieter do if michel and helicopter caught a train it was too risky for dieter to get on the same train helicopter would certainly recognize him and it was even possible that michel might remember him from the square at samteccile no hans would have to board the train and dieter would follow by road they entered the station through one of three classical arches hans left his moped and followed them inside dieter pulled up and did the same if the two men went to the booking office he would tell hans to stand behind them in the queue and buy a ticket to the same destination they were not at the ticket window dieter entered the station just in time to see hans go down a flight of steps to the tunnel beneath the lines that connected the platforms perhaps michel had bought tickets in advance dieter thought that was not a problem hans would just get on the train without a ticket on either side of the tunnel steps led up to the platforms dieter followed hans past all the platform entrances sensing danger he quickened his pace as he mounted the stairs to the stations rear entrance he caught up with hans and they emerged together into the rue de courcelles several of the buildings had been bombed recently but cars were parked on those stretches of the road that were clear of rubble dieter scanned the street fear leaping in his chest a hundred meters away michel and helicopter were jumping into a black car dieter and hans would never catch them dieter put his hand on his gun but the range was too great for a pistol the car pulled away it was a black renault monaquatre one of the commonest cars in france dieter could not read its license plate it tore off along the street and turned a corner dieter cursed it was a simple ploy but infallible by entering the tunnel they had forced their pursuers to abandon their vehicles then they had a car waiting at the other side enabling them to escape they might not even have detected their shadows like the change of direction outside the pharmacy the tunnel trick had probably been a routine precaution dieter sank into gloom he had gambled and lost weber would be overjoyed what do we do now said hans go back to sainteccile they returned to the van put the moped in the back and drove to headquarters dieter had just one ray of hope he knew helicopters times for radio contact and the frequencies assigned to him that information might yet be used to recapture him the gestapo had a sophisticated system developed and refined throughout the war for detecting illicit broadcasts and following them to their source many allied agents had been captured that way as british training improved so the wireless operators had adopted better security precautions always broadcasting from a different location never staying on air longer than fifteen minutes but careless ones could still be caught would the british suspect that helicopter had been found out helicopter would by now be giving michel a full account of his adventures michel would question him closely about the arrest in the cathedral and subsequent escape he would be particularly interested in the newcomer codenamed charenton however he would have no reason to suspect that mademoiselle lemas was not who she claimed to be michel had never met her so he would not be alerted even if helicopter happened to mention that she was an attractive young redhead rather than a middleaged spinster and helicopter had no idea that his onetime pad and his silk handkerchief had been meticulously copied out by stephanie or that his frequencies had been notedfrom the yellow wax crayon marks on the dialsby dieter perhaps dieter began to think all was not yet lost when they got back to the chfteau dieter ran into weber in the hallway weber looked hard at him and said have you lost him jackals can smell blood dieter thought yes he admitted it was beneath his dignity to lie to weber ha weber was triumphant you should leave such work to the experts very well then i shall dieter said weber looked surprised dieter went on hes due to broadcast to england at eight oclock tonight heres your chance to prove your expertise show how good you are track him down chapter the fishermans rest was a big pub that stood on the estuary shore like a fort with chimneys for gun turrets and smokedglass windows instead of observation slits a fading sign in its front garden warned customers to stay off the beach which had been mined back in in anticipation of a german invasion since soe had moved into the neighborhood the pub had been busy every night its lights blazing behind the blackout curtains its piano loud its bars crowded and spilling over into the garden on warm summer evenings the singing was raucous the drinking was heavy and the canoodling was kept only just within the bounds of decency an atmosphere of abandon prevailed for everyone knew that some of the youngsters who were laughing uproariously at the bar tonight would embark tomorrow on missions from which they might never return flick and paul took their team to the pub at the end of their twoday training course the girls dressed up for the outing maude was prettier than ever in a pink summer frock ruby would never be pretty but she looked sultry in a black cocktail dress she had borrowed from somewhere lady denise had on an oystercolored silk dress that looked as if it had cost a fortune though it did nothing for her bony figure greta wore one of her stage outfits a cocktail dress and red shoes even diana was wearing a smart skirt instead of her usual country corduroys and to flicks astonishment had put on a smear of lipstick the team had been given the code name jackdaws they were going to parachute in near reims and flick remembered the legend of the jackdaw of reims the bird that stole the bishops ring the monks couldnt figure out who had taken it so the bishop cursed the unknown thief she explained to paul as they both sipped scotch hers with water and his on the rocks next thing they knew the jackdaw appeared all bedraggled and they realized he was suffering from the effects of the curse and must be the culprit i learned the whole thing at school the day was gone the night came on the monks and the friars they searched till dawn when the sacristan saw on crumpled claw come limping a poor little lame jackdaw no longer gay as on yesterday his feathers all seemed to be turned the wrong way his pinions drooped he could hardly stand his head was as bald as the palm of your hand his eye so dim so wasted each limb that heedless of grammar they all cried thats him sure enough they found the ring in his nest paul nodded smiling flick knew he would have nodded and smiled in exactly the same way if she had been speaking icelandic he did not care what she said he just wanted to watch her she did not have vast experience but she could tell when a man was in love and paul was in love with her she had got through the day on autopilot last nights kisses had shocked and thrilled her she told herself that she did not want to have an illicit affair she wanted to win back the love of her faithless husband but pauls passion had upended her priorities she asked herself angrily why she should stand in line for michels affections when a man such as paul was ready to throw himself at her feet she had very nearly let him into her bedin fact she wished he had been less of a gentleman for if he had ignored her refusal and climbed between the sheets she might have given in at other moments she was ashamed that she had even kissed him it was frightfully common all over england girls were forgetting about husbands and boyfriends on the front line and falling in love with visiting american servicemen was she as bad as those emptyheaded shop assistants who went to bed with their yanks just because they talked like movie stars worst of all her feelings for paul threatened to distract her from the job she held in her hands the lives of six people plus a crucial element in the invasion plan and she really did not need to be thinking about whether his eyes were hazel or green he was no matinee idol anyway with his big chin and his shotoff ear although there was a certain charm to his face what are you thinking he said she realized she must have been staring at him wondering whether we can pull this off she lied we can with a little luck ive been lucky so far maude sat herself next to paul speaking of luck she said batting her eyelashes can i have one of your cigarettes help yourself he pushed the lucky strike pack along the table she put a cigarette between her lips and he lit it flick glanced across to the bar and caught an irritated look from diana maude and diana had become great friends and diana had never been good at sharing so why was maude flirting with paul to annoy diana perhaps it was a good thing paul was not coming to france flick thought he could not help being a disruptive influence in a group of young women she looked around the room jelly and percy were playing a gambling game called spoof which involved guessing how many coins the other player held in a closed fist percy was buying round after round of drinks this was deliberate flick needed to know what the jackdaws were like under the influence of booze if any of them became rowdy indiscreet or aggressive she would have to take precautions once they were in the field she was most worried about denise who even now was sitting in a corner talking animatedly to a man in captains uniform ruby was drinking steadily too but flick trusted her she was a curious mixture she could barely read or write and had been hopeless in classes on map reading and encryption but nevertheless she was the brightest and most intuitive of the group ruby gave greta a hard look now and again and she may have guessed that greta was a man but to her credit she had said nothing ruby was sitting at the bar with jim cardwell the firearms instructor talking to the barmaid but at the same time discreetly stroking the inside of jims thigh with a small brown hand they were having a whirlwind romance they kept disappearing during the morning coffee break the halfhour rest period after lunch the afternoon tea time or at any opportunity they would sneak off for a few minutes jim looked as if he had jumped out of a plane and had not yet opened his parachute his face wore a permanent expression of bemused delight ruby was no beauty with her hooked nose and turnedup chin but she was obviously a sex bomb and jim was reeling from the explosion flick almost felt jealous not that jim was her typeall the men she had ever fallen for were intellectuals or at least very brightbut she envied rubys lustful happiness greta was leaning on the piano with some pink cocktail in her hand talking to three men who looked to be local residents rather than finishing school types it seemed they had got over the shock of her german accentno doubt she had told the story of her liverpudlian fatherand now she held them enthralled with tales about hamburg nightclubs flick could see they had no suspicions about gretas gender they were treating her like an exotic but attractive woman buying her drinks and lighting her cigarettes and laughing in a pleased way when she touched them as flick watched one of the men sat at the piano played some chords and looked up at greta expectantly the bar went quiet and greta launched into kitchen man how that boy can open clams no one else can touch my hams the audience quickly realized that every line was a sexual innuendo and the laughter was uproarious when greta finished she kissed the pianist on the lips and he looked thrilled maude left paul and returned to diana at the bar the captain who had been talking to denise now came over and said to paul she told me everything sir flick nodded disappointed but not surprised paul asked him what did she say that shes going in tomorrow night to blow up a railway tunnel at marles near reims it was the cover story but denise thought it was the truth and she had revealed it to a stranger flick was furious thank you paul said im sorry the captain shrugged flick said better to find out now than later do you want to tell her sir or shall i deal with it ill talk to her first paul replied just wait outside for her if you wouldnt mind yes sir the captain left the pub and paul beckoned denise he left suddenly denise said rather bad behavior i thought she obviously felt slighted hes an explosives instructor no hes not paul said hes a policeman what do you mean denise was mystified hes wearing a captains uniform and he told me he told you lies paul said his job is to catch people who blab to strangers and he caught you denises jaw dropped then she recovered her composure and became indignant so it was a trick you tried to trap me i succeeded unfortunately paul said you told him everything realizing she was found out denise tried to make light of it whats my punishment a hundred lines and no playtime flick wanted to slap her face denises boasting could have endangered the lives of the whole team paul said coldly theres no punishment as such oh thank you so much but youre off the team you wont be coming with us youll be leaving tonight with the captain i shall feel rather foolish going back to my old job at hendon paul shook his head hes not taking you to hendon why not you know too much you cant be allowed to walk around free denise began to look worried what are you going to do to me youll be posted to some place where you cant do any damage i believe its usually an isolated base in scotland where their main function is to file regimental accounts thats as bad as prison paul reflected for a moment then nodded almost for how long denise said in dismay who knows until the war is over probably you absolute rotter denise said furiously i wish id never met you you may leave now said paul and be grateful i caught you otherwise it might have been the gestapo denise stalked out paul said i hope that wasnt unnecessarily cruel flick did not think so the silly cow deserved a lot worse however she wanted to make a good impression on paul so she said no point in crushing her some people just arent suited to this work its not her fault paul smiled youre a rotten liar he said you think i was too easy on her dont you i think crucifixion would be too easy on her flick said angrily but paul laughed and his humor softened her wrath until she had to smile i cant pull the wool over your eyes can i i hope not he became serious again its fortunate that we had one team member more than we really needed we could afford to lose denise but now were down to the bare minimum flick stood up wearily wed better get the rest to bed this will be their last decent nights sleep for a while paul looked around the room i dont see diana and maude they must have stepped out for a breath of air ill find them if youll round up the rest paul nodded agreement and flick went outside there was no sign of the two girls she paused for a moment to look at the evening light glowing on the calm water of the estuary then she walked around the side of the pub to the parking lot a tancolored army austin was pulling away and flick glimpsed denise in the back crying there was no sign of diana or maude frowning puzzled flick crossed the tarmac and went to the back of the pub she came to a yard with old barrels and stacked crates across the yard was a small outbuilding with a wooden door that stood open she went in at first she could see nothing in the gloom but she knew she was not alone for she could hear breathing instinct told her to remain silent and still her eyes adjusted to the dim light she was in a tool shed with neat rows of wrenches and shovels on hooks and a big lawn mower in the middle of the floor diana and maude were in a far corner maude was leaning against the wall and diana was kissing her flicks jaw dropped dianas blouse was undone revealing a large severely practical brassiere maudes pink gingham skirt was rucked up around her waist as the picture became clearer she saw that dianas hand was thrust down the front of maudes panties flick stood there for a moment frozen with shock maude saw her and met her eye have you had a good look she said saucily or do you want to take a photo diana jumped snatching her hand away and stepping back from maude she turned around and a look of horror came over her face oh my god she said she pulled the front of her blouse together with one hand and covered her mouth with the other in a gesture of shame flick stammered iii just came to say were leaving then she turned around and stumbled out chapter wireless operators were not quite invisible they lived in a spirit world where their ghostly shapes could be dimly seen peering into the gloom searching for them were the men of the gestapos radio detection team housed in a cavernous darkened hall in paris dieter had visited the place three hundred round oscilloscope screens flickered with a greenish light radio broadcasts appeared as vertical lines on the monitors the position of the line showing the frequency of the transmission the height indicating the strength of the signal the screens were tended day and night by silent watchful operators who made him think of angels observing the sins of humankind the operators knew the regular stations either germancontrolled or foreignbased and were able to spot a rogue instantly as soon as this happened the operator would pick up a telephone at his desk and call three tracking stations two in southern germany at augsburg and nuremberg and one in brittany at brest he would give them the frequency of the rogue broadcast the tracking stations were equipped with goniometers apparatus for measuring angles and each could say within seconds which direction the broadcast was coming from they would send this information back to paris where the operator would draw three lines on a huge wall map the lines intersected where the suspect radio was located the operator then telephoned the gestapo office nearest to the location the local gestapo had cars waiting in readiness equipped with their own detection apparatus dieter was now sitting in such a car a long black citron parked on the outskirts of reims with him were three gestapo men experienced in wireless detection tonight the help of the paris center was not required dieter already knew the frequency helicopter would use and he assumed helicopter would broadcast from somewhere in the city because it was too difficult for a wireless operator to lose himself in the countryside the cars receiver was tuned to helicopters frequency it measured the strength as well as the direction of the broadcast and dieter would know he was getting nearer to the transmitter when the needle rose on the dial in addition the gestapo man sitting next to dieter wore a receiver and an aerial concealed beneath his raincoat on his wrist was a meter like a watch that showed the strength of the signal when the search narrowed down to a particular street city block or building the walker would take over the gestapo man in the front seat held on his lap a sledgehammer for breaking doors down dieter had been hunting once he did not much like country pursuits preferring the more refined pleasures of city life but he was a good shot now he was reminded of that as he waited for helicopter to begin sending his coded report home to england this was like lying in the hide in the early dawn tense with anticipation impatient for the deer to start moving savoring the thrill of anticipation the resistance were not deer but foxes dieter thought skulking in their holes coming out to cause carnage in the chicken house then going to earth again he was mortified to have lost helicopter he was so keen to recapture the man that he hardly minded having to rely on the help of willi weber he just wanted to kill the fox the driver immediately turned west and the signal began to strengthen got you dieter breathed but five minutes had elapsed the car raced west and the signal strengthened as helicopter continued to tap on the morse key of his suitcase radio in his hiding placea bathroom an attic a warehousesomewhere in the northwest of the city back at the chfteau of sainteccile a german radio operator had tuned to the same frequency and was taking down the coded message it was also being registered on a wire recorder later dieter would decrypt it using the onetime pad copied by stephanie but the message was not as important as the messenger they entered a neighborhood of large old houses mostly decrepit and subdivided into small apartments and bed sitting rooms for students and nurses the signal grew louder then suddenly began to fade overshoot overshoot said the gestapo man in the front passenger seat the driver reversed the car then braked ten minutes had passed dieter and the three gestapo men sprang out the one with the portable detection unit under his raincoat walked rapidly along the pavement consulting his wrist dial constantly and the others it was a fine summer evening the car was parked at the northern end of the city reims was a small town and dieter reckoned a car could drive from one side to the other in less than ten minutes he checked his watch one minute past eight helicopter was late coming on air perhaps he would not broadcast tonight but that was unlikely today helicopter had met up with michel as soon as possible he would want to report his success to his superiors and tell them just how much was left of the bollinger circuit michel had phoned the house in the rue du bois two hours ago dieter had been there it was a tense moment stephanie had answered in her imitation of mademoiselle lemass voice michel had given his code name and asked whether bourgeoise remembered hima question that reassured stephanie because it indicated that michel did not know mademoiselle lemas very well and therefore would not realize this was an impersonator he had asked her about her new recruit codenamed charenton hes my cousin stephanie had said gruffly ive known him since we were children i would trust him with my life michel had told her she had no right to recruit people without at least discussing it with him but he had appeared to believe her story and dieter had kissed stephanie and told her she was a good enough actor to join the comdie franaise all the same helicopter would know that the gestapo would be listening and trying to find him that was a risk he had to run if he sent no messages home he was of no use he would stay on air only for the minimum length of time if he had a lot of information to send he would break it into two or more messages and send them from different locations dieters only hope was that he would be tempted to stay on the air just a little too long the minutes ticked by there was silence in the car the men smoked nervously then at five past eight the receiver beeped by prearrangement the driver set off immediately driving south the signal grew stronger but slowly making dieter worry that they were not heading directly for the source sure enough as they passed the cathedral in the center of town the needle fell back in the passenger seat a gestapo man talked into a shortwave radio he was consulting with someone in a radiodetection truck a mile away after a moment he said northwest quarter followed he went a hundred meters then suddenly turned back he stopped and pointed to a house that one he said but the transmission has ended dieter noticed that there were no curtains in the windows the resistance liked to use derelict houses for their transmissions the gestapo man carrying the sledgehammer broke the door down with two blows they all rushed in the floors were bare and the place had a musty smell dieter threw open a door and looked into an empty room dieter opened the door of the back room he crossed the vacant room in three strides and looked into an abandoned kitchen he ran up the stairs on the next floor was a window overlooking a long back garden dieter glanced outand saw helicopter and michel running across the grass michel was limping helicopter was carrying his little suitcase dieter swore they must have escaped through a back door as the gestapo were breaking down the front dieter turned and yelled back garden the gestapo men ran and he followed as he reached the garden he saw michel and helicopter scrambling over the back fence into the grounds of another house he joined in the chase but the fugitives had a long lead with the three gestapo men he climbed the fence and ran through the second garden they reached the next street just in time to see a black renault monaquatre disappearing around the corner hell dieter said for the second time in a day helicopter had slipped through his grasp chapter when they cot back to the house flick made cocoa for the team it was not regular practice for officers to make cocoa for their troops but in flicks opinion that only showed how little the army knew about leadership paul stood in the kitchen watching her as she waited for the kettle to boil she felt his eyes on her like a caress she knew what he was going to say and she had prepared her reply it would have been easy to fall in love with paul but she was not going to betray the husband who was risking his life fighting the nazis in occupied france however his question surprised her what will you do after the war im looking forward to being bored she said he laughed youve had enough excitement too much she thought for a moment i still want to be a teacher id like to share my love of french culture with young people educate them about french literature and painting and also about less highbrow things like cooking and fashion so youll become a don finish my doctorate get a job at a university be condescended to by narrowminded old male professors maybe write a guide book to france or even a cookbook sounds tame after this its important though the more young people know about foreigners the less likely they are to be as stupid as we were and go to war with their neighbors i wonder if thats right what about you whats your plan for after the war oh mine is real simple i want to marry you and take you to paris for a honeymoon then well settle down and have children she stared at him were you thinking of asking my consent she said indignantly he was quite solemn i havent thought of anything else for days i already have a husband but you dont love him you have no right to say that i know but i cant help it why did i used to think you were a smooth talker usually i am that kettles boiling she took the kettle off the hob and poured boiling water over the cocoa mixture in a big stoneware jug put some mugs on a tray she told paul a little housework might cure you of dreams of domesticity he complied you cant put me off by being bossy he said i kind of like it she added milk and sugar to the cocoa and poured it into the mugs he had laid out in that case carry that tray into the living room right away boss when they entered the living room they found jelly and greta having a row standing face to face in the middle of the room while the others looked on half amused and half horrified jelly was saying you werent using it i was resting my feet on it greta replied there arent enough chairs jelly was holding a small stuffed pouffe and flick guessed she had snatched it away from greta rudely flick said ladies please they ignored her greta said you only had to ask sweetheart i dont have to ask permission from foreigners in my own country im not a foreigner you fat bitch oh jelly was so stung by the insult that she reached out and pulled gretas hair gretas brunette wig came off in her hand with her head of closecropped dark hair exposed greta suddenly looked unmistakably like a man percy and paul were in on the secret and ruby had guessed but maude and diana were shocked rigid diana said good god and maude gave a little scream of fright jelly was the first to recover her wits a pervert she said triumphantly oh my gordon its a foreign pervert greta was in tears you bloody fucking nazi she sobbed i bet shes a spy jelly said flick said shut up jelly shes not a spy i knew she was a man you knew so did paul so did percy jelly looked at percy who nodded solemnly greta turned to leave but flick caught her arm dont go she said please sit down greta sat down jelly give me the damn wig jelly handed it to flick flick stood in front of greta and put the wig back on ruby quickly understanding what flick was trying to do lifted the mirror from over the mantelpiece and held it in front of greta who studied her reflection while she adjusted the wig and blotted her tears with a handkerchief now listen to me all of you said flick greta is an engineer and we cant accomplish our mission without an engineer we have a much better chance of survival in occupied territory as an allwoman team the upshot is we need greta and we need her to be a woman so get used to it jelly gave a contemptuous grunt theres something else i ought to explain flick said she looked hard at jelly you may have noticed that denise is no longer with us a little test was set for her tonight and she failed it shes off the team unfortunately shes learned some secrets in the last two days and she cant be allowed to return to her old posting so shes gone to a remote base in scotland where shell stay probably for the rest of the war with no leave jelly said you cant do that of course i can you idiot flick said impatiently theres a war on remember and what ive done to denise ill do to anyone who has to be fired from this team i never even joined the army jelly protested yes you did you were commissioned as an officer yesterday after tea you all were and youre getting officers pay although you havent seen any yet that means youre under military discipline and you all know too much so were prisoners diana said youre in the army flick said its much the same thing so drink your cocoa and go to bed they drifted off one by one until only diana was left flick had been expecting this seeing the two women in a sexual clinch had been a real shock she recalled that at school some of the girls had developed crushes on one another sending loving notes holding hands and sometimes even kissing but as far as she knew it had not gone any further at some point she and diana had practiced french kissing on one another so that they would know what to do when they got boyfriends and now flick guessed those kisses had meant more to diana than they had to her but she had never known a grown woman who desired other women theoretically she was aware that they existed the female equivalents of her brother mark and of greta but she had never really imagined them well feeling each other up in a garden shed did it matter not in everyday life mark and his kind were happy or at least they were when people left them alone but would dianas relationship with maude affect the mission not necessarily flick herself worked with her husband in the resistance after all this was not quite the same admittedly a passionate new romance might prove a distraction flick could try to keep the two lovers separatebut that might make diana even more insubordinate and the affair could just as easily be an inspiration flick had been trying desperately to get the women to work together as a team and this might help she had decided to leave well enough alone but diana wanted to talk its not what it seems really it isnt diana said without preamble christ youve got to believe me it was just a stupid thing a joke would you like more cocoa flick said i think theres some left in the jug diana stared at her nonplussed after a moment she said how can you talk about cocoa i just want you to calm down and realize that the world is not going to come to an end simply because you kissed maude you kissed me onceremember i knew youd bring that up but that was just kid stuff with maude it wasnt just a kiss diana sat down her proud face crumpled and she began to cry you know it was more than that you could see oh god the things i did what on earth did you think flick chose her words carefully i thought the two of you looked very sweet sweet diana was incredulous you werent disgusted certainly not maude is a pretty girl and you appear to have fallen in love with her thats exactly what happened so stop being ashamed how can i not be ashamed im queer i wouldnt look at it that way if i were you you ought to be discreet to avoid offending narrowminded people such as jelly but theres no need for shame will i always be like this flick considered the answer was probably yes but she did not want to be brutal look she said i think some people like maude just love to be loved and they can be made happy by a man or a woman in truth maude was shallow selfish and tarty but flick suppressed that thought firmly others are more inflexible she went on you should keep an open mind i suppose thats the end of the mission for me and maude it most certainly is not youll still take us i still need you and i dont see why this should make any difference diana took out a handkerchief and blew her nose flick got up and went to the window giving her time to recover her composure after a minute diana spoke in a calmer voice youre frightfully kind she said with a touch of her old hauteur go to bed flick said diana got up obediently and if i were you what id go to bed with maude diana looked shocked flick shrugged it may be your last chance she said thank you diana whispered she stepped toward flick and spread her arms as if to hug her then she stopped you may not want me to kiss you she said dont be silly flick said and embraced her goodnight said diana she left the room flick turned and looked out at the garden the moon was threequarters full in a few days time it would be full and the allies would invade france a wind was disturbing the new leaves in the forest the weather was going to change she hoped there would not be a storm in the english channel the entire invasion plan could be ruined by the capricious british climate she guessed a lot of people were praying for good weather she ought to get some sleep she left the room and climbed the stairs she thought of what she had said to diana id go to bed with maude it may be your last chance she hesitated outside pauls door it was different for dianashe was single flick was married but it might be her last chance she knocked at the door and stepped inside chapter sunk in gloom dieter returned to the chfteau at sainteccile in the citron with the radio detection team he went to the wireless listening room in the bombproofed basement willi weber was there looking angry the one consolation from tonights fiasco dieter thought was that weber was not able to crow that he had succeeded where dieter had failed but dieter could have put up with all the triumphalism weber could muster in return for having helicopter in the torture chamber you have the message he sent dieter asked weber handed him a carbon copy of the typed message it has already been sent to the cryptanalysis office in berlin dieter looked at the meaningless strings of letters they wont be able to decode it hes using a onetime pad he folded the sheet and slipped it into his pocket what can you do with it weber said i have a copy of his code book dieter said it was a petty victory but he felt better weber swallowed the message may tell us where he is yes hes scheduled to receive a reply at eleven pm he looked at his watch it was a few minutes before eleven lets record that and i will decrypt the two together weber left dieter waited in the windowless room on the dot of eleven a receiver tuned to helicopters listening frequency began to chatter with the longandshort beeps of morse an operator wrote the letters down while at the same time a wire recorder ran when the chattering stopped the operator pulled a typewriter toward him and typed out what he had on his notepad he gave dieter a carbon copy the two messages could be everything or nothing dieter thought as he got behind the wheel of his own car the moon was bright as he followed the twisting road through the vineyards to reims and parked in the rue du bois it was good weather for an invasion stephanie was waiting for him in the kitchen of mademoiselle lemass house he put the coded messages on the table and took out the copies stephanie had made of the pad and the silk handkerchief he rubbed his eyes and began to decode the first message the one helicopter had sent writing the decrypt on the scratch pad mademoiselle lemas had used to make her shopping lists stephanie brewed a pot of coffee she looked over his shoulder for a while asked a couple of questions then took the second message and began to decode it herself dieters decrypt gave a concise account of the incident at the cathedral naming dieter as charenton and saying he had been recruited by bourgeoise mademoiselle lemas because she was worried about the security of the rendezvous it said monet michel had taken the unusual step of phoning bourgeoise to confirm that charenton was trustworthy and he was satisfied it listed the code names of those members of the bollinger circuit who had not fallen in the battle last sunday and were still active there were only four it was useful but it did not tell him where to find the spies he drank a cup of coffee while he waited for stephanie to finish she handed him a sheet of paper covered with her flamboyant handwriting when he read it he could hardly believe his luck it said prepare receive group of six number parachutists codenamed jackdaws leader leopardess arriving eleven pip emma friday second june champ de pierre my god he whispered champ de pierre was a code name but dieter knew what it meant for gaston had told him during the very first interrogation it was a drop zone in a pasture outside chatelle a small village five miles from reims dieter now knew exactly where helicopter and michel would be tomorrow night and could pick them up he could also capture six more allied agents as they parachuted to earth and one of them was leopardess flick clairet the woman who knew more than anyone else about the french resistance the woman who under torture would give him the information he needed to break the back of the resistancejust in time to stop them aiding the invasion force jesus christ almighty dieter said what a break the sixth day friday june chapter paul and flick were talking they lay side by side on his bed the lights were off but the moon shone through the window he was naked as he had been when she entered the room he always slept naked he wore pajamas only to walk along the corridor to the bathroom he had been asleep when she came in but he had wakened fast and leaped out of bed his unconscious mind assuming that a clandestine visit in the night must mean the gestapo he had had his hands around her throat before he realized who it was he was astonished thrilled and grateful he had closed the door then kissed her standing there for a long time he was unprepared and it felt like a dream he was afraid he might wake up she had caressed him feeling his shoulders and his back and his chest her hands were soft but her touch was firm exploring you have a lot of hair she had whispered like an ape but not as handsome she teased he looked at her lips delighting in the way they moved when she spoke thinking that in a moment he would touch them with his own and it would be lovely he smiled lets lie down they lay on the bed facing one another but she did not take off any clothes not even her shoes he found it strangely exciting to be naked with a woman who was fully dressed he enjoyed it so much that he was in no hurry to move to the next base he wanted this moment to last forever tell me something she said in a lazy sensual voice what anything i feel i dont know you what was this he had never had a girl behave like this she came to his room in the night she lay on his bed but kept her clothes on then she questioned him is that why you came he said lightly watching her face to interrogate me she laughed softly dont worry i want to make love to you but not in a hurry tell me about your first lover he stroked her cheek with light fingertips tracing the curve of her jaw he did not know what she wanted where she was going she had thrown him off balance can we touch while we talk yes he kissed her lips and kiss too yes then i think we should talk for just a little while maybe a year or two what was her name flick was not as confident as she pretended to be he decided in fact she was nervous and that was the reason for the questions if it made her comfortable he would answer her name was linda we were terribly youngim embarrassed at how young we were the first time i kissed her she was twelve and i was fourteen can you imagine of course i can she giggled and for an instant she was a girl again i used to kiss boys when i was twelve we always had to pretend we were going out with a bunch of friends and usually we started the evening that way but pretty soon we would peel off from the crowd and go to a movie or something we did that for a couple of years before we had real sex where was this in america paris my father was military attach at the embassy lindas parents owned a hotel that catered specially for american visitors we used to run with a whole crowd of expatriate kids where did you make love in the hotel we had it easy there were always empty rooms what was it like the first time did you use any you know precautions she stole one of her fathers rubbers flicks fingertips traced a course down his belly he closed his eyes she said who put it on she did it was very exciting i nearly came right then and if youre not careful she moved her hand to his hip id like to have known you when you were sixteen he opened his eyes he no longer wanted to make this moment last forever in fact he found he was in a great hurry to move on would you his mouth was dry and he swallowed would you like to take off some clothes yes but speaking of precautions in my billfold on the bedside table good she sat upright and unlaced her shoes throwing them on the floor she stood up and unbuttoned her blouse she was tense he could see so he said take your time we have all night it was a couple of years since paul had watched a woman undress he had been living on a diet of pinups and they always wore elaborate confections of silk and lace corsets and garter belts and transparent negligees flick was wearing a loose cotton chemise not a brassiere and he guessed that the small neat breasts he could see tantalizingly outlined beneath it did not need support she dropped her skirt her panties were plain white cotton with frills around the legs her body was tiny but muscular she looked like a schoolgirl getting changed for hockey practice but he found that more exciting than a pinup she lay down again is that better she said he stroked her hip feeling the warm skin then the soft cotton then skin again she was not yet ready he could tell he forced himself to be patient and let her set the pace you havent told me about your first time he said to his surprise she blushed it wasnt as nice as yours in what way it was a horrible place a dusty storeroom he felt indignant what kind of idiot could take a girl as special as flick and submit her to a furtive quickie in a cupboard how old were you twentytwo he had expected her to say seventeen jeepers at that age you deserve a comfortable bed that wasnt it though she was relaxing again paul could tell he encouraged her to talk some more so what was wrong probably that i didnt really want to do it i was talked into it didnt you love the guy yes i did but i wasnt ready what was his name i dont want to tell you paul guessed it was her husband michel and decided not to question her any more he kissed her and said may i touch your breasts you can touch anything you like no one had ever said that to him he found her openness startling and exciting he began to explore her body in his experience most women closed their eyes at this point but she kept hers open studying his face with a mixture of desire and curiosity that inflamed him more it was as if by watching him she was exploring him instead of the other way around his hands discovered the pert shape of her breasts and his fingertips got to know her shy nipples learning what they liked he took off her panties she had curly hair the color of honey lots of it and under the hair on the left side a birthmark like a splash of tea he bent his head and kissed her there his lips feeling the crisp brush of her hair his tongue tasting her moisture he sensed her yielding to pleasure her nervousness vanished her arms and legs spread out in a star shape slack abandoned but her hips strained toward him eagerly he explored the folds of her sex with slow delight her movements became more urgent she pushed his head away her face was flushed and she was breathing hard she reached across to the bedside table opened his billfold and found the rubbers three of them in a small paper packet she ripped the pack with fumbling fingers took one out and put it on him then she straddled him as he lay on his back she bent to kiss him and said into his ear oh boy you feel so good inside me then she sat upright and began to move take off your chemise he said she pulled it over her head he watched her above him her lovely face drawn into an expression of fierce concentration her pretty breasts moving delightfully he felt like the luckiest man in the world he wanted this to go on forever no dawn no tomorrow no plane no parachute no war in all of life he thought there was nothing better than love w h e n i t wa s over flicks first thought was what will i say to michel she did not feel unhappy she was full of love and desire for paul in a short time she had come to feel more intimate with him than she ever had with michel she wanted to make love to him every day for the rest of her life that was the trouble her marriage was over and she would have to tell michel as soon as she saw him she could not pretend even for a few minutes to feel the same about him michel was the only man she had been intimate with before paul she would have told paul that but she felt disloyal talking about michel it seemed more of a betrayal than simple adultery one day she would tell paul he was only her second lover and she might say he was her best but she would never talk to him about how sex was with michel however it was not just sex that was different with paul it was herself she had never asked michel the way she had questioned paul about his early sexual experiences she had never said to him you can touch anything you like she had never put a rubber on him or climbed on top of him to make love or told him he felt good inside her when she had lain down on the bed beside paul another personality had seemed to come out of her just as a transformation had come over mark when he walked into the crisscross club she suddenly felt she could say anything she liked do anything that took her fancy be herself without worrying what would be thought of her it had never been like that with michel beginning as his student wanting to impress him she had never really got on an even footing with him she had continued to seek his approval something he had never done with her in bed she tried to please him not herself after a while paul said what are you thinking about my marriage she said what about it she wondered how much to confess he had said earlier in the evening that he wanted to marry her but that was before she came to his bedroom men never married girls who slept with them first according to female folklore it was not always true flick knew from her own experience with michel but all the same she decided to tell paul half the truth that its over a drastic decision she raised herself on her elbow and looked at him does that bother you on the contrary i hope it means we might see each other again do you mean that he put his arms around her im scared to tell you how much i mean it scared of frightening you off i said a foolish thing earlier about marrying me and having children i meant it but i said it in an arrogant way thats okay she said when people are perfectly polite it usually means they dont really care a little awkwardness is more sincere i guess youre right i never thought of that she stroked his face she could see the bristles of his beard and she realized the dawn light was strengthening she forced herself not to look at her watch she did not want to keep checking how much time they had left she ran her hand over his face mapping his features with her fingertips the bushy eyebrows the deep eye sockets the big nose the shotoff ear the sensual lips the lantern jaw do you have hot water she said suddenly yes its a swanky room theres a basin in the corner she got up he said what are you doing stay there she padded across the floor in her bare feet feeling his eyes on her naked body wishing she were not quite so broad across the hips on a shelf over the sink was a mug containing toothpaste and a wooden toothbrush that she recognized as french next to the glass were a safety razor a brush and a bowl of shaving soap she ran the hot tap dipped the shaving brush in it and worked up a lather in his soap bowl come on he said what is this im going to shave you why youll see she covered his face with lather then got his safety razor and filled the tooth mug with hot water she straddled him the way she had when they made love and shaved his face with careful tender strokes how did you learn to do this he asked dont speak she said i watched my mother do it for my father many times dad was a drunk and toward the end he couldnt hold the razor steady so ma had to shave him every day lift your chin he did so obediently and she shaved the sensitive skin of his throat when she had finished she soaked a flannel in hot water and wiped his face with it then patted him dry with a clean towel i should put on some face cream but i bet youre too masculine to use it it never occurred to me that i should never mind what next do you remember what you were doing to me just before i reached for your wallet yes did you wonder why i didnt let you go on longer i thought you were impatient for intercourse no your bristles were scratching my thighs right where the skin is most tender oh im sorry well you can make it up to me he frowned how she groaned with mock frustration come on einstein now that your bristles have gone ohi see is that why you shaved me yes of course it is you want me to she lay on her back smiling and parted her legs is this enough of a hint he laughed i guess it is he said and he bent over her she closed her eyes chapter the old ballroom was in the bombed west wing of the chfteau at saintececile the room was only partly damaged one end was a pile of debris square stones and carved pediments and chunks of painted wall in a dusty heap but the other remained intact the effect was picturesque dieter thought with the morning sun shining through a great hole in the ceiling onto a row of broken pillars like a victorian painting of classical ruins dieter had decided to hold his briefing in the ballroom the alternative was to meet in webers office and dieter did not want to give the men the impression that will was in charge there was a small dais presumably intended for the orchestra on which he had placed a blackboard the men had brought chairs from other parts of the building and had placed them in front of the dais in four neat rows of fivevery german dieter thought with a secret smile french men would have scattered the chairs any which way weber who had assembled the team sat on the dais facing the men to emphasize that he was one of the commanders not subordinate to dieter the presence of two commanders equal in rank and hostile to one another was the greatest threat to the operation dieter thought on the blackboard he had chalked a neat map of the village of chatelle it consisted of three large housespresumably farms or wineriesplus six cottages and a bakery the buildings were clustered around a crossroads with vineyards to the north west and south and to the east a large cow pasture a kilometer long bordered by a broad pond dieter guessed that the field was used for grazing because the ground was too wet for grapes the parachutists will aim to land in the pasture dieter said it must be a regular landingandtakeoff field its level plenty big enough for a lysander and long enough even for a hudson the pond next to it would be a useful landmark visible from the air there is a cowshed at the southern end of the field where the reception committee probably take shelter while they are waiting for the plane he paused the most important thing for everyone here to remember is that we want these parachutists to land we must avoid any action that might betray our presence to the reception committee or the pilot we have to be silent and invisible if the plane turns around and returns home with the agents on board we will have lost a golden opportunity one of the parachutists is a woman who can give us information on most of the resistance circuits in northern franceif only we can get our hands on her weber spoke mainly to remind them that he was here allow me to underline what major franck has said take no risks do nothing ostentatious stick to the plan thank you major dieter said lieutenant hesse has divided you into twoman teams designated a through l each building on the map is marked with a team letter we will arrive at the village at twenty hundred hours very swiftly we will enter every building all the residents will be brought to the largest of the three big houses known as la maison grandin and held there until it is all over one of the men raised a hand weber barked schuller you may speak sir what if the resistance people call at a house they will find it empty and they may become suspicious dieter nodded good question but i dont think they will my guess is the reception committee are strangers here they dont usually have agents parachute in near where sympathizers liveits an unnecessary security risk im betting they arrive after dark and go straight to the cowshed without bothering the villagers weber spoke again this would be normal resistance procedure he said with the air of a doctor giving a diagnosis la maison grandin will be our headquarters dieter continued major weber will be in command there this was his scheme for keeping weber away from the real action the prisoners will be locked away in some convenient place ideally a cellar they must be kept quiet so that we can hear the vehicle in which the reception committee arrive and later the plane weber said any prisoner who persistently makes noise may be shot dieter continued as soon as the villagers have been incarcerated teams a b c and d will take up concealed positions on the roads leading into the village if any vehicles or personnel enter the village you will report by shortwave radio but you will do nothing more at this point you will not prevent people entering the village and you will not do anything that might betray your presence looking around the room dieter wondered pessimistically whether the gestapo men had brains enough to follow these orders the enemy needs transport for six parachutists plus the reception committee so they will arrive in a truck or bus or possibly several cars i believe they will enter the pasture by this gatethe ground is quite dry at this time of year so there is no danger of cars becoming bogged downand park between the gate and the cowshed just here he pointed to the spot on the map teams e f g and h will be in this cluster of trees beside the pond each equipped with a large battery searchlight teams i and j will remain at la maison grandin to guard the prisoners and maintain the command post with major weber dieter did not want weber at the scene of the arrest teams k and l will be with me behind this hedge near the cowshed hans had found out which of the men were the best shots and assigned them to work with dieter i will be in radio contact with all teams and will be in command in the pasture when we hear the planewe do nothing when we see the parachutistswe do nothing we will watch the parachutists land and wait for the reception committee to round them up and assemble them near where the vehicles are parked dieter raised his voice mainly for the benefit of weber not until this process has been completed will we arrest anyone the men would not jump the gun unless a skittish officer told them to when we are ready i will give the signal from this moment on until the order to stand down is given teams a b c and d will arrest anyone attempting to enter or leave the village teams e f g and h will switch on their searchlights and turn them on the enemy teams k and l will approach them with me and arrest them no one is to fire on the enemyis that clear schuller obviously the thinker among the group raised his hand again what if they fire on us do not return their fire these people are useless to us dead lie flat and keep the lights trained on them only teams e and f are permitted to use their weapons and they have orders to shoot to wound we want to interrogate these parachutists not kill them the phone in the room rang and hans hesse picked it up its for you he said to dieter rommels headquarters the timing was lucky dieter thought as he took the phone he had called walter goedel at la rocheguyon earlier and had left a message asking goedel to call back now he said walter my friend how is the field marshal fine what do you want said goedel abrupt as ever i thought the field marshal might like to know that we expect to carry off a small coup tonightthe arrest of a group of saboteurs as they arrive dieter hesitated to give details over the phone but this was a german military line and the risk that the resistance might be listening was very small and it was crucial to get goedels support for the operation my information is that one of them could tell us a great deal about several resistance circuits excellent said goedel as it happens i am calling you from paris how long would it take me to drive to reimstwo hours three then i will join you on the raid dieter was delighted by all means he said if that is what the field marshal would like meet us at the chfteau of sainteccile not later than nineteen hundred he looked at weber who had gone slightly pale very good goedel hung up dieter handed the phone back to hesse field marshal rommels personal aide major goedel will be joining us tonight he said triumphantly yet another reason for us to make sure that everything is done with impeccable efficiency he smiled around the room bringing his gaze to rest finally on weber arent we fortunate chapter all morn inc the jackdaws drove north in a small bus it was a slow journey through leafy woods and fields of green wheat zigzagging from one sleepy market town to the next circling london to the west the countryside seemed oblivious of the war or indeed of the twentieth century and flick hoped it would long remain so as they wound their way through medieval winchester she thought of reims another cathedral city with uniformed nazis strutting on the streets and the gestapo everywhere in their black cars and she gave a short prayer of thanks that they had stopped at the english channel she sat next to paul and watched the countryside for a while thenhaving been awake all night making loveshe fell into a blissful sleep with her head on his shoulder at two in the afternoon they reached the village of sandy in bedfordshire the bus went down a winding country road turned onto an unpaved lane through a wood and arrived at a large mansion called tempsford house flick had been here before it was the assembly point for the nearby tempsford airfield the mood of tranquility left her despite the eighteenthcentury elegance of the place to her it symbolized the unbearable tension of the hours immediately before a flight into enemy territory they were too late for lunch but they got tea and sandwiches in the dining room flick drank her tea but felt too anxious to eat however the others tucked in heartily afterwards they were shown to their rooms a little later the women met in the library the room looked more like the wardrobe of a film studio there were racks of coats and dresses boxes of hats and shoes cardboard cartons labeled culotres chausseue and mouchoirs and a trestle table in the middle of the room with several sewing machines in charge of the operation was madame guillemin a slim woman of about fifty in a shirtwaist dress with a chic little matching jacket she had spectacles on the end of her nose and a measuring tape around her neck and she spoke to them in perfect french with a parisian accent as you know french clothes are distinctively different from british clothes i wont say they are more stylish but you know they are more stylish she gave a french shrug and the girls laughed it was not just a question of style flick thought somberly french jackets were normally about ten inches longer than british and there were numerous differences of detail any of which could be the fatal clue that betrayed an agent so all the clothes here had been bought in france exchanged with refugees for new british clothes or faithfully copied from french originals then worn for a while so that they would not look new now it is summer so we have cotton dresses light wool suits and shower proof coats she waved a hand at two young women sitting at sewing machines my assistants will make alterations if the clothes dont fit quite perfectly flick said we need clothes that are fairly expensive but well worn i want us to look like respectable women in case were questioned by the gestapo when they needed to pose as cleaners they could quickly downgrade their appearance by taking off their hats gloves and belts madame guillemin began with ruby she looked hard at her for a minute then picked from the rack a navy dress and a tan raincoat try those its a mans coat but in france today no one can afford to be particular she pointed across the room you can change behind that screen if you wish and for the very shy there is a little anteroom behind the desk we think the owner of the house used to lock himself in there to read dirty books they laughed again all but flick who had heard madame guillemins jokes before the seamstress looked hard at greta then moved on saying ill come back to you she picked outfits for jelly diana and maude and they all went behind the screen then she turned to flick and said in a low voice is this a joke why do you say that she turned to greta youre a man flick gave a grunt of frustration and turned away the seamstress had seen through gretas disguise in seconds it was a bad omen madame added you might fool a lot of people but not me i can tell greta said how madame guillemin shrugged the proportions are all wrongyour shoulders are too broad your hips too narrow your legs too muscular your hands too bigits obvious to an expert flick said irritably she has to be a woman for this mission so please dress her as best you can of coursebut for gods sake try not to let her be seen by a dressmaker no problem the gestapo dont employ many of those flicks confidence was faked she did not want madame guillemin to know how worried she was the seamstress looked again at greta ill give you a contrasting skirt and blouse to reduce your height and a threequarterlength coat she selected clothes and handed them to greta greta looked at them with disapproval her taste ran to more glamorous outfits however she did not complain im going to be shy and lock myself in the anteroom she said finally madame gave flick an applegreen dress with a matching coat the color shows off your eyes she said as long as youre not ostentatious why shouldnt you look pretty it may help you charm your way out of trouble the dress was loose and looked like a tent on flick but she put on a leather belt to give it a waist you are so chic just like a french girl said madame guillemin flick did not tell her that the main purpose of the belt was to hold a gun they all put on their new clothes and paraded around the room preening and giggling madame guillemin had chosen well and they liked what they had been given but some of the garments needed adjusting while we are making alterations you can choose some accessories madame said they rapidly lost their inhibitions and downed around in their underwear trying on hats and shoes scarves and bags they had momentarily forgotten the dangers ahead flick thought and were taking simple pleasure in their new outfits greta came out of the anteroom looking surprisingly glamorous flick studied her with interest she had turned up the collar of the plain white blouse so that it looked stylish and wore the shapeless coat draped over her shoulders cloakstyle madame guillemin raised an eyebrow but made no comment flicks dress had to be shortened while that was being done she studied the coat working undercover had given her a sharp eye for detail and she anxiously checked the stitching the lining the buttons and the pockets to make sure they were in the normal french style she found no fault the label in the collar said galeries lafayette flick showed madame guillemin her lapel knife it was only three inches long with a thin blade but it was wickedly sharp it had a small handle and no hilt it came in a slim leather sheath pierced with holes for thread i want you to sew this to the coat under the lapel flick said madame guiflemin nodded i can do this she gave them each a little pile of underwear two of everything all with the labels of french shops with unerring accuracy she had picked not just the right size but the preferred style of each woman corsets for jelly pretty lacy slips for maude navy knickers and boned brassieres for diana simple chemises and panties for ruby and flick the handkerchiefs bear the laundry marks of different blanchisseries in reims said madame guillemin with a touch of pride finally she produced an assortment of bags a canvas duffel a gladstone bag a rucksack and a selection of cheap fiber suitcases in different colors and sizes each woman got one inside she found a toothbrush toothpaste face powder shoe polish cigarettes and matchesall french brands even though they were going in only for a short time flick had insisted on the full kit for each of them remember flick said you may not take with you anything that you have not been given this afternoon your life depends on that the giggling stopped as they remembered the danger they would face in a few hours flick said all right everybody please go back to your rooms and change into your french outfits including underwear then well meet downstairs for dinner in the main drawing room of the house a bar had been set up when flick walked in it was occupied by a dozen or so men some in raf uniform all of themflick knew from previous visitsclestined to make clandestine flights over france a blackboard bore the names or code names of those who would leave tonight together with the times they needed to depart from the house flick read aristotle capt jenkins lieut ramsey all jackdaws colgate bunteroo mr blister paradox saxophone she looked at her watch it was sixthirty two hours to go she sat at the bar and looked around wondering which of them would come back and which would die in the field some were terribly young smoking and telling jokes looking as if they had no cares the older ones looked hardened and savored their whisky and gin in the grim knowledge it might be their last she thought about their parents their wives or girlfriends their babies and children tonights work would leave some of them with a grief that would never entirely go away her somber reflections were interrupted by a sight that astonished her simon fortescue the slippery bureaucrat from mi walked into the bar in a pinstriped suitaccompanied by denise bowyer flicks jaw dropped felicity im so glad i caught you said simon without waiting for an invitation he pulled up a stool for denise gin and tonic please barman what would you like lady denise a martini very dry and for you felicity flick did not answer the question shes supposed to be in scotland she said look there seems to have been some misunderstanding denise has told me all about this policeman fellow no misunderstanding flick said abruptly denise failed the course thats all there is to it denise made a disgusted sound fortescue said i really dont see how a perfectly intelligent girl from a good family could fail shes a blabbermouth what she cant keep her damn mouth shut shes not trustworthy she shouldnt be walking around free denise said you insolent cat fortescue controlled his temper with an effort and lowered his voice look her brother is the marquess of inverlocky whos very close to the prime minister inverlocky himself asked me to make sure denise got a chance to do her bit so you see it would be dreadfully tactless to turn her down flick raised her voice let me get this straight one or two of the men nearby looked up as a favor to your upperclass friend youre asking me to take someone untrustworthy on a dangerous mission behind enemy lines is that it as she was speaking percy and paul walked in percy glared at fortescue with undisguised malevolence paul said did i hear right fortescue said ive brought denise with me because it would be frankly an embarrassment to the government if she were left behind and a danger to me if she were to come flick interrupted youre wasting your breath shes off the team look i dont want to have to pull rank what rank said flick i resigned from the guards as a colonel retired and im the civil service equivalent of a brigadier dont be ridiculous flick said youre not even in the army im ordering you to take denise with you then ill have to consider my response said flick thats better im sure you wont regret it all right here is my response fuck off fortescue went red he had probably never been told to flick off by a girl he was uncharacteristically speechless well said denise weve certainly found out what type of person were dealing with paul said youre dealing with me he turned to fortescue im in command of this operation and i wont have denise on the team at any price if you want to argue call monty well said my boy percy added fortescue found his voice at last he wagged a finger at flick the time will come mrs clairet when you will regret saying that to me he got off his stool im sorry about this lady denise but i think weve done all we can here they left stupid prat percy muttered lets have dinner said flick the others were already in the dining room waiting as the jackdaws began their last meal in england percy gave each of them an expensive gift silver cigarette cases for the smokers gold powder compacts for the others they have french hallmarks so you can take them with you he said the women were pleased but he brought their mood back down with his next remark they have a purpose too they are items that can easily be pawned for emergency funds if you get into real trouble the food was plentiful a banquet by wartime standards and the jackdaws tucked in with relish flick did not feel very hungry but she forced herself to eat a big steak knowing it was more meat than she would get in a week in france when they finished supper it was time to go to the airfield they returned to their rooms to pick up their french bags then boarded the bus it took them along another country lane and across a railway line then approached what looked like a cluster of farm buildings at the edge of a large flat field a sign said gibraltar farm but flick knew that this was raf tempsford and the barns were heavily disguised nissen huts they went into what looked like a cowshed and found a uniformed raf officer standing guard over steel racks of equipment before they were given their gear each of them was searched a box of british matches was found in maudes suitcase diana had in her pocket a halfcompleted crossword torn from the daily mirror which she swore she had intended to leave on the plane and jelly the inveterate gambler had a pack of playing cards with made in binningham printed on every one paul distributed their identity cards ration cards and clothing coupons each woman was given a hundred thousand french francs mostly in grubby thousandfranc notes it was the equivalent of five hundred pounds enough to buy two ford cars they also got weaponscaliber colt automatic pistols and sharp doublebladed commando knives flick declined both she took her personal gun a browning ninemillimeter automatic around her waist she wore the leather belt into which she could push the pistol or at a pinch the submachine gun she also took her lapel knife instead of the commando knife the commando knife was longer and deadlier but more cumbersome the great advantage of the lapel knife was that when the agent was asked to produce papers she could innocently reach toward an inside pocket then at the last moment pull the knife in addition there was a leeenfield rifle for diana and a sten mark ii submachine gun with silencer for flick the plastic explosive jelly would need was distributed evenly among the six women so that even if one or two bags were lost there would still be enough to do the job maude said it might blow me up jelly explained that it was extraordinarily safe i knew a bloke who thought it was chocolate and ate some she said mind you she added it didnt half give him the runs they were offered the usual round mills grenades with the conventional turtleshell finish but flick insisted on generalpurpose grenades in square cans because they could also be used as explosive charges each woman got a fountain pen with a hollow cap containing a suicide pill there was a compulsory visit to the bathroom before putting on the flying suit it had a pistol pocket so that the agent could defend herself immediately on landing if necessary with the suit they donned helmet and goggles and finally shrugged into the parachute harness paul asked flick to step outside for a moment he had held back the allimportant special passes that would enable the women to enter the chfteau as cleaners if a jackdaw were to be captured by the gestapo this pass would betray the true purpose of the mission for safety he gave all the passes to flick to be distributed at the last minute then he kissed her she kissed him back with desperate passion clutching his body to hers shamelessly thrusting her tongue into his mouth until she had to gasp for breath dont get killed he said into her ear they were interrupted by a discreet cough flick smelled percys pipe she broke the clinch percy said to paul the pilot is waiting for a word with you paul nodded and moved away make sure he understands that flick is the officer in command percy called after him sure paul replied percy looked grim and flick had a bad feeling whats wrong she said he took a sheet of paper from his jacket pocket and handed it to her a motorcycle courier from london brought this from soe headquarters just before we left the house it came in from brian standish last night he sucked anxiously on his pipe and blew out clouds of smoke flick looked at the sheet of paper in the evening sunlight it was a decrypt its contents hit her like a punch in the stomach she looked up dismayed brian has been in the hands of the gestapo only for a few seconds so this claims any reason to think otherwise ah fuck it she said loudly a passing airman looked up sharply surprised to hear a womans voice utter such words flick crumpled the paper and threw it on the ground percy bent down picked it up and smoothed out the creases lets try to stay calm and think clearly flick took a deep breath we have a rule she said insistently any agent who is captured by the enemy whatever the circumstances must immediately be returned to london for debriefing then youll have no wireless operator i can manage without one and what about this charenton i suppose its natural that mademoiselle lemas might have recruited someone to help her all recruits are supposed to be vetted by london you know that rule has never been followed at a minimum they should be approved by the local commander well he has been nowmichel is satisfied that charenton is trustworthy and charenton saved brian from the gestapo that whole scene in the cathedral cant have been deliberately staged can it perhaps it never took place at all and this message comes straight from gestapo headquarters but it has all the right security codes anyway they wouldnt invent a story about his being captured and then released theyd know that would arouse our suspicions they would just say he had arrived safely youre right but still i dont like it no nor do i he said surprising her but i dont know what to do she sighed we have to take the risk theres no time for precautions if we dont disable the telephone exchange in the next three days it will be too late we have to go anyway percy nodded flick saw that there were tears in his eyes he put his pipe in his mouth and took it out again good girl he said his voice reduced to a whisper good girl the seventh day saturday june chapter soe had no planes of its own it had to borrow them from the raf which was like pulling teeth in the air force had reluctantly handed over two lysanders too slow and heavy for their intended role in battlefield support but ideal for clandestine landings in enemy territory later under pressure from churchill two squadrons of obsolete bombers were assigned to soe although the head of bomber command arthur hams never stopped scheming to get them back by the spring of when dozens of agents were flown into france in preparation for the invasion soe had the use of thirtysix aircraft the plane the jackdaws boarded was an americanmade twinengined hudson light bomber manufactured in and since made obsolete by the fourengined lancaster heavy bomber a hudson came with two machine guns in the nose and the raf added a rear turret with two more at the back of the passenger cabin was a slide like a water chute down which the parachutists would glide into space there were no seats inside and the six women and their dispatcher lay down on the metal floor they were cold and uncomfortable and scared but jelly got a fit of the giggles which cheered them all up they shared the cabin with a dozen metal containers each as tall as a man and equipped with a parachute harness all containingflick presumedguns and ammunition to enable some other resistance circuit to run interference behind german lines during the invasion after dropping the jackdaws at chatelle the hudson would fly on to another destination before turning around and heading back to tempsford takeoff had been delayed by a faulty altimeter which had to be replaced so it was one oclock in the morning when they left the english coastline behind over the channel the pilot dropped the plane to a few hundred feet above the sea trying to hide below the level of enemy radar and flick silently hoped they would not be shot at by ships of the royal navy but he soon climbed again to eight thousand feet to cross the fortified french coastline he stayed high to traverse the atlantic wall the heavily defended coastal strip then descended again to three hundred feet to make navigation less difficult the navigator was constantly busy with his maps calculating the planes position by dead reckoning and trying to confirm it by landmarks the moon was waxing and only three days from full so large towns were easily visible despite the blackout however they generally had antiaircraft batteries so had to be avoided as did army camps and military sites for the same reason rivers and lakes were the most useful terrain features especially when the moon was reflected off the water forests showed as dark patches and the unexpected absence of one was a sure sign that the flight had gone astray the gleam of railway lines the glow of a steam engines fire and the headlights of the occasional blackoutbreaking car were all helpful all the way flick brooded over the news about bnan standish and the newcomer charenton the story was probably true the gestapo had learned about the cathedral crypt rendezvous from one of the prisoners they had taken last sunday at the chfteau and they had set a trap which brian had walked into but he had escaped with help from mademoiselle lemass new recruit it was all perfectly possible however flick hated plausible explanations she felt safe only when events followed standard procedure and no explanations were required as they approached the champagne region another navigation aid came into play it was a recent invention known as eurekalrebecca a radio beacon broadcast a call sign from a secret location somewhere in reims the crew of the hudson did not know exactly where it was but flick did for michel had placed it in the tower of the cathedral this was the eureka half on the plane was rebecca a radio receiver shoehorned into the cabin next to the navigator they were about fifty miles north of reims when the navigator picked up the signal from the eureka in the cathedral the intention of the inventors was that the eureka should be in the landing field with the reception committee but this was impracticable the equipment weighed more than a hundred pounds it was too bulky to be transported discreetly and it could not be explained away to even the most gullible gestapo officer at a checkpoint michel and other resistance leaders were willing to place a eureka in a permanent position but refused to carry them around so the navigator had to revert to traditional methods to find chatelle however he was lucky in having flick beside him someone who had landed there on several occasions and could recognize the place from the air in the event they passed about a mile to the east of the village but flick spotted the pond and redirected the pilot they circled around and flew over the cow pasture at three hundred feet flick could see the flare path four weak flickering lights in an l shape with the light at the toe of the l flashing the prearranged code the pilot climbed toward six hundred feet the ideal altitude for a parachute drop any higher and the wind could blow the parachutists away from the dropping zone much lower and the chute might not have time to open fully before the agent hit the ground ready when you are said the pilot im not ready flick said whats the matter somethings wrong flicks instincts were sounding alarm bells it was not just her worries about brian standish and charenton there was something else she pointed west to the village look no lights that surprises you theres a blackout and its after three oclock in the morning flick shook her head this is the countryside theyre careless about the blackout and theres always someone up a mother with a new baby an insomniac a student cramming for finals ive never seen it completely dark if you really feel theres something wrong we should get out of here fast the pilot said nervously something else was bothering her she tried to scratch her head and found her helmet in the way the thought evaded her what should she do she could hardly abort the mission just because the villagers of chatelle were obeying the blackout rules for once the plane overflew the field and banked to turn the pilot said anxiously remember each time we over fly increases the risk everyone in that village can hear our engines and one of them might call the police exactly she said we must have awakened the entire place yet no one has switched on a light i dont know country folk can be very incurious they like to keep themselves to themselves as they always say nonsense theyre as nosy as anyone this is peculiar the pilot looked more and more worried but he continued circling suddenly it came to her the baker should have lit his oven you can normally see the glow from the air could he be closed today what day is it saturday a baker might close on a monday or a tuesday but never on a saturday whats happened this is like a ghost town then lets get out of here it was as if someone had rounded up the villagers including the baker and locked them in a barnwhich was probably what the gestapo would have done if they were lying in wait for her she could not abort the mission it was too important but every instinct told her not to parachute into chatelle a risk is a risk she said the pilot was losing patience so what do you want to do suddenly she remembered the containers of supplies in the passenger cabin whats your next destination im not supposed to tell you not usually no but now i really need to know its a field north of chartres that meant the vestryman circuit i know them flick said with mounting excitement this could be the solution you could drop us with the containers there will be a reception committee waiting they can take care of us we could be in paris this afternoon reims by tomorrow morning he reached for the joystick is that what you want to do is it possible i can drop you there no problem the tactical decision is yours youre in command of the missionthat was made very clear to me flick considered worrying her suspicions might be unfounded in which case she would need to get a message to michel via brians radio saying that although her landing had been aborted she was still on her way but in case brians radio was in gestapo hands she would have to give the minimum of information however that was feasible she could write a brief radio signal for the pilot to take back to percy brian would have it in a couple of hours she would also have to change the arrangements for picking up the jackdaws after the mission at present a hudson was scheduled to land at chatelle at two am on sunday and if the jackdaws were not there to return the following night at the same time if chatelle had been betrayed to the gestapo and could no longer be used she would have to divert the hudson to another landing field at laroque to the west of reims codenamed champ dor the mission would take an extra day because they would have to travel from chartres to reims so the pickup flight would have to come down at two am on monday with a fallback on tuesday at the same hour she weighed consequences diverting to chartres meant the loss of a day but landing at chatelle could mean the entire mission failed and all the jackdaws ended up in gestapo torture chambers it was no contest go to chartres she said to the pilot roger wilco as the aircraft banked and turned flick went back to the cabin the jackdaws all looked expectantly at her theres been a change of plan she said chapter d i e t e r lay b e n eath a hedge and watched bewildered while the british plane circled over the cow pasture why the delay the pilot had made two passes over the landing site the flare path such as it was was in place had the reception leader flashed the wrong code had the gestapo men done something to arouse suspicion it was maddening felicity clairet was a few yards away from him if he fired his pistol at the plane a lucky shot might hit her then the plane banked turned and roared away to the south dieter was mortified flick clairet had evaded himin front of walter goedel will weber and twenty gestapo men for a moment he buried his face in his hands what had gone wrong there could be a dozen reasons as the drone of the planes engines receded dieter could hear shouts of indignation in french the resistance seemed as perplexed as he was his best guess was that flick an experienced team leader had smelled a rat and aborted the jump walter goedel lying in the dirt beside him said what are you going to do now dieter considered briefly there were four resistance people here michel the leader still limping from his bullet wound helicopter the british radio operator a frenchman dieter did not recognize and a young woman what should he do with them his strategy of letting helicopter run free had been a good one in theory but it had now led to two humiliating reverses and he did not have the nerve to continue it he had to get something out of tonights fiasco he was going to have to revert to traditional methods of interrogation and hope to salvage the operationand his reputation he brought the mouthpiece of the shortwave radio to his lips all units this is major franck he said softly action i repeat action then he got to his feet and drew his automatic pistol the searchlights concealed in the trees blazed into life the four terrorists in the middle of the field were mercilessly lit up looking suddenly bewildered and vulnerable dieter called out in french you are surrounded raise your hands beside him goedel drew his luger the four gestapo men with dieter aimed their rifles at the legs of the resistance people there was a moment of uncertainty would the resistance open fire if they did they would be mowed down with luck they might be only wounded but dieter had not had much luck tonight and if these four were killed he would be left emptyhanded they hesitated dieter stepped forward moving into the light and the four riflemen moved with him twenty guns are aimed at you he shouted do not draw your weapons one of them started to run dieter swore he saw a flash of red hair in the lights it was helicopter stupid boy heading across the field like a charging bull shoot him dieter said quietly all four riflemen took careful aim and fired the shots crashed out in the silent meadow helicopter ran another two paces then fell to the ground dieter looked at the other three waiting slowly they raised their hands in the air dieter spoke into the shortwave radio all teams in the pasture move in and secure the prisoners he put away his pistol he walked over to where helicopter lay the body was still the gestapo riflemen had shot at his legs but it was hard to hit a moving target in the dark and one of them had aimed too high putting a bullet through his neck severing his spinal cord or his jugular vein or both dieter knelt beside him and felt for a pulse but there was none you werent the cleverest agent ive ever met but you were a brave boy he said quietly god rest your soul he closed the eyes he looked over the other three as they were disarmed and fettered michel would resist interrogation well dieter had seen him in action and he had courage his weakness was probably vanity he was handsome and a womanizer the way to torture him would be in front of a mirror break his nose knock out his teeth scar his cheeks make him understand that with every minute that he continued to resist he was getting irreversibly uglier the other man had the air of a professional perhaps a lawyer a gestapo man searched him and showed dieter a pass that permitted dr claude bouler to be out after curfew dieter assumed it was a forgery but when they searched the resistance cars they found a genuine doctors bag full of instruments and drugs under arrest he looked pale but composed he too would be a difficult subject the girl was the most promising she was about nineteen and pretty with long dark hair and big eyes but she had a vacant look her papers showed that she was gilberte duval dieter knew from his interrogation of gaston that gilberte was the lover of michel and the rival of flick handled correctly she might prove easy to turn the german vehicles were brought from the barn at la maison grandin the prisoners went in a truck with the gestapo men dieter gave orders that they should be kept in separate cells and prevented from communicating with one another he and goedel were driven back to sainteccile in webers mercedes what a damned farce weber said scornfully a complete waste of time and manpower not quite said dieter we have taken four subversive agents out of circulationwhich is after all what the gestapo is supposed to doand even better three of them are still alive for interrogation goedel said what do you hope to get from them the dead man helicopter was a wireless operator dieter explained i have a copy of his code book unfortunately he did not have his set with him if we can find the set we can impersonate helicopter surely you can use any radio transmitter so long as you know the frequency assigned to him dieter shook his head every transmitter sounds different to the experienced ear and these little suitcase radios are particularly distinctive all nonessential circuits are omitted to minimize the size and the result is poor tone quality if we had one exactly like his captured from another agent it might be similar enough to take the risk we may have one somewhere if we do it will be in berlin its easier to find helicopters how will you do that the girl will tell me where it is for the rest of the journey dieter brooded over his interrogation strategy he could torture the girl in front of the men but they might resist that more promising would be to torture the men in front of the girl but there might be an easier way a plan was forming in his mind when they passed the public library in the center of reims he had noticed the building before it was a little jewel an art deco design in tan stone standing in a small garden would you mind stopping the car for a moment please major weber he said weber muttered an order to his driver do you have any tools in the trunk i have no idea said weber what is this about the driver said of course major we have the regulation tool kit is there a goodsized hammer yes the driver jumped out this wont take a moment dieter said he got out of the car the driver handed him a longhandled hammer with a chunky steel head dieter walked past a bust of andrew carnegie up to the library the place was closed and dark of course the glass doors were protected by an elaborate wroughtiron grille he walked around to the side of the building and found a basement entrance with a plain wood door marked archives municipales dieter swung at the door with the hammer hitting the lock it broke after four blows he went inside turning on the lights he ran up a narrow staircase to the main floor and crossed the lobby to the fiction section there he located the letter f for flaubert and picked out a copy of the book he was looking for madame bovary it was not particularly lucky that was the one book that must be available in every library in the country he turned to nine and located the passage he was thinking about he had remembered it accurately it would serve his purpose very well he returned to the car goedel was looking amused weber said incredulously you needed something to read sometimes i find it difficult to get to sleep dieter replied goedel laughed he took the book from dieter and read its title a classic of world literature he said all the same i imagine thats the first time someone broke down the library door to borrow it they drove on to sainteccile by the time they reached the chfteau dieters plan was fully formed he ordered lieutenant hesse to prepare michel by stripping him naked and tying him to a chair in the torture chamber show him the instrument used for pulling out fingernails he said leave it on the table in front of him while that was being done he got a pen a bottle of ink and a pad of letter paper from the offices on the upper floor walter goedel ensconced himself in a corner of the torture chamber to watch dieter studied michel for a few moments the resistance leader was a tall man with attractive wrinkles around his eyes he had a kind of badboy look that women liked now he was scared but determined he was thinking grimly about how to hold out as long as possible against torture dieter guessed dieter put the pen ink and paper on the table next to the fingernail pliers to show that they were alternatives untie his hands he said hesse complied michels face showed enormous relief combined with a fear that this might not be real dieter explained to walter goedel before questioning the prisoners i will take samples of their handwriting their handwriting dieter nodded watching michel who seemed to have understood the brief exchange in german he looked hopeful dieter took madame bovary from his pocket opened it and put it down on the table copy out chapter nine he said to michel in french michel hesitated it seemed a harmless request he suspected a trick dieter could tell but he could not see what it was dieter waited the resistance were told to do everything they could to put off the moment when torture began michel was bound to see this as a means of postponement it was unlikely to be harmless but it had to be better than having his fingernails pulled out very well he said after a long pause he began writing dieter watched him his handwriting was large and flamboyant two pages of the printed book took up six sheets of the letter paper when michel turned the page dieter stopped him he told hans to return michel to his cell and bring gilberte goedel looked over what michel had written and shook his head bemusedly i cant figure out what youre up to he said he handed the sheets back and returned to his chair dieter tore one of the pages very carefully to leave only certain words gilberte came in looking terrified but defiant she said i wont tell you anything i will never betray my friends besides i dont know anything all i do is drive cars dieter told her to sit down and offered her coffee the real thing he said as he handed her a cup french people could get only ersatz coffee she sipped it and thanked him dieter studied her she was quite beautiful with long dark hair and dark eyes although there was something bovine about her expression youre a lovely woman gilberte he said i dont believe you are a murderer at heart no im not she said gratefully a woman does things for love doesnt she she looked at him with surprise you understand i k w all about you you are in love with michel she bowed her head without replying a married man of course this is regrettable but you love him and thats why you help the resistance out of love not hate she nodded am i right he said you must answer she whispered yes but you have been misguided my dear i know ive done wrong you misunderstand me youve been misguided not just in breaking the law but in loving michel she looked at him in puzzlement i know hes married but im afraid he doesnt really love you but he does no he loves his wife felicity clairet known as flick an englishwomannot chic not very beautiful some years older than youbut he loves her tears came to her eyes and she said i dont believe you he writes to her you know i imagine he gets the couriers to take his messages back to england he sends her love letters saying how much he misses her theyre rather poetic in an oldfashioned way ive read some its not possible he was carrying one when we arrested all of you he tried to destroy it just now but we managed to save a few scraps dieter took from his pocket the sheet he had torn and handed it to her isnt that his handwriting yes and is it a love letter or what gilberte read it slowly moving her lips i think of you constantly the memory of you drives me to despair ah forgive me will leave you farewell i will go far away so far that you will never hear of me again and yettodayi know not what force impelled me toward you for one doesnt struggle against heaven one cannot resist the smile of angels one is carried away by that which is beautiful charming adorable she threw down the paper with a sob im sorry to be the one to tell you dieter said gently he took the white linen handkerchief from the breast pocket of his suit and handed it to her she buried her face in it it was time to turn the conversation imperceptibly toward interrogation i suppose michel has been living with you since flick left longer than that she said indignantly for six months every night except when she was in town in your house i have an apartment very small but it was enough for two two people who loved each other she continued to cry dieter strove to maintain a light conversational tone as he obliquely approached the topic he was really interested in wasnt it difficult to have helicopter living with you as well in a small place hes not living there he only came today but you must have wondered where he was going to stay no michel found him a place an empty room over the old bookshop in the rue moliere walter goedel suddenly shifted in his chair he had realized where this was heading dieter carefully ignored him and casually asked gilberte didnt he leave his stuff at your place when you went to chatelle to meet the plane no he took it to the room dieter asked the key question including his little suitcase yes ah dieter had what he wanted helicopters radio set was in a room over the bookshop in the rue moliere ive finished with this stupid cow he said to hans in german thru her over to becker dieters own car the blue hispanosuiza was parked in front of the chfteau with walter goedel beside him and hans hesse in the backseat he drove fast through the villages to reims and quickly found the bookshop in the rue moliere they broke down the door and climbed a bare wooden staircase to the room over the shop it was unfurnished but for a palliasse covered with a rough blanket on the floor beside the rough bed stood a bottle of whisky a bag containing toiletries and the small suitcase dieter opened it to show goedel the radio with this dieter said triumphantly i can become helicopter on the way back to sainteccile they discussed what message to send first helicopter would want to know why the parachutists did not drop dieter said so he will ask what happened do you agree and he would be angry goedel said so he will say what the blazes happened perhaps goedel shook his head i studied in england before the war that phrase what the blazes is too polite its a coy euphemism for what the hell a young man in the military would never use it maybe he should say what the flick instead too coarse goedel objected he knows the message may be decoded by a female your english is better than mine you choose i think he would say what the devil happened it expresses his anger and its a masculine curse that would not offend most women okay then he wants to know what he should do next so he will ask for further orders what would he say probably send instructions english people dislike the word order they think its not refined all right and well ask for a quick response because helicopter would be impatient and so are we they reached the chfteau and went to the wireless listening room in the basement a middleaged operator called joachim plugged the set in and tuned it to helicopters emergency frequency while dieter scribbled the agreed message what the devil happened send instructions reply immediately dieter forced himself to control his impatience and carefully show joachim how to encode the message including the security tags goedel said wont they know its not helicopter at the machine cant they recognize the individual fist of the sender like handwriting yes joachim said but ive listened to this chap sending a couple of times and i can imitate him its a bit like mimicking someones accent talking like a frankfurt man say goedel was skeptical you can do a perfect impersonation after hearing him twice not perfect no but agents are often under pressure when they broadcast in some hiding place and worried about us catching up with them so small variations will be put down to strain he began to tap out the letters dieter reckoned they had a wait of at least an hour at the british listening station the message had to be decrypted then passed to helicopters controller who was surely in bed the controller might get the message by phone and compose a reply on the spot but even then the reply had to be encrypted and transmitted then decrypted by joachim dieter and goedel went to the kitchen on the ground floor where they found a mess corporal starting work on breakfast and got him to give them sausages and coffee goedel was impatient to get back to rommels headquarters but he wanted to stay and see how this turned out it was daylight when a young woman in ss uniform came to tell them that the reply had come in and joachim had almost finished typing it they hurried downstairs weber was already there with his usual knack of showing up where the action was joachim handed the typed message to him and carbon copies to dieter and goedel dieter read jackdaws aborted drop but have landed elsewhere await contact from leopardess weber said grumpily this does not tell us much goedel agreed what a disappointment youre both wrong dieter said jubilantly leopardess is in franceand i have a picture of her he pulled the photos of flick clairet from his pocket with a flourish and handed one to weber get a printer out of bed and have a thousand copies made i want to see that picture all over reims within the next twelve hours hans get my car filled up with petrol where are you going said goedel to paris with the other photograph to do the same thing there ive got her now chapter t h e parachute d r op went smoothly the containers were pushed out first so that there was no possibility of one landing on the head of a parachutist then the jackdaws took turns sitting on the top of the slide and when tapped on the shoulder by the dispatcher slithering down the chute and out into space flick went last as she fell the hudson turned north and disappeared into the night she wished the crew luck it was almost dawn because of the nights delays they would have to fly the last part of their journey in dangerous daylight flick landed perfectly with her knees bent and her arms tucked into her sides as she fell to the ground she lay still for a moment french soil she thought with a shiver of fear enemy territory now she was a criminal a terrorist a spy if she was caught she would be executed she put the thought out of her mind and stood up a few yards away a donkey stared at her in the moonlight then bent its head to graze she could see three containers nearby farther away scattered across the field were half a dozen resistance people working in pairs picking up the bulky containers and carrying them away she struggled out of her parachute harness helmet and flying suit while she was doing so a young man ran up to her and said in breathless french we werent expecting any personnel just supplies a change of plan she said dont worry about it is anton with you anton was the code name of the leader of the vestryman circuit yes tell him leopardess is here ahyou are leopardess he was impressed yes im chevalier im so pleased to meet you she glanced up at the sky it was turning from black to gray find anton as quickly as you can please chevalier tell him we have six people who need transport theres no time to spare very good he hurried away she folded her parachute into a neat bundle then set out to find the other jackdaws greta had landed in a tree and had bruised herself crashing through the upper branches but had come to rest without serious injury and had been able to slip out of her harness and climb down to the ground the others had all come down safely on the grass im very proud of myself said jelly but i wouldnt do it again for a million pounds flick noted that the resistance people were carrying the containers to the southern end of the field and she took the jackdaws in that direction there she found a builders van a horse and cart and an old lincoln limousine with the hood removed and some kind of steam motor powering it she was not surprised gas was available only for essential business and french people tried all kinds of ingenious ways to run their cars the resistance men had loaded the cart with containers and were now hiding them under empty vegetable boxes more containers were going into the back of the builders van directing the operation was anton a thin man of forty in a greasy cap and a short blue workmans jacket with a yellow french cigarette stuck to his lip he stared in astonishment six women he said is this a sewing circle jokes about women were best ignored flick had found she spoke solemnly to him this is the most important operation ive ever run and i need your help of course we have to catch a train to paris i can get you to chartres he glanced at the sky calculating the time until daylight then pointed across the field to a farmhouse dimly visible you can hide in a barn for now when we have disposed of these containers well come back for you not good enough flick said firmly we have to get going the first train to pans leaves at ten i can get you there by then nonsense no one knows when the trains will run it was true the combination of allied bombing resistance sabotage and deliberate mistakes by antinazi railway workers had wrecked all schedules and the only thing to do was go to the station and wait until a train came but it was best to get there early put the containers in the barn and take us now impossible he said i have to stash the supplies before daylight the men stopped work to listen to the argument flick sighed the guns and ammunition in the containers were the most important thing in the world to anton they were the source of his power and prestige she said this is more important believe me im sorry anton listen to me if you dont do this for me i promise you you will never again receive a single container from england you know i can do this dont you there was a pause anton did not want to back down in front of his men however if the supply of arms dried up the men would go elsewhere this was the only leverage british officers had over the french resistance but it worked he glared at her slowly he removed the stub of the cigarette from his mouth pinched out the end and threw it away very well he said get in the van the women helped unload the containers then clambered in the floor was filthy with cement dust mud and oil but they found some scraps of sacking and used them to keep the worst of the dirt off their clothes as they sat on the floor anton closed the door on them chevalier got into the driving seat so ladies he said in english off we go flick replied coldly in french no jokes please and no english he drove off having flown five hundred miles on the metal floor of a bomber the jackdaws now drove twenty miles in the back of a builders van surprisingly it was jellythe oldest the fattest and the least fit of the sixwho was most stoical joking about the discomfort and laughing at herself when the van took a sharp bend and she rolled over helplessly but when the sun came up and the van entered the small city of chartres their mood became somber again maude said i cant believe im doing this and diana squeezed her hand flick was planning ahead from now on we split up into pairs she said the teams had been decided back at the finishing school flick had put diana with maude for otherwise diana would make a fuss flick paired herself with ruby because she wanted to be able to discuss problems with someone and ruby was the cleverest jackdaw unfortunately that left greta with jelly i still dont see why i have to go with the foreigner jelly said this isnt a tea party flick said irritated you dont get to sit by your best friend its a military operation and you do what youre told jelly shut up well have to modify our cover stories to explain the train trip flick went on any ideas greta said im the wife of major remmer a german officer working in paris traveling with my french maid i was to be visiting the cathedral at reims now i suppose i could be returning from a visit to the cathedral at chartres good enough diana maude and i are secretaries working for the electric company in reims weve been to chartres because maude has lost contact with her fianc and we thought he might be here but he isnt flick nodded satisfied there were thousands of french women searching for missing relatives especially young men who might have been injured by bombing arrested by the gestapo sent to labor camps in germany or recruited by the resistance she said and im the widow of a stockbroker who was killed in went to chartres to fetch my orphaned cousin and bring her to live with me in reims one of the great advantages women had as secret agents was that they could move around the country without attracting suspicion by contrast a man found outside the area where he worked would automatically be assumed to be in the resistance especially if he was young flick spoke to the driver chevalier look for a quiet spot to let us out the sight of six respectably dressed women getting out of the back of a builders van would be somewhat remarkable even in occupied france where people used any means of transport they could get we can find the station on our own a couple of minutes later he stopped the van and reversed into a turn then jumped out and opened the back door the jackdaws got out and found themselves in a narrow cobbled alley with high houses on either side through a gap between roofs she glimpsed part of the cathedral flick reminded them of the plan go to the station buy oneway tickets to paris and get the first train each pair will pretend not to know the others but well try to sit close together on the train we regroup in paris you have the address they were going to a flophouse called hotel de la chapdlle where the proprietress though not actually in the resistance could be relied upon not to ask questions if they arrived in time they would go on to reims immediately if not they could stay overnight at the flophouse flick was not pleased to be going to parisit was crawling with gestapo men and their collaborators the kollabosbut there was no way around it by train only flick and greta knew the real mission of the jackdaws the others still thought they were going to blow up a railway tunnel diana and maude first off you go quick jelly and greta next more slowly they went off looking scared chevalier shook their hands wished them luck and drove away heading back to the field to fetch the rest of the containers flick and ruby walked out of the alley the first few steps in a french town were always the worst flick felt that everyone she saw must know who she was as if she had a sign on her back saying british agent shoot her down but people walked by as if she were nobody special and after she had safely passed a gendarme and a couple of german officers her pulse began to return to normal she still felt very strange all her life she had been respectable and she had been taught to regard policemen as her friends i hate being on the wrong side of the law she murmured to ruby in french as if ive done something wicked ruby gave a low laugh im used to it she said the police have always been my enemies flick remembered with a start that ruby had been in jail for murder last tuesday it seemed a long four days they reached the cathedral at the top of the hill and flick felt a thrill at the sight of it the summit of french medieval culture a church like none other she suffered a sharp pang of regret for the peaceful times when she might have spent a couple of hours looking around the cathedral they walked down the hill to the station a modern stone building the same color as the cathedral they entered a square lobby in tan marble there was a queue at the ticket window that was good it meant local people were optimistic that there would be a train soon greta and jelly were in the queue but there was no sign of diana and maude who must already be on the platform they stood in line in front of an antiresistance poster showing a thug with a gun and stalin behind him it read they murder wrapped in the folds of our flag thats supposed to be me flick thought they bought their tickets without incident on the way to the platform they had to pass a gestapo checkpoint and flicks pulse beat faster greta and jelly were ahead of them in line this would be their first encounter with the enemy flick prayed they would be able to keep their nerve diana and maude must have already passed through greta spoke to the gestapo men in german flick could clearly hear her giving her cover story i know a major remmer said one of the men a sergeant is he an engineer no hes in intelligence greta replied she seemed remarkably calm and flick reflected that pretending to be something she was not must be second nature to her you must like cathedrals he said conversationally theres nothing else to see in this dump yes he turned to jellys papers and began to speak french you travel everywhere with frau remmer yes shes very kind to me jelly replied flick heard the tremor in her voice and knew that she was terrified the sergeant said did you see the bishops palace thats quite a sight greta replied in french we didvery impressive the sergeant was looking at jelly waiting for her response she looked dumbstruck for a moment then she said the bishops wife was very gracious flicks heart sank into her boots jelly could speak perfect french but she knew nothing about any foreign country she did not realize that it was only in the church of england that bishops could have wives france was catholic and priests were celibate jelly had given herself away at the first check what would happen now flicks sten gun with the skeleton butt and the silencer was in her suitcase disassembled into three parts but she had her personal browning automatic in the worn leather shoulder bag she carried now she discreetly unzipped the bag for quick access to her gun and she saw ruby put her right hand in her raincoat pocket where her pistol was wife the sergeant said to jelly what wife jelly just looked nonplussed you are french he said of course greta stepped in quickly not his wife his housekeeper she said in french it was a plausible explanation in that language a wife was une femme and a housekeeper was une femme de menage jelly realized she had made a mistake and said yes of course his housekeeper i meant to say flick held her breath the sergeant hesitated for a moment longer then shrugged and handed back their papers i hope you wont have to wait too long for a train he said reverting to german greta and jelly walked on and flick allowed herself to breathe again when she and ruby got to the head of the line they were about to hand over their papers when two uniformed french gendarmes jumped the queue they paused at the checkpoint and gave the germans a sketchy salute but did not offer their papers the sergeant nodded and said go ahead if i were running security here flick thought id tighten up on that point anyone could pretend to be a cop but the germans were overly deferential to people in uniform that was part of the reason they had let their country be taken over by psychopaths then it was her turn to tell her story to the gestapo youre cousins the sergeant said looking from her to ruby and back again not much resemblance is there flick said with a cheerful air she did not feel there was none at all flick had blonde hair green eyes and fair skin whereas ruby had dark hair and black eyes she looks like a gypsy he said rudely flick pretended to be indignant well shes not by way of explanation for rubys coloring she added her mother my uncles wife came from naples he shrugged and addressed ruby how did your parents die in a train derailed by saboteurs she said the resistance yes my sympathies young lady those people are animals he handed the papers back thank you sir said ruby flick just nodded they walked on it had not been an easy checkpoint i hope theyre not all like that flick thought my heart wont stand it diana and maude had gone to the bar flick looked through the window and saw they were drinking champagne she felt cross soes thousandfranc notes were not for that purpose besides diana should realize she needed her wits about her at every second but there was nothing flick could do about it now greta and jelly were sitting on a bench jelly looked chastened no doubt because her life had just been saved by someone she thought of as a foreign pervert flick wondered whether her attitude would improve now she and ruby found another bench some distance away and sat down to wait over the next few hours more and more people crowded onto the platform there were men in suits who looked as if they might be lawyers or local government officials with business in paris some relatively welldressed french women and a scattering of germans in uniform the jackdaws having money and forged ration books were able to get pain noir and ersatz coffee from the bar it was eleven oclock when a train pulled in the coaches were full and not many people got off so flick and ruby had to stand greta and jelly did too but diana and maude managed to get seats in a sixperson compartment with two middleaged women and the two gendarmes the gendarmes worried flick she managed to squeeze into a place right outside the compartment from where she could look through the glass and keep an eye on them fortunately the combination of a restless night and the champagne they had drunk at the station put diana and maude to sleep as soon as the train pulled out of the station they chugged slowly through woods and rolling fields an hour later the two french women got off the train and flick and ruby quickly slid into the vacated seats however flick regretted the decision almost immediately the gendarmes both in their twenties immediately struck up a conversation delighted to have some girls to talk to during the long journey their names were christian and jeanmarie both appeared to be in their twenties christian was handsome with curly black hair and brown eyes jeanmarie had a shrewd foxy face with a fair mustache christian the talkative one was in the middle seat and ruby sat next to him flick was on the opposite banquette with maude beside her slumped the other way with her head on dianas shoulder the gendarmes were traveling to paris to pick up a prisoner they said it was nothing to do with the war he was a local man who had murdered his wife and stepson then fled to paris where he had been caught by the flics the city police and had confessed it was their job to bring him back to chartres to stand trial christian reached into his tunic pocket and pulled out the handcuffs they would put on him as if to prove to flick that he was not boasting in the next hour flick learned everything there was to know about christian she was expected to reciprocate so she had to elaborate her cover story far beyond the basic facts she had figured out beforehand it strained her imagination but she told herself this was good practice for a more hostile interrogation they passed versailles and crawled through bombravaged train yards at st quentin maude woke up she remembered to speak french but she forgot that she was not supposed to know flick so she said hello where are we do you know the gendarmes looked puzzled flick had told them she and ruby had no connection with the two sleeping girls yet maude had addressed flick like a friend flick kept her nerve smiling she said you dont know me i think you have mistaken me for your friend on the other side youre still half asleep maude gave her a dontbesostupid frown then caught the eye of christian in a pantomime of comprehension she registered surprise put her hand over her mouth in horror then said unconvincingly of course youre quite right excuse me christian was not a suspicious man however and he smiled at maude and said youve been asleep for two hours were on the outskirts of pans but as you can see the train is not moving maude gave him the benefit of her most dazzling smile when do you think we will arrive there mademoiselle you ask too much of me i am merely human only god can tell the future maude laughed as if he had said something deliciously witty and flick relaxed then diana woke up and said loudly in english good god my head hurts what bloody time is it a moment later she saw the gendannes and realized instantly what she had donebut it was too late she spoke english said christian flick saw ruby reach for her gun youre british he said to diana he looked at maude you too as his gaze went around the compartment he realized the truth all of you flick reached across and grabbed rubys wrist as her gun was halfway out of her raincoat pocket christian saw the gesture looked down at what ruby had in her hand and said and armed his astonishment would have been comical if they had not been in danger of their lives diana said oh christ thats torn it the train jerked and moved forward christian lowered his voice youre all agents of the allies flick waited on tenterhooks to see what he would do if he drew his gun ruby would shoot him then they would all have to jump from the train with luck they might disappear into the slums beside the railway tracks before the gestapo was alerted the train picked up speed she wondered whether they should jump now before they were moving too fast several frozen seconds passed then christian smiled good luck he said lowering his voice to a whisper your secret is safe with us they were sympathizersthank god flick slumped with relief thank you she said christian said when will the invasion come he was naive to think that someone who really knew such a secret would reveal it so casually but to keep him motivated she said any day now maybe tuesday truly this is wonderful long live france flick said im so glad you are on our side i have always been against the germans christian puffed himself up a little in my job i have been able to render some useful services to the resistance in a discreet way he tapped the side of his nose flick did not believe him for a second no doubt he was against the germans most french people were after four years of scarce food old clothes and curfews but if he really had worked with the resistance he would not have told anyoneon the contrary he would have been terrified of people finding out however that did not matter the important thing was that he could see which way the wind was blowing and he was not going to turn allied agents over to the gestapo a few days before the invasion there was too strong a chance he would end up being punished for it the train slowed down and flick saw that they were coming into the gare dorsay station she stood up christian kissed her hand and said with a tremor in his voice you are a brave woman good luck she left the carriage first as she stepped onto the platform she saw a workman pasting up a poster something struck her as familiar she looked more closely at the poster and her heart stopped it was a picture of her she had never seen it before and she had no recollection of ever having had her photograph taken in a swimsuit the background was cloudy as if it had been painted over so there were no clues there the poster gave her name plus one of her old aliases franoise boule and said she was a murderess the workman was just finishing his task he picked up his bucket of paste and a stack of posters and moved on flick realized her picture must be all over paris this was a terrible blow she stood frozen on the platform she was so frightened she wanted to throw up then she got hold of herself her first problem was how to get out of the gare dorsay she looked along the platform and saw a checkpoint at the ticket barrier she had to assume the gestapo officers manning it had seen the picture how could she get past them she could not talk her way through if they recognized her they would arrest her and no tall tale would convince german officers to do otherwise could the jackdaws shoot their way out of this they might kill the men at the checkpoint but there would be others all over the station plus french police who would probably shoot first and ask questions later it was too risky there was a way out she realized she could hand over command of the operation to one of the othersruby probablythen let them pass through the checkpoint ahead of her and finally give herself up that way the mission would not be doomed she turned around ruby diana and maude had got off the train christian and jeanmarie were about to follow then flick remembered the handcuffs christian had in his pocket and a wild scheme occurred to her she pushed christian back into the carriage and climbed in after him he was not sure if this was some kind of joke and he smiled anxiously whats the matter look she said theres a poster of me on the wall both the gendarmes looked out christian turned pale jeanmarie said my god you really are spies you have to save me she said christian said how can we the gestapo i must get through the checkpoint but they will arrest you not if ive already been arrested what do you mean put the handcuffs on me pretend you have captured me march me through the checkpoint if they stop you say youre taking me to eightyfour avenue foch it was the address of gestapo headquarters what then commandeer a taxi get in with me then once we are clear of the station take the cuffs off and let me out in a quiet street and continue on to your real destination christian looked terrified flick could tell that he wanted with all his heart to back out but he hardly could after his big talk about the resistance jeanmarie was calmer it will work he said they wont be suspicious of police officers in uniform ruby climbed back into the carriage flick she said that poster i know the gendarmes are going to march me through the checkpoint in handcuffs and release me later if things go wrong youre in charge of the mission she switched to english forget the railway tunnel thats a cover story the real target is the telephone exchange at sainteccile but dont tell the others until the last minute now get them back in here quickly a few moments later they were all crowded into the carriage flick told them the plan then she said if this doesnt work and i get arrested whatever you do dont shoot there will be too many police at the station if you start a gun battle youll lose the mission comes first abandon me get out of the station regroup at the hotel and carry on ruby will be in command no discussion there isnt time she turned to christian the handcuffs he hesitated flick wanted to scream get on with it you bigmouthed coward but instead she lowered her voice to an intimate murmur and said thank you for saving my lifeill never forget you christian he took out the cuffs the rest of you get going flick said christian handcuffed flicks right hand to jeanmaries left then they stepped down from the train and marched along the platform three abreast christian carrying flicks suitcase and her shoulder bag with the automatic pistol in it there was a queue at the checkpoint jeanmarie said loudly stand aside there stand aside please ladies and gentlemen coming through they went straight to the head of the line as they had at chartres both gendarmes saluted the gestapo officers but they did not stop however the captain in charge of the checkpoint looked up from the identity card he was examining and said quietly wait all three stood still flick knew she was very near death the captain looked hard at flick shes the one on the poster christian seemed too scared to speak after a moment jeanmarie answered the question yes captain we arrested her in chartres flick thanked heaven that one of them had a cool head well done said the captain but where are you taking her jeanmarie continued to answer our orders are to deliver her to avenue foch do you need transport there is a police vehicle waiting for us outside the station the captain nodded but still did not dismiss them he continued to stare at flick she began to think there was something about her appearance that had given away her subterfuge something in her face that told him she was only pretending to be a prisoner finally he said these british they send little girls to do their fighting for them he shook his head in disbelief jeanmarie sensibly kept his mouth shut at last the captain said carry on flick and the gendarmes marched through the checkpoint and out into the sunshine chapter paul chancellor had been angry with percy thwaite violently angry when he found out about the message from brian standish you deceived me paul had shouted at percy you deliberately made sure i was out of the way before you showed it to flick its true but it seemed best im in commandyou have no right to withhold information from me i thought you would have aborted the flight perhaps i would havemaybe i should have but you would have done it for love of flick not because it was right operationally there percy had touched pauls weak spot for paul had compromised his position as leader by sleeping with one of his team that had made him more angry but he had been forced to suppress his rage they could not contact flicks plane for flights over enemy territory had to observe radio silence so the two men had stayed at the airfield all night smoking and pacing and worrying about the woman they both in different ways loved paul had in his shirt pocket the wooden french toothbrush he and flick had shared on friday morning after their night together he was not normally superstitious but he kept touching it as if he were touching her making sure she was okay when the plane returned and the pilot told them how flick had become suspicious of the reception committee at chatelle and had eventually dropped near chartres paul had been so relieved he almost wept minutes later percy had taken a call from soe headquarters in london and had learned of brian standishs message demanding to know what had gone wrong paul had decided to respond by sending the reply drafted by flick and brought home by her pilot in case brian was still at liberty it told him that the jackdaws had landed and would contact him but it gave no further information because of the possibility that he was in the hands of the gestapo still no one was sure what had happened out there the uncertainty was unbearable for paul flick had to go to reims one way or another he had to know whether she was walking into a gestapo trap surely there must be a way to check whether brians transmissions were genuine his signals bore the correct security tags percy doublechecked but the gestapo knew about security tags and they could easily have tortured brian to learn his there were subtler methods of checking percy said but they depended on the girls at the listening station so paul had decided to go there at first percy had resisted it was dangerous for operational people to descend on signals units he said they disrupted the smooth running of the service for hundreds of agents paul ignored that then the head of the station said he would be delighted for paul to make an appointment to visit in say two or three weeks no paul had said two or three hours is what i had in mind he had insisted gently but firmly using the threat of montys wrath as a last resort and so he had gone to grendon underwood as a small boy in sunday school paul had been vexed by a theological problem he had noticed that in arlington virginia where he was living with his parents most of the children of his age went to bed at the same time seventhirty that meant they were saying their prayers simultaneously with all those voices rising to heaven how could god hear what he paul was saying he was not satisfied with the answer of the pastor who just said that god could do anything little paul knew that was an evasion the question troubled him for years if he could have seen grendon underwood he would have understood like god the special operations executive had to listen to innumerable messages and it often happened that scores of them came in at the same time secret agents in their hideaways were all tapping their morse keys simultaneously like the nineyearolds of arlington kneeling at their bedsides at half past seven soe heard them all grendon underwood was another grand country house vacated by the owners and taken over by the military officially called station a it was a listening post in its extensive grounds were radio aerials grouped in great arcs like the ears of god listening to messages that came from anywhere between the arctic north of norway to the dusty south of spain four hundred wireless operators and coders most of them young women in the fanys worked in the big house and lived in nissen huts hastily erected on the grounds paul was shown around by a supervisor jean bevins a heavy woman with spectacles at first she was terrified of the visiting big shot who represented montgomery himself but paul smiled and talked softly and made her feel at ease she took him to the transmitting room where a hundred or so girls sat in rows each with headphones notebook and pencils a big board showed agents code names and scheduled times for transmissionknown as skeds and always pronounced the american wayand the frequencies they would use there was an atmosphere of intense concentration the only sound being the tap of morse code as an operator told an agent she was receiving him loud and clear jean introduced paul to lucy briggs a pretty blonde girl with a yorkshire accent so strong that he had to concentrate hard to understand her helicopter she said aye i know helicopterhes new he calls in at twenty hundred hours and receives at twentythree hundred no problems so far she never pronounced the letter aitch once paul realized that he began to find it easier to interpret the accent what do you mean he asked her what sort of problems do you get well some of them dont tune the transmitter right so you have to search for the frequency then the signal may be weak so that you cant hear the letters very well and you worry that you might be mistaking dashes for dotsthe letter b is very like d for instance and the tone is always bad from those little suitcase radios because theyre so small would you recognize his fist she looked dubious hes only broadcast three times on wednesday he was a bit nervous probably because it was his first but his pace was steady as if he knew he had plenty of time i was pleasedi thought he must feel reasonably safe we worry about them you know were sitting here nice and warm and theyre somewhere behind enemy lines dodging the bloody gestapo what about his second broadcast that was thursday and he was rushed when theyre in a hurry it can be difficult to be sure what they meanyou know was that two dots run together or a short dash wherever he was sending from he wanted to get out of there fast and then friday he didnt broadcast but i didnt worry they dont call unless they have to its too dangerous then he came on the air on saturday morning just before dawn it was an emergency message but he didnt sound panicky in fact i remember thinking to myself hes getting the hang of this you know it was a strong signal the rhythm was steady all the letters clear could it have been someone else using his transmitter that time she looked thoughtful it sounded like him but yes it could have been someone else i suppose and if it was a german pretending to be him they would sound nice and steady wouldnt they because theyd have nothing to fear paul felt as if he were wading through gumbo every question he asked had two answers he yearned for something definite he had to fight down panic every time he recalled to mind the dreadful prospect that he might lose flick less than a week after she had come into his life like a gift from the gods jean had disappeared and returned now with a sheaf of papers in a plump hand ive brought the decrypts of the three signals received from helicopter she said her quiet efficiency pleased him he looked at the first sheet call sign hlcp helicopter security tag present may message reads arrived ok stop cryt rendevous unsafe stop nabbed by ggestapo but got away stop in future rendezvous at cafe de la gare over he cant spell for nuts paul commented its not his spelling jean said they always make errors in the morse we order the decoders to leave them in the decrypt rather than tidy them up in case theres some significance brians second transmission giving the strength of the bollinger circuit was longer callsign hlcp helicopter security tag present may message reads activ agents nomber five as folows stop monet who is wouned stop comtesse ok stop cheval helps oca sionly stop bourgeoise still im place stop plus my rescuer cod name charenton stop paul looked up this is much worse lucy said i told you he was in a rush the second time there was more of the second message mainly a detailed account of the incident at the cathedral paul went on to the third callsign hlcp helicopter security tag present jun message reads what the devil happened query send instructions stop reply imediately over hes improving paul said only one mistake i thought he was more relaxed on saturday lucy said either that or someone else sent the signal suddenly paul thought he saw a way to test whether brian was himself or a gestapo impersonator if it worked it would at least give him certainty lucy do you ever make mistakes in transmission hardly ever she threw an anxious glance at her supervisor if a new girl is a bit careless the agent will kick up a hell of a stink quite rightly too there should never be any mistakesthe agents have enough problems to cope with paul turned to jean if i draft a message would you encode it exactly as it is it would be a kind of test of course he looked at his watch it was seventhirty pm he should broadcast at eight can you send it then the supervisor said yes when he calls in well just tell him to stand by to receive an emergency message immediately after transmission paul sat down thought for a moment then wrote on a pad give your arms how man automats how my stens also ammo how mny rounds ech plus gredanes reply immmediatly he considered it for a moment it was an unreasonable request phrased in a highhanded tone and it appeared to be carelessly encoded and transmitted he showed it to jean she frowned thats a terrible message id be ashamed of it what do you think an agents reaction would be she gave a humorless laugh he would send an angry reply with a few swear words in it please encode it exactly as it is and send it to helicopter she looked troubled if thats what you wish yes please of course she took it away paul went in search of food the canteen operated twentyfour hours a day as the station did but the coffee was tasteless and there was nothing to eat but some stale sandwiches and driedup cake a few minutes after eight oclock the supervisor came into the canteen helicopter called in to say he had had no word yet from leopardess were sending him the emergency message now thank you it would take brianor his gestapo impersonatorat least an hour to decode the message compose a reply encode it and transmit it paul stared at his plate wondering how the british had the nerve to call this a sandwich two pieces of white bread smeared with margarine and one thin slice of ham no mustard chapter the redlight district of paris was a neighborhood of narrow dirty streets on a low hill behind the rue de la chapelle not far from the gare du nord at its heart was la charbo the rue de la charbonnišre on the north side of the street the convent of la chapelle stood like a marble statue in a junkyard the convent consisted of a tiny church and a house where eight nuns dedicated their lives to helping the most wretched of parisians they made soup for starving old men talked depressed women out of suicide dragged drunk sailors from the gutter and taught the children of prostitutes to read and write next door to the convent stood the hotel de la chapelle the hotel was not exactly a brothel for there were no whores in residence but when the place was not full the proprietress was willing to rent rooms by the hour to heavily madeup women in cheap evening gowns who arrived with fat french businessmen furtive german soldiers or naive young men too drunk to see straight flick walked through the door with a mighty sense of relief the gendarmes had dropped her off half a mile away she had seen two copies of her wanted poster on the way christian had given her his handkerchief a clean cotton square red with white dots and she had tied it over her head in an attempt to hide her blonde hair but she knew that anyone who looked hard at her would recognize her from the poster there had been nothing she could do but keep her eyes down and her fingers crossed it had seemed like the longest walk of her life the proprietress was a friendly overweight woman wearing a pink silk bathrobe over a whalebone corset she had once been voluptuous flick guessed flick had stayed at the place before but the proprietress did not appear to remember her flick addressed her as madame but she said call me regine she took flicks money and gave her a room key without asking any questions flick was about to go upstairs to her room when she glanced through the window and saw diana and maude arriving in a strange kind of taxi a sofa on wheels attached to a bicycle their brush with the gendarmes did not seem to have sobered them and they were giggling about the vehicle good god what a dump said diana when she walked in the door perhaps we can eat out paris restaurants had continued to operate during the occupation but inevitably many of their customers were german officers and agents avoided them if they could dont even think about it flick said crossly were going to lie low here for a few hours then go to the gare de lest at first light maude looked accusingly at diana you promised to take me to the ritz flick controlled her temper what world are you living in she hissed at maude all right keep your hair on nobody leaves is that understood yes yes one of us will go out and buy food later i have to get out of sight now diana you sit here and wait for the others while maude checks into your room let me know when everyones arrived climbing the stairs flick passed a negro girl in a tight red dress and noticed that she had a full head of straight black hair wait flick said to her will you sell me your wig you can buy one yourself around the corner honey she looked flick up and down taking her for an amateur hooker but frankly id say you need more than a wig im in a hurry the girl pulled it off to reveal black curls cropped close to her scalp i cant work without it flick took a thousandfranc note from her jacket pocket buy yourself another she looked at flick with new eyes realizing she had too much money to be a prostitute with a shrug she accepted the money and handed over the wig thank you said flick the girl hesitated no doubt she was wondering how many more of those notes flick had i do girls too she said she reached out and brushed flicks breast lightly with her fingertips no thanks maybe you and your boyfriend the girl looked at the thousandfranc note well i guess this is my night off good luck honey thanks said flick i need it she found her room put her case on the bed and took off her jacket there was a small mirror over a washbasin flick washed her hands then stood looking at her face for a moment she combed her short blonde hair back over her ears and pinned it with hair clips then she put on the wig and adjusted it it was a bit big but it would stay on the black hair altered her appearance radically however her fair eyebrows now looked peculiar she took the eyebrow pencil from her makeup kit and darkened them that was much better not only did she look like a brunette she seemed more formidable than the sweet girl in the swimsuit she had the same straight nose and severe chin but that seemed like a family resemblance between two otherwise differentlooking sisters next she took her identity papers from her jacket pocket with great care she retouched the photograph using the eyebrow pencil to draw faint lines of dark hair and narrow dark eyebrows when she was done she looked hard at the picture she did not think anyone would be able to tell it had been doctored unless they rubbed it hard enough to smear the pencil marks she took off the wig stepped out of her shoes and lay on the bed she had not slept for two nights because she had spent thursday night making love to paul and friday night on the metal floor of a hudson bomber now she closed her eyes and dropped off within seconds she was awakened by a knock at the door to her surprise it was getting dark she had slept for several hours she went to the door and said who is it ruby she let her in is everything all right im not sure flick closed the curtains then switched on the light whats happened everyone has checked in but i dont know where diana and maude are theyre not in their room where have you looked the proprietresss office the little church next door the bar across the street oh christ flick said in dismay the bloody fools theyve gone out where would they have gone maude wanted to go to the ritz ruby was incredulous they cant be that stupid maude can but i thought diana had more sense dianas in love flick said i suppose shell do anything maude asks and she wants to impress her paramour take her to swanky places show that she knows her way around the world of high society they say love is blind in this case love is bloody suicidal i cant believe itbut i bet thats where theyve gone it will serve them right if they end up dead whatll we do go to the ritz and get them out of thereif were not too late flick put on her wig ruby said i wondered why your eyebrows had gone dark its effective you look like someone else good get your gun in the lobby rgine handed flick a note it was addressed in dianas handwriting flick ripped it open and read were going to a better hotel well meet you at the gare de lest at am dont worry she showed it to ruby then ripped it to shreds she was most angry with herself she had known diana all her life it was no surprise that she was foolish and irresponsible why did i bring her she asked herself because i had no one else was the answer they left the flophouse flick did not want to use the metro for she knew there were gestapo checkpoints at some stations and occasional spot checks on the trains the ritz was in the place vendme a brisk halfhour walk from la charbo the sun had gone down and night was falling fast they would have to keep an eye on the time there was an eleven oclock curfew flick wondered how long it would take the ritz staff to call the gestapo about diana and maude they would have known immediately that there was something odd about them their papers said they were secretaries from reimswhat were two such women doing at the ritz they were dressed respectably enough by the standards of occupied france but they certainly did not look like typical ritz clientsthe wives of diplomats from neutral countries the girlfriends of black marketers or the mistresses of german officers the hotel manager himself might not do anything especially if he was antinazi but the gestapo had informants in every large hotel and restaurant in the city and strangers with implausible stories were just what they were paid to report this kind of detail was drummed into people on soes training coursebut that course lasted three months and diana and maude had been given only two days flick quickened her step chapter dieter was exhausted to get a thousand posters printed and distributed in half a day had taken all his powers of persuasion and intimidation he had been patient and persistent when he could and had flown into a mad rage when necessary in addition he had not slept the previous night his nerves were jangled he had a headache and his temper was short but a feeling of peace descended on him as soon as he entered the grand apartment building at the porte de la muette overlooking the bois de boulogne the job he had been doing for rommel required him to travel all over northern france so he needed to be based in paris but getting this place had taken a lot of bribery and bullying it had been worth it he loved the dark mahogany paneling the heavy curtains the high ceilings the eighteenthcentury silver on the sideboard he walked around the cool dim apartment renewing his acquaintance with his favorite possessions a small rodin sculpture of a hand a degas pastel of a dancer putting on a ballet slipper a first edition of the count of monte cristo he sat at the steinway baby grand piano and played a languid version of aint misbehavin no one to talk with all by myself before the war the apartment and much of the furniture had belonged to an engineer from lyon who had made a fortune manufacturing small electrical goods vacuum cleaners and radios and doorbells dieter had learned this from a neighbor a rich widow whose husband had been a leading french fascist in the thirties the engineer was a vulgarian she said he had hired people to choose the right wallpaper and antiques for him the only purpose of objects of beauty had been to impress his wifes friends he had gone to america where everyone was vulgar said the widow she was pleased the apartment now had a tenant who really appreciated it dieter took off his jacket and shirt and washed the paris grime from his face and neck then he put on a clean white shirt inserted gold links in the french cuffs and chose a silvergray tie while he was tying it he switched on the radio the news from italy was bad the newscaster said the germans were fighting a fierce rearguard action dieter concluded that rome must fall in the next few days but italy was not france he now had to wait for someone to spot felicity clairet he could not be certain she would pass through paris of course but it was undoubtedly the likeliest place after reims for her to be seen anyway there was nothing more he could do he wished he had brought stephanie with him from reims however he needed her to occupy the house in the rue du bois there was a chance that more allied agents would land and find their way to her door it was important to draw them gently into the net he had left instructions that neither michel nor dr bouler was to be tortured in his absence he might yet have uses for them there was a bottle of dom perignon champagne in the icebox he opened it and poured some into a crystal flute then with a feeling that life was good he sat down at his desk to read his mail there was a letter from his wife waltraud my beloved dieter i am so sorry we will not be together on your fortieth birthday dieter had forgotten his birthday he looked at the date on his cartier desk clock it was june he was forty years old today he poured another glass of champagne to celebrate in the envelope from his wife were two other missives his sevenyearold daughter margarete known as mausi had drawn a picture of him in uniform standing by the eiffel tower in the picture he was taller than the tower so children magnified their fathers his son rudi ten years old had written a grownup letter carefully rounded letters in dark blue ink my dear papa i am doing well in school although dr richters classroom has been bombed fortunately it was nighttime and the school was empty dieter closed his eyes in pain he could not bear the thought of bombs falling on the city where his children lived he cursed the murderers of the raf even though he knew german bombs had fallen on british schoolchildren he looked at the phone on his desk contemplating trying to call home it was difficult to get through the french phone system was overloaded and military traffic had priority so you could wait hours for a personal call to be connected all the same he decided to try he felt a sudden longing to hear the voices of his children and reassure himself that they were still alive he reached for the phone it rang before he touched it he picked it up major franck here this is lieutenant hesse dieters pulse quickened you have found felicity clairet no but something almost as good chapter flick had been to the ritz once when she was a student in paris before the war she and a girlfriend had put on hats and makeup gloves and stockings and walked through the door as if they did it every day they had sauntered along the hotels internal arcade of shops giggling at the absurd prices of scarves and fountain pens and perfume then they had sat in the lobby pretending they were meeting someone who was late and criticized the outfits of the women who came there to tea they themselves had not dared to order so much as a glass of water in those days flick had saved every spare penny for cheap seats at the comdie franaise since the occupation began she had heard that the owners were attempting to run the hotel as normally as possible even though many of the rooms had been taken over permanently by top nazis she had no gloves or stockings today but she had powdered her face and set her beret at a jaunty angle and she just had to hope that some of the hotels wartime patrons would be forced into similar compromises lines of gray military vehicles and black limousines were lined up outside the hotel in the place vendme on the facade of the building six blood red nazi banners flapped boastfully in the breeze a commissionaire in top hat and red trousers looked doubtfully at flick and ruby you cant come in he said flick was in a light blue suit very creased and ruby in a navy frock and a mans raincoat they were not dressed to dine at the ritz flick tried to imitate the hauteur of a french woman dealing with an irritating inferior putting her nose in the air she said what is the matter this entrance is reserved for the top brass madame even german colonels cant come in this way you have to go around to the rue cambon and use the back door as you wish flick said with an air of weary courtesy but in truth she was pleased he had not told them they were underdressed she and ruby walked quickly around the block and found the rear entrance the lobby was bright with light and the bars on either side were full of men in evening dress or uniform the buzz of conversation clicked and whirred with german consonants not the languid vowels of french flick felt as though she were walking into the enemys stronghold she went up to the desk a concierge in a coat with brass buttons looked down his nose at her judging her to be neither a german nor a wealthy french woman he said coldly what is it check whether mademoiselle legrand is in her room flick said peremptorily she assumed that diana must be using the false name on her papers simone legrand i have an appointment he backed off may i tell her who is inquiring madame martigny i am her employee very good in fact mademoiselle is in the rear dining room with her companion perhaps you would speak to the head waiter flick and ruby crossed the lobby and entered the restaurant it was a picture of elegant living white tablecloths silver cutlery candles and waiters in black gliding around the room with dishes of food no one would have guessed that half paris was starving flick smelled real coffee pausing on the threshold she immediately saw diana and maude they were at a small table on the far side of the room as flick watched diana took a bottle of wine out of a gleaming bucket beside the table and poured for maude and herself flick could have throttled her she turned to make for the table but the head waiter stood in her way pointedly looking at her cheap suit he said yes madame good evening she said i must speak with that lady over there he did not move he was a small man with a worried air but he was not to be bullied perhaps i can give her a message for you im afraid not its too personal then i will tell her that you are here the name flick glared in dianas direction but diana did not look up i am madame martigny flick said giving up tell her i must speak to her immediately very well if madame would care to wait here flick ground her teeth with frustration as the head waiter walked away she was tempted just to run past him then she noticed a young man in the black uniform of an ss major at a nearby table staring at her she met his eye and looked away fear rising in her throat had he merely taken an idle interest in her altercation with the head waiter was he trying to remember where he had seen her before having seen the poster but not yet made the connection or did he simply find her attractive in any event flick realized it would be dangerous for her to make a fuss every second she stood here was dangerous she resisted the temptation to turn and run the head waiter spoke to diana then turned and beckoned flick flick said to ruby youd better wait hereone is less conspicuous than two then she walked quickly across the room to dianas table neither diana nor maude had the grace to look guilty flick observed angrily maude appeared pleased with herself diana haughty flick put her hands on the edge of the table and leaned forward to speak in a low voice this is terribly dangerous get up now and leave with me well pay the bill on the way out she had been as forceful as she knew how but they were living in a fantasy world be reasonable flick diana said flick was outraged how could diana be such an arrogant idiot you stupid cow she said dont you realize youll get killed she saw immediately that it had been a mistake to use abuse diana looked superior its my life im entitled to take that risk youre endangering us too and the whole mission now get up off that chair look here there was a commotion behind flick diana stopped and looked past her flick turned around and gasped standing in the entrance was the welldressed german officer she had last seen in the square at sainteccile she took him in at a glance a tall figure in an elegant dark suit with a white handkerchief in the breast pocket she quickly turned her back heart pounding and prayed that he had not noticed her with her dark wig there was a good chance he would not have recognized her at first glance his name came back to her dieter franck she had found his photograph in percy thwaites files he was a former police detective she recalled the note on the back of his photo a star of rommels intelligence staff this officer is said to be a skilled interrogator and a ruthless torturer for the second time in a week she was close enough to shoot him flick did not believe in coincidence there was a reason he was here at the same time as she she soon found out what it was she looked again and saw him striding across the restaurant toward her with four gestapo types trailing him the head waiter came after them a look of panic on his face keeping her face averted flick walked away franck went straight to dianas table the whole place suddenly became quiet customers fell silent in midsentence waiters stopped serving vegetables the sommelier froze with a decanter of claret in his hand flick reached the doorway where ruby stood waiting ruby whispered hes going to arrest them her hand moved toward her gun flick again caught the eye of the ss major leave it in your pocket she murmured theres nothing we can do we might take on him and four gestapo men but were surrounded by german officers even if we killed all those five wed be mowed down by the others franck was questioning diana and maude flick could not make out the words dianas voice took on the tone of supercilious indifference she used when she was in the wrong maude became tearful franck must have asked for their papers because the two women simultaneously reached for their handbags on the floor beside their chairs franck shifted his position so that he was to one side of diana and slightly behind her looking over her shoulder and suddenly flick knew what was going to happen next maude took out her identity papers but diana pulled a gun a shot rang out and one of the uniformed gestapo men doubled over and fell the restaurant erupted women screamed men dived for cover there was a second shot and another gestapo man cried out some diners ran for the exit dianas gun hand moved toward a third gestapo man flick had a flash of memory diana in the woods at somersholme sitting on the ground smoking a cigarette with dead rabbits all around her she remembered what she had said to diana youre a killer she had been right but diana did not fire the third shot dieter franck kept a cool head he seized dianas right forearm with both his hands and banged her wrist on the edge of the table she screamed with pain and the gun fell from her grasp he yanked her out of her chair threw her facedown on the carpet and fell on her with both knees in the small of her back he pulled her hands behind her back and handcuffed her ignoring the screams of pain she gave as he jerked her injured wrist he stood up flick said to ruby lets get out of here there was a crush at the doorway panicky men and women all trying to pass through at the same time before flick could move the young ss major who had been staring at her earlier sprang to his feet and grabbed her arm wait a moment he said in french flick fought down panic take your hands off me he tightened his grip you seem to know those women over there he said no i dont she tried to move away he pulled her back with a jerk youd better stay here and answer some questions there was another shot several women screamed but no one knew where the shot had come from the ss officers face twisted in a grimace of agony as he slumped to the floor flick saw ruby behind him slipping her pistol back into her raincoat pocket they both forced their way through the crowd at the door shoving ruthlessly and burst out into the lobby they were able to run without drawing attention to themselves because everyone else was running cars were parked in a line along the curb in the rue cambon some of them attended by chauffeurs most of the chauffeurs were hurrying toward the hotel to see what was happening flick picked a black mercedes sedan with a spare wheel perched on the running board she looked into the front the key was in the dash get in she yelled at ruby she got behind the wheel and pulled the selfstarter a big engine rumbled into life she engaged first gear heaved the steering wheel around and accelerated away from the ritz the car was heavy and sluggish but stable at speed it cornered like a train when she was several blocks away she reviewed her position she had lost a third of her team including her best marksman she considered whether to abandon the mission and immediately decided to carry on it would be awkward she would have to explain why only four cleaners had come to the chfteau instead of the usual six but she could make up some excuse it meant they might be questioned more closely but she would take that risk she dumped the car in the rue de la chapelle she and ruby were out of immediate danger they walked quickly to the flophouse ruby rounded up greta and jelly and brought them to flicks room she told them what had happened diana and maude will be questioned immediately she said dieter franck is a capable and ruthless interrogator so we have to assume they will tell everything they knowincluding the address of this hotel that means the gestapo could be here at any moment we have to leave right away jelly was crying poor maude she said she was a silly cow but she didnt deserve to be tortured greta was more practical where will we go well hide in the convent next door to the flophouse theyll take anyone in ive hidden escaped prisoners of war there before now theyll let us stay until daybreak then what well go to the station as planned diana is going to tell dieter franck our real names our code names and our false identities he will put out an alert for anyone traveling under our aliases fortunately i have a spare set of papers for all of us using the same photographs but different identities the gestapo dont have photographs of you three and ive changed my appearance so the checkpoint guards will have no way of recognizing us however to be safe we wont go to the station at first lightwell wait until about ten oclock when it should be busy ruby said diana will also tell them what our mission is shell tell them were going to blow up the railway tunnel at marles fortunately thats not our real mission its a cover story i gave out jelly said admiringly flick you think of everything yes she said grimly thats why im still alive chapter paul sat in the dismal canteen at grendon underwood brooding anxiously about flick for more than an hour he was beginning to believe that brian standish had been compromised the incident in the cathedral the fact that chatelle had been in total darkness and the unnatural correctness of the third radio message all pointed in the same direction in the original plan flick would have been met at chatelle by a reception committee consisting of michel and the remnants of the bollinger circuit michel would have taken them to a hideaway for a few hours then arranged transport to sainteccile after they entered the chfteau and blew up the telephone exchange he would have driven them back to chatelle to meet their pickup plane all that had changed now but flick would still need both transport and a hiding place when she got to reims and she would be relying on the bollinger circuit to help however if brian had been compromised would there be any of the circuit left was the safe house safe was michelin gestapo hands too at last lucy briggs came into the canteen and said jean asked me to tell you that helicopters reply is being decrypted now would you like to come with me he followed her to the tiny roomformerly a boot cupboard he guessedthat served as jean bevinss office jean had a sheet of paper in her hand she looked annoyed i cant understand this she said paul read it quickly callsign hlcp helicopter security tag present jun message reads two stens with six magazines for each stop one lee enfeld rifle with ten clips stop six colt automatics with approximately one hundred rounds stop no grenades over paul stared at the decrypt in dismay as if hoping the words might change to something less horrifying but of course they remained the same i expected him to be furious jean said he doesnt complain at all just answers your questions as nice as pie exactly said paul thats because its not him this message did not come from a harassed agent in the field who had been presented with a sudden unreasonable request by his bureaucratic superiors the reply had been drafted by a gestapo officer desperate to maintain the smooth appearance of calm normality the only spelling mistake was enfeld instead of enfield and even that suggested a german for feld was german for field there was no longer any doubt flick was in terrible danger paul massaged his temples with his right hand there was now only one thing to do the operation was falling apart and he had to save itand flick he looked up at jean and caught her looking at him with an expression of compassion may i use your phone he said of course he dialed baker street percy was at his desk this is paul im convinced brian has been captured his radio is being operated by the gestapo in the background jean bevins gasped oh hell percy said and without the radio we have no way to warn flick yes we do said paul how get me a plane im going to reimstonight the eighth day sunday june chapter the avenue foch seemed to have been built for the richest people in the world a wide road running from the arc de triomphe to the bois de boulogne it had ornamental gardens on both sides flanked by inner roads giving access to the palatial houses number was an elegant residence with a broad staircase leading to five stories of charming rooms the gestapo had turned it into a house of torture dieter sat in a perfectly proportioned drawing room stared at the intricately decorated ceiling for a moment then closed his eyes preparing himself for the interrogation he had to sharpen his wits and at the same time numb his feelings some men enjoyed torturing prisoners sergeant becker in reims was one they smiled when their victims screamed they got erections as they inflicted wounds and they experienced orgasms during their victims death throes but they were not good interrogators for they focused on pain rather than information the best torturers were men such as dieter who loathed the process from the bottom of their hearts now he imagined himself closing doors in his soul shutting his emotions away in cupboards he thought of the two women as pieces of machinery that would disgorge information as soon as he figured out how to switch them on he felt a familiar coldness settle over him like a blanket of snow and he knew he was ready bring the older one he said lieutenant hesse went to fetch her he watched her carefully as she came in and sat in the chair she had short hair and broad shoulders and wore a mantailored suit her right hand hung limply and she was supporting the swollen forearm with her left hand dieter had broken her wrist she was obviously in pain her face pale and gleaming with sweat but her lips were set in a line of grim determination he spoke to her in french everything that happens in this room is under your control he said the decisions you make the things you say will either cause you unbearable pain or bring you relief it is entirely up to you she said nothing she was scared but she did not panic she was going to be difficult to break he could tell already he said to begin with tell me where the london headquarters of the special operations executive is located eightyone regent street she said he nodded let me explain something i realize that soe teaches its agents not to remain silent under questioning but to give false answers that will be difficult to check because i know this i will ask you many questions to which i already know the answers this way i will know whether you are lying to me where is the london headquarters carlton house terrace he walked across to her and slapped her face as hard as he could she cried out in pain her cheek turned an angry red it was often useful to begin with a slap in the face the pain was minimal but the blow was a humiliating demonstration of the helplessness of the prisoner and it quickly sapped their initial bravery but she looked defiantly at him is that how german officers treat ladies she had a haughty manner and she spoke french with the accent of the upper classes she was some kind of aristocrat he guessed ladies he said scornfully you have just shot and killed two policemen who were going about their lawful business spechts young wife is now a widow and rolfes parents have lost their only child youre not a soldier in uniform you have no excuse in answer to your questionno this is not how we treat ladies its how we treat murderers she looked away he had scored a hit with that remark he was beginning to undermine her moral foundation tell me something else he said how well do you know flick clairet her eyes widened in an involuntary expression of surprise that told him he had guessed correctly these two were part of major clairets team he had shaken her again but she recovered her composure and said i dont know anyone of that name he reached down and knocked her left hand away she cried out in pain as her broken wrist lost its support and sagged he took her right hand and jerked it she screamed why were you having dinner at the ritz for gods sake he said he released her hand she stopped screaming he repeated the question she caught her breath and said i like the food there she was even tougher than he had thought take her away he said bring the other one the younger girl was quite pretty she had put up no resistance when arrested so she still looked presentable her dress unruffled and her makeup intact she appeared much more frightened than her colleague he asked her the question he had asked the older one why were you having dinner at the ritz ive always wanted to go there she replied he could hardly believe his ears werent you afraid it might be dangerous i thought diana would look after me so the other ones name was diana whats your name maude this was suspiciously easy and what are you doing in france maude we were supposed to blow something up what i dont remember would it have something to do with railways dieter began to wonder whether he was being led up the garden path how long have you known felicity clairet he tried do you mean flick only a few days shes awfully bossy a thought crossed her mind she was right thoughwe shouldnt have gone to the ritz she began to cry i never meant to do anything wrong i just wanted to have a good time and see places thats all ive ever wanted whats your teams code name the blackbirds she said in english he frowned the radio message to helicopter had referred to them as jackdaws are you sure yes its because of some poem the blackbird of reims i think no the jackdaw of reims thats it if she was not completely stupid she was doing a very good imitation where do you think flick is now maude thought for a long moment then said i really dont know dieter sighed in frustration one prisoner was too tough to talk the other too stupid to know anything useful this was going to take longer than he had hoped there might be a way of shortening the process he was curious about the relationship between these two why had the dominant mannish older woman risked her life to take the pretty emptyheaded girl to dinner at the ritz perhaps ive got a dirty mind he said to himself but still take her away he said in german put her in with the other one make sure the room has a judas when they had been locked away lieutenant hesse showed dieter to a small room in the attic he looked through a peephole into the room next door the two women were sitting side by side on the edge of the narrow bed maude was crying and diana was comforting her dieter watched carefully dianas broken right wrist rested in her lap with her left hand she stroked maudes hair she was talking in a low voice but dieter could not hear the words how close a relationship was this were they comrades in arms bosom friends or more diana leaned forward and kissed maudes forehead that did not mean much then diana put a forefinger on maudes chin turned the girls face to her own and kissed her lips it was a gesture of comfort but surely too intimate for a mere friend finally diana poked out the tip of her tongue and licked maudes tears that made up dieters mind it was not foreplayno one could have sex in such circumstancesbut it was the kind of comfort that would be offered only by a lover not by a mere friend diana and maude were lesbians and that solved the problem bring the older one again he said and he returned to the interview room when diana was brought in the second time he had her tied to the chair then he said prepare the electrical machinery he waited impatiently while the electric shock machine was rolled in on its trolley and plugged to a socket in the wall every minute that passed was taking flick clairet farther away from him when everything was ready he seized diana by the hair with his left hand holding her head still he attached two crocodile clips to her lower lip he turned the power on diana screamed he left it on for ten seconds then switched off when her sobbing began to ease he said that was less than half power it was true he had rarely used full power only when the torture had gone on a long time and the prisoner kept passing out was full power used in an effort to penetrate the subjects fading consciousness and by then it was generally too late for madness was setting in but diana did not know that not again she begged please please not again are you willing to answer my questions she groaned but she did not say yes dieter said bring the other one diana gasped lieutenant hesse brought maude in and tied her to a chair what do you want maude cried diana said dont say anythingits better maude was wearing a light summer blouse she had a neat trim figure with full breasts dieter tore her blouse open sending the buttons flying please maude said ill tell you anything under her blouse she wore a cotton chemise with a lacy trim he took hold of the neckline and ripped it off maude screamed he stood back and looked maudes breasts were round and firm a part of his mind noticed how pretty they were diana must love them he thought he took the crocodile clips from dianas mouth and carefully fastened one to each of maudes small pink nipples then he returned to the machine and put his hand on the control au right diana said quietly ill tell you everything dieter arranged for the railway tunnel at manes to be heavily guarded if the jackdaws got that far they would find it almost impossible to enter the tunnel he felt confident that flick would not now achieve her objective but that was secondary his burning ambition was to capture her and interrogate her it was already two oclock on sunday morning tuesday would be the night of the full moon the invasion could be hours away but in those few hours dieter could break the back of the french resistanceif he could get flick in a torture chamber he only needed the list of names and addresses that she had in her head the gestapo in every city in france could be galvanized into action thousands of trained staff they were not the brightest of men but they knew how to arrest people in a couple of hours they could jail hundreds of resistance cadres instead of the massive uprising that the allies were no doubt hoping for to aid their invasion there would be calm and order for the germans to organize their response and push the invaders back into the sea he had sent a gestapo team to raid the hotel de la chapelle but that was a matter of form he was certain flick and the other three would have left within minutes of the arrest of their comrades where was flick now reims was the natural jumpingoff point for an attack on marles which was why the jackdaws had originally planned to land near the city dieter thought it likely flick would still pass through reims it was on the road and rail routes to marles and there was probably some kind of help she needed from the remnants of the bollinger circuit he was betting she was now on her way from paris to reims he arranged for every gestapo checkpoint between the two cities to be given details of the false identities being used by flick and her team however that too was something of a formality either they had alternative identities or they would find ways to avoid the checkpoints he called reims got weber out of bed and explained the situation for once weber was not obstructive he agreed to send two gestapo men to keep an eye on michels town house two more to watch gilbertes building and two to the house in the rue du bois to guard stephanie finally as the headache began dieter called stephanie the british terrorists are on their way to reims he told her im sending two men to guard you she was as calm as ever thank you but its important that you continue to go to the rendezvous with luck flick would not suspect the extent to which dieter had penetrated the bollinger circuit and she would walk into his arms remember we changed the location its not the cathedral crypt any more its the caf de la gare if anyone shows up just drive them back to the house the way you did with helicopter then the gestapo can take over from that point okay are you sure ive minimized the risk to you but its still dangerous im sure you sound as if you have a migraine its just beginning do you have the medicine hans has it im sorry im not there to give it to you he was too i wanted to drive back to reims tonight but i dont think i can make it dont you dare ill be fine take a shot and go to bed come back here tomorrow he knew she was right it was going to be hard enough getting back to his apartment less than a kilometer away he could not travel to reims until he had recovered from the strain of the interrogation okay he said ill get a few hours sleep and leave here in the morning happy birthday you remembered i forgot it myself i have something for you a gift more like an action he grinned despite his headache oh boy ill give it to you tomorrow i cant wait i love you the words i love you too came to his lips but he hesitated reluctant from old habit to say them and then there was a click as stephanie hung up chapter in the early hours of sunday morning paul chancellor parachuted into a potato field near the village of laroque west of reims without the benefitor the riskof a reception committee the landing gave him a tremendous jolt of pain in his wounded knee he grit his teeth and lay motionless on the ground waiting for it to ease the knee would probably hurt him every so often for the rest of his life when he was an old man he would say a twinge meant rainif he lived to be an old man after five minutes he felt able to struggle to his feet and get out of his parachute harness he found the road oriented himself by the stars and started walking but he was limping badly and progress was slow his identity hastily cobbled together by percy thwaite was that of a schoolteacher from epernay a few miles west he was hitchhiking to reims to visit his father who was ill percy had got him all the necessary papers some of them hastily forged last night and rushed to tempsford by motorcycle the limp fitted quite well with the cover story a wounded veteran might well be a schoolteacher whereas an active young man should have been sent to a labor camp in germany getting here was the simple part now he had to find flick his only way of contacting her would be via the bollinger circuit he had to hope that part of the circuit was left intact and brian was the only member in gestapo custody like every new agent dropping in to reims he would contact mademoiselle lemas he would just have to be especially cautious soon after first light he heard a vehicle he stepped off the road into the field alongside and concealed himself behind a row of vines as the noise came closer he realized the vehicle was a tractor that was safe enough the gestapo never traveled by tractor he returned to the road and thumbed a lift the tractor was driven by a boy of about fifteen and was pulling a cartload of artichokes the driver nodded at pauls leg and said war wound yes paul said the likeliest moment for a french soldier to have been hurt was during the battle of france so he added sedan nineteenforty i was too young the boy said regretfully lucky you but wait till the allies come back then youll see some action he gave paul a sideways look i cant say any more but you wait and see paul thought hard was this lad a member of the bollinger circuit he said but do our people have the guns and ammunition they need if the boy knew anything at all he would know that the allies had dropped tons of weaponry in the past few months well use whatever weapons come to hand was he being discreet about what he knew no paul thought the boy looked vague he was fantasizing paul said no more the lad dropped him off on the outskirts and he limped into town the rendezvous had changed from the cathedral crypt to the caf de la gare but the time was the same three oclock in the afternoon he had hours to kill he went into the caf to get breakfast and reconnoitre he asked for black coffee the elderly waiter raised his eyebrows and paul realized he had made a slip hastily he tried to cover up no need to say black i suppose he said you probably dont have any milk anyway the waiter smiled reassured unfortunately not he went away paul breathed out it was eight months since he had been undercover in france and he had forgotten the minutetominute strain of pretending to be someone else he spent the morning dozing through services in the cathedral then went back into the caf at onethirty for lunch the place emptied out around twothirty and he stayed drinking ersatz coffee two men came in at two fortyfive and ordered beer paul looked hard at them they wore old business suits and talked about grapes in colloquial french they were eruditely discussing the flowering of the vines a critical period that had just ended he did not think they could possibly be agents of the gestapo at exactly three oclock a tall attractive woman came in dressed with unobtrusive elegance in a summer frock of plain green cotton and a straw hat she wore odd shoes one black one brown this must be bourgeoise paul was a little surprised he had expected an older woman however that was probably an unwarranted assumption flick had never actually described her all the same he was not yet ready to trust her he got up and left the caf he walked along the pavement to the railway station and stood in the entrance watching the caf he was not conspicuous as usual there were several people hanging around the station waiting to meet friends he monitored the cafs clientele a woman walked by with a child who was demanding pastry and as they reached the caf the mother gave in and took the child inside the two grape experts left a gendarme went in and came out immediately with a packet of cigarettes in his hand paul began to believe this was not a gestapo trap there was no one in sight who looked remotely dangerous changing the location of the rendezvous had shaken them off only one thing puzzled him when brian standish had been caught at the cathedral he had been rescued by bourgeoises friend charenton where was he today if he had been keeping an eye on her in the cathedral why not here too but the circumstance was not dangerous in itself and there could be a hundred simple explanations the mother and child left the caf then at three thirty bourgeoise came out she walked along the pavement away from the station paul followed on the other side of the street she went up to a small black car of italian design the one the french called a simca cinq paul crossed the street she got into the car and started the engine it was time for paul to decide he could not be sure this was safe but he had gone as far as he could with caution short of not making the rendezvous at all at some point risks had to be taken otherwise he might as well have stayed at home he went up to the car on the passenger side and opened the door she looked coolly at him monsieur pray for me he said i pray for peace paul got into the car giving himself a code name he said i am danton she pulled away why didnt you speak to me in the caf she said i saw you as soon as i walked in you made me wait there half an hour its dangerous i wanted to be sure this wasnt a trap she glanced over at him you heard what happened to helicopter yes wheres your friend who rescued him charenton she headed south driving fast hes working today on sunday what does he do fireman hes on duty that explained that paul moved quickly to the real purpose of his visit wheres helicopter she shook her head no idea my house is a cutout i meet people i pass them on to monet im not supposed to know anything is monet all right yes he phoned me on thursday afternoon checking up on charenton not since no but thats not unusual when did you last see him in person ive never seen him have you heard from leopardess paul brooded as the car threaded through the suburbs bourgeoise really had no information for him he would have to move to the next link in the chain she pulled into a courtyard alongside a tall house come inside and get cleaned up she said he got out of the car everything seemed to be in order bourgeoise had been at the right rendezvous and had given all the correct signals and there had been no one following her on the other hand she had given him no useful information and he still had no notion how deeply the bollinger circuit had been penetrated nor how much danger flick was in as bourgeoise led him to the front door and opened it with her key he touched the wooden toothbrush in his shirt pocket it was frenchmade so he had been permitted to bring it with him now an impulse seized him as bourgeoise stepped into the house he slipped the toothbrush from his pocket and dropped it on the ground just in front of the door he followed her inside big place he said it had dark oldfashioned wallpaper and heavy furniture quite out of character with its owner have you been here long i inherited it three or four years ago id like to redecorate but you cant get the materials she opened a door and stood aside for him to go first come into the kitchen he stepped inside and saw two men in uniform both held automatic pistols and both guns were pointed at paul chapter dieters car suffered a puncture on the rn road between paris and meaux a bent nail was stuck in the tire the delay irritated him and he paced the roadside restlessly but lieutenant hesse jacked up the car and changed the wheel with calm efficiency and they were on their way again within a few minutes dieter had slept late under the influence of the morphine injection hans had given him in the early hours and now he watched with impatience as the ugly industrial landscape east of paris changed gradually to farming country he wanted be in reims he had set a trap for flick clairet and he needed to be there when she fell into it the big hispanosuiza flew along an arrowstraight road lined with poplarsa road probably built by the romans at the start of the war dieter had thought the third reich would be like the roman empire a paneuropean hegemony that would bring unprecedented peace and prosperity to all its subjects now he was not so sure he worried about his mistress stephanie was in danger and he was responsible everyones life was at risk now he told himself modern warfare put the entire population on the front line the best way to protect stephanieand himself and his family in germanywas to defeat the invasion but there were moments when he cursed himself for involving his lover so closely in his mission he was playing a risky game and using her in an exposed position resistance fighters did not take prisoners being in constant peril themselves they had no scruples about killing french people who collaborated with the enemy the thought that stephanie might be killed made his chest tighten and his breathing difficult he could hardly contemplate life without her the prospect seemed dismal and he realized he must be in love with her he had always told himself that she was just a beautiful courtesan and he was using her the way men always used such women now he saw that he had been fooling himself and he wished all the more that he was already in reims at her side it was sunday afternoon so there was little traffic on the road and they made good progress the second puncture occurred when they were less than an hour from reims dieter wanted to scream with frustration it was another bent nail were wartime tires poor quality he wondered or did french people deliberately drop their old nails on the road knowing that nine vehicles out of ten were driven by the occupying forces the car did not have a second spare wheel so the tire had to be mended before they could drive on they left the car and walked after a mile or so they came to a farmhouse a large family was sitting around the remains of a substantial sunday lunch on the table were cheese and strawberries and several empty wine bottles country folk were the only french people who were well fed dieter bullied the farmer into hitching up his horse and cart and driving them to the next town in the town square was a single gas pump on the pavement outside a wheelwrights shop with a closed sign in the window they banged on the door and woke a surly garagisre from his sundayafternoon nap the mechanic fired up an ancient truck and drove off with hans beside him dieter sat in the living room of the mechanics house stared at by three small children in ragged clothes the mechanics wife a tired woman with dirty hair bustled about in the kitchen but did not offer him so much as a glass of cold water dieter thought of stephanie again there was a phone in the hallway he looked into the kitchen may i make a call he asked politely i will pay you of course she gave him a hostile glare where to reims she nodded and made a note of the time by the clock on the mantelpiece dieter got the operator and gave the number of the house in the rue du bois it was answered immediately by a low gruff voice reciting the number in a provincial accent suddenly alert dieter said in french this is pierre charenton the voice at the other end changed into stephanies and she said my darling he realized she had answered the phone with her imitation of mademoiselle lemas as a precaution his heart gladdened with relief is everything all right he asked her ive captured another enemy agent for you she said coolly his mouth went dry my god well done how did it happen i picked him up in the caf de la gare and brought him here dieter closed his eyes if something had gone wrongif she had done anything to make the agent suspect hershe could be dead by now and then your men tied him up she had said him that meant the terrorist was not flick dieter was disappointed all the same his strategy was working this man was the second allied agent to walk into the trap whats he like a young guy with a limp and half his ear shot off what have you done with him hes here in the kitchen on the floor i was about to call saintecdcile and have him picked up dont do that lock him in the cellar i want to talk to him before weber does where are you some village we have a damn puncture hurry back i should be with you in an hour or two okay how are you fine dieter wanted a serious answer but really how do you feel how do i feel she paused thats a question you dont usually ask dieter hesitated i dont usually involve you in capturing terrorists her voice softened i feel fine dont worry about me he found himself saying something he had not planned what will we do after the war there was a surprised silence at the other end of the line dieter said of course the war could go on for ten years but on the other hand it might be over in two weeks and then what would we do she recovered her composure somewhat but there was an uncharacteristic tremor in her voice as she said what would you like to do i dont know he said but that left him dissatisfied and after a moment he blurted out i dont want to lose you he waited for her to say something else what are you thinking he said she said nothing there was an odd sound at the other end and he realized she was crying he felt choked up himself he caught the eye of the mechanics wife still timing his phone call he swallowed hard and turned away not wanting a stranger to see that he was upset ill be with you soon he said well talk some more i love you she said he glanced at the mechanics wife she was staring at him to hell with her he thought i love you too he said then he hung up the phone chapter it took the jackdaws most of the day to get from paris to reims they passed through all the checkpoints without incident their new fake identities worked as well as the old and no one noticed that flicks photograph had been retouched with eyebrow pencil but their train was delayed repeatedly stopping for an hour at a time in the middle of nowhere flick sat in the hot carriage fuming with impatience as the precious minutes leaked away uselessly she could see the reason for the holdups half the track had been destroyed by the bombers of the us army air corps and the rae when the train chugged into life and moved forward they looked out of the windows and saw emergency repair crews cutting through twisted rails picking up smashed sleepers and laying new track her only consolation was that the delays would be even more maddening for rommel as he attempted to deploy his troops to repel the invasion there was a feeling in her chest like a cold inert lump and every few minutes her thoughts returned to diana and maude they had certainly been interrogated by now probably tortured possibly killed flick had known diana all her life she was going to have to tell dianas brother william what had happened flicks own mother would be almost as upset as william ma had helped raise diana they began to see vineyards then champagne warehouses alongside the track and at last they arrived in reims a few minutes after four on sunday afternoon as flick had feared it was too late to carry out their mission the same evening that meant another nerveracking twentyfour hours in occupied territory it also gave flick a more specific problem where would the jackdaws spend the night this was not paris there was no redlight district with disreputable flophouses whose proprietors asked few questions and flick did not know of a convent where the nuns would hide anyone who begged for sanctuary there were no dark alleys in which downandouts slept behind rubbish bins ignored by the police flick knew of three possible hideouts michels town house gilbertes apartment and mademoiselle lemass house in the rue du bois unfortunately any of them might be under surveillance depending on how deeply the gestapo had penetrated the bollinger circuit if dieter franck was in charge of the investigation she had to fear the worst there was nothing to do but go and look we must split up into pairs again she told the others four women together is too conspicuous ruby and i will go first greta and jelly follow a hundred meters behind us they walked to michels place not far from the station it was flicks marital home but she always thought of it as his house there was plenty of room for four women but the gestapo almost certainly knew of the place it would be astonishing if none of the men taken captive last sunday had revealed the address under torture the house was in a busy street with several shops walking along the pavement flick surreptitiously looked into each parked car while ruby checked the houses and shops michels property was a high narrow building in an elegant eighteenthcentury row it had a small front yard with a magnolia tree the place was still and quiet with no movement at the windows the doorstep was dusty on their first pass along the street they saw nothing suspicious no workmen digging up the road no watchful loiterers at the pavement tables outside the bar chez regis no one leaning on a telegraph pole reading a newspaper they returned on the opposite side outside the bakers shop was a black citron traction avant with two men in suits sitting in the front smoking cigarettes and looking bored flick tensed she was wearing her dark wig so she felt sure they would not recognize her as the girl on the wanted poster but all the same her pulse beat faster and she hurried past them all along the pavement she listened for a shout behind her but it did not come and at last she turned the corner and breathed easier she slowed her pace her fears had been justified michels house was no use to her it did not have a rear entrance being part of a row with no back alley the jackdaws could not enter without being seen by the gestapo she considered the other two possibilities michel was presumably still living at gilbertes apartment unless he had been captured the building had a useful back entrance but it was a tiny place and four overnight guests at a oneroom apartment would not only be uncomfortable but also might be noticed by other people in the building the obvious place for them to spend the night was the house in the rue du bois flick had been there twice it was a big house with lots of bedrooms mademoiselle lemas was completely trustworthy and was more than willing to feed unexpected guests she had been sheltering british agents downed airmen and escaping prisoners of war for years and she might know what had happened to brian standish it was a mile or two from the center of town the four women set out to walk there still in pairs a hundred meters apart they arrived half an hour later the rue du bois was a quiet suburban street a surveillance team would have trouble concealing themselves here there was only one parked car within sight an impeccably upright peugeot that was much too slow for the gestapo it was empty flick and ruby took a preliminary walk past mademoiselle lemass house it looked the same as always her simca cinq stood in the courtyard which was unusual only in that she normally parked it in the garage flick slowed her pace and surreptitiously looked in at the window she saw no one mademoiselle lemas used that room only rarely it was an oldfashioned front parlor the piano immaculately dusted the cushions always plumped the door kept firmly closed except for formal visits her secret guests always sat in the kitchen at the back of the house where there was no chance they would be seen by passersby as flick passed the door her eye was caught by something on the ground it was a wooden toothbrush without pausing in her stride she stooped and picked it up ruby said do you need to clean your teeth this looks like pauls she almost thought it was pauls although there must be hundreds like it in france maybe thousands do you think he might be here maybe why would he have come i dont know to warn us of danger perhaps they walked on around the block before approaching the house again she let greta and jelly catch up this time well go together she said greta and jelly knock on the front door jelly said thank gordon my feet are killing me ruby and i will go around to the back just as a precaution dont say anything about us just wait for us to appear they walked along the street again all together this time flick and ruby went into the courtyard and past the simca cinq and crept around to the back the kitchen ran almost the whole width of the house at the rear with two windows and a door between flick waited until she heard the metallic ring of the doorbell then she risked a peep through a window her heart stopped there were three people in the kitchen two men in uniform and a tall woman with luxuriant red hair who was definitely not the middleaged mademoiselle lemas in a frozen fraction of a second flick noted that all three were looking away from the windows reflexively turning in the direction of the front door then she ducked down again she thought fast the men were obviously gestapo officers the woman must be a french traitor posing as mademoiselle lemas she had looked vaguely familiar even from the back there was something about the stylish drape of her green summer dress that struck a chord in flicks memory it was dismayingly clear to flick that the safe house had been betrayed the place was now a trap for allied agents poor brian standish must have fallen straight into it flick wondered whether he was still alive a feeling of cold determination came over her she drew her pistol ruby did the same three people she told ruby in a low voice two men and a woman she took a deep breath it was time to be ruthless were going to kill the men she said okay ruby nodded flick thanked heaven for rubys cool head id prefer to keep the woman alive for questioning but well shoot her if she seems likely to escape got it the men are at the lefthand end of the kitchen the woman will probably go to the door you take this window ill take the far one aim at the man nearest to you shoot when i shoot she crept across the width of the house and crouched under the other window her breath was coming fast and her heart was beating like a steam hammer but she was thinking as clearly as if she were playing chess she had no experience of firing through glass she decided to shoot three times in rapid succession once to shatter the window a second time to kill her man and a third time to be sure of him she thumbed the safety catch on her pistol and held it pointing to the sky then she straightened up and looked in through the window the two men were standing facing the door to the hail both had pistols drawn flick leveled her gun at the one nearest her the woman had gone but as flick looked she returned holding the kitchen door open greta and jelly walked in ahead of her all unsuspecting then they saw the gestapo men greta gave a small scream of fear something was saidflick could not hear whatthen greta and jelly raised their hands in the air the fake mademoiselle lemas walked into the kitchen behind them seeing her fullface flick felt a shock of recognition she had seen her before an instant later she remembered where the woman had been in the square at sainteccile last sunday with dieter franck flick had thought she was the officers mistress obviously she was something more than that a moment later the woman saw flicks face at the window her mouth dropped open her eyes widened and she lifted her hand to point at what she had seen the two men began to turn flick pulled the trigger the bang of the gun seemed simultaneous with the crash of breaking glass holding the gun level and steady she fired twice more a second later ruby fired both men fell to the ground flick threw open the back door and stepped inside the young woman had already turned away she was making a dash for the front door flick raised her gun but too late in a split second the woman was in the hail and out of flicks line of sight then jelly moving surprisingly fast threw herself through the door there was a crash of falling bodies and breaking furniture flick crossed the kitchen and looked jelly had brought the woman down on the tiled floor of the hall she had also broken the delicate curved legs of a kidneyshaped table smashed a chinese vase that had stood on the table and scattered a spray of dried grasses that had been in the vase the french woman struggled to get up flick aimed her pistol but did not fire jelly showing remarkably quick reactions grabbed the woman by the hair and banged her head on the tiles until she stopped wriggling the woman was wearing odd shoes one black and one brown flick turned back and looked at the two gestapo men on the kitchen floor both lay still she picked up their guns and pocketed them loose firearms left lying around might be used by the enemy for the moment the four jackdaws were safe flick was operating on adrenaline the time would come she knew when she would think about the man she had killed the end of a life was a dreadful moment its solemnity might be postponed but would return hours or days from now flick would wonder if the young man in uniform had left behind a wife who was now alone and children fatherless but for the present she was able to put that aside and think only of her mission she said jelly keep the woman covered greta find some string and tie her to a chair ruby go upstairs and make sure theres no one else in the house ill check the basement she ran down the stairs to the cellar there on the dirt floor she saw the figure of a man tied up and gagged the gag covered much of his face but she could see that half his ear had been shot oft she pulled the gag from his mouth bent down and gave him a long passionate kiss welcome to france he grinned best welcome i ever had ive got your toothbrush it was a lastsecond thing because i wasnt perfectly sure of the redhead it made me just that little bit more suspicious thank god she took the sharp little knife from its sheath under her lapel and began to cut the cords that bound him how did you get here parachuted in last night what the hell for brians radio is definitely being operated by the gestapo i wanted to warn you she threw her arms around him in a burst of affection im so glad youre here he hugged and kissed her in that case im glad i came they went upstairs look who i found in the cellar flick said they were all waiting for instructions she thought for a moment five minutes had passed since the shooting the neighbors must have heard gunfire but few french citizens were quick to call the police nowadays they were afraid they would end up answering questions at the gestapo office however she would not take needless risks they had to be out of here as soon as possible she turned her attention to the fake mademoiselle lemas now tied to a kitchen chair she knew what had to be done and her heart sank at the prospect what is your name she asked her stephanie vinson youre the mistress of dieter franck she was as pale as a sheet but looked defiant and flick thought how beautiful she was he saved my life so that was how franck had won her loyalty flick thought it made no difference a traitor was a traitor whatever the motive you brought helicopter to this house to be captured she said nothing is helicopter alive or dead i dont know flick pointed to paul you brought him here too you would have helped the gestapo capture us all the anger sounded in her voice as she thought of the danger to paul stephanie lowered her gaze flick walked behind the chair and drew her gun youre french yet you collaborated with the gestapo you might have killed us all the others seeing what was coming stood aside out of the line of fire stphame could not see the gun but she sensed what was happening she whispered what are you going to do with me flick said if we leave you here now you will tell dieter franck how many we are and describe us to him and help him to capture us so that we can be tortured and killed wont you she did not answer flick pointed the gun at the back of stephanies head do you have any excuse for helping the enemy i did what i had to doesnt everyone exactly flick said and she pulled the trigger twice the gun boomed in the confined space blood and something else spurted from the womans face and splashed on the skirt of her elegant green dress and she slumped forward soundlessly jelly flinched and greta turned away even paul went white only ruby remained expressionless they were all silent for a moment then flick said lets get out of here chapter it was six oclock in the evening when dieter parked outside the house in the rue du bois his skyblue car was covered with dust and dead insects after the long journey as he got out the evening sun slipped behind a cloud and the suburban street was thrown into shadow he shivered he took off his motoring goggleshe had been driving with the top downand ran his fingers through his hair to flatten it wait for me here please hans he said he wanted to be alone with stephanie opening the gate and entering the front garden he noticed that mademoiselle lemass simca cinq was gone the garage door was open and the garage was empty was stephanie using the car but where would she have gone she should be waiting here for him guarded by two gestapo men he strode up the garden path and pulled the bell rope the ring of the bell died away leaving the house strangely silent he looked through the window into the front parlor but that room was always empty he rang again there was no response he bent down to look through the letter box but he could not see much part of the staircase a painting of a swiss mountain scene and the door to the kitchen half open there was no movement he glanced at the house next door and saw a face hastily withdraw from a window and a curtain fall back into place he walked around the side of the house and through the courtyard to the rear garden two windows were broken and the back door stood open fear grew in his heart what had happened here stephanie he called there was no answer he stepped into the kitchen at first he did not understand what he was looking at a bundle was tied to a kitchen chair with ordinary household string it looked like a womans body with a disgusting mess on top after a moment his police experience told him that the disgusting thing was a human head that had been shot then he saw that the dead woman was wearing odd shoes one black and one brown and he understood she was stephanie he let out a howl of anguish covered his eyes with his hands and sank slowly to his knees sobbing after a minute he dragged his hands from his eyes and forced himself to look again the detective in him noted the blood on the skirt of her dress and concluded that she had been shot from behind perhaps that was merciful she might not have suffered the terror of knowing she was about to die there had been two shots he thought it was the large exit wounds that had made her lovely face look so dreadful destroying her eyes and nose leaving her sensual lips bloodstained but intact had it not been for the shoes he would not have known her his eyes filled with tears until she became a blur the sense of loss was like a wound he had never known a shock like this sudden knowledge that she was gone she would not throw him that proud glance again she would no longer turn heads walking through restaurants he would never again see her pull silk stockings over her perfect calves her style and her wit her fears and her desires were all canceled wiped out ended he felt as if he had been shot and had lost part of himself he whispered her name at least he had that then he heard a voice behind him he cried out startled it came again a wordless grunt but human he leaped to his feet turning around and wiping the moisture from his eyes for the first time he noticed two men on the floor both wore uniforms they were stephanies gestapo bodyguards they had failed to protect her but at least they had given their lives trying or one of them had one lay still but the other was trying to speak he was a young chap nineteen or twenty with black hair and a small mustache his uniform cap lay on the linoleum floor beside his head dieter stepped across the room and knelt beside him he noted exit wounds in the chest the man had been shot from behind he was lying in a pool of blood his head jerked and his lips were moving dieter put his ear to the mans mouth water the man whispered he was bleeding to death they always asked for water near the end dieter knewhe had seen it in the desert he found a cup filled it at the tap and held it to the mans lips he drank it all the water dribbling down his chin onto his bloodsoaked tunic dieter knew he should phone for a doctor but he had to find out what had happened here if he delayed the man might expire without telling what he knew dieter hesitated only a moment over the decision the man was dispensable dieter would question him first then call the doctor who was it he said and he bent his head again to hear the dying mans whispers four women the man said hoarsely the jackdaws dieter said bitterly two at the front two at the back dieter nodded he could visualize the course of events stephanie had gone to the front door to answer the knock the gestapo men had stood ready looking toward the hail the terrorists had sneaked up to the kitchen windows and shot them from behind and then who killed stephanie water dieter controlled his sense of urgency with an effort of will he went to the sink refilled the cup and put it to the mans mouth again once again he drank it all and sighed with relief a sigh that turned into a dreadful groan who killed stephanie dieter repeated the small one said the gestapo man flick said dieter and his heart filled with a raging desire for revenge the man whispered im sorry major how did it happen quick it was very quick tell me they tied her up said she was a traitor gun to the back of the head then they went away traitor dieter said the man nodded dieter choked back a sob she never shot anyone in the back of the head he said in a griefstricken whisper the gestapo man did not hear him his lips were still and his breathing had stopped dieter reached out with his right hand and closed the mans eyelids gently with his fingertips rest in peace he said then keeping his back to the body of the woman he loved he went to the phone chapter it was a struggle to fit five people into the simca cinq ruby and jelly sat on the rudimentary backseat paul drove greta took the front passenger seat and flick sat on gretas lap ordinarily they would have giggled about it but they were in a somber mood they had killed three people and they had come close to being captured by the gestapo now they were watchful hyper alert ready to react fast to anything that happened they had nothing on their minds but survival flick guided paul to the street parallel with gilbertes flick remembered coming here with her wounded husband exactly seven days ago she directed paul to park near the end of the alley wait here flick said ill check the place jelly said be quick for gods sake quick as i can flick got out and ran down the alley past the back of the factory to the door in the wall she crossed the garden quickly and slipped through the back entrance into the building the hallway was empty and the place was quiet she went softly up the stairs to the attic floor she stopped outside gilbertes apartment what she saw filled her with dismay the door stood open it had been broken in and was leaning drunkenly from one hinge she listened but heard nothing and something told her the breakin had happened days ago cautiously she stepped inside there had been a perfunctory search in the little living room the cushions on the seats were disarranged and in the kitchen corner the cupboard doors stood open flick looked into the bedroom and saw a similar scene the drawers had been pulled out of the chest the wardrobe was open and someone had stood on the bed with dirty boots she went to the window and looked down into the street parked opposite the building was a black citron traction avant with two men sitting in the front this was all bad news flick thought despairingly someone had talked and dieter franck had made the most of it he had painstakingly followed a trail that had led him first to mademoiselle lemas then to brian standish and finally to gilberte and michel was he in custody it seemed all too probable she thought about dieter franck she had felt a shiver of fear the first time she had looked at the short mi biography of him on the back of his file photo she had not been scared enough she now knew he was clever and persistent he had almost caught her at la chatelle he had scattered posters of her face all over paris he had captured and interrogated her comrades one after another she had set eyes on him just twice both times for a few moments only she brought his face to mind there was intelligence and energy in his look she thought plus a determination that could easily become ruthlessness she was quite sure that he was still on her trail she resolved to be ever more vigilant she looked at the sky she had about three hours until dark she hurried down the stairs and out through the garden back to the simca cinq parked in the next street no good she said as she squeezed into the car the place has been searched and the gestapo are watching the front hell paul said where do we go now i know of one more place to try said flick drive into town she wondered how long they could continue to use the simca cinq as the tiny cc engine struggled to power the overloaded car assuming the bodies at the house in the rue du bois had been discovered within an hour how long would it be before police and gestapo men in reims were alerted to look out for mademoiselle lemass car dieter had no way of contacting men who were already out on the streets but at the next change of shift they would all be briefed and flick did not know when the night crews came on duty she concluded that she had almost no time left drive to the station she said well dump the car there good idea paul said maybe theyll think weve left town flick scanned the streets for military mercedes cars or black gestapo citrons she held her breath as they passed a pair of gendarmes patrolling but they reached the center of the city without incident paul parked near the railway station and they all got out and hurried away from the incriminating vehicle ill have to do this alone flick said the rest of you had better go to the cathedral and wait for me there all my sins have been forgiven several times over ive spent so much time in church today paul said you can pray for a place to spend the night flick told him and she hurried away she returned to the street where michel lived a hundred meters from his house was the bar chez regis flick went in the proprietor alexandre regis sat behind the counter smoking he gave her a nod of recognition but said nothing she went through the door marked toilettes she walked along a short passage then opened what looked like a cupboard door it led to a steep staircase going up at the top of the stairs was a heavy door with a peephole flick banged on it and stood where her face could be seen through the judas a moment later the door was opened by mm regis the mother of the proprietor flick entered a large room whose windows were blacked out it was crudely decorated with matting on the floor brownpainted walls and several naked bulbs hanging from the ceiling at one end of the room was a roulette wheel around a large circular table a group of men were playing cards there was a bar in one corner this was an illegal gambling club michel liked to play poker for high stakes and he enjoyed louche company so he occasionally came here for an evening flick never played but she sometimes sat and watched the game for an hour michel said she brought him luck it was a good place to hide from the gestapo and flick had been hoping she might find him here but as she looked from face to face around the room she was disappointed thank you mm she said to alexandres mother its good to see you how are you fine have you seen my husband ah the charming michel not tonight i regret the people here did not know michel was in the resistance flick went to the bar and sat on a stool smiling at the barmaid a middleaged woman with bright red lipstick she was yvette regis the wife of alexandre have you any scotch of course said yvette for those who can afford it she produced a bottle of dewars white label and poured a measure flick said im looking for michel i havent seen him for a week or so yvette said damn flick sipped her drink ill wait awhile in case he shows up chapter dieter was desperate flick had proved too clever she had evaded his trap she was somewhere in the city of reims but he had no way of finding her he could no longer have members of the reims resistance followed in the hope that she would contact one of them for they were all now in custody dieter had michels house and gilbertes flat under surveillance but he felt sure that flick was too wily to let herself be seen by the average gestapo flatfoot there were posters of her all over town but she must have changed her appearance by now dyed her hair or something for no one had reported seeing her she had outwitted him at every stop he needed a stroke of genius and he had come up with onehe thought he sat on the seat of a bicycle at the roadside he was in the center of town just outside the theater he wore a beret goggles and a rough cotton sweater and his trousers were tucked into his socks he was unrecognizable no one would suspect him the gestapo never went by bicycle he stared west along the street narrowing his eyes to look into the setting sun he was waiting for a black citroen he checked his watch any minute now on the other side of the road hans was at the wheel of a wheezy old peugeot which had almost come to the end of its useful life the engine was running dieter did not want to take the risk that it might not start when it was needed hans was also disguised in sunglasses and a cap and wore a shabby suit and downattheheel shoes like a french citizen he had never done anything like this before but he had accepted his orders with unflappable stoicism dieter too had never done this before he had no idea whether it would work all kinds of things could go wrong and anything could happen what dieter had planned was desperate but what did he have to lose tuesday was the night of the full moon he felt sure the allies were about to invade flick was the grand prize she was worth a great deal of risk but winning the war was no longer what most occupied his mind his future had been wrecked he hardly cared who ruled europe he thought constantly of flick clairet she had ruined his life she had murdered stephanie he wanted to find flick and capture her and take her to the basement of the chfteau there he would taste the satisfaction of revenge he fantasized constantly about how he would torture her the iron rods that would smash her small bones the electric shock machine turned up to maximum the injections that would render her helpless with great wrenching spasms of nausea the ice bath that would give her shivering convulsions and freeze the blood in her fingers destroying the resistance and repelling the invaders had become merely part of his punishment of flick but first he had to find her in the distance he saw a black citron he stared at it was this the one it was a twodoor model the kind always used when transporting a prisoner he tried to see inside he thought there were four people altogether this had to be the car he was waiting for it drew nearer and he recognized the handsome face of michelin the back guarded by a uniformed gestapo man he tensed he was glad now that he had given orders that michel was not to be tortured while dieter was away this scheme would not have been possible otherwise as the citron came level with dieter hans suddenly pulled away from the curb in the old peugeot the car swung out into the road leaped forward and smashed straight into the front of the citron there was a clatter of crumpling metal and a medley of breaking glass the two gestapo men leaped out of the front of the citron and began yelling at hans in bad frenchseeming not to notice that their colleague in the back appeared to have banged his head and was slumped apparently unconscious beside his prisoner this was the critical moment dieter thought his nerves strung like wire would michel take the bait he stared at the tableau in the middle of the street it took michel a long moment to realize his opportunity dieter almost thought he would fail to seize it then he seemed to come to he reached over the front seats fumbled at the door catch with bound hands succeeded in getting the door open pushed down the seat and scrambled out he glanced at the two gestapo men still arguing with hans they had their backs to him he turned and walked quickly away his expression said he could hardly believe his good luck dieters heart leaped with triumph his plan was working he followed michel hans followed dieter on foot dieter rode the bicycle for a few yards then he found himself catching up with michel so he got off and pushed it along the pavement michel turned the first corner limping slightly from his bullet wound but walking fast holding his bound hands low in front of him to make them less conspicuous dieter followed discreetly sometimes walking sometimes riding dropping back out of michels sight whenever he could taking cover behind highsided vehicles if he got the chance michel occasionally glanced back but made no systematic attempt to shake off a tail he had no notion that he was being tricked after a few minutes hans overtook dieter by arrangement and dieter dropped back to follow hans then they switched again where would michel go it was essential to dieters plan that michel should lead him to other resistance members so that he could once again pick up flicks trail to dieters surprise michel headed for his house near the cathedral surely he must suspect that his home was under surveillance nevertheless he turned into the street however he did not go to his own place but entered a bar across the street called chez regis dieter leaned his bicycle against the wall of the next building a vacant store with a faded charcuterie sign he waited a few minutes just in case michel should come out again immediately when it was clear michel was staying a while dieter went in he intended simply to make sure michel was still thererelying on his goggles and beret to conceal his identity from michel he would buy a pack of cigarettes as an excuse and go back outside but michel was nowhere in sight puzzled dieter hesitated the barman said yes sir beer said dieter draft he hoped that if he kept his conversation to a minimum the barman would not notice his slight german accent and accept him as a cyclist who had stopped to quench his thirst coming up wheres the toilet the barman pointed to a door in the corner dieter went through it michel was not in the mens room dieter risked a glance into the ladies it was empty he opened what looked like a cupboard door and saw that it led to a staircase he went up the stairs at the top was a heavy door with a peephole he knocked on the door but there was no answer he listened for a moment he could hear nothing but the door was thick he felt sure there was someone on the other side looking at him through the peephole realizing he was not a regular customer he tried to act as if he had taken a wrong turn on the way to the toilet he scratched his head shrugged and went back down the stairs there was no sign of a back entrance to the place michel was here dieter felt sure in the locked room upstairs but what should dieter do about it he took his glass to a table so that the barman would not try to engage him in small talk the beer was watery and tasteless even in germany the quality of beer had declined during the war he forced himself to finish it then went out hans was on the other side of the street looking in the window of a bookshop dieter went across hes in some kind of private room upstairs he told hans he may be meeting with other resistance cadres on the other hand it may be a brothel or something and i dont want to bust in on him before hes led us to anyone worthwhile hans nodded understanding the dilemma dieter made a decision it was too soon to rearrest michel when he comes out ill follow him as soon as were out of sight you can raid the place on my own dieter pointed to two gestapo men in a citron keeping watch on michels house get them to help you okay try to make it look like a vice thingarrest the whores if there are any dont mention the resistance okay until then we wait chapter until the moment when michel walked in flick was feeling pessimistic she sat at the bar in the little makeshift casino making desultory conversation with yvette indifferently watching the intent faces of the men as they concentrated on their cards their dice and the spinning roulette wheel no one took much notice of her they were serious gamblers not to be distracted by a pretty face if she did not find michel she was in trouble the other jackdaws were in the cathedral but they could not stay there all night they could sleep in the openthey would survive the weather in junebut they could so easily be caught they also needed transport if they could not get a car or van from the bollinger circuit they would have to steal one but then they would be forced to carry out the mission using a vehicle for which the police were searching it added more dangers to an already perilous enterprise there was another reason for her gloom the image of stephanie vinson kept coming back to her it was the first time flick had killed a bound helpless captive and the first time she had shot a woman any killing disturbed her profoundly the gestapo man she had shot a few minutes before stephanie had been a combatant with a gun in his hand but still it seemed dreadful to her that she had brought his life to an end so it had been with the other men she had killed two milice cops in paris a gestapo colonel in lille and a french traitor in rouen but stephanie was worse flick had put a gun to the back of her head and executed her it was exactly how she had taught trainees to do it in the soe course stephanie had deserved it of courseflick had no doubt about that but she wondered about herself what kind of person was capable of the coldblooded killing of a helpless prisoner had she become some kind of brutish executioner she drained her whisky but declined a refill for fear of becoming maudlin then michel came through the door overwhelming relief flooded her michel knew everyone in town he would be able to help her suddenly the mission seemed possible again she felt a wry affection as she took in the lanky figure in a rumpled jacket the handsome face with the smiling eyes she would always be fond of him she imagined she suffered a painful stab of regret as she thought of the passionate love she had once had for him that would never come back she was sure as he came closer she saw that he was not looking so good his face seemed to have new lines her heart filled with compassion for him exhaustion and fear showed in his expression and he might have been fifty rather than thirtyfive she thought anxiously but her greatest anxiety came from the thought of telling him that their marriage was over she was afraid it struck her as ironic she had just shot and killed a gestapo man and a french traitress and she was undercover in occupied territory yet her worst fear was of hurting her husbands feelings he was visibly delighted to see her flick he cried i knew you would get here he crossed the room to her still limping from his bullet wound she said quietly i was afraid the gestapo had captured you they did he turned so that his back was to the room and no one could see and showed her his hands bound at the wrists with stout rope she drew the little knife from its sheath under her lapel and discreetly cut through his bonds the gamblers saw nothing she put the knife away mm regis spotted him just as he was stuffing the ropes into his trousers pockets she embraced and kissed him on both cheeks flick watched him flirt with the older woman talking to her in his cometobed voice giving her the benefit of his sexy grin then mm resumed her work serving drinks to the gamblers and michel told flick how he had escaped she had been afraid he would want to kiss her passionately and she had not known how she would deal with that but in the event he was too full of his own adventures to get romantic with her i was so lucky he finished he sat on a bar stool rubbing his wrists and asked for a beer flick nodded too lucky perhaps she said what do you mean it could be some kind of trick he was indignant no doubt resenting the implication that he was gullible i dont think so could you have been followed here no he said firmly i checked of course she was uneasy but she let it go so brian standish is dead and three others are in custodymademoiselle lemas gilberte and dr bouler the rest are dead the germans released the bodies of those killed in the skirmish and the survivors gaston genevieve and bertrand were shot by a firing squad in the square at saintececile dear god they were silent for a moment flick was weighed down by the thought of the lives lost and the suffering endured for the sake of this mission michels beer came he drank half in a single draft and wiped his lips i presume youve come back for another attempt on the chfteau she nodded but the cover story is that were going to blow up the railway tunnel at manes its a good idea we should do it anyway not now two of my team were taken in paris and they must have talked they will have told the cover storythey had no idea of the real missionand the germans are sure to have doubled the guard on the railway tunnel well leave that to the raf and concentrate on sainteccile what can i do we need somewhere to stay the night he thought for a moment joseph laperrišres cellar laperrišre was a champagne maker michels aunt antoinette had once been his secretary is he one of us a sympathizer he gave a sour grin everyone is a sympathizer now they all think the invasion is coming any day he looked inquiringly at her i imagine theyre right about that yes she said she did not elaborate how big is the cellar there are five of us its big he could hide fifty people down there fine the other thing i need is a vehicle for tomorrow to drive to sainteccile and afterwards to meet our pickup plane if were still alive you realize that you cant use the usual drop zone at chatelle dont you the gestapo know about itits where i was picked up yes the plane is coming to the other one at laroque i gave instructions the potato field good and the vehicle philippe moulierhas a van he delivers meat to all the german bases monday is his day off i remember him hes pronazi he was and hes been making money out of them for four years so now hes terrified that the invasion is going to succeed and after the germans have gone hell be strung up as a collaborator hes desperate to do something to help us to prove hes not a traitor hell lend us his van bring it to the cellar tomorrow at ten oclock in the morning he touched her cheek cant we spend the night together he smiled his old smile and looked as roguishly handsome as ever she felt a familiar stirring inside but it was not as strong as it had been in the old days once that smile would have made her wet now it was like the memory of a desire she wanted to tell him the truth for she hated to be anything less than honest but it might jeopardize the mission she needed his cooperation or was that just an excuse perhaps she just did not have the nerve no she said we cant spend the night together he looked crestfallen is it because of gilberte she nodded but she could not lie and she found herself saying well partly whats the other part i dont really want to have this discussion in the middle of an important mission he looked vulnerable almost scared have you got someone else she could not bring herself to hurt him no she lied he looked hard at her good he said at last im glad flick hated herself michel finished his beer and got off his stool laperrišres place is in the chemin de la carrišre it will take you thirty minutes to walk there i know the street id better go and see moulier about the van he put his arms around flick and kissed her lips she felt dreadful she could hardly refuse the kiss having denied that she had someone else but kissing michel seemed so disloyal to paul she closed her eyes and waited passively until he broke the clinch he could not fail to notice her lack of enthusiasm he looked thoughtfully at her for a moment ill see you at ten he said and he left she decided to give him five minutes to get clear before she followed him out she asked yvette for another scotch while she was sipping it a red light began to flash over the door no one spoke but everyone in the room moved at once the croupier stopped the roulette wheel and turned it upside down so that it looked like a normal tabletop the card players swept up their stakes and put on their jackets yvette picked up the glasses from the bar and dumped them in the sink mm regis turned out the lights leaving the room illuminated only by the flashing red bulb over the door flick picked up her bag from the floor and put her hand on her gun whats happening she asked yvette police raid she said flick cursed what hellish luck it would be to get arrested for illegal gambling alexandre downstairs has given us the warning yvette explained get going quickly she pointed across the room flick looked in the direction yvette indicated and saw meme regis stepping into what looked like a cupboard as she watched mm shoved aside a couple of old coats hanging from a rail to reveal at the back of the cupboard a door which she hurriedly opened the gamblers began to leave by the hidden door maybe flick thought she could get away the flashing red light went out and a banging began on the main door flick crossed the room in the dark and joined the men pushing through the cupboard she followed the crowd into a bare room the floor was about a foot lower than she expected and she guessed this was the apartment over the shop next door they all ran down the stairs and sure enough she found herself in the disused charcuterie with a stained marble counter and dusty glass cases the blind in the front window was drawn down so that no one could see in from the street they all went out through the back door there was a dirty yard surrounded by a high wall a door in the wall led to an alley and the alley led to the next street when they reached the street the men went in different directions flick walked quickly away and soon found herself alone breathing hard she reoriented herself and headed for the cathedral where the other jackdaws were waiting my god she whispered to herself that was close as she got her breath back she began to see the raid on the gambling club in a different light it had happened just minutes after michel had left flick did not believe in coincidence the more she thought about it the more convinced she became that whoever was banging on the door had been looking for her she knew that a small group of men had been playing for high stakes in that room since before the war the local police certainly knew about the place why would they suddenly decide to close it down if not the police it must have been the gestapo and they were not really interested in gamblers they went after communists jews homosexualsand spies the story of michels escape had aroused her suspicions from the start but she had been partly reassured by his insistence that he had not been followed now she thought otherwise his escape must have been faked like the rescue of brian standish she saw the sly brain of dieter franck behind this someone had followed michel to the caf guessed at the existence of the secret upstairs room and hoped to find her there in that case michel was still under surveillance if he continued to be careless he would be trailed to philippe mouliers house tonight and in the morning driving the van he would be followed to the champagne cellar where the jackdaws were hiding and what the hell flick thought am i going to do about that the ninth day monday june chapter dieters migraine began shortly after midnight as he stood in his room at the hotel frankfort looking at the bed he would never again share with stephanie he felt that if he could weep the pain would fade but no tears came and he injected himself with morphine and collapsed on the counterpane the phone woke him before daylight it was walter goedel rommels aide groggily dieter said has the invasion begun not today goedel replied the weather is bad in the english channel dieter sat upright and shook his head to clear it what then the resistance were clearly expecting something overnight there has been an eruption of sabotage throughout northern france goedels voice already cool descended to an arctic chill it was supposed to be your job to prevent that what are you doing in bed caught off guard dieter struggled to regain his usual poise im right on the tail of the most important of all resistance leaders he said trying hard not to sound as if he was making excuses for failure i almost caught her last night ill arrest her today dont worryby tomorrow morning well be rounding up terrorists by the hundreds i promise you he immediately regretted the pleading tone of the last three words goedel was unmoved after tomorrow it will probably be too late i know dieter stopped the line was dead goedel had hung up dieter cradled the phone and looked at his wristwatch it was four oclock he got up his migraine had gone but he felt queasy either from the morphine or the unpleasant phone call he drank a glass of water and swallowed three aspirins then began to shave as he lathered his face he nervously ran over the events of the previous evening asking himself if he had done everything possible leaving lieutenant hesse outside chez regis he had followed michel clairet to the premises of philippe moulier a supplier of fresh meat to restaurants and military kitchens it was a storefront property with living quarters above and a yard at the side dieter bad watched the place for an hour but no one had come out deciding that michel intended to spend the night there dieter had found a bar and phoned hans hesse hans had got on a motorcycle and joined him outside the moulier place at ten the lieutenant told dieter the story of the inexplicably empty room above chez regis theres some earlywarning system dieter speculated the barman downstairs is ready to sound the alarm if anyone comes looking you think the resistance were using the place probably id guess the communist party used to hold meetings there and the resistance took over the system but how did they get away last night a trapdoor under the carpet something like thatthe communists would have been prepared for trouble did you arrest the barman i arrested everyone in the place theyre at the chfteau now dieter had left hans watching the moulier property and had driven to sainteccile there he questioned the terrified proprietor alexandre regis and learned within minutes that his speculation had been off target the place was neither a resistance hideout nor a communist meeting place but an illegal gambling club nevertheless alexandre confirmed that michel clairet had gone there last night and he said michel had met his wife there it was another maddeningly near miss for dieter he had captured one resistance member after another but flick always eluded him now he finished shaving wiped his face and phoned the chfteau to order a car with a driver and two gestapo men to pick him up he got dressed and went to the hotel kitchen to beg half a dozen warm croissants which he wrapped in a linen napkin then he went out into the cool of the early morning the towers of the cathedral were silvered by the breaking dawn one of the fast citrons favored by the gestapo was waiting he gave the driver the address of the moulier place he found hans lurking in a warehouse doorway fifty meters along the street no one had come or gone all night hans said so michel must still be inside dieter told his driver to wait around the next corner then stood with hans sharing the croissants and watching the sun come up over the roofs of the city they had a long wait dieter fought to control his impatience as the minutes and hours ticked away uselessly the loss of stephanie weighed on his heart but he had recovered from the immediate shock and he had regained his interest in the war he thought of the allied forces massing somewhere in the south or east of england shiploads of men and tanks eager to turn the quiet seaside towns of northern france into battlefields he thought of the french saboteursarmed to the teeth thanks to parachute drops of guns ammunition and explosivesready to attack the german defenders from behind to stab them in the back and fatally cramp rommels ability to maneuver he felt foolish and impotent standing in a doorway in reims waiting for an amateur terrorist to finish his breakfast today perhaps he would be led into the very heart of the resistancebut all he had was hope it was after nine oclock when the front door opened at last dieter breathed he moved back from the sidewalk making himself inconspicuous hans put out his cigarette michel came out of the building accompanied by a boy of about seventeen who dieter guessed might be a son of moulier the lad keyed a padlock and opened the gates of the yard in the yard was a clean black van with white lettering on the side that read moulier filsviandes michel got in dieter was electrified michel was borrowing a meat delivery van it had to be for the jackdaws lets go he said hans hurried to his motorcycle which was parked at the curb and stood with his back to the road pretending to fiddle with the engine dieter ran to the corner signaled the gestapo driver to start the car then watched michel michel drove out of the yard and headed away hans started his motorcycle and followed dieter jumped into the car and ordered the driver to follow hans they headed east dieter in the front passenger seat of the gestapos black citron looked ahead anxiously mouliers van was easy to follow having a high roof with a vent on top like a chimney that little vent will lead me to flick dieter thought optimistically the van slowed in the chemin de la carrišre and pulled into the yard of a champagne house called laperrišre hans drove past and turned the next corner and dieters driver followed they pulled up and dieter leaped out i think the jackdaws hid out there overnight dieter said shall we raid the place hans said eagerly dieter pondered this was the dilemma he had faced yesterday outside the caf flick might be in there but if he moved too quickly he might prematurely end michels usefulness as a stalking horse not yet he said michel was the only hope he had left it was too soon to risk losing that weapon well wait dieter and hans walked to the end of the street and watched the laperrišre place from the corner there were a tall elegant house a courtyard full of empty barrels and a low industrial building with a flat roof dieter guessed the cellars ran beneath the flatroofed building mouliers van was parked in the yard dieters pulse was racing any moment now michel would reappear with flick and the other jackdaws he guessed they would get into the van ready to drive to their targetand dieter and the gestapo would move in and arrest them as they watched michel came out of the low building he wore a frown and he stood indecisively in the yard looking around him in a perplexed fashion hans said whats the matter with him dieters heart sank something he didnt expect surely flick had not evaded him again after a minute michel climbed the short flight of steps to the door of the house and knocked a maid in a little white cap let him in he came out again a few minutes later he still looked puzzled but he was no longer indecisive he walked to the van got in and turned it around dieter cursed it seemed the jackdaws were not here michel appeared just as surprised as dieter was but that was small consolation dieter had to find out what had happened here he said to hans well do the same as last night only this time you follow michel and ill raid the place hans started his motorcycle dieter watched michel drive away in mouliers van followed at a discreet distance by hans hesse on his motorcycle when they were out of sight he summoned the three gestapo men with a wave and walked quickly to the laperrišre house he pointed at two of the men check the house make sure no one leaves nodding at the third man he said you and i will search the winery he led the way into the low building on the ground floor there was a large grape press and three enormous vats the press was pristine the harvest was three or four months away there was no one present but an old man sweeping the floor dieter found the stairs and ran down in the cool underground chamber there was more activity racked bottles were being turned by a handful of bluecoated workers they stopped and stared at the intruders dieter and the gestapo man searched room after room of bottles of champagne thousands of them some stacked against the walls others racked slantwise with the necks down in special ashaped frames but there were no women anywhere in an alcove at the far end of the last tunnel dieter found crumbs of bread cigarette ends and a hair clip his worst fears were dismally confirmed the jackdaws had spent the night here but they had escaped he cast about for a focus for his anger the workers would probably know nothing about the jackdaws but the owner must have given permission for them to hide here he would suffer for it dieter returned to the ground floor crossed the yard and went to the house a gestapo man opened the door theyre all in the front room he said dieter entered a large gracious room with elegant but shabby furnishings heavy curtains that had not been cleaned for years a worn carpet a long dining table and a matching set of twelve chairs the terrified household staff were standing at the near end of the room the maid who opened the door an elderly man who looked like a butler in his threadbare black suit and a plump woman wearing an apron who must have been the cook a gestapo man held a pistol pointed at them at the far end of the table sat a thin woman of about fifty with red hair threaded with silver dressed in a summer frock of pale yellow silk she had an air of calm superiority dieter turned to the gestapo man and said in a low voice wheres the husband he left the house at eight they dont know where he went hes expected home for lunch dieter gave the woman a hard look madame laperriere she nodded gravely but did not deign to speak dieter decided to puncture her dignity some german officers behaved with deference to upperclass french people but dieter thought they were fools he would not pander to her by walking the length of the room to speak to her bring her to me he said one of the men spoke to her slowly she got up from her chair and approached dieter what do you want she said a group of terrorists from england escaped from me yesterday after killing two german officers and a french woman civilian im sorry to hear that said madame laperriere they tied the woman up and shot her in the back of the head at pointblank range he went on her brains spilled out onto her dress she closed her eyes and turned her head aside dieter went on last night your husband sheltered those terrorists in your cellar can you think of any reason why he should not be hanged behind him the maid began to cry madame laperriere was shaken her face turned pale and she sat down suddenly no please she whispered dieter said you can help your husband by telling me what you know i dont know anything she said in a low voice they came after dinner and they left before dawn i never saw them how did they leave did your husband provide them with a car she shook her head we have no gas then how do you deliver the champagne you make our customers have to come to us dieter did not believe her he felt sure flick needed transportation that was why michel had borrowed a van from philippe moulier and brought it here yet when michel got here flick and the jackdaws had gone they must have found alternative means of transport and decided to go on ahead no doubt flick had left a message explaining the situation and telling michel to catch up with her dieter said are you asking me to believe they left here on foot no she replied im telling you that i dont know when i woke up they had gone dieter still thought she was lying but to get the truth out of her would take time and patience and he was running out of both arrest them all he said and his angry frustration injected a petulant note into his voice the phone rang in the hall dieter stepped out of the dining room and picked it up a voice with a german accent said let me speak to major franck this is he lieutenant hesse here major hans what happened im at the station michel parked the van and bought a ticket to marles the train is about to leave it was as dieter had thought the jackdaws had gone ahead and left instructions for michel to join them they were still planning to blow up the railway tunnel he felt frustrated that flick was continuing to stay one step ahead of him however she had not been able to escape him completely he was still on her tail he would catch her soon get on the train quickly he said to hans stay with him ill meet you at marles very good said hans and he hung up dieter returned to the dining room call the chfteau and have them send transportation he said to the gestapo men turn all the prisoners over to sergeant becker for interrogation tell him to start with madame he pointed to the driver you can drive me to marles chapter in the caf de la gare near the railway station flick and paul had a breakfast of ersatz coffee black bread and sausage with little or no meat in it ruby jelly and greta sat at a separate table not acknowledging them flick kept an eye on the street outside she knew that michel was in terrible danger she had contemplated going to warn him she could have gone to the moulier placebut that would have played into the hands of the gestapo who must be following michelin the hope that he would lead them to her even to phone the moulier place would have risked betraying her hideout to a gestapo eavesdropper at the telephone exchange in fact she had decided the best thing she could do to help michel was not to contact him directly if her theory was right dieter franck would let michel remain at large until flick was caught so she had left a message for michel with madame lapemšre it read micheli am sure you are under surveillance the place we were at last night was raided after you left you have probably been followed this morning we will leave before you get here and make ourselves inconspicuous in the town center park the van near the railway station and leave the key under the drivers seat get a train to marles shake off your shadow and come back be carefulplease flick now burn this it seemed good in theory but she waited all morning in a fever of tension to see whether it would work then at eleven oclock she saw a high van draw up and park near the station entrance flick held her breath on the side in white lettering she read moulier filsviandes michel got out and she breathed again he walked into the station he was carrying out her plan she looked to see who might be following him but it was impossible people arrived at the station constantly on foot on bicycles and in cars and any of them might have been shadowing michel she remained in the caf pretending to drink the bitter unsatisfying coffee substitute keeping an eye on the van trying to discover whether it was under surveillance she studied the people and vehicles coming and going outside the station but she did not spot anyone who might have been watching the van after fifteen minutes she nodded to paul they got up picked up their cases and walked out flick opened the van door and got into the drivers seat paul got in the other side flicks heart was in her mouth if this was a gestapo trap now would be the moment when they arrested her she fumbled beneath her seat and found a key she started the van she looked around no one seemed to have noticed her ruby jelly and greta came out of the caf flick jerked her head to indicate that they should get in the back she looked over her shoulder the van was fitted out with shelves and cupboards and trays for ice to keep the temperature down everything looked as if it had been well scrubbed but there remained a faint unpleasant odor of raw meat the rear doors opened the other three women threw their suitcases into the van and clambered in after them ruby pulled the doors shut flick put the gearshift into first and drove away we did it jelly said thank gordon flick smiled thinly the hard part was still ahead she drove out of town on the road to sainteccile she watched for police cars and gestapo citrons but she felt fairly safe for the moment the vans lettering announced its legitimacy and it was not unusual for a woman to be driving such a vehicle when so many frenchmen were in labor camps in germanyor had fled to the hills and joined the maquis to avoid being sent to the camps soon after midday they reached sainteccile flick noted the sudden miraculous quiet that always fell on french streets at the stroke of noon as the people turned their attention to the first serious meal of the day she drove to antoinettes building a pair of tall wooden doors halfopen led to the inner courtyard paul leaped out of the van and opened the doors flick drove in and paul closed the doors behind her now the van with its distinctive legend could not be seen from the street come when i whistle flick said and she jumped out she went to antoinettes door while the others waited in the van last time she had knocked on this door eight days and a lifetime ago michels aunt antoinette had hesitated to answer jumpy on account of the gunfire from the square but today she came right away she opened the door a slim middleaged woman in a stylish but faded yellow cotton dress she looked blankly at flick for a moment flick still had on the dark wig then recognition dawned you she said a look of panic came over her face what do you want flick whistled to the others then pushed antoinette back inside dont worry she said were going to tie you up so the germans will think we forced you what is this antoinette said shakily ill explain in a moment are you alone yes good the others came in and ruby closed the apartment door they went into antoinettes kitchen a meal was laid out on the table black bread a salad of shredded carrots a heel of cheese a wine bottle without a label antoinette said again what is this sit down flick said finish your lunch she sat down but she said i cant eat its very simple flick said you and your ladies are not going to clean the chfteau tonight we are she looked baffled how will that happen were going to send notes to each of the women on duty tonight telling them to come here and see you before they go to work when they arrive we will tie them up then we will go to the chfteau instead of them you cant you dont have passes yes we do how antoinette gasped you stole my pass last sunday i thought i had lost it i got into the most terrible trouble with the germans im sorry you got into trouble but this will be worseyoure going to blow the place up antoinette began to moan and rock theyll blame me you know what theyre like well all be tortured flick gritted her teeth she knew that antoinette could be right the gestapo might easily kill the real cleaners just in case they had had something to do with the deception were going to do everything we can to make you look innocent she said you will be our victims the same as the germans all the same there remained a risk flick knew they wont believe us antoinette moaned we might be killed flick hardened her heart yes she said thats why its called a war chapter marles was a small town to the east of reims where the railway line began its long climb into the mountains on its way to frankfurt stuttgart and nuremberg the tunnel just beyond the town carried a constant stream of supplies from the home country to the german forces occupying france the destruction of the tunnel would starve rommel of ammunition the town itself looked bavarian with halftimbered houses painted in bright colors the town hall stood on the leafy square opposite the railway station the local gestapo chief had taken over the mayors grand office and now stood poring over a map with dieter franck and a captain bern who was in charge of the military guard on the tunnel i have twenty men at each end of the tunnel and another group constantly patrolling the mountain said bern the resistance would need a large force to overcome them dieter frowned according to the confession of the lesbian he had interrogated diana colefield flick had started with a team of six women including herself and must now be down to four however she might have joined up with another group or made contact with more french resistance cadres in and around marles they have plenty of people he said the french think the invasion is coming but a large force is hard to conceal so far we have seen nothing suspicious bern was short and slight and wore spectacles with thick lenses which was presumably why he was stationed in this backwater rather than with a fighting unit but he struck dieter as an intelligent and efficient young officer dieter was inclined to take what he said at face value dieter said how vulnerable is the tunnel to explosives it goes through solid rock of course it can be destroyed but they will need a truckload of dynamite they have plenty of dynamite but they need to get it hereagain without our seeing it indeed dieter turned to the gestapo chief have you received any reports of strange vehicles or a group of people arriving in the town none at all there is only one hotel in town and at present it has no guests my men visited the bars and restaurants at lunchtime as they do every day and saw nothing unusual captain bern said hesitantly is it conceivable major that the report you received of an attack on the tunnel was some kind of deception a diversion as it were to draw your attention away from the real target that infuriating possibility had already begun to dawn on dieter he knew from bitter experience that flick clairet was a master of deception had she fooled him again the thought was too humiliating to contemplate i interrogated the informant myself and im sure she was being honest dieter replied trying hard to keep the rage out of his voice but you could still be right its possible she had been misinformed deliberately as a precaution bern cocked his head and said a train is coming dieter frowned he could hear nothing my hearing is very good the man said with a smile no doubt to compensate for my eyesight dieter had established that the only train to have left reims for marles today had been the eleven oclock so michel and lieutenant hesse should be on the next one in the gestapo chief went to the window this is a westbound train he said your man is eastbound i think you said dieter nodded bern said in fact there are two trains approaching one from either direction the gestapo chief looked the other way youre right so there are the three men went out into the square dieters driver leaning on the hood of the citron stood upright and put out his cigarette beside him was a gestapo motorcyclist ready to resume surveillance of michel they walked to the station entrance is there another way out dieter asked the gestapo man they stood waiting captain bern said have you heard the news no what dieter replied rome has fallen my god the us army reached the piazza venezia yesterday at seven oclock in the evening as the senior officer dieter felt it was his duty to maintain morale thats bad news but not unexpected he said however italy is not france if they try to invade us theyll get a nasty surprise he hoped he was right the westbound train came in first while its passengers were still unloading their bags and stepping onto the platform the eastbound train chugged in there was a little knot of people waiting at the station entrance dieter studied them surreptitiously wondering if the local resistance was meeting michel at the train he saw nothing suspicious a gestapo checkpoint stood next to the ticket barrier the gestapo chief joined his underling at the table captain bern leaned on a pillar to one side making himself less conspicuous dieter returned to his car and sat in the back watching the station what would he do if captain bern was right and the tunnel was a diversion the prospect was dismal he would have to consider alternatives what other military targets were within reach of reims the chfteau at sainteccile was an obvious one but the resistance had failed to destroy that only a week agosurely they would not try again so soon there was a military camp to the north of the town some railwaymarshaling yards between reims and paris that was not the way to go guesswork might lead anywhere he needed information he could interrogate michel right now as soon as he got off the train pull out his fingernails one by one until he talkedbut would michel know the truth he might tell some cover story believing it to be genuine as diana had dieter would do better just to follow him until he met up with flick she knew the real target she was the only one worth interrogating now dieter waited impatiently while papers were carefully checked and passengers trickled through a whistle blew and the westbound train pulled out more passengers came out ten twenty thirty the eastbound train left then hans hesse emerged from the station dieter said what the hell hans looked around the square saw the citron and ran toward it dieter jumped out of the car hans said what happened where is he what do you mean dieter shouted angrily youre following him i did he got off the train i lost sight of him in the queue for the checkpoint after a while i got worried and jumped the queue but he had already gone could he have got back on the train noi followed him all the way off the platform could he have got on the other train hanss mouth dropped open i lost sight of him about the time we were passing the end of the reims platform thats it said dieter hell hes on his way back to reims hes a decoy this whole trip was a diversion he was furious that he had fallen for it what do we do well catch up with the train and you can follow him again i still think he will lead us to flick clairet get in the car lets go chapter flick could hardly believe she had got this far four of the original six jackdaws had evaded capture despite a brilliant adversary and some mixed luck and now they were in antoinettes kitchen a few steps away from the square at sainteccile right under the noses of the gestapo in ten minutes time they would walk up to the gates of the chfteau antoinette and four of the other five cleaners were firmly tied to kitchen chairs paul had gagged all but antoinette each cleaner had arrived carrying a little shopping basket or canvas bag containing food and drinkbread cold potatoes fruit and a flask of wine or ersatz coffeewhich they would normally have during their break not being allowed to use the german canteen now the jackdaws were hastily emptying the bags and reloading them with the things they needed to carry into the chfteau electric torches guns ammunition and yellow plastic explosive in grain sticks the jackdaws own suitcases which had held the stuff until now would have looked odd in the hands of cleaners going to work flick quickly realized that the cleaners own bags were not big enough she herself had a sten submachine gun with a silencer each of its three parts about a foot long jelly had sixteen detonators in a shockproof can an incendiary thermite bomb and a chemical block that produced oxygen for setting fires in enclosed spaces such as bunkers after loading their ordnance into the bags they had to conceal it with the cleaners packets of food there was not enough room damn flick said edgily antoinette do you have any big bags what do you mean bags big bags like shopping bags you must have some theres one in the pantry that i use for buying vegetables flick found the bag a cheap rectangular basket made of woven reeds its perfect she said have you any more like it no why would i have two flick needed four there was a knock flick went to the door a woman in a flowered overall and a hair net stood there the last of the cleaners good evening flick said the woman hesitated surprised to see a stranger is antoinette here i received a note flick smiled reassuringly in the kitchen please come in the woman walked through the apartment evidently familiar with the place and entered the kitchen where she stopped dead and gave a little scream antoinette said dont worry francoisetheyre tying us up so that the germans will know we didnt help them flick relieved the woman of her bag it was made of knotted stringfine for carrying a loaf and a bottle but no good to flick this infuriatingly petty detail had flick stymied just minutes before the climax of the mission she could not go on until she solved the problem she forced herself to think calmly then said to antoinette where did you get your basket at the little shop across the street you can see it from the window the windows were open as it was a warm evening but the shutters were closed for shade flick pushed a shutter open a couple of inches and looked out onto the rue du chfteau on the other side of the street was a store selling candles firewood brooms and clothespins she turned to ruby go and buy three more bags quickly ruby went to the door if you can get different shapes and colors flick was afraid the bags might attract attention if they were all the same right paul tied the last of the cleaners to a chair and gagged her he was apologetic and charming and she did not resist flick gave cleaners passes to jelly and greta she had held them back until the last minute because they would have given away the mission if found on the person of a captured jackdaw with rubys pass in her hand she went to the window ruby was coming out of the store carrying three shopping baskets of different kinds flick was relieved she checked her watch it was two minutes to seven then disaster struck as ruby was about to cross the road she was accosted by a man in militarystyle clothes he wore a blue denim shirt with buttoned pockets a dark blue tie a beret and dark trousers tucked into high boots flick recognized the uniform of the milice the security militia that did the dirty work of the regime oh no she said like the gestapo the milice was made up of men too stupid and thuggish to get into the normal police their officers were upperclass versions of the same type snobbish patriots who talked of the glory of france and sent their underlings to arrest jewish children hiding in cellars paul came and looked over flicks shoulder hell its a frigging militian he said flicks mind raced was this a chance encounter or part of an organized security sweep directed at the jackdaws the milice were infamous busybodies reveling in their power to harass their fellow citizens they would stop people they did not like the look of examine their papers minutely and seek a pretext to arrest them was the questioning of ruby such an incident flick hoped so if the police were stopping everyone on the streets of sainteccile the jackdaws might never reach the gates of the chfteau the cop started to question ruby aggressively flick could not hear clearly but she picked up the words mongrel and black and she wondered if the man was accusing the darkskinned ruby of being a gypsy ruby took out her papers the man examined them then continued to question her without handing them back paul drew his pistol put it away flick commanded youre not going to let him arrest her yes i am flick said coldly if we have a shootout now were finishedthe mission is blown whatever happens rubys life is not as important as disabling the telephone exchange put away the damn gun paul tucked it under the waistband of his trousers the conversation between ruby and the militian became heated flick watched with trepidation as ruby shifted the three baskets to her left hand and put her right hand into her raincoat pocket the man grabbed rubys left shoulder in a decisive way obviously arresting her ruby moved fast she dropped the baskets her right hand came out of her pocket holding a knife she took a step forward and swung the knife up from hip level with great force sticking the blade through his uniform shirt just below the ribs angled up toward the heart flick said oh shit the man gave a scream that quickly died off into a horrible gurgle ruby tugged the knife out and stuck it in again this time from the side he threw back his head and opened his mouth in a soundless cry of pain flick was thinking ahead if she could get the body out of sight quickly they might get away with this had anyone seen the stabbing flicks view from the window was restricted by the shutters she pushed them wide and leaned out to her left the rue du chfteau was deserted except for a parked truck and a dog asleep on a doorstep looking the other way she saw coming along the pavement three young people in policestyle uniforms two men and a woman they had to be gestapo personnel from the chfteau the militian fell to the pavement blood coming from his mouth before flick could shout a warning the two gestapo men sprang forward and grabbed ruby by the arms flick quickly pulled her head back in and drew the shutters together ruby was lost she continued to watch through a narrow gap between the shutters one of the gestapo men banged rubys right hand against the shop wall until she dropped the knife the girl bent over the bleeding militian she lifted his head and spoke to him then said something to the two men there was a short exchange of barked words the girl ran into the shop and came out with a storekeeper in a white apron he bent over the militian then stood up again his face showing distastewhether for the mans ugly wounds or for the hated uniform flick could not tell the girl ran off back in the direction of the chfteau presumably to get help and the two men frogmarched ruby in the same direction flick said paulgo and get the baskets ruby dropped paul did not hesitate yes maam he went out flick watched him emerge onto the street and cross the road what would the storekeeper say the man looked at paul and said something paul did not reply but bent down swiftly picked up the three baskets and came back the storekeeper stared at paul and flick could read his thoughts on his face at first shocked by pauls apparent callousness then puzzled and searching for possible reasons then beginning to understand lets move quickly flick said as paul came into the kitchen load the bags and out now i want us to pass through that checkpoint while the guards are still excited about ruby she quickly stuffed one of the baskets with a powerful flashlight her disassembled sten gun six round magazines and her share of the plastic explosive her pistol and knife were in her pockets she covered the weapons in the basket with a cloth and put in a slice of vegetable terrine wrapped in baking paper jelly said what if the guards at the gate search the baskets then were dead flick said well just try to take as many of the enemy with us as we can dont let the nazis capture you alive oh my gordon said jelly but she checked the magazine in her automatic pistol professionally and pushed it home with a decisive click the church bell in the town square struck seven they were ready flick said to paul someone is sure to notice there are only three cleaners instead of the usual six antoinette is the supervisor so they may decide to ask her whats gone wrong if anyone shows up here youll just have to shoot him okay flick kissed paul on the mouth briefly but hard then went out with jelly and greta following on the other side of the street the storekeeper was staring down at the militian dying on the pavement he glanced up at the three women then looked away again flick guessed he was already rehearsing his answers to questions i saw nothing no one else was there the three remaining jackdaws turned toward the square flick set a brisk pace wanting to get to the chfteau as quickly as possible she could see the gates directly ahead of her on the far side of the square ruby and her two captors were just passing through well flick thought at least ruby is inside the jackdaws reached the end of the street and started across the square the window of the caf des sports smashed in last weeks shootout was boarded over two guards from the chfteau came across the square at a run carrying their rifles their boots clattering on the cobblestones no doubt heading for the wounded militian they took no notice of the little group of cleaning women who scuttled out of the way flick reached the gate this was the first really dangerous moment one guard was left he kept looking past flick at his comrades running across the square he glanced at flicks pass and waved her in she stepped through the gate then turned to wait for the others greta came next and the guard did the same he was more interested in what was going on in the rue du chfteau flick thought they were home and dry but when he had checked jellys pass he glanced into her basket something smells good he said flick held her breath its some sausage for my supper jelly said you can smell the garlic he waved her on and looked across the square again the three jackdaws walked up the short drive mounted the steps and at last entered the chfteau chapter dieter spent the afternoon shadowing michels train stopping at every sleepy country halt in case michel got off he felt sure he was wasting his time and that michel was a decoy but he had no alternative michel was his only lead he was desperate michel rode the train all the way back to reims a doomy sense of impending failure and disgrace overwhelmed dieter as he sat in a car beside a bombed building near the reims station waiting for michel to emerge where had he gone wrong it seemed to him that he had done everything he couldbut nothing had worked what if following michel led nowhere at some point dieter would have to cut his losses and interrogate the man but how much time did he have tonight was the night of the full moon but the english channel was stormy again the allies might postpone the invasionor they might decide to take their chances with the weather in a few hours it might be too late michel had come to the station this morning in a van borrowed from philippe moulier the meat supplier and dieter looked around for it but could not see it he guessed the van had been left here for flick clairet to pick up by now she might be anywhere within a radius of a hundred miles he cursed himself for not setting someone to watch the van he diverted himself by considering how to interrogate michel the mans weak point was probably gilberte right now she was in a cell at the chfteau wondering what was going to happen to her she would stay there until dieter was quite sure he had finished with her then she would be executed or sent to a camp in germany how could she be used to make michel talkand fast the thought of the camps in germany gave dieter an idea leaning forward he said to his driver when the gestapo send prisoners to germany they go by train dont they yes sir is it true that you put them in the kind of railway cars normally used for transporting livestock cattle trucks yes sir its good enough for those scum communists and jews and the like where do they board right here in reims the train from paris stops here and how often do those trains run theres one most days it leaves paris late in the afternoon and stops here around eight in the evening if its on time before he could progress his idea further dieter saw michel emerge from the station ten yards behind him in the crowd was hans hesse they approached dieter on the other side of the street dieters driver started the engine dieter turned in his seat to watch michel and hans they passed dieter then to dieters surprise michel turned into the alley alongside the caf de la gare hans quickened his pace and turned the same corner less than a minute later dieter frowned was michel trying to shake off his tail hans reemerged from the alley and looked up and down the street with a worried frown there were not many people on the pavements just a few travelers walking to and from the station and the last of the city center workers heading for home hans mouthed a curse and turned back into the alley dieter groaned aloud hans had lost michel this was the worst foulup dieter had been involved in since the battle of alam haifa when wrong intelligence had led rommel to defeat that had been the turning point of the north african war dieter prayed this was not to be the turning point in europe as he stared despondently at the mouth of the alley michel emerged from the front entrance of the caf dieters spirits leaped michel had shaken off hans but did not realize he had a second shadow all was not yet lost michel crossed the road breaking into a run and headed back the way he had cometoward dieter in the car dieter thought fast if he tried to follow michel maintaining the surveillance then he too would have to run and that would make it obvious that he was tailing the man it was no good the surveillance was over it was time to seize michel michel pounded along the pavement shoving other pedestrians aside he ran awkwardly because of his bullet wound but he moved fast and rapidly approached dieters car dieter made a decision he opened the car door as michel drew level dieter got out narrowing the available pavement by holding the door wide michel swerved to dodge around the obstacle dieter stuck out his leg michel tripped over his outstretched foot and went flying a big man he fell heavily on the paved sidewalk dieter drew his pistol and thumbed the safety catch michel lay prone for a second stunned then groggily he tried to get to his knees dieter touched the barrel of the gun to michels temple dont get up he said in french the driver got a pair of handcuffs from the trunk secured michels wrists and bundled him into the back of the car hans reappeared looking dismayed what happened he went in through the back door of the caf de la gare and came out of the front dieter explained hans was relieved what now come with me to the station dieter turned to the driver do you have a gun yes sir keep a close watch on this man if he tries to escape shoot him in the legs yes sir dieter and hans walked briskly into the station dieter buttonholed a uniformed railway man and said i want to see the stationmaster right away the man looked surly but he said ill take you to his office the stationmaster was dressed in a black jacket and waistcoat with striped trousers an elegant oldfashioned uniform worn thin at the elbows and knees he kept his bowler hat on even in his office he was frightened by this visit from a highpowered german what can i do for you he said with a nervous smile are you expecting a train from paris with prisoners tonight yes at eight oclock as usual when it comes hold it here until you hear from me i have a special prisoner i want to board very good if i could have written authorization of course i will arrange it do you do anything with the prisoners while the train is here sometimes we hose out the cars cattle trucks are used you see so there are no lavatory facilities and frankly it becomes extremely unpleasant without wishing to criticize do not clean the trucks tonight you understand of course do you do anything else the man hesitated not really he was guilty about something dieter could tell come on man out with it im not going to punish you sometimes the railway men take pity on the prisoners and give them water its not allowed strictly speaking but no water will be given tonight understood dieter turned to hans i want you to take michel clairet to the police station and lock him in a cell then return here to the station and make sure my orders are carried out of course major dieter picked up the phone on the stationmasters desk get me the chfteau of sainteccile when he got through he asked for weber theres a woman in the cells called gilberte i know said weber pretty girl dieter wondered why weber sounded so pleased with himself would you please send her in a car to the railway station in reims lieutenant hesse is here he will take charge of her very well said weber hold the line a moment will you he moved the phone away from his mouth and spoke to someone in the room giving orders for gilberte to be moved dieter waited impatiently weber came back on the line ive arranged that thank you dont hang up i have some news for you this would be why he was sounding pleased go on dieter said i have captured an allied agent myself what dieter said this was a lucky break when a few minutes ago where for gods sake right here in sainteccile how did that happen she attacked a militian and three of my bright young people happened to witness it they had the presence of mind to capture the culprit who was armed with a colt automatic did you say she the agent is a woman yes that settled it the jackdaws were in sainteccile the chfteau was their target dieter said weber listen to me i think she is part of a team of saboteurs intending to attack the chfteau they tried that before weber said we gave them a hiding dieter controlled his impatience with an effort indeed you did so they may be more sly this time may i suggest a security alert double the guards search the chfteau and question all nongerman personnel in the building i have given orders to that effect dieter was not sure he believed that weber had already thought of a security alert but it did not matter so long as he did so now dieter briefly considered rescinding his instructions about gilberte and michel but decided not to he might well need to interrogate michel before the night was over i will return to sainteccile immediately he told weber as you wish weber said casually implying he could manage perfectly well without dieters assistance i need to interrogate the new prisoner i have already begun sergeant becker is softening her up for gods sake i want her sane and able to speak of course please weber this is too important for mistakes i beg you to keep becker under control until i get there very well franck i will make sure he doesnt overdo it thank you ill be there as fast as i can dieter hung up chapter flick paused at the entrance to the great hall of the chfteau her pulse was racing and there was a cold sensation of fear in her chest she was in the lions den if she were captured nothing could save her she surveyed the room rapidly telephone switchboards had been installed in precise paradeground rows incongruously modern against the faded grandeur of the pinkandgreen walls and the pudgy cherubs painted on the ceiling bundled cables twisted across the checkerboard marble floor like uncoiled ropes on the deck of a ship there was a hubbub of chatter from forty operators those nearest glanced at the new arrivals flick saw one girl speak to her neighbor and point to them the operators were all from reims and the surrounding district many from sainteccile itself so they would know the regular cleaners and would realize the jackdaws were strangers but flick was gambling that they would say nothing to the germans she oriented herself quickly bringing to mind the plan antoinette had drawn the bombed west wing to her left was disused she turned right and led greta and jelly through a pair of tall paneled doors into the east wing one room led to another all palatial reception rooms full of switchboards and equipment racks that buzzed and clicked as numbers were dialed flick did not know whether the cleaners normally greeted the operators or passed them in silence the french were great people for saying good morning but this place was run by the german military she contented herself with smiling vaguely and avoiding eye contact in the third room a supervisor in german uniform sat at a desk flick ignored her but the woman called out where is antoinette flick answered without pausing in her stride shes coming she heard the tremor of fear in her own voice and hoped the supervisor had not noticed the woman glanced up at the clock which said five past seven youre late very sorry madame well get started right away flick hurried into the next room for a moment she listened heart in her mouth for an angry shout calling her back but none came and she breathed easier and walked on with greta and jelly close behind at the end of the east wing was a stairwell leading up to the offices or down to the basement the jackdaws were headed for the basement eventually but first they had preparations to make they turned left and moved into the service wing following antoinettes directions they found a small room where cleaning materials were stored mops buckets brooms and garbage bins plus the brown cotton overall coats the cleaners had to wear on duty flick closed the door so far so good said jelly greta said im so scared she was pale and trembling i dont think i can go on flick gave her a reassuring smile youll be fine she said lets get on with it put your ordnance into these cleaning buckets jelly began to transfer her explosives into a bucket and after a moments hesitation greta followed suit flick assembled her submachine gun without its rifle butt reducing the length by a foot to make it easier to conceal she fitted the noise suppressor and flicked the switch for singleshot firing when using the silencer the chamber had to be reloaded manually before each shot she pushed the weapon under her leather belt then she put on an overall coat it covered the gun she left the buttons undone for quick access the other two also put on overalls concealing the guns and ammunition stuffed into their pockets they were almost ready for the basement however it was a highsecurity area with a guard at the door and french personnel were not allowed down therethe germans cleaned it themselves before entering the jackdaws were going to create a little confusion they were about to leave the room when the door opened and a german officer looked in passes he barked flick tensed she had been expecting some kind of security alert the gestapo must have guessed that ruby was an allied agentno one else would be carrying an automatic pistol and a lethal knifeand it made sense for them to take extra precautions at the chfteau however she had hoped that the gestapo would move too slowly to interfere with her mission that wish had not been granted probably they were doublechecking all french personnel in the building quickly the man said impatiently he was a gestapo lieutenant flick saw from the badge on his uniform shirt she took out her pass he looked at it carefully comparing the picture with her face and handed it back he did the same with jelly and greta i must search you he said he looked into jellys bucket behind his back flick drew the sten gun from under her overall the officer frowned in puzzlement and took from jellys bucket the shockproof canister flick disengaged the cocking lever of her gun from the safety slot the officer unscrewed the lid of the canister amazement dawned on his face as he saw the detonators flick shot him in the back the gun was not really silentthe noise suppressor was not perfectly effectiveand the shot made a soft bang like a book being dropped on the floor the gestapo lieutenant jerked and fell flick ejected the cartridge and pulled back the bolt then shot him again in the head to make sure of him she reloaded the chamber and put the gun back under her overall jelly dragged the body to the wall and shoved it behind the door where it would not be seen by anyone glancing casually into the room lets get out of here said flick jelly went out greta stood frozen and pale staring at the dead officer flick said greta we have a job to do lets go at last greta nodded picked up her mop and bucket and walked through the door moving like a robot they went from the cleaning store into the canteen it was empty but for two girls in uniform drinking coffee and smoking speaking french in a low voice flick said you know what you have to do jelly began to sweep the floor greta hesitated flick said dont let me down greta nodded she took a deep breath straightened her back and said im ready flick entered the kitchen and greta followed the fuse boxes for the building were in a cupboard off the kitchen beside the large electric oven according to antoinette there was a young german man at the kitchen stove flick gave him a sexy smile and said what have you got to offer a hungry girl he grinned at her behind his back greta took out a stout pair of pliers with rubberized handles then opened the cupboard door the sky was partly cloudy and the sun disappeared as dieter franck drove into the picturesque square of sainteccile the clouds were the same shade of dark gray as the slate roof of the church he noticed four guards at the chfteau gate instead of the usual two although he was in a gestapo car the sergeant carefully examined his pass and his drivers before opening the wroughtiron gates and waving the car in dieter was pleased weber had taken seriously the need for extra security a cool breeze blew as he walked from the car to the steps of the grand entrance passing into the hall and seeing the rows of women at their switchboards he thought about the female secret agent weber had arrested the jackdaws were an allwoman team it occurred to him that they might try to enter the chfteau disguised as telephonists was it possible as he passed through the east wing he spoke to the german woman supervisor have any of these women joined in the last few days no major she said one new girl was taken on three weeks ago and she was the last that put paid to his theory he nodded and walked on at the end of the east wing he took the staircase down the door to the basement stood open as usual but there were two soldiers instead of the usual one standing inside weber had doubled the guard the corporal saluted and the sergeant asked for his pass dieter noticed that the corporal stood behind the sergeant while the sergeant checked the pass he said the way you are now its too easy for someone to overpower you both corporal you should stand to the side and two meters away so that you have a clear shot if the sergeant is attacked yes sir dieter entered the basement corridor he could hear the rumble of the dieselfueled generator that supplied electricity to the phone system he passed the doors of the equipment rooms and entered the interview room he hoped to find the new prisoner here but the room was empty puzzled he stepped inside and closed the door then his question was answered from the inner chamber came a long scream of utter agony dieter threw open the door becker stood at the electric shock machine weber sat on a chair nearby a young woman lay on the operating table with her wrists and ankles strapped and her head clamped in the head restraint she wore a blue dress and wires from the electric shock machine ran between her feet and up her dress weber said hello franck join us please becker here has come up with an innovation show him sergeant becker reached beneath the womans dress and drew out an ebonite cylinder about fifteen centimeters long and two or three in diameter the cylinder was ringed by two metal bands a couple of centimeters apart two wires from the electric shock machine were attached to the bands dieter was accustomed to torture but this hellish caricature of the sexual act filled him with loathing and he shuddered with disgust she hasnt said anything yet but weve only just started weber said give her another shock sergeant becker pushed up the womans dress and inserted the cylinder in her vagina he picked up a roll of electricians tape tore off a strip and secured the cylinder so that it would not fall out weber said turn the voltage up this time becker returned to the machine then the lights went out there was a blue flash and a bang from behind the oven the lights went out and the kitchen was filled with the smell of scorched insulation the motor of the refrigerator ran down with a groan as the power was cut off the young cook said in german whats going on flick ran out of the door and through the canteen with jelly and greta hard on her heels they followed a short corridor past the cleaning cupboard at the top of the stairs flick paused she drew her submachine gun and held it concealed under the flap of her coat the basement will be in total darkness she said i cut all the cables including the wires to the emergency lighting system greta assured her lets go they ran down the stairs the daylight coming from the groundfloor windows faded rapidly as they descended and the entrance to the basement was halfdark there were two soldiers standing just inside the door one of them a young corporal with a rifle smiled and said dont worry ladies its only a power cut flick shot him in the chest then swung her weapon and shot the sergeant the three jackdaws stepped through the doorway flick held her gun in her right hand and the flashlight in her left she could hear a low rumble of machinery and several voices shouting questions in german from distant rooms she turned on an electric torch for a second she was in a broad corridor with a low ceiling farther along doors were opening she switched off the flashlight a moment later she saw the flicker of a match at the far end about thirty seconds had passed since greta cut off the power it would not be long before the germans recovered from the shock and found flashlights she had only a minute maybe less to get out of sight she tried the nearest door it was open she shone her flashlight inside this was a photo lab with prints hanging to dry and a man in a white coat fumbling his way across the room she slammed the door crossed the corridor in two strides and tried a door on the opposite side it was locked she guessed from the position of the room at the front of the chfteau under a corner of the parking lot that the room beyond contained the fuel tanks she moved along the corridor and opened the next door the rumble of machinery became louder she shone her flashlight once more just for a split second long enough to see an electricity generatorthe independent power supply to the phone system she assumedthen she hissed drag the bodies in here jelly and greta pulled the dead guards across the floor flick returned to the basement entrance and slammed the steel door shut now the corridor was in total darkness as an afterthought she shot the three heavy bolts on the inside that might give her precious extra seconds she returned to the generator room closed the door and turned on her flashlight jelly and greta had pushed the bodies behind the door and stood panting with the effort all done greta murmured there was a mass of pipes and cables in the room but they were all colorcoded with german efficiency and flick knew which was which freshair pipes were yellow fuel lines were brown water pipes were green and power lines were striped redandblack she directed her torch at the brown fuel line to the generator later if we have time i want you to blow a hole in that easy said jelly now put your hand on my shoulder and follow me greta you follow jelly the same way okay okay flick turned off her flashlight and opened the door now they had to explore the basement blind she put her hand to the wall as a guide and began to walk heading farther inside a confused babble of raised voices revealed that several men were blundering about the corridor an authoritative voice said in german who closed the main door she heard greta reply but in a mans voice it seems to be stuck the german cursed a moment later there was the scrape of a bolt flick reached another door she opened it and shone her flashlight again it contained two huge wooden coffers the size and shape of mortuary slabs greta whispered battery room go to the next door the german mans voice said was that a flashlight bring it over here just coming said greta in her gerhard voice but the three jackdaws walked in the opposite direction flick came to the next room led the other two inside and closed the door before shining her flashlight it was a long narrow chamber with racks of equipment along both walls at the near end of the room was a cabinet that probably held large sheets of drawings at the far end the beam of her flashlight revealed a small table three men sat at it holding playing cards they appeared to have remained sitting during the minute or so since the lights went out now they moved as they rose to their feet flick leveled her gun jelly was just as quick flick shot one jellys pistol cracked and the man beside him fell the third man dived for cover but flicks flashlight followed him both flick and jelly fired again and he fell still flick refused to let herself think about the dead men as people there was no time for feelings she shone her flashlight around what she saw gladdened her heart this was almost certainly the room she was looking for standing a meter from one long wall was a pair of floortoceiling racks bristling with thousands of terminals in tidy rows from the outside world the telephone cables came through the wall in neat bundles to the backs of the terminals on the nearer rack at the farther end similar cables led from the backs of the terminals up through the ceiling to the switchboards above at the front of the frame a nightmare tangle of loose jumper wires connected the terminals of the near rack to those of the far one flick looked at greta well greta was examining the equipment by the light of her own flashlight a fascinated expression on her face this is the mdfthe main distribution frame she said but its a bit different from ours in britain flick stared at greta in surprise minutes ago she had said she was too frightened to go on now she was unmoved by the killing of three men along the far wall more racks of equipment glowed with the light of vacuum tubes and on the other side flick asked greta swung her torch those are the amplifiers and carrier circuit equipment for the longdistance lines good flick said briskly show jelly where to place the charges the three of them went to work greta unwrapped the waxpaper packets of yellow plastic explosive while flick cut the fuse cord into lengths it burned at one centimeter per second ill make all the fuses three meters long flick said that will give us exactly five minutes to get out jelly assembled the fire train fuse detonator and firing cap flick held a flashlight while greta molded the charges to the frames at the vulnerable places and jelly stuck the firing cap into the soft explosive they worked fast in five minutes all the equipment was covered with charges like a rash the fuse cords led to a common source where they were loosely twisted together so that one light would serve to ignite them all jelly took out a thermite bomb a black can about the size and shape of a tin of soup containing finely powdered aluminum oxide and iron oxide it would burn with intense heat and fierce flames she took off the lid to reveal two fuses then placed it on the ground behind the mdf greta said somewhere in here are thousands of cards showing how the circuits are connected we should burn them then it will take the repair crew two weeks rather than two days to reconnect the cables flick opened the cupboard and found four custommade card holders containing large diagrams neatly sorted by labeled file dividers is this what were looking for greta studied a card by the light of her flashlight yes jelly said scatter them around the thermite bomb theyll go up in seconds flick threw the cards on the floor in loose piles jelly placed an oxygengenerating pack on the floor at the blind end of the room this will make the fire hotter she said ordinarily we could only burn the wooden frames and the insulation around the cables but with this the copper cables should melt everything was ready flick shone her flashlight around the room the outer walls were ancient brick but the inner walls between the rooms were light wooden partitions the explosion would destroy the partition walls and the fire would spread rapidly to the rest of the basement five minutes had passed since the lights went out jelly took out a cigarette lighter flick said you two make your way outside the building jelly on your way go into the generating room and blow a hole in the fuel line where i showed you got it we meet up at antoinettes greta said anxiously where are you going to find ruby jelly warned you have five minutes flick nodded jelly lit the fuse w h e n d e t e r passed from the darkness of the basement into the halflight of the stairwell he noticed that the guards had gone from the entrance no doubt they were fetching help but the ill discipline infuriated him they should have remained at their post perhaps they had been forcibly removed had they been taken away at gunpoint was an attack on the chfteau already under way he ran up the stairs on the ground floor there were no signs of battle the operators were still working the phone system was on a separate circuit from the rest of the buildings electricity and there was still enough light coming through the windows for them to see their switchboards he ran through the canteen heading for the rear of the building where the maintenance workshops were located but on the way he looked into the kitchen and found three soldiers in overalls staring at a fuse box theres a power cut in the basement dieter said i know said one of the men he had a sergeants stripes on his shirt all these wires have been cut dieter raised his voice then get your tools out and reconnect them you damn fool he said dont stand here scratching your stupid head the sergeant was startled yes sir he said a worriedlooking young cook said i think its the electric oven sir what happened dieter barked well major they were cleaning behind the oven and there was a bang who who was cleaning i dont know sir a soldier someone you recognized no sir just a cleaner dieter did not know what to think clearly the chfteau was under attack but where were the enemy he left the kitchen went to the stairwell and ran up toward the offices on the upper floor as he turned at the bend in the stairs something caught his eye and he looked back a tall woman in a cleaners overall was coming up the stairs from the basement carrying a mop and a bucket he froze staring at her his mind racing she should not have been there only germans were allowed into the basement of course anything could have happened in the confusion of a power cut but the cook had blamed a cleaner for the power cut he recalled his brief conversation with the supervisor of the switchboard girls none of them was new to the jobbut he had not asked about the frenchwomen cleaners he came back down the stairs and met her at ground level why were you in the basement he asked her in french i went there to clean but the lights are out dieter frowned she spoke french with an accent that he could not quite place he said youre not supposed to go there yes the soldier told me that they clean it themselves i didnt know her accent was not english dieter thought but what was it how long have you worked here only a week and ive always done upstairs until today her story was plausible but dieter was not satisfied come with me he took her arm in a firm grip she did not resist as he led her through to the kitchen dieter spoke to the cook do you recognize this woman yes sir shes the one who was cleaning behind the oven dieter looked at her is that true yes sir im very sorry if i damaged something dieter recognized her accent youre german he said no sir you filthy traitor he looked at the cook grab her and follow me shes going to tell me everything f l i c k o p e n e d t h e door marked interview room stepped inside closed the door behind her and swept the room with her flashlight she saw a cheap pine table with ashtrays several chairs and a steel desk the room was empty of people she was puzzled she had located the prison cells on this corridor and had shone her flashlight through the judas in each door the cells were empty the prisoners the gestapo had taken during the last eight days including gilberte must have been moved somewhere else or killed but ruby had to be here somewhere then she saw on her left a door leading presumably to an inner chamber she switched off her flashlight opened the door stepped through closed the door and switched on her flashlight she saw ruby right away she was lying on a table like a hospital operating table specially designed straps secured her wrists and ankles and made it impossible for her to move her head a wire from an electrical machine led between her feet and up her skirt flick guessed immediately what had been done to ruby and gasped with horror she stepped to the table ruby can you hear me ruby groaned flicks heart leaped she was still alive ill free you she said she put her sten gun down on the table ruby was trying to speak but her words came out as a moan swiftly flick undid the straps that bound ruby to the table flick ruby said at last what behind you flick jumped to one side something heavy brushed her ear and thumped her left shoulder hard she cried out in pain dropped her flashlight and fell hitting the floor she rolled sideways moving as far as possible from her original position so that her assailant could not hit her again she had been so shocked by the sight of ruby that she had not shone her flashlight all around the room someone else had been lurking in the shadows waiting for his chance and had slowly crept up behind her her left arm was momentarily numbed using her right hand she scrabbled on the floor for her flashlight before she found it there was a loud click and the lights came on she blinked and saw two people one was a squat stocky man with a round head and closecropped hair behind him stood ruby in the dark ruby had picked up what looked like a steel bar and she held it above her head in readiness as soon as the lights came on ruby saw the man turned and brought the steel bar down on his head with maximum force it was a crippling blow and the man slumped to the floor and lay still flick got up the feeling was rapidly returning to her arm she picked up the sten gun ruby was kneeling over the prone body of the man meet sergeant becker she said are you all right flick said im in bloody agony but im going to get my own back on this fucking bastard grasping the front of beckers uniform tunic ruby heaved him upright then with an effort pushed him onto the operating table he groaned hes coming round flick said ill finish him off give me ten seconds ruby straightened the mans limbs and strapped him in by his wrists and ankles then she tightened the head restraint so that he could not move finally she took the cylindrical terminal from the electric shock machine and stuffed it into his mouth he choked and gagged but could not move his head she picked up a roll of electricians tape tore off a strip with her teeth and secured the cylinder so that it would not come out of his mouth then she went to the machine and fumbled with the switch there was a low hum the man on the table let out a strangled scream his strappeddown body shook with convulsions ruby looked at him for a moment then she said lets go they went out leaving sergeant becker writhing on the table squealing like a pig in the slaughterhouse flick checked her watch two minutes had passed since jelly lit the fuses they passed through the interview room and stepped out into the corridor the confusion had died down there were just three soldiers near the entrance talking calmly flick walked rapidly toward them with ruby close behind flicks instinct was to walk straight past the soldiers relying on a confident air to get her through but then she glimpsed through the door the tall figure of dieter franck approaching followed by two or three other people she could not clearly see she stopped abruptly ruby bumped into her back flick turned to the nearest door it was marked wireless room she opened it the room was empty they stepped inside she left the door an inch open she heard major franck bark in german captain where are the two men who should be guarding this entrance i dont know major i was just asking flick took the silencer off her sten gun and flicked the switch for rapid fire she had used only four bullets so far leaving twentyeight in the magazine sergeant you and this corporal stand guard captain you go up to major webers office and tell him major franck strongly recommends he conduct a search of the basement immediately off you go on the double a moment later francks footsteps passed the wireless room flick waited listening a door slammed she peeped out franck had disappeared lets go she said to ruby they left the wireless room and walked to the main door the corporal said in french what are you doing here flick had an answer ready my friend valerie is new to the job and she came to the wrong place in the confusion of the blackout the corporal looked dubious its still light upstairs how could she get lost ruby said im very sorry sir i thought i was supposed to clean here and no one stopped me the sergeant said in german were supposed to keep them out not keep them in corporal he laughed and waved them on dieter tied the prisoner to a chair then dismissed the cook who had escorted her from the kitchen he looked at the woman for a moment wondering how much time he had one agent had been arrested in the street outside the chfteau another if she was an agent had been caught coming up the stairs from the basement had the others come and gone were they waiting somewhere to be let in or were they here in the building right now it was maddening not to know what was happening but he had ordered the basement searched the only other thing he could do was interrogate the prisoner dieter began with the traditional slap in the face sudden and demoralizing the woman gasped with shock and pain where are your friends he asked her the womans cheek reddened he studied her expression what he saw mystified him she looked happy youre in the basement of the chfteau he told her through that door is the torture chamber on the other side beyond that partition wall is the telephone switchgear we are at the end of a tunnel the bottom of the sack as the french say if your friends plan to blow up the building you and i will surely die here in this room her expression did not change perhaps the chfteau was not about to blow up dieter thought but then what was the mission youre german he said why are you helping your countrys enemies at last she spoke ill tell you she said she spoke german with a hamburg accent many years ago i had a lover his name was manfred she looked away remembering your nazis arrested him and sent him to a camp i think he died therei never heard she paused swallowing dieter waited after a moment she went on when they took him away from me i swore i would have my revengeand this is it she smiled happily your foul regime is almost finished and ive helped to destroy it there was something wrong here she spoke as if the deed was already done furthermore the power cut had come and gone had the blackout already served its purpose this woman showed no fear but could it be that she did not mind dying why was your lover arrested they called him a pervert what kind he was homosexual but he was your lover yes dieter frowned then he looked harder at the woman she was tall and broadshouldered and underneath the makeup she had a masculine nose and chin are you a man he said in astonishment she just smiled a dreadful suspicion dawned on dieter why are you telling me this he said are you trying to keep me occupied while your friends get away are you sacrificing your life to ensure the success of the mission his train of thought was broken by a faint noise it sounded like a strangled scream now that he noticed it he realized he had heard it two or three times before and ignored it the sound seemed to come from the next room dieter sprang up and went into the torture chamber he expected to see the other woman agent on the table and was shocked to find someone else there it was a man he saw immediately but at first he did not know who because the face was distortedthe jaw dislocated the teeth broken the cheeks stained with blood and vomit then he recognized the squat figure of sergeant becker the wires from the electric shock machine led to beckers mouth dieter realized that the terminal from the machine was in beckers mouth secured there by electricians tape becker was still alive twitching and emitting a dreadful squealing sound dieter was horrified he swiftly turned off the machine becker stopped twitching dieter grasped the electric wire and jerked hard the terminal came out of beckers mouth he threw it to the floor he bent over the table becker he said can you hear me what happened here there was no reply upstairs all was normal flick and ruby walked quickly through the ranks of telephone operators all busy at their switchboards murmuring into their headsets in low voices as they plugged jacks into sockets connecting decisionmakers in berlin paris and normandy flick checked her watch in exactly two minutes all those connections would be destroyed and the military machine would fall apart leaving a scatter of isolated components unable to work together now flick thought if only we can get out they passed out of the building without incident in seconds they would be in the town square they had allmost made it but in the courtyard they met jellycoming back wheres greta she said she left with you flick replied i stopped to set a charge on the diesel fuel line in the generator room like you said greta went on ahead of me but she never reached antoinettes place ive just met paul he hasnt seen her i came back to look for her jelly had a paper packet in her hand i told the guard at the gate that i just went out to fetch my supper flick was dismayed greta must be insidehell im going back for her jelly said determinedly she saved me from the gestapo back in chartres so i owe her flick looked at her watch we have less than two minutes lets go they ran back inside the switchboard girls stared at them as they raced through the rooms flick was already having second thoughts in attempting to save one of her team was she about to sacrifice two moreand herself when they reached the stairwell flick paused the two soldiers who had let them out of the basement with a joke would not let them in again so easily as before she said quietly to the others approach the guards innocently and shoot at the last moment a voice from above said whats going on here flick froze she looked back over her shoulder on the staircase coming down from the top floor stood four men one in majors uniform was pointing a pistol at her she recognized major weber this was the search party dieter franck had asked for it had appeared at precisely the wrong moment flick cursed herself for a bad decision now four would be lost instead of one weber said you women have a conspiratorial air what do you want with us flick said were the cleaners perhaps you are he said but there is a team of female enemy agents in the district flick pretended to be relieved oh good she said if youre looking for enemy agents were safe i was afraid you might be dissatisfied with the cleaning she forced a laugh ruby joined in both sounded false weber said raise your hands in the air as she lifted her wrist past her face flick checked her watch thirty seconds left down the stairs said weber reluctantly flick went down ruby and jelly went with her and the four men followed she went as slowly as she could counting seconds she stopped at the foot of the stairs twenty seconds you again said one of the guards flick said speak to your major keep moving said weber i thought we werent supposed to go into the basement just keep going five seconds they passed through the basement door there was a tremendous bang at the far end of the corridor the partition walls of the equipment chamber exploded outwards there was a series of crashing sounds flames billowed over the debris flick was knocked down she got up on one knee pulled the submachine gun out from under her overall and spun around jelly and ruby were on either side of her the basement guards weber and the other three men had also fallen flick pulled the trigger of the six germans only weber had kept his presence of mind as flick sprayed bullets weber fired his pistol beside flick jelly struggling to her feet cried out and fell then flick hit weber in the chest and he went down flick emptied her gun into the six bodies on the floor she ejected the magazine took a fresh one from her pocket and reloaded ruby bent over jelly feeling for a pulse after a moment she looked up dead she said flick looked toward the far end of the corridor where greta was flames were billowing out from the equipment chamber but the wall of the interview room seemed intact she ran toward the inferno dieter found himself lying on the floor without knowing how he had got there he heard the roaring of flames and smelled smoke he struggled to his feet and looked into the interview room he realized immediately that the brick walls of the torture chamber had saved his life the partition between the interview room and the equipment chamber had disappeared the few pieces of furniture in the interview room had been thrown up against the wall the prisoner had suffered the same fate and lay on the ground still tied to the chair neck at the horrid angle that indicated it was broken and sheor hewas dead the equipment chamber was aflame and the fire was spreading rapidly dieter realized he had only seconds to get away the door to the interview room opened and flick clairet stood there holding a submachine gun she wore a dark wig that had fallen askew to reveal her own blonde hair beneath flushed breathing hard a wild look in her eyes she was beautiful if he had had a gun in his hand at that moment he would have mowed her down in blind rage she would be an incomparable prize if captured alive but he was so enraged and humiliated by her success and his own failure that he could not have controlled himself but she had the gun at first she did not see dieter but stared at the dead body of her comrade dieters hand moved inside his jacket then she lifted her gaze and met his eyes he saw recognition dawn on her face she knew who he was she knew whom she had been fighting for the past nine days there was a light of triumph in her eyes but he also saw the thirst for revenge in the twist of her mouth and she raised the sten gun and fired dieter ducked back into the torture chamber as her bullets chipped fragments of brick off the wall he drew his walther p automatic pistol thumbed the safety lever to the fire position and pointed it at the doorway waiting for flick to come through she did not appear he waited a few seconds then risked a look flick had gone he dashed across the burning interview room threw open the door and stepped into the corridor flick and another woman were running toward the far end as he raised his gun they jumped over a group of uniformed bodies on the floor he aimed at flick then a hot pain burned his arm he cried out and dropped his gun he saw that his sleeve was on fire he tore off his jacket when he looked up again the women had gone dieter picked up his pistol and went after them as he ran he smelled fuel there was a leakor perhaps the saboteurs had holed a pipe any second now the basement would explode like a giant bomb but he might still catch flick he ran out and started up the stairs in the torture chamber sergeant beckers uniform started to smolder the heat and the smoke brought him back to consciousness and he cried for help but no one heard he struggled against the leather straps that bound him as so many of his victims had struggled in the past but like them he was helpless a few moments later his clothes burst into flame and he began to scream flick saw dieter coming up the stairs after her with his gun in his hand she was afraid that if she stopped and turned to take aim at him he would be able to shoot first she decided to run rather than stand and fight someone had activated the fire alarm and a klaxon blared throughout the chfteau as she and ruby raced through the switchboard rooms all the operators left their stations and crowded to the doors so that flick found herself in a crush the crowd would be making it difficult for dieter to get a shot at her or ruby but the other women were slowing them down flick punched and kicked ruthlessly to get people out of her way they reached the front entrance and ran down the steps in the square flick could see mouliers meat van backed up to the chfteau gates with its engine running and its rear doors open paul stood beside it staring anxiously through the iron railings flick thought he was the best thing she had ever seen however as the women poured out of the building two guards were directing them into the vineyard on the west side of the courtyard away from the parked cars flick and ruby ignored their waved instructions and ran for the gates when the soldiers saw flicks submachine gun they reached for their weapons a rifle appeared in pauls hands he aimed through the railings two shots rang out and both guards fell paul threw open the gates as flick dashed through the gateway shots whistled over her head and hit the van dieter was firing paul jumped into the front of the van flick and ruby threw themselves into the back as the van pulled away flick saw dieter turn toward the parking lot where his skyblue car stood waiting at that moment down in the basement the fire reached the fuel tanks there was a deep underground boom like an earthquake the parking lot erupted gravel and earth and slabs of concrete flying into the air half the cars parked around the old fountain were overturned huge stones and chunks of brickwork rained down on the rest dieter was thrown back across the steps the gas pump soared into the air and a gout of flame spurted from the ground where it had stood several cars caught fire and their gas tanks began to explode one by one then the van left the square and flick could see no more paul drove at top speed out of the village flick and ruby bounced on the metal floor of the van it dawned slowly on flick that they had accomplished their mission she could hardly believe it she thought of greta and jelly both dead and of diana and maude dead or dying in some concentration camp and she could not feel happy but she felt a savage satisfaction as she saw again in her mind the blazing equipment chamber and the exploding parking lot she looked at ruby ruby grinned at her we did it she said flick nodded ruby put her arms around flick and hugged her hard yes flick said we did it dieter picked himself up off the ground he felt bruised all over but he could walk the chfteau was ablaze and the parking lot was a shambles the women were screaming and panicking he stared at the carnage all around the jackdaws had succeeded in their mission but it was not over yet they were still in france and if he could capture and interrogate flick clairet he could yet turn defeat into victory sometime tonight she must be planning to meet a small plane in a field not far from reims he had to find out where and when and he knew who would tell him her husband the last day tuesday june chapter dieter sat on the platform at the reims railway station french railway men and german troops watched with him standing patiently under the harsh lights the prison train was late hours late but it was coming he had been assured of that he had to wait for it he had no other cards to play his heart was full of rage he had been humiliated and defeated by a girl had she been a german girl he would have been proud of her he would have called her brilliant and brave he might even have fallen in love with her but she belonged to the enemy and she had outwitted him at every turn she had killed stephanie she had destroyed the chfteau and she had escaped but he would catch her yet and when he did she would suffer tortures worse than her most terrifying imaginingsthen she would talk everyone talked the train rolled in a few minutes after midnight he noticed the stink even before it came to a halt it was like the smell of a farmyard but disgustingly human there was an assortment of rail cars none of them designed for passengers goods wagons cattle trucks even a mail car with its narrow windows broken each was crammed with people the livestock wagons had high wooden sides pierced by slats to permit observation of the animals the prisoners nearest put their arms through the slats hands open with palms upward begging they asked to be let out they pleaded for something to eat but most of all they begged for water the guards looked on impassively dieter had given instructions that the prisoners were to have no relief at reims tonight he had two waffen ss corporals with him guards from the chfteau both good marksmen he had extracted them from the shambles at sainteccile trading on his authority as a major he turned to them now and said bring michel clairet michel was locked in the windowless room where the stationmaster kept the cash the corporals went away and reappeared with michel between them his hands were tied behind his back and his ankles were hobbled so that he could not run he had not been told what had happened at sainteccile all he knew was that he had been captured for the second time in a week there was little left of his buccaneering persona he was trying to maintain an air of bravado to keep his spirits up but the attempt was a failure his limp was worse his clothes were dirty and his face grim he looked defeated dieter took michels arm and walked him closer to the train at first michel did not understand what he was looking at and his face showed only mystification and fear then when he made out the begging hands and understood the piteous voices he staggered as if he had been struck and dieter had to hold him upright dieter said i need some information michel shook his head put me on the train he said id rather be with them than with you dieter was shocked by the insult and surprised by michels courage he said tell me where the jackdaws plane will landand when michel stared at him you havent caught them he said and hope came back into his face theyve blown up the chfteau havent they they succeeded he threw back his head and gave a whoop of joy well done flick dieter made michel walk the length of the train slowly showing him the numbers of prisoners and the scale of their suffering the plane he said again michel said the field outside la chatelle at three am dieter was almost certain that was false flick had been scheduled to arrive at la chatelle seventytwo hours ago but had aborted the landing presumably because she suspected a gestapo trap dieter knew there was a backup landing place because gaston had told him so but gaston had known only its code name champ dor not its location michel however would know the exact place youre lying dieter said then put me on the train michel replied dieter shook his head thats not the choicenothing so easy he saw puzzlement and the shadow of fear in michels eyes dieter walked him back and stopped at the womens car their feminine voices begged in french and german some invoking the pity of god others asking the men to think of their mothers and sisters a few offering sexual favors michel bowed his head refusing to look dieter beckoned to two figures standing in the shadows michel looked up and a terrible dread came over his face hans hesse walked out of the shadows escorting a young woman she might have been beautiful but her face was ghastly white her hair lay in greasy strands and she had sores on her lips she seemed weak walking with difficulty it was gilberte michel gasped dieter repeated his question where will the plane land and when michel said nothing dieter said put her on the train michel moaned a guard opened the gate of a cattle car while two others kept the women in with bayonets the guard pushed gilberte into the car no she cried no please the guard was about to close the gate but dieter said wait he looked at michel tears were pouring down the mans face gilberte said please michel i beg you michel nodded all right he said dont lie again dieter warned let her out the time and place the potato field east of laroque at two am dieter looked at his watch it was twelvefifteen show me he said paul said im single he looked at flick she shook her head i intended to ask michel for a divorce but how could i in the middle of an operation so well wait until after the war to get married paul said im patient typical man flick thought he slips marriage into the conversation like a minor detail on a level with buying a dog license so much for romance but in truth she was pleased it was the second time he had mentioned marriage who needs romance she thought she looked at her watch it was onethirty lime to go she said dieter had commandeered a mercedes limousine that had been outside the chfteau grounds and so had survived the explosion the car was now parked at the edge of the vineyard next to the potato field at laroque camouflaged with leafy vines torn from the ground michel and gilberte were in the backseat bound hand and foot guarded by hans dieter also had with him the two corporals each armed with a rifle dieter and the riflemen looked into the potato field they could see clearly in the moonlight dieter said the terrorists will be here in the next few minutes we have the advantage of surprise they have no idea that were here but remember i must have them aliveespecially the leader the small woman you have to shoot to wound not kill one of the marksmen said we cant guarantee that this field must be three hundred meters wide lets say the enemy is a hundred and fifty meters away at that distance no one could be sure of hitting the legs of a running man they wont be running dieter said theyre meeting a plane they have to form a line pointing electric torches at the aircraft to guide the pilot down that means theyll be standing still for several minutes in the middle of the field yes the man nodded then we can do it he looked up unless the moon goes behind a cloud in that event well turn on the headlights of the car at the crucial moment the mercedes had huge dinnerplate lamps the other marksman said listen five kilometers from laroque the village of lepine was asleep bright moonlight silvered the big church behind the church mouliers meat van was parked inconspicuously next to a barn in the deep moon shadow thrown by a buttress the surviving jackdaws sat waiting what are you looking forward to said ruby paul said a steak flick said a soft bed with clean sheets how about you seeing jim flick recalled that ruby had had a fling with the firearms instructor i thought she stopped you thought it was just a casual shag ruby said flick nodded embarrassed so did jim ruby said but ive got other plans paul laughed softly ill bet you get what you want what about you two ruby asked they fell silent a motor vehicle was approaching they all knelt despite the moonlight they would not be visible against the dark mass of the vines provided they kept their heads down a van came along the road from the village with its lights off it pulled up by the gate to the potato field a female figure jumped out and swung the gate wide the van pulled in and its engine was silenced two more people got out another woman and a man quiet now dieter whispered suddenly the hush was shattered by the blare of a car horn incredibly loud dieter jumped and cursed it came from immediately behind him jesus he exploded it was the mercedes he leaped to his feet and ran to the open window of the drivers door he saw immediately what had happened michel had sprung forward leaning across the front seat and before hans could stop him he had pressed on the horn with his bound hands hans in the front passenger seat was now trying to aim his gun but gilberte had joined in and she was lying half over hans hampering his movements so that he kept having to push her away dieter reached in and shoved michel but michel resisted and dieters position with his arms extended through the car window was too awkward for him to exert much force the horn continued to sound a deafening warning that the resistance agents could not fail to hear dieter fumbled for his gun michel found the light switch and the cars headlights came on dieter looked up the riflemen were hideously exposed in the glare of the lights they both got up off their knees but before they could throw themselves out of the beam there was a rattle of machinegun fire from the field one rifleman cried out dropped his gun clutched his belly and fell across the hood of the mercedes then the other was shot in the head a sharp pain stung dieters left arm and he let out a yell of shock then there was a shot from within the car and michel cried out hans had at last flung gilberte off himself and got his pistol out he fired again and michel slumped but michels hand was still on the horn and his body now lay over his hand pressing it down so the horn continued to blare hans fired a third time uselessly for his bullet thudded into the body of a dead man gilberte screamed and threw herself at hans again grabbing at his gun arm with her manacled hands dieter had his gun out but could not shoot at gilberte for fear of hitting hans there was a fourth shot it was hanss gun again but now it was somehow pointing upwards and he shot himself the bullet hitting him under the chin he gave a horrid gurgle blood came out of his mouth and he slumped back against the door his eyes staring lifelessly dieter took careful aim and shot gilberte in the head he reached through the window with his right arm and shoved the corpse of michel away from the steering wheel the horn was silenced he found the light switch and killed the headlights he looked across the field the van was still there but the jackdaws had disappeared he listened nothing moved he was alone flick crawled through the vineyard on her hands and knees heading for dieter francks car the moonlight so necessary for clandestine flights across occupied territory was now her enemy she wished for a cloud to shade the moon but for the moment the sky was clear she kept close to the row of vines but she threw a conspicuous moon shadow she had firmly instructed paul and ruby to stay behind hiding at the edge of the field near the van three people made three times the noise and she did not want a companion to betray her presence as she crawled she listened for the incoming plane she had to locate any remaining enemies and kill them before the plane arrived the jackdaws could not stand in the middle of the field with flashlights while there were armed troops aiming at them from the vineyard and if they did not hold flashlights the plane would return to england without touching down the thought was unbearable she was deeper into the vineyard than dieter francks car which was parked at the edge she was five rows of vines back she would approach the enemy from behind she kept the submachine gun in her right hand ready to fire as she crawled she drew level with the car franck had camouflaged it with vegetation but when she peeped over the rows of vines she saw moonlight glint off the rear window the shoots of the vines were espaliered crosswise but she was able to crawl beneath the lowest strand she pushed her head through and looked up and down the next alley it was clear she crawled across the open space and repeated the exercise she grew ultra cautious as she approached the car but she saw no one when she was two rows away she was able to see the wheels of the car and the ground around it she thought she could make out two motionless bodies in uniform how many were there in total it was a long mercedes limousine and could easily carry six she crept closer nothing moved were they all dead or had one or two survived and concealed themselves nearby waiting to pounce eventually she crawled right up to the car the doors were wide open and the interior seemed full of bodies she looked in the front and recognized michel she choked back a sob he was a bad husband but he had been her choice and now he was lifeless with three redringed bullet holes in his blue chambray shirt she guessed he had been the one to sound the horn if so he had died saving her life there was no time to think of such things now she would ponder them later if she lived long enough next to michel lay a man she did not recognize who had been shot in the throat he wore the uniform of a lieutenant there were more bodies in the back she looked through the open rear door one was that of a woman she leaned into the car for a better view she gasped the woman was gilberte and she seemed to be staring at flick a ghastly moment later flick realized that the eyes saw nothing and gilberte was dead shot in the head she leaned over gilberte to look at the fourth corpse it rose up from the floor in a swift motion before she had time to scream it grabbed her by the hair and thrust the barrel of a gun into the soft flesh of her throat it was dieter franck drop the gun he said in french she was holding the submachine gun in her right hand but it was pointing up and before she could aim it he would be able to shoot her she had no choice she dropped it the safety catch was disengaged and she halfhoped the impact of its fall would fire the gun but it landed harmlessly on the earth back away as she stepped back he followed her getting out of the car keeping the gun at her throat he drew himself upright youre so small he said looking her up and down and youve done so much damage she saw blood on the sleeve of his suit and guessed she had winged him with her sten gun not just to me he said that telephone exchange is every bit as important as you obviously believe she found her voice good dont look pleased now youre going to damage the resistance she wished she had not been so fierce in ordering paul and ruby to wait in hiding there was now no chance they would come to her rescue dieter shifted the gun from her throat to her shoulder i dont want to kill you but id be happy to give you a crippling wound i need you able to talk of course youre going to give me all the names and addresses in your head she thought of the suicide pill concealed in the hollow cap of her fountain pen would she have a chance to take it its a pity youve destroyed the interrogation facility at sainteccile he went on ill have to drive you to paris ive got all the same equipment there she thought with horror of the hospital operating table and the electric shock machine i wonder what will break you he said sheer pain breaks everyone eventually of course but i feel that you might bear pain for an inconveniently long time he raised his left arm the wound seemed to give him a twinge and he winced but he bore it he touched her face the loss of your looks perhaps imagine this pretty face disfigured the nose broken the lips slashed one eye put out the ears cut off flick felt sick but she maintained a stony expression no his hand moved down stroking her neck then he touched her breast sexual humiliation then to be naked in front of many people fondled by a group of drunk men forced to perform acts of grossness with animals and which of us would be most humiliated by that she said defiantly me the helpless victim or you the real perpetrator of obscenity he took his hand away then again we have tortures which destroy forever a womans ability to bear children flick thought of paul and flinched involuntarily ah he said with satisfaction i believe i have found the key to unlock you she realized she had been foolish to speak to him now she had given him information which he could use to break her will well drive straight to paris he said well be there by dawn by midday you will be begging me to stop the torture and listen to you pour out all the secrets you know tomorrow night we will arrest every member of the resistance in northern france flick was cold with dread franck was not bragging he could do it i think you can travel in the trunk of the car he said its not airtight you wont suffocate but ill put the corpses of your husband and his lover in with you a few hours bumping around with dead people will put you in the right frame of mind i think flick shuddered with loathing she could not help it keeping the pistol pressed to her shoulder he reached into his pocket with his other hand he moved his arm cautiously the bullet wound hurt but did not incapacitate him he drew out a pair of handcuffs give me your hands he said she remained motionless i can either handcuff you or render your arms useless by shooting you in both shoulders helpless she raised her hands he closed one cuff over her left wrist she moved her right toward him then she made her last desperate move she struck sideways with her handcuffed left hand knocking his gun away from her shoulder at the same time she used her right hand to draw the small knife from its hidden sheath behind the lapel of her jacket he flinched back but not fast enough she lunged forward and thrust the knife directly into his left eye he turned his head but the knife was already in and flick moved farther forward pressing her body up against his ramming the knife home blood and fluid spurted from the wound franck screamed in agony and fired his gun but the shots went into the air he staggered back but she followed him still pushing the knife with the heel of her hand the weapon had no hilt and she continued to shove until its entire three inches had sunk into his head he fell backwards and hit the ground she fell on him knees on his chest and she felt ribs crack he dropped his gun and clawed at his eye with both hands trying to get at the knife but it was sunk too deep flick grabbed the gun it was a walther p she stood upright held it twohanded and aimed it at franck then he fell still she heard pounding footsteps paul rushed up flick are you all right she nodded she was still pointing the walther at dieter franck i dont think that will be necessary paul said softly after a moment he moved her hands then gently took the gun from her and engaged the safety catch ruby appeared listen she cried listen flick heard the drone of a hudson lets get moving paul said they ran out into the field to signal the plane that would take them home they crossed the english channel in strong winds and intermittent rain during a quiet spell the navigator came back into the passenger compartment and said you might want to take a look outside flick ruby and paul were dozing the floor was hard but they were exhausted flick was wrapped in pauls arms and she did not want to move the navigator pressed them youd better be quick before it clouds over again youll never see anything like this again if you live to be a hundred curiosity overcame flicks tiredness she got up and staggered to the small rectangular window ruby did the same obligingly the pilot dipped a wing the english channel was choppy and a stiff wind blew but the moon was full and she could see clearly at first she could hardly believe her eyes immediately below the plane was a graypainted warship bristling with guns alongside it was a small ocean liner its paintwork gleaming white in the moonlight behind them a rusty old steamer pitched into the swell beyond them and behind were cargo boats troop transports battered old tankers and great shallowdraft landing ships there were ships as far as flick could see hundreds of them the pilot dipped the other wing and she looked out the other side it was the same paul look at this she cried he came and stood beside her jeepers he said ive never seen so many ships in all my life its the invasion she said take a look out the front said the navigator flick went forward and looked over the pilots shoulder the ships were spread out over the sea like a carpet stretching for miles and miles as far as she could see she heard pauls incredulous voice say i didnt know there were this many ships in the damn world how many do you think it is ruby said the navigator said i heard five thousand amazing flick said the navigator said id give a lot to be part of that wouldnt you flick looked at paul and ruby and they all smiled oh we are she said were part of it all right one year later wednesday june chapter the london street called whitehall was lined on both sides with grandiose buildings that embodied the magnificence of the british empire as it had once been a hundred years earlier inside those fine buildings many of the high rooms with their long windows had been subdivided by cheap partitions to form offices for lesser officials and meeting rooms for unimportant groups as a subcommittee of a subcommittee the medals clandestine actions working party met in a windowless room fifteen feet square with a vast cold fireplace that occupied half of one wall simon fortescue from mi was in the chair wearing a striped suit striped shirt and striped tie the special operations executive was represented by john graves from the ministry of economic warfare which had theoretically supervised soe throughout the war like the other civil servants on the committee graves wore the whitehall uniform of black jacket and gray striped trousers the bishop of marlborough was there in a purple clerical shirt no doubt to give the moral dimension to the business of honoring men for killing other men colonel algernon nobby clarke an intelligence officer was the only member of the committee who had seen action in the war tea was served by the committees secretary and a plate of biscuits was passed around while the men deliberated it was midmorning when they came to the case of the jackdaws of reims john graves said there were six women on this team and only two came back but they destroyed the telephone exchange at sainteccile which was also the local gestapo headquarters women said the bishop did you say six women yes my goodness me his tone was disapproving why women the telephone exchange was heavily guarded but they got in by posing as cleaners i see nobby clarke who had spent most of the morning chainsmoking in silence now said after the liberation of paris i interrogated a major goedel who had been aide to rommel he told me they had been virtually paralyzed by the breakdown in communications on d day it was a significant factor in the success of the invasion he thought i had no idea a handful of girls were responsible i should think were talking about the miitary cross arent we perhaps said fortescue and his manner became prissy however there were discipline problems with this group an official complaint was entered against the leader major clairet after she insulted a guards officer insulted said the bishop how there was a row in a bar and im afraid she told him to fuck off saving your presence bishop my goodness me she doesnt sound like the kind of person who should be held up as a hero to the next generation exactly a lesser decoration than the military cross thenthe mbe perhaps nobby clarke spoke again i disagree he said mildly after all if this woman had been a milksop she probably wouldnt have been able to blow up a telephone exchange under the noses of the gestapo fortescue was irritated it was unusual for him to encounter opposition he hated people who were not intimidated by him he looked around the table the consensus of the meeting seems to be against you clarke frowned i presume i can put in a minority recommendation he said with stubborn patience indeed said fortescue though i doubt if theres much point clarke drew on his cigarette thoughtfully why not the minister will have some knowledge of one or two of the individuals on our list in those cases he will follow his own inclinations regardless of our recommendations in all other cases he will do as we suggest having himself no interest if the committee is not unanimous he will accept the recommendation of the majority i see said clarke all the same i should like the record to show that i dissented from the committee and recommended the military cross for major clairet fortescue looked at the secretary the only woman in the room make sure of that please miss gregory very good she said quietly clarke stubbed out his cigarette and lit another and that was the end of that frau waltraud franck came home happy she had managed to buy a neck of mutton it was the first meat she had seen for a month she had walked from her suburban home into the bombed city center of cologne and had stood in line outside the butcher shop all morning she had also forced herself to smile when the butcher herr beckmann fondled her behind for if she had objected he would have been sold out to her ever afterwards but she could put up with beckmanns wandering hands she would get three days of meals out of a neck of mutton im back she sang out as she entered the house the children were at school but dieter was at home she put the precious meat in the pantry she would save it for tonight when the children would be here to share it for lunch she and dieter would have cabbage soup and black bread she went into the living room hello darling she said brightly her husband sat at the window motionless a piratical black patch covered one eye he had on one of his beautiful old suits but it hung loosely on his skinny frame and he wore no tie she tried to dress him nicely every morning but she had never mastered the tying of a mans tie his face wore a vacant expression and a dribble of saliva hung from his open mouth he did not reply to her greeting she was used to this guess what she said i got a neck of mutton he stared at her with his good eye who are you he said she bent and kissed him well have a meaty stew for supper tonight arent we lucky that afternoon flick and paul got married in a little church in chelsea it was a simple ceremony the war in europe was over and hitler was dead but the japanese were fiercely defending okinawa and wartime austerity continued to cramp the style of londoners flick and paul both wore their uniforms wedding dress material was very hard to find and flick as a widow did not want to wear white percy thwaite gave flick away ruby was matron of honor she could not be bridesmaid because she was already marriedto jim the firearms instructor from the finishing school who was sitting in the second row of pews pauls father general chancellor was best man he was still stationed in london and flick had got to know him quite well he had the reputation of an ogre in the us military but to flick he was a sweetheart also in the church was mademoiselle jeanne lemas she had been taken to ravensbrueck concentration camp with young marie and marie had died there but somehow jeanne lemas had survived and percy thwaite had pulled a hundred strings to get her to london for the wedding she sat in the third row wearing a cloche hat dr claude bouler had also survived but diana and maude had both died in ravensbrueck before she died diana had become a leader in the camp according to mademoiselle lemas trading on the german weakness of showing deference to aristocracy she had fearlessly confronted the camp commandant to complain about conditions and demand better treatment for all she had not achieved much but her nerve and optimism had raised the spirits of the starving inmates and several survivors credited her with giving them the will to live the wedding service was short when it was over and flick and paul were husband and wife they simply turned around and stood at the front of the church to receive congratulations pauls mother was there too somehow the general had managed to get his wife on a transatlantic flying boat she had arrived late last night and now flick met her for the first time she looked flick up and down obviously wondering whether this girl was good enough to be the wife of her wonderful son flick felt mildly put out but she told herself this was natural in a proud mother and kissed mrs chancellors cheek with warmth they were going to live in boston paul would take up the reins of his educationalrecords business flick planned to finish her doctorate then teach american youngsters about french culture the fiveday voyage across the atlantic would be their honeymoon flicks ma was there in a hat she had bought in she cried even though it was the second time she had seen her daughter married the last person in the small congregation to kiss flick was her brother mark there was one more thing flick needed to make her happiness perfect with her arm still around mark she turned to her mother who had not spoken to him for five years look ma she said heres mark mark looked terrified ma hesitated for a long moment then she opened her arms and said hello mark oh ma he said and he hugged her after that they all walked out into the sunshine from the official history women did not normally organize sabotage but pearl witherington a trained british courier took over and ran an active maquis of some two thousand men in
