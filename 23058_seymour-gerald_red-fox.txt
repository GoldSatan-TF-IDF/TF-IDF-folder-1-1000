gerald seymour red fox chapter one an hour now they had been in position the car was nestled off the road under a blanket of high mushroomed pine branches it was back from the main route and on a parking space that later would be used by those who came to play tennis on the courts behind the place was quiet and unobserved as they wanted it not that the car was here by chance nothing in these matters was casual and unplanned and spontaneous for a clear fortnight the men had toured this discreet web of sidestreets watching and eyeing and considering the location that would afford them the greatest advantage accepting and rejecting the alternatives and the options weighing the chances of attack and escape they had not chosen this place till all were satisfied and then they had reported back and another had come on the morning of the previous day and had heard from them their description of what would happen and nodded his head slapping them lightly on the shoulders to affirm his agreement and accolade so the ambush was set the trap was sprung the wires taut and the men could scrutinize their wristwatches bright with chrome and status and wonder whether the prey would be punctual or tardy in front of their car the road ran down a gentle hill towards the main sixlane route into and from the city which it joined at an intersection two hundred and fifty yards from them under the pines the road was shadowed and grey the potholes and rainwater tracks in dark relief there was no chance that when he came in his car he would be speeding hed be doing thirty kilometres at most because he would be safeguarding the expensive framework of his mercedes creeping between the ruts avoiding the hazards and as unaware and unsuspicious as they all were the car in which the men sat had been stolen three weeks earlier from outside a hotel in the centre of anzio away to the south of rome by the time the loss had been reported written in the ledger book by the polizia the alfetta had already been fitted with new number plates likewise stolen but from a car owned in arezzo to the north the number plates had originally belonged to a mirafiori fiat the calculation was that the marriage of the stolen car and the stolen number plates would be too complex for any casual check by the polizia stradale the paperwork of insurance and tax had been matched to the vehicles new identity by men who specialized in such work three men were in the car all sharing the lank coarse hair and mahoganysheened faces of the deep south of the toe of italy men of calabria of the rugged and daunting aspromonte mountains this was their game their playtime their experience qualified them for such occasions men who travelled from the lofty villages down to the big city to effect the grab and then fled back to the safety of their families their community where they lived uncharted and unknown to the police computers the smell in the car was of the crudely packed ms cigarettes that they smoked incessantly drawn to their mouths by roughened fingers that carried the blister scars of work in the fields and mingling with the tobacco was the nightold stench of the perroni beer they had consumed the evening before men close to middle age the one who sat in front of the steeringwheel had the proud hair on his forehead receding in spite of the many and varied ways he combed it and the one who sat beside him carried traces of grey at his temples highlighted by the grease he anointed himself with and the lone one in the back wore a wide belly strapped beneath his leather belt there was little talk in the car as the minute hands of the watches moved on towards seventhirty they had nothing to communicate conversation was futile and wasted breath the man in the back drew from a grip bag that rested on the floor between his legs the stocking masks that they would wear purchased the previous afternoon in the standa supermarket and pierced with a knife for eye and mouth vents without a word he passed two forward to his companions then dived again into the bag a snubbarrelled beretta pistol for the driver who probably had no need for a gun at all as his work was to drive for himself and the front passenger there were squat submachineguns made angular as he fitted the magazine sticks the quiet in the car was fractured by the heavy metallic clacking of the weapons being armed last to be taken from the bag was the hammer a shiny varnished handle of new wood weighted with its greypainted iron head they had a man to lift this time a man of their own age their own fitness their own skill it would be harder than the last one because that had been a child just a child toddling to kindergarten in aventino with the eritrean maid shed screamed at the sight of them the black whore and collapsed in a dead faint on the pavement and the dog shit by the time theyd reached the child and the brat hadnt struggled had almost run with them to the car the car had been stationary no more than fifteen seconds before they were moving again with the kid on the floor and out of sight and only the noise of the keening wail of the maid to let anyone know that anything had happened two hundred and fifty million theyd paid out the parents good as gold placid as sheep shut the door on the investigations of the polizia and the carabinieri cooperated as theyd been told to sold the shares went and tapped the grandfather up in genova just as it had been planned they would nice and clean and organized good quick payout used lire notes and not a uniform in sight just the way it should always be but how this one would react there was no way of knowing whether hed fight whether hed struggle whether hed be a f o o l the man in the back fingered the hammerhead stroking its smoothness with his fingers and in all their minds was the thought of the welcome the big men would provide if there was failure if the car came back empty if the cash investment were not repaid no room for failure no possibility the big bastard would skin them from behind his ample bottom muffled by his trousers came the screech of static noise and then the call sign he wriggled round heaved his bulk so that it no longer suffocated the transmitterreceiver radio pulled the device clear and to his face they hadnt used the system before but this was advancement this was progress yes yes number two yes there had been a code an agreed one but the suddenness of the transmission had seemed to surprise him and he was aware of the frustration of the men in front at his fumbling theyd practised the link often enough in the last week assured themselves that the receiver would pick up from behind the first block a hundred metres up the hill he saw the anger on the drivers face yes this is number one he is c o m i n g it is the mercedes and he is alone only the one for each man in the car the distorted and distant voice brought a syringe of excitement each felt the tension rise and writhe through his intestines felt the snap of stiffness come to the legs clasped at the security of the guns never able to escape it however many times they were involved never a familiarity with the moment when the bridge was crossed and spanned when the only road was forward hed skin them if they failed the big man would did you hear me number one did you receive we hear you number two spoken with the grey lips against the builtin microphone big and large and fat and juicy that was what the big man called it the capo a foreigner and with a renowned company behind him a multinational and theyd pay up well pay fast and pay deep a billion lire in this one that for minimum could be two billion spirals of noughts filling the minds what was two billion to a multinational nothing a million and a half dollars nothing the man in the back switched off the radio its work completed burdening silence filled the car again all ears strained for the drive of the heavy mercedes engine and when it came there was the whine of the low gear the careful negotiation of the pitfalls of the road creeping forward cutting distance the growing thunder of the wasp wings as the insect closes on the web the spider has set the driver vanni half turned winked and grimaced muttered something inaudible and indistinct gave mario in the front claudio in the back the curl of a smile come on nerves building in the back time to go get the package vanni raised his voice time to go pluck the rooster he thrust the gear lever forward eased his foot on to the accelerator nudged the car out into the narrowness of the road as all three peered left and upwards to the bend a black monster of a machine the mercedes sleek and washed a machine that justified its existence only on the autostrada but which was now confined and crippled on the broken surfaces clawing towards them earsplitting in the confines of the car claudio shouted go vanni go the alfetta surged forward swinging right with the tyres protesting across the loose roadside gravel the wrench of the brakes took mario and claudio unawares punching them in their seats thirty metres in front of the mercedes the alfetta bucked to a stop across the road blocking it closing it the drumroll of action as the passengers dragged the stockings over their heads reducing their features to nondescript contours this was a moment for vanni to savour the visible anger of the driver as he closed in on them he knew the mans background knew he had been nineteen months in the country and saw framed in his overhead mirror the caricature of the italian gesture of annoyance the flick of the wrist the point of the fingers as if this were a sufficient protest as if this were a common drivers altercation vanni heard the door beside him and the one behind crash open as he spun in his seat to see the scene better there was the impact of splintering glass vicious and vulgar he saw claudio hammer in one hand machinepistol in the other at the drivers door and mario beside him and wrenching it open a moment of pathetic struggle and mario had the collar of his jacket and was pulling him irresistibly clear making it hard for himself wriggling the stupid bastard but then the men usually did vanni felt a shiver in his seat involuntary and unwelcome as he saw a car turn on the bend of the hill begin its descent unseen by mario and claudio both wrestling with the idiot and on the point of victory he reached for the pistol from his lap heart pumping the cry of warning gorging his throat just a woman just a signora from the hill in her little car hair neatly coiffed who would be on her way to the condotti for early morning shopping before the sun was up he eased his fingers from the gun and back to their places on the gear stick and the wheel shed sit there till it was over a woman wouldnt hurt them hear nothing see nothing know nothing the man still struggled as if the shrill of the brakes behind him had provided the faint hope of salvation and then marios fist caught him flush on the jutting chin and the light the resistance died all finished the man spreadeagled over the back seat and floor of the alfetta mario and claudio towering over him and there was a shout for vanni to be on his way critical to get clear before the polizia blocked the roads stifled their escape first fifteen minutes critical and vital vanni wrenched at the wheel muscles rising in his forearms as he spun left at the junction flicked his fingers to the traffic horn dared another to cut him out and won through with his bravado from the back came first a grovelling whimper and then nothing but the movement of his friends and the breathing of their prey as the stench of the chloroform drifted forward the crisis for vanni would soon be over clear of the immediate scene the principal hazards would disperse a few hundred metres on the narrow tor di quinto then faster for two kilometres on the twolane foro olympico before he slowed at the lights at the salaria junction and then left on the main road leading to the north and the autostrada away from the city he could have driven it with his eyes covered there was no necessity now for speed no need for haste just steady distance he must not attract attention nor invite notice and there was no reason why he should if he did not fall into the panic pit he felt claudios fingers tighten on the collar of his shirt and press against the flesh of his shoulder ignoring him he kept his attention for the road as he pulled out behind a lorry passed it slotted back into the slower lane claudio could not sense his mood he was a big man heavy in weight and grip and with a dulled speed of thought unable to judge the moment when he should speak when he should bide his time past the lorry safe and clear and cruising claudio did not look down at the prone body easy in its sleep the head resting on his lap the torso and legs on the carpet floor enmeshed between marios shins brave boy vanni you took us clear and did it well how long till the garage he should have known the answer himself they had made the journey four times in the previous week they knew to within three minutes the time it would take to cover the distance but claudio wanted to talk always wanted to talk a man to whom silence was a punishment he could be removed from his cigarettes his beer and his women but he would die if he were left to the cruelty of his own company vanni appreciated the loneliness of a man who must be spoken to and talked with at all times four or five minutes past the bmw depot and the bank sports place just past there he fought us you know when we had to take him from the car you took him well claudio you gave him no chance if he had gone on then i would have hit him with the hammer you dont know the sap in your arm vanni chuckled theyd pay little for a corpse how long did you say to the garage three more minutes a little less than when you last asked idiot of calabria are you frightened of losing us you would like to come with us on the train this afternoon poor claudio you must endure a night of the boredom and the tedium of rome you must be patient as the capo said a bad night for the whores eh claudio we could all have travelled together not what the capo said travel separately break the group give claudio his night between the thighs dont you go hurting those girls big boy vanni laughed softly it was part of the game the prowess of claudio the lover if a girl spoke to the buffoon hed fall on his arse in fright i would like to be back in palmi claudio said simply calabria can wait for you just ohe day more calabria will survive without you its a bastard strain on your own you will find someone to talk to youll find some fat cow who thinks youre a great man but dont go flashing her not your money anyway not five million and the laughter faded thats how they get you claudio how the polizia take you when you have the money running free in your palm perhaps claudio should put his money in the bank murmured mario and have some criminal bastard walk in with a shooter and take it never dont do that claudio they laughed together heaving their bodies in the seats exaggerated childish humour because through that came a relaxation from the tension that had taken three weeks to build since the outline of the plan was first put to them beyond the rieti turnoff they went right and drove on a rough track skirting a recently completed fourfloor block of flats and towards the garages that lay to the rear partly shielded from the upper windows by a line of vigorous conifers there was a van waiting there old and with its paintwork scratched from frequent scarrings and the rust showing at the mudguards and road dirt coating the small window set in the rear doors two men lounged elbows on the bonnet waiting for the arrival of the alfetta vanni did not hear what was said as mario and claudio carried the crumpled drugged form of their prisoner from the back seat to the opened rear doors of the van it would be of little interest the passing of a moment between men hitherto unknown to each other who would not meet again when the doors were closed an envelope passed between fingers and claudio slapped the men on their backs and kissed their cheeks and his face was wreathed in happiness and mario handed the grip bag to new owners mario led the way back to the car then paused by the open door to watch the men fasten the back of their van with a padlock and drive away there was a certain wistfulness on his features as if he regretted that his own part in the matter was now completed when claudio joined him he looked away from the retreating vehicle and slid back into his seat then the vultures were at the envelope ripping at it tearing it apart till the bundles in the pretty coloured plastic bands were falling on their knees one hundred notes for each some hardly used in transactions others elderly and spoiled from passage of time and frequency of handling silence reigned while each counted his bounty flicking the tops of the notes to a rhythm of counting vanni loaded his money into the folds of his wallet pulled a small key from his pocket climbed from the car and walked to one of the garage doors he unlocked it then returned to the car and motioned for mario and claudio to leave he drove the car into the garage satisfied himself that the doors prevented a casual glance from the building seeing his work and spent five slow minutes wiping clean the plastic and wood surfaces of the interior with his handkerchief and then when he was satisfied the outer doors when he was finished he came out into the warmth and slammed the garage doors shut the garage had been rented by telephone a letter with a bogus address containing cash had provided the deposit and confirmation he threw the key far on to the flat roof where it clattered momentarily the rent had six weeks to run time enough for the alfetta to rest there and by the time an irate landlord prised open the doors all other traces of the group would have been covered together the three men walked out past the flats and to the main road and then along the pavement to the greenpainted bus stop sign it was the safest way into the city and ultimately to the railway station on that morning in a flat across two roman hills the first of the occupants to wake was the boy giancarlo lithe on his bare feet he padded across the carpet of the livingroom sleep still heavy and confusing to his eyes blurring the shapes and images of the furnishings he avoided the low tables and velvetseated chairs stumbling on a light flex as he pulled a shirt over his young undeveloped shoulders he had shaken franca gently and with the care and wonderment and awe of a boy who wakes for the first time in a womans bed and is frightened that the tumult and emotion of the night will be relegated by dawn to a fantasy and dream he had scratched his fingers across her collarbone and pulled quietly at the lobe of her ear and whispered her name and that it was time he had looked down on her face gazed intoxicated on the shoulder skin and the contour of the drawnup sheet and left her a small flat they lived in the one livingroom the bathroom that was a box which crammed in a toilet a bidet and a shower unit the kitchen with a sink buried under abandoned plates and a cooker that had not seen a damp cloth round the burners for more than a week the bedroom where enrico still slept noisily and where there was the unused bed that till last night had been giancarlos and there was francas room with the single narrow divan her clothes draped as haphazard carpeting across the woodblock floor a small hallway and a door with three locks and a spyhole and a metal bar with chain that enabled the door to be opened an inch for additional checking of a visitor it was a good flat for their needs the requirements of franca tantardini enrico panicucci and giancarlo battestini were not great not complex it was determined that they should live among the borghese in a middleclass area where there was wealth prosperity where lives were shuttered selfreliant affairs and closed to the inquisitive vigna clara hill suited them well left them secure and unnoticed in the heart of enemy territory they were anonymous in a land of ferraris and mercedes and jaguars among the servants and the spoiled children and the long holidays through the summer and the formidable foreign bank accounts there was a basement garage and a lift that could carry them out of sight to their own door in the attic of the building affording them the possibility of cloaking their movements coming and going without observation not that they went out much they did not roam the streets because that was dangerous and put them at risk better that they should spend their hours cooped between the walls profiting from seclusion reducing the threat of casual recognition by the polizia expensive of course to live there four hundred and seventyfive thousand a month they paid but there was money in the movement enough money was available to meet the basic precautions of survival and they settled in cash on the first day of the month and did not ask for the contract to be registered and witnessed and the sum to figure on their landlords tax return there was no difficulty finding premises that were private and discreet giancarlo was a boy with two terms of psychology study at the university of rome behind him and nine more months in the regina coeli gaol locked in a damp cell low down by the tiber river still a boy little more than a child but bedded now bedded by a woman in every way his senior she was eight years older than he was so that he had seen in the first creeping light of the bedroom the needle lines at her neck and mouth and the faint trembling of the weight at her buttocks as she had turned in her sleep resting on his arm uncovered and uncaring till he had pulled the sheet about her eight years of seniority in the movement and that he knew of too because her picture was in the mind of every car load of the squadra mobile and her name was on the lips of the capo of the squadra antiterrorismo when he called his conferences at the viminale eight years of importance to the movement that too giancarlo knew of because the assignment of enrico and himself was to guard and protect her to maintain her freedom the bright expansive heat drove through the slatted shutters bathing the furniture in zebra shades of colour illuminating the filled ashtrays and the empty supermarket wine bottles and the uncleared plates with the pasta sauce still clinging to them and the spreadeagled newspapers the light flickered on the glass of the pictures with which the room was hung expensive and modern and rectangular in their motifs not of their choosing but provided with the premises and which hurt their sensitivities as they whiled away the cramped hours waiting for instructions and orders of reconnaissance and planning and ultimately of attack all of it all of the surroundings grated on the boy disturbed him nurturing his distrust for the flat in which they lived they should not have been in a place like this not with the plumage and trappings of the enemy and the comforts and ornaments of those they fought against but giancarlo was nineteen years old and new to the movement and he was quick to learn to keep his silence at the contradictions he heard the noise of her feet tripping to the bedroom door swung round and in haste dragged his shirt tails into the waist of his trousers and fastened the top button and heaved at the zip she stood in the open doorway and there was the look of a cat about her mouth and her slow distant smile a towel was draped uselessly around her waist and above its line were the drooping bronzed breasts where giancarlos curls had rested they hung heavily because she forswore the use of a brassiere under her daily uniform of a straining blouse wonderful to the boy a dream image his hands were still on the zipfastener pat it away little boy before you run dry she rippled with her laughter giancarlo blushed tore his eyes from her to the silent unmoving door to enricos room dont be jealous little fox she read him and there was the trace of mocking the suspicion of scorn enrico wont take my little fox away enrico wont supplant him she came across the room to giancarlo straight and direct and circled her arms around his neck and nuzzled at his ear pecked and bit at it and he stayed motionless because he thought that if he moved the towel would fall and it was morning and the room was bright now weve made a man of you giancarlo dont behave like a man dont be tedious and possessive and middleaged not after just once he kissed her almost curtly on the forehead where it rested against his mouth and she giggled i worship you franca she laughed again then make some coffee and heat the bread if its stale and get that pig enrico out of his bed and dont go boasting to him those can be the first labours of your worship she disentangled herself and he felt a trembling in his legs and the tightness in his arms and close to his nostrils was the damp livedwith scent of her hair he watched her glide to the bathroom flouncing and swinging her hips her hair rippling on her shoulder muscles an officer of the nuclei armati proletaria organizer and undisputed leader of a cell a symbol of resistance her liberty was a hammered nail in the cross of the state she gave him a little wave with a small and delicate fist as the towel fell from her waist and there was the flash of whitened skin and the moment of darkened hair and the tinkle of her laugh before the door closed on her a sweet and gentle little fist that he had known for its softness and persuasion divorced from the clamped grip of a week ago as it held the beretta p and pumped the shells into the legs of the falling screaming personnel officer outside the factory gate giancarlo hammered at enricos door he battered on through the stream of obscenities and protest till he heard the muffled voice cleared of sleep and the tread lumbering for the door enricos face appeared the leer spreading keep you warm boy did she ready to go back to your mama now going to sleep all afternoon giancarlo dragged the door closed flushed and hurried for the kitchen to fill the kettle rinse the mugs and test with his hands the state of the twodayold bread he went next to francas bedroom walking with care to avoid stepping on her clothes staring at the indented mattress and the stripped sheets he slid to his knees and dragged from the hidingplace under the bed the cheap plastic suitcase that always rested there unfastened the straps and pulled the lid back this was the arsenal of the covo three machineguns of czech manufacture two pistols magazines loose cartridges batteries wires of red and blue flex the little plastic bag which held the detonators he moved aside the metalcased box with its dials and telescopic aerial that was marketed openly for radiocontrolled aeroplanes and boats and which they utilized for the triggering of remote explosions buried at the bottom was his own p the rallying cry of the young people of anger and dispute p trent otto available reliable the symbol of the fight with the spreading tentacles of fascism p love you the token of manhood of the coming of age p we fight together and when franca ordered him he would be ready he squinted his eyes down the gunsight p my friend enrico could get his own bastard he fastened the straps again and pushed the bag away under the bed brushing his hand against her pants clenching them in his fingers carrying them to his lips a whole day to wait before he would be back there lying like a dog on his back in surrender feeling the pressures on his body time to get the rosetti out of the oven and find the instant coffee she was standing at the doorway impatient little fox i had been at the case giancarlo floundered if we are to be at the post when it opens her smile faded right we should not be late there enrico is ready he will not be long we have time for coffee it was an abomination an ordeal to drink the manufactured instant brand but the bars where they could drink the real the special the habitual were too dangerous she used to joke that the absence of bar coffee in the mornings was the ultimate sacrifice of her life get him moving he has enough time to sleep in the rest of the day all the hours of the day the kindness the motherliness had fled from her the authority had taken over the softness and the warmth and the smell washed away with the shower water they must go to the post to pay the quarterly telephone bill bills should always be paid promptly she said if there are delays there is suspicion and checks are made and investigations are instituted if they went early were there when the post opened then they would head the queue at the conti correnti counter where the bills must be met in cash and they would hang around for the least time minimize the vulnerability there was no need for her to go with enrico and giancarlo but the flat bred its own culture of claustrophobia wearing and nagging at her patience hurry him up she snapped wriggling the jeans up the length of her thighs stretching herself in the bed arching her body under the silk of the pink nightgown irritation and annoyance surfacing on her creamwhitened face violet harrison attempted to identify the source of the noise she had wanted to sleep another hour at least a minimum of another hour she rolled over in the double bed seeking to press her face into the depth of the pillows looking for an escape from the penetration of the sound that enveloped and cascaded round the room geoffrey had gone out quietly enough put his shoes on in the hall hadnt disturbed her she had barely felt the snap of his quick kiss on her cheek before he left for the office and the sprinkling of toast crumbs from his mouth she did not have to wake yet not till maria came and cleared the kitchen and washed up the plates from last night and the lazy cow didnt appear before nine god it was hot not eight oclock and already there was a sweat on her forehead and at her neck and under her arms bloody geoffrey too mean to fit airconditioning in the flat shed asked for it enough times and hed hedged and delayed and said the summer was too short and prattled about the expense and how long would they be there anyway he didnt spend his day in a turkish bath he didnt have to walk around with stain in the armpit and an itch in his pants airconditioning at the office but not at home no that wasnt necessary bloody geoffrey and the noise was still there shed go to the beach that morning at least there was a wind at the beach not much of it precious little but some sort of cool from off the sea and the boy might be there hed said he would be cheeky little devil little blighter old enough to be his enough problems without the cliches violet all sinews and flat stomach and those ridiculous little curly hairs on his shins and thighs chattering his compliments encroaching on her towel enough to get his face slapped on an english summer beach and going off and buying icecream three bloody flavours my dear and licking his own in that way dirty little boy but she was a big girl now big enough violet harrison to take care of herself and have a dash of amusement too needed something to liven things stuck in this bloody flat geoffrey out all day and coming home and moaning how tired he was and what a boring day hed had and the italians didnt know the way to run an office and why hadnt she learned to cook pasta the way it was in the ristorante at lunchtime and couldnt she use less electricity and save a bit on the petrol for her car why shouldnt she have a little taste of the fun a little nibble still that bloody noise down in the road couldnt erase it not without getting out of bed and closing the window it took her a full minute to identify the source of the intrusion that had broken her rest sirens baying out their immediacy in response to a womans emergency call the first police cars were arriving at the scene of the kidnapping of geoffrey harrison chapter two the cars were enricos responsibility this week it was a fiat the fortnight before a that was hardly large enough for the three of them before that a mirafiori before that an alfasud enricos speciality he would drift away from the flat be gone three or four hours and then open the front door smiling away his success and urging franca to come to the basement garage to inspect his handiwork usually it was night when he made the switches with no preference between the city centre and the distant southern suburbs good and clean and quick and franca would nod in appreciation and squeeze his arm and even the gorilla even enrico would weaken and allow a trace of pleasure he was well satisfied with the lucky to have found a car with a painstaking owner and an overhauled engine fast in acceleration lively to the touch of his feet at the controls coming down off vigna clara heading for the corso francia they seemed like three affluent young people the right image the right camouflage blending mto their surroundings and if giancarlo sitting hunched in the back was unshaven poorly dressed it was not conspicuous because few of the sons of the borghese who had their flats on the hill would have bothered with a razor in high summer and if franca sitting in the front passenger seat had her hair tied with a creased scarf neither was that of importance because the daughters of the rich did not require their finery so early in the morning enrico drove fast and with ease and confidence understanding the mechanism of the car rejoicing in the freedom of escape from the confines of the flat too fast for franca she slapped her hand on his wrist shouted for him to be more careful as he overtook on the inside weaved among the traffic hooted his way past the more sedate drivers dont be a fool enrico if we touch something we never have we wont now enricos familiar uncurbed response to correction as always giancarlo was perplexed that he treated franca with such small deference wouldnt grovel wouldnt dip his head in apology always ready with a rejoinder brooding and generally uncommunicative as if breeding a private secret hatred that he would not share his moments of humanity and humour were rare fleeting paced out giancarlo wondered what enrico had thought of the unmade bed his absence in the night hours wondered if it stirred the pulse kicked at the indifference that enrico presented to all around him he doubted if it would selfsufficient selfreliant an emotional eunuch with his shoulders rounded over the wheel three weeks giancarlo had been at the covo three weeks as guard at the safe house of the prize of the movement but enrico had been with her many months there must be a trust and understanding between him and franca a tolerance between her and this strange padding animal who left her side only when she slept it was beyond giancarlo to unravel it this was a relationship too complex too eccentric for his comprehension the three young people in a car that carried a licence plate and a valid tax disc on the windscreen merged without effort into the soft flatulent society with which they were at war two days earlier franca had exclaimed with triumph shouted for giancarlo and enrico to come to the side of her chair and read to them a statistic from the newspaper in italy she had declaimed the increase of political violence on the previous years figures was greater than in any country in the world even argentina we lead even the people of the monteneros so were wounding the pigs hurting them and this year we wound them more we hurt them harder she had played her part in the compilation of those figures had not been backward in advancing herself and had earned the accolade bestowed on her by the magazines and tabloids of public enemy number one women and shrieked with laughter when she read it the first time chauvinist bastards typical of them that whatever i do i cannot be labelled as the greatest threat because i am a woman they would choke rather than admit that a woman can do them the greatest damage my title has to be embroidered with a category eight times in the past twelve months she had led the strike squads the action commandos target ambushes bullets blasted into the lower limbs because the sentence of maiming was thought more psychologically devastating than death eight times and still no sign that many beyond the hierarchy of the colossus knew of her existence or cared eight times and still no indication that the uprising of the proletariat forces was imminent it was as if she was teased mocked to do her worst undo herself in the very audacity she was taunted towards when she thought like that in the late evening when the flat was subdued when enrico was sleeping then she came for the boys who were enricos constant but changing companions that was when she demanded the pawing clumsy association with the juvenile that her mood might be broken her despair smashed under the weight of a young body these were hard and dangerous times for the movement the odour of risk was in the air constant after the kidnapping and execution of aldo moro the mobilization of the forces of the state the harrying of the groups the gesture on the grand scale by the brigatisti had been the taking of moro and the peoples court to try him and pass sentence but there were many who disputed that this was the way to fight who counselled caution argued against the massive strike and favoured instead the process of wearing erosion more men were rallied against them now there was more awareness more sophistication it was a time for the groups to burrow deeper and when they surfaced on the street it was in the knowledge that the risks were greater the possibility of failure increased swerving across the traffic lanes enrico brought the car to rest spanning the gutter half on the pavement half in the road franca wore a watch on her wrist but still asked with a flow of irritation in her voice how long till it opens enrico accustomed to her did not reply two minutes perhaps three if they begin on time giancarlo said well we cant sit here all morning lets get there she slipped the door open swung her feet out and stretched on the pavement leaving the boy to fiddle at getting her seat forward so that he could follow her as she started to walk away enrico went hurrying after her because his place was at her side and she should not walk without him to giancarlo her stride was light and perfect shivering in the taut and faded jeans and she should walk well thought the boy because she does not carry the cold clear shape of the p against her flesh buried beneath a shirt and trouser belt not that giancarlo would have been without his gun it was more than a tube of chewing gum more than a packet of marlboro it was something he could no longer live without something that had become an extension of his personality it owned a divinity to giancarlo the p with its simple mechanism its gas routes and magazines its hairtrigger its power no need for us all to be in there franca said when giancarlo was at her side enrico on the other flank and they were close to the post doorway get yourself across the road to the papers and get plenty if were to be stuck in the flat for the rest of the day he didnt wish to leave her side but it was an instruction a dismissal giancarlo turned away he faced the wide and scurrying lanes of early morning traffic looked for the opening that would enable him to reach the raised centre bank of the corso francia there was a newspaper stall on the far side nearly opposite the post there was no hurry for him because however early you came to the post there was always a man there before you the pathetic fools who were paid to take the bills and the money for gas and telephone and electricity because it was beneath the dignity of the borghese to stand and wait in a line he saw the opening a slowing in the traffic and launched himself through the welter of bonnets and bumpers and spirited horns and spinning wheels a hesitation in the centre another delay before the passage was clear and he was off again skipping youngfooted across the remaining roadway to the stand with its gaudy decoration of magazine covers and paperbacks he had not looked back at franca and did not see the slowly cruising car of the squadra mobile far out in the traffic flow of the road behind him giancarlo was unaware of the moment of surging danger the startled gape of recognition on the face of the vice brigadiere as he riveted on the features of the woman half in profile at the entrance to the post and waiting for the lifting of the steel shutter giancarlo did not know as he took his place ih the queue to be served that the policeman had savagely urged his driver to maintain speed create no warning as he rifled through the folder of photographs kept permanently in the glove box of the car the boy was still shuffling forward as the first radio message was beamed to the questura in central rome giancarlo stood hands in pockets mind on a woman as the radio transmissions hit the air while cars were scrambling accelerating guns being armed and cocked giancarlo searched his memories finding again the breasts and thighs of franca he did not protest as the woman in the cream coat pushed past him without ceremony passing up the opportunity to sneer and laugh so that she should be discomfited he knew the newspapers he should buy lunita of the pci the communists la stampa of turin the paper of fiat and agnelli repubblica of the socialists popolo of the right il messaggero of the left necessary always franca said to have il messaggero so that they could browse through the cronaca di roma section and read of the successes of their colleagues in different and separated cells learn where the molotovs had landed in the night what enemy had been hit what friend taken five papers a thousand lire giancarlo scratched in the hip pocket of his trousers for the dribble of coins and the crumpled notes he would need counting out the money standing his ground against the pushing of the man behind him he would ask franca to replace it it was she who kept the cells money in the small wall safe in her room with the combination lock and the documents for identity changes and the files on targets of future attacks she should replace the money a thousand lire three bottles of beer if he went to the bar in the evening it was all right for him to go out after dark it was only franca who should not but he would not be drinking beer that evening he would be sitting on the rug at the feet of the woman and close to her rubbing his shoulder against her knee resting his elbow on her thigh waiting for the indications of her tiredness her willingness for bed he had been to the bar the night before after their meal and come back to find her drooped in the chair and enrico sprawled and sleeping opposite her on the sofa with his feet on the cushions she had said nothing just taken his hand and turned off the lights and led him like a lamb to her room and still she had not spoken as her hands slipped down the length of his shirt to his waist the agony of waiting for her would be unendurable giancarlo paid his money stepped back from the counter with the folded newspapers and scanned the front page of il messaggero carillo of spain and berlinguer of italy were meeting in rome a eurocommunist summit middleclass middleaged a betrayal of the true proletariat a former minister of shipping was accused of having his hand in the till what youd expect from the bastard democrazia cristiana the steering committee of the socialists was sitting down with the dc games being played circles of words a banker arrested for tax evasion all the sickness all the foetid corruption was here all the cancer of the world they struggled to usurp and then he found the headlines that would bring the smile and the cold mirth to franca the successes and the triumphs one of their own antonio de laurentis of napoli missing inside the maximum security gaol on favignana island described as most dangerous a leader of the nap inside the prison and theyd lost him an executive of fiat shot in the legs in turin the thirtyseventh that year to have the peoples sentence inflicted and the year not eight months old he tucked the papers under his arm and looked out across the road to the post franca would be furious icy if he kept her waiting it was heavily parked now around their two yellow alfettas there and a grey alfasud close to their own car he wondered whether theyd be able to get out god shed be angry if they were boxed over the top of the traffic solid and unpassable to him giancarlo saw enrico emerge from the doorway cautious and wary two paces behind him franca cool commanding his woman christ she walked well with the loping stride never an eye left nor right and the blur of movement shatteringly fast too quick for the boy to retain franca and enrico were five six metres from the entrance to the post the doors of the three intruding cars bulged and split open men running shouting the moment of clarity for giancarlo he saw the guns in their hands the two at the front sprinted forward then dived for the crouch with the automatics held straight arm to the front enrico twisted his arm back for the hanging flap of the shirt tail and the concealed beretta across the traffic and tarmac void giancarlo heard the shriek of the doomed enrico the cry for the woman to run the scream of the stag that will stand against the dogs to give time for the hind to hasten to the thickets but her eyes were faster than his her mind quicker and better able to assess the realities of the moment as his gun came up to face the aggressors she made the quicksilver decision of survival the boy saw her head duck and disappear behind the roofs of the passing cars and then there was the vision of her prone on the stomach hands on her head enrico would not see her would believe in his last sandrunning moments that his sacrifice had achieved its purpose even as he fired he was cut down by the swarm of bullets aimed at him in a thunderclap of gunfire and lay writhing on the pavement as if trying to shake away a great agony rolling and rolling from his back to his belly the men ran forward still suspicious that their enemy might bite might hurt there was a trail of blood from enricos mouth another two from his chest that meandered together and then separated and more crimson paths etching from his shattered legs but his life lingered and a hand scrabbled at the dirt for the gun that had been dropped that had fallen beyond reach the men who towered above him wore jeans and casual slacks and sweatshirts and some were unshaven or bearded or carried their hair long on their shoulders nothing to tell them from enrico and giancarlo these were the men of the squadra antiterrorismo undercover dedicated as hard and ruthless as those they opposed a single shot destroyed the frenzy of enricos groping hands an execution bullet just as it had been said it was when the carabinieri dropped la muscio on the church steps near the colosseo bastards bastard pigs a man beside giancarlo crossed himself in haste a private gesture in the glare of a public moment down the road a woman bent in sickness a priest in long cassock abandoned his car in the road and ran forward two of the men covered the figure of franca their guns roaming close to her head a terrible pain coursed through the boy as his hands stayed clamped on the folded newspapers and would not waver towards the gun buried in the flesh of his buttock he watched part of the gathering crowd terrified of risking the intervention that enrico had affected he willed himself to run forward and shoot because that was the job the movement had chosen for him protector and bodyguard of franca tantardini but if he did his blood would run in the deep gutter company for enricos there was no thrust in his legs no jolt in his arms he was a part of those who stayed and waited for the show to end they pulled the woman unresisting and limp to her feet and dragged her to a car two had their hands on her upper arms another walked in front with his fist caught in the long blonde strands of her hair there was a kick that missed at her shins he could see that her eyes were open but bewildered unrecognizing as she went to the opened car door would she have seen the boy she had opened herself to a short night before would she have seen him he wanted to wave give a sign shout out that he had not abandoned her how to show that giancarlo enrico dead and giancarlo alive and breathing because he had stepped back had dissociated how to show it giancarlo the car revved its engine and its horn was raucous as it pulled out into the open road another alfetta close in escort behind the cars swung across the central reservation lurching and shaken and completed their turn in front of where giancarlo stood the crowd around him pressed forward to see better the face of the woman and the boy was among them and then they were gone and one of the men held a machinegun at the car window a fanfare of sirens an explosion of engine power for a few moments only he was able to follow the passage of the cars in the growing traffic before they were lost to him and the sight of enrico was taken from him by a moving bus deep in a gathering shame at the scope of his failure giancarlo began slowly to walk away along the pavement twice he bumped into men who hurried towards him fearful that they had missed the excitement and that there was nothing remaining for them to see giancarlo was careful not to run just walked away not thinking where he should go where he should hide too logical such thoughts for his fractured mind to cope with he saw only the stunned deep golden eyes of franca who was handcuffed and for whom a boy had not stepped forward she had called him her little fox and scratched with her nails at his body had kissed him far down on the flatness of his stomach had governed and tutored him and he drifted from the place feet leaden unseeing with the moisture in his eyelids the british embassy in rome occupies a prime site set back from high railings and lawns and a stoneskirted artificial lake at a via xx settembre the building itself unlikely and original supported by pillars of grey cement and with narrow arrowslit windows was conceived by a noted english architect after the previous occupant of the grounds had been destroyed by the gelignite of jewish terrorists or guerrillas or freedom fighters a stopover in their search for a homeland the architect had fashioned his designs at a time when the representatives of the queen in this city were numerous and influential expense and expediency had whittled down the staff list many diplomats now doubled on two separate jobs the first secretary who handled matters of political importance in italian affairs had also taken under his umbrella the area of liaison with the questura and the viminale politics and security the aesthetic and the earthy strange bed partners that michael charlesworths two previous foreign postings had been in vientiane and reykjavik was a source of astonishment neither to himself nor his colleagues he was expected to master the local intricacies of a situation inside three years and this accomplished he could correctly anticipate that he would be sent to a country about which he had only the most superficial knowledge after iceland and the tangled arguments of the cod war with the islands fishing interests ranged against the need of his countrymen to eat northern water fish from old newspapers roman politics and police had a certain charm he was not dissatisfied charlesworth had demanded and won a rise in rent allowance from his ambassador and had been able to set up home with his wife in a highroofed flat within earshot but not sight of the piazza del popolo in the centro storico the garaging of a car there was next to impossible and while his wifes veteran was parked beneath the condescending eyes of the vigili urbani in the piazza he himself cycled to work on the machine he had first used twenty years earlier as a cambridge undergraduate the sight of the darkstripesuited englishman pedalling hard along the corso dltalia and the via piave with collapsible umbrella and attache case clamped to the carrier over the rear wheel was a pleasing sight to italian motorists who from respect for his efforts afforded him unusual circumspection once the slopes of the borghese gardens had been surmounted the bicycle provided charlesworth with fast and intrepid transport and often he was the first of the senior diplomatic staff to reach his desk a salute from the gatekeeper the parking and padlocking of the machine the shaking free of trouser turnups from the clips a wave to security in the groundfloor hall a gallop up two flights of stairs and he was striding along the back secondfloor corridor fully three doors away he heard the telephone ringing from his office fast with the key into the lock swinging the door open to confront the noise abandoning the briefcase and umbrella to the floor he lunged for the receiver pronto panting a little not the way he liked to be signor charlesworth f yes la questura dottore giuseppe c a r b o n i momento delay first a crossed line apology rampant clicking and interruption before charlesworth heard the questura switchboard announce with pride to carboni that the task was accomplished the connection successful they were not friends the policeman and michael charlesworth but known to each other acquainted carboni would know that charlesworth was happier in english that language courses were not always victorious with a faint american accent carboni spoke charlesworth that is you yes caution no man is happy talking to the police least of all to foreign police at fourteen minutes past eight in the morning i have bad news for you my friend bad news to give you for which i am sorry you have a businessman in the city a resident a man called harrison he is the financial controller of ich in eur international chemical holdings they are at viale pasteur in eur many of the multinationals favour that a r e a whats the silly blighter done thought charlesworth resigned socked a copper drunk himself stupid no couldnt be that not if carboni was calling not if it was at that level i regret very much charlesworth to have to tell you that geoffrey harrison was kidnapped this morning armed men forced from his car near his home christ muttered charlesworth low but audible i understand your feelings he is the first of the foreign residents the first of the foreign commercials to be affected by this plague i know we are doing everything we can there are road blocks the distant voice tailed and died as if carboni knew the futility of boasting to this man he came again but you know charlesworth these people are very organized very sophisticated it is unlikely and you will understand me it is unlikely that what we can do will be sufficient i know said charlesworth an honest man he was talking to and what to say that wouldnt be churlish i am confident you will exercise all your agencies in this matter completely confident you can help me charlesworth i have called you early it is not half an hour since the attack and we have not yet been to the family we have not spoken to his wife perhaps she does not speak italian perhaps she speaks only english we thought it better if someone from the embassy should be with her first to give her the news the dose prescribed for diplomats seeking nightmares was purveying illtidings to their own nationals far from home a stinking lousy job and indefinite involvement that was very considerate of you it is better also that you have a doctor go to her this morning in many cases we find that necessary in the first hours it is a shock you will understand yes i do not want to lecture you at this stage because soon you will be busy and i am busy myself in this matter but you should make a contact with harrisons employer it is a londonbased company i believe if they have taken the employee of a multinational they will be asking for more than poor harrisons bank balance can provide they will believe they are ransoming the company it could be expensive charlesworth you would like me to alert the company to this situation charlesworth scribbled hard on his memo pad they must make their attitude clear and quickly when the contact is made they must know what attitude they will take what a way to start the bloody day well theyll ask me this and it may colour their judgement you would presume that this is the work of a professional an experienced gang there was a faint laugh quavering over the telephone line before carboni replied how can i say charlesworth you read our newspapers you watch the telegiornale in the evening you know what we are up against you know how many times the gangs are successful how many times we beat them we do not hide the figures you know that too if you look at the results you will see that a few of the gangs are amateur you english always you want to reduce everything to sport and we catch those ones does that give us a winning score i would like to say so but i cannot it is very hard to beat the professionals and you should tell to harrisons firm when you speak with them that the greater the police efforts to release him the greater the risk to his life they should not forget that charlesworth sucked at his pencil top you would expect the company to pay what they are asked to we should talk of that later perhaps it is premature at this moment a gentle correction made with kindness but a correction nevertheless not manners to talk of the will and the beneficiaries while the corpse is still warm but i do not think that we would expect the family or the company of a foreigner to adopt a differing procedure to that taken by our own families when they are faced with identical problems the invitation to pay it wouldnt be made clearer than that the invitation not to be stubborn and principled pragmatism winning through and a bloody awful scene for a policeman to have to get his nose into there may be some difficulty we dont do it like that in england but you are not in england charlesworth the taint of impatience from carboni and in england you have not always been successful i remember two cases two ransom demands unmet two victims found two deaths it is not a straightforward area of decision and not one which we can debate later perhaps but now i think there are other things that you wish to do i appreciate greatly what you have done dottore it is nothing carboni rang off five minutes later charlesworth was in the groundfloor hall of the embassy waiting for the arrival of the ambassador still shrill in his ears the piercing protests of the woman he had telephoned who was going to pay didnt they know they hadnt any money nothing in the bank just a few savings who was going to take responsibility not a conversation that charlesworth had relished and his calming noises had been shouted out till hed said he had to go because he must see the ambassador no more blustering after that just a deep sobbing a pain echoing down the wire to him as if some dam of control and inhibition had been broken where was he the poor sod what were they doing to him must be a terrible loneliness mindbending horrific and damn all for comfort didnt even know that idiots like michael charlesworth and giuseppe carboni were sapping their wings and running in circles better he didnt know it it might make him turn over and give up and what chance the ambassador being in before nine what bloody chance theyd tied him expertly as they would have done a lively bullock going to slaughter not a casual job not just a length of rope round his legs geoffrey harrison had lain perhaps twenty minutes on the coarse sacking on the van floor before he had tried to move his ankles and wrists the effects of the chloroform were dissipating the shock of capture and the numbness of disorientation sliding the nobbled bones on the inside of his ankles wrapped in cord caught hard against each other digging at the flesh the metal handcuffs on his wrists set too tight for him pressed on the veins and arteries tape adhesive and broad was across his mouth forcing him to breath through his nose reducing any sounds he could make to a jumbled incomprehensible moan one man had trussed him swiftly before the chloroform had gone to be replaced by the desperate passiveness of terror in an alien surrounding and theyd hooded him reducing his horizons to the limited things he could touch and smell the hood was cool and damp as if it had spent the night in the grass been subject to the light dew and retrieved before the coming of the drying warmth of the early sun because of the handcuffs behind his back he lay on his right side where the undulations of the road surface caused his shoulder to impact through the sacking against the ribbed metal floor they seemed to move at a constant speed as if far from the reach of traffic lights and road junctions and many times harrison heard the whine of overtaking engines and occasionally the van shuddered as if under strain and pulled out to the left just once they stopped for a short time and he heard voices a rapid exchange before the van was moving again riding through its gears getting under way and back to the undisturbed progress he thought about and conjured a route along the raccordo annulare with its festoons of white and pink oleander between the central crash barrier and imagined the halt must have been at the toll gate for entry to an autostrada could be north on the florence road or west for laquila and the adriatic coast or south for naples could be any bloody direction any road the animals wanted to use hed thought hed been clever and superior in his intellect to make the calculations and then came the wave of antipathy carried on the wing what did it matter which direction they took it was a futile and petty exercise because the control of his destiny was removed turning him into a bloody vegetable anger surfaced for the first time and spent itself straining against the ankle cords striving to bite with his teeth against the tape across his mouth it created a force and a power that struggled even as the tears rose and welled in one convulsion one final effort to win even the minimum of freedom for any of his limbs he arched his back forced his muscles couldnt shift couldnt move couldnt change anything pack it in geoffrey youre being bloody pathetic once more forget it they dont come with machineguns and chloroform and then find surprise surprise that they dont know how to tie knots as he sagged back his head thumped on the floor above the reach and slight protection of the sacking and he lay still with the ache and the throb in his temples and the smell of the hood in his nose lay still because he could do nothing else chapter three the immediate sense of survival was uppermost now in the mind of giancarlo it was the instinct of the stoat or the weasel that has lost its mate and must abandon its den move on but has no notion of where to go only that it must creep stealthily away from the scene of its enemies vengeance he wanted to run to outstrip the pedestrians who cluttered and barred the pavements but his training won out he did not hurry he strolled because he must blend must forsake the identity bestowed on him by the p the noise and confusion and shouting of the beginning of a new day swamped him the hooting of impatient motorists the crashing intrusion of the alimentari shutters rising in their doorways and windows to display the cheese and hams and tins and bottles the arguments that spilled from the bars confident secure sounds belonging and with a right to be there swarming around giancarlo the boy tried to shut inside himself his concentration and avoid the cancer of these people that swept and surged past him he belonged to no part of them since the nap had drifted into existence in the early nineteenseventies coalesced from a meeting of minds and aspirations to an organization it had derived its principal security from the cell system nothing new nothing revolutionary in that laid down by mao and ho and guevara standard in the theoretical treatises separated in their cells the members had no need for the identity of other names for the location of other safe houses it was essential procedure and when one was taken then the wound to the movement could be swiftly cauterized franca was their cell leader she alone knew the hidden places where ammunitions and materials were stored the telephone numbers of the policy committee and the lists of addresses she had not shared with enrico much less with the boy the probationer because neither required such information he could not go back to his previous fiat where he had lived with a girl and two boys as that had been closed and abandoned he could not tour the cars and streets of pietralata behind the tiburtina station and ask for them by name he wouldnt know where to begin and who to ask it made him shudder as he walked the depths of the isolation in which the movement had so successfully cloaked him where among the streaming scrambling crowds that passed on either side of him did he find the nod and handshake of recognition it was frightening to the boy because without franca he was truly alone storm clouds rising sails full rudder flapping and the rocks high and sharp and waiting giancarlo battestini nineteen years old short and without weight a physical nonentity a body that looked perpetually starved a face that seemed for ever hungry a boy that a woman would want to take in and fatten because she would fear that unless she hurried he might wither and fade dark hair above the growth of his cheeks that was curled and untidy a sallow wan complexion as if the sun had not sought him out had avoided the lustreless skin acne spots at his chin and the sides of his mouth that were red and angry against the surrounding flesh and to which his fingers moved with embarrassed frequency the pale and puckered line across the bridge of his nose that deviated on across the upper cheekbone under his right eye was his major distinguishing mark he had the polizia of the primo celere to thank for the scar the baton charge across the ponte garibaldi when the boy had slipped in headlong flight and turned his ankle he had been a student then enrolled two terms at the university of rome choosing the study of psychology for no better reason than that the course was a long one and his father could pay for four years of education and what else was there to do the university with its bulging inefficiency had seemed to giancarlo a paradise of liberation lectures too clogged to attend unless you took a seat or standing place a full hour before the professor came tutorials that were late or cancelled exams that were postponed a hostel within walking distance in the viale regina elena where the talk was long and bold and brave heady battles they had fought around the university that winter the autonomia in the van they had driven the polizia back from the front facade of arches and across the street to their trucks they had expelled by force luciano lama the big union man of the pci who had come to talk to them on moderation and conformity and responsibility thrown him out the turncoat communist in his suit and polished shoes six hundred formed the core of the autonomia the separatists and giancarlo had first hung round their fringe then attended their meetings and finally sidled towards the leaders and stammered his pledge of support warm acceptance had followed a paradise indeed to the boy from the seaside at pescara where his father owned a shop and carried a stock of fine cotton dresses and blouses and skirts in summer and wool and leather and suede in winter hit and run strike and retreat the tactical battles of the autonomia were in the name of repression in argentina the deaths in stamheim of comrades baader and raspe and enselin the changing of the curriculum no long searches for cause and justification hurt the polizia and the carabinieri the forces of the new fascism goad them into retaliatory dashes from the wide streets that were safe to the narrow maze of centro storico where the molotovs and the ps could score and wound formidable the polizia looked with their white bulletproof tunics lolling to their knees and their stovepipe face masks behind which they felt a false invulnerability but they could not run in their new and expensive equipment could only fire the gas and beat the clubs on the plastic shields they were loath to follow the kids the pied pipers when the range of the pistols and the petrol diminished a scarf tight across his face for protection both from press photographs and the gas giancarlo had never before experienced such orgasmic pained excitement as when he had sprinted forward on the bridge and launched the bottle with its litre of petrol and smouldering rag at the primo celere huddled behind their armoured jeep a shriek of noise had erupted as the bottle splintered the flames scattered there was a roar of approval from behind as the boy stood his ground in defiance while the gas shells flourished about him then the retaliation twenty of them running and giancarlo had turned for his escape the desperate terrifying moment when the ground was rising space under his feet control lost and in his ears the drumming of the boots that were in pursuit his hands covering his head were pulled away as they put the baton in and there was blood cool across his face and sweet in his mouth and blows to the leg kicks to the belly voices from the south from the peasant south from the servants of the democrazia cristiana from the workers who had been bought and were too stupid to know it two months in the regina coeli gaol awaiting his court appearance seven months imprisonment for throwing the molotov to be served in the queen of heaven a whore of a place that gaol intolerable heat and stench through that first summer when he had bunked in a cell with two others devoid of draught and privacy assimilated into a world of homosexuality thieving deprivation food inedible boredom impossible company illiterate hatred and loathing bit deep in the boy when he was the guest of the queen of heaven hatred and loathing of those who had put him there of the polizia who had clubbed him and spat in his face in the truck and laughed in their dialect at the little humbled intellettuale giancarlo sought his counterstrike and found the potential for revenge in the topfloor cells of the b wing where the men of the nuclei armati proletaria were incarcerated some on remand some sentenced they could read in the boys eyes and in the twist of his lower lip that here was a progeny that could be useful and exploited he learned in those heated sweating cells the theory and the practice the expertise and the strategy of urban guerrilla conflict a new recruit a new volunteer the men gave him diagrams to memorize of the mechanism of weapons lectured him in the study of concealment and ambush droned at him of the politics of their struggle hectored him with the case histories of corruption and malpractice in government and capitalist business these men would not see the fruits of their work but took comfort that they had found one so malleable so supple to their will they were pleased with what they saw word of his friendship spread along the landings of his own wing the homosexuals did not sidle close and flash their hands at his genitals the thieves left undisturbed the bag under his bunk where he kept his few personal possessions the agenti did not bully in the months in gaol he passed from the student of casual and fashionable protest to the political militant his parents never visited him in the queen of heaven he had not seen them since they had stood at the back of the court half masked from his sight by the guards shoulders anger on his fathers face tears making the mascara run on his mothers cheeks his father wore a sunday suit his mother dressed in a black coat as if that would impress the magistrate the chains on his wrists had been long and loose and they gave him the opportunity to raise his right arm clenched fist the salute of the left the gesture of the fighter screw them give them something to think on when they took the autostrada back across the mountains to pescara and his picture would be in the adriatic paper and would be seen by the ladies who came to buy from the shop and they would whisper and titter behind their hands in all his time in the gaol he received only one letter written in the spider hand of his brother fabrizio a graduate lawyer and five years his elder there was a room for him at home mama still kept his bedroom as it had been before he had gone to rome papa would find work for him therecould be a new start he would be forgiven methodically giancarlo had torn the single sheet of notepaper into many pieces that flaked to the cell floor when the time came for giancarlos release he was clear on the instructions that had been given him from the men in b wing he had walked out through the steel gates and on to the lungotevere and not looked back at the crumbling plaster of the high ochrestained walls the car was waiting as he had been told it would be and a girl had moved across the back seat to make room for him first names they called themselves by and they took him for a coffee and poured a measure of scotch whisky into the foaming milk of the cappuccino and brought him cigarettes that were imported and expensive half a year now of being hunted half a year of running and caution and care and he had wondered what was the life expectancy of freedom thought of how long his wings would stay undipped by cell bars and locked doors once he had been in the same flat as the one they called the chief had seen his profile through an opened door bushybearded short vital in the eyes and mouth the chief who stayed now on the island prison of asinara and who they said had been betrayed once he had strayed into the bedroom of a covo carrying the cigarettes he had been sent to buy looking for the man who had dispatched him and recognized the sleeping form of the one they said was expert with explosives he too they said had been betrayed to a life sentence on the island once he had been taken to stand for a moment on the steps of a church where antonio la muscio and mia vianale had sat and eaten plums on a summer evening and he now in his grave with half a carabinieri magazine to put him there and the fruit unfinished and la vianale rotting in the gaol at messina hard and dangerous times only recently made safer by the skill and calm of franca but as the net grew closer shrinking around the group franca had disowned the safety of inactivity two hundred and fifty political prisoners of the left in the gaols and they believe we are close to the moment of our destruction that is what they say on the rai that is what they say at the dc congress so we must fight demonstrate beyond their concealment that we are not crushed not neutered franca did not talk in the slogans of the kids of his first covo she had no use for the parrot words of enemies of the proletariat the forces of repression capitalist exploitation it confused the boy because they had become a part of his life a habit of his tongue cemented to his vocabulary franca vented her anger without words displayed her dedication with the squeezed arctic index finger of her right hand three bedridden victims in the policlinico another in a private room of the nursing home on the trionfale they were her vengeance men who might never walk again with freedom would not run with their children and one among them who would not sleep with and satisfy his wife inevitable that it must end the risks were too great the pace too heady the struggle unequal giancarlo crossed a road not looking for the cars nor for the greenlit avanti sign not hearing the shriek of the brakes ignorant of the bellowed insult perhaps he would have brought her flowers that evening perhaps he would have gone to the piazza and bought from the gypsy woman some violets or a sprig of pansies nothing gaudy nothing that would win a sneer from her simple flowers from the fields to make her smile and her face soften to erase the harshness of her mouth that he had first seen as she walked from the shooting of the personnel officer but flowers would not help her now not from the boy who had declined to step forward who had walked away there was a hunger already in his stomach and little chance to appease it his wallet still lay in the flat on the small table beside his unused bed there was some loose change in his hip pocket and the miniassegni notes that were worth not more than a hundred and a hundred and fifty lire apiece in all he had enough for a bowl of pasta or a sandwich and a coffee or a beer and after that nothing he must keep two hundred lire for an afternoon paper when they came on the news stands paese sera or momento sera meanwhile his wallet was in the flat his wallet that he touched and handled through the day held with his fingertips the contour whorls that were only his own and that the police fingerprint dust would find and feed to the files they had taken his fingerprints months back in the police station after his arrest they will have your name by the afternoon giancarlo and your photograph all they want about you they will have time to begin to think again to throw off the weight of depression and selfexamination stupid bastard take a hold behave like a man of the nap save yourself and survive where to start the university in the vacation in the summer when there is no one there where else where else do you go to giancarlo home to mama to tell her it was all a mistake that you met bad people perhaps there would be someone at the university the university offered him the best chance of a bed with no questions asked among the students of the autonomia whom he had known many months before he had not been there since his release and he would have to exercise the utmost care as he approached the faculties the campus was heavy with informers and policemen who carried books and mingled but if he could find the right boys then they would hide him and they would respect him because he had graduated from the sitins and the lockins and the molotovs to the real war of the fully fledged of the men they would look after him at the university a long walk it would be across the wide ponte flaminio through the parioli along the treelined ribbon of the viale regina margherita with the decision taken and his mind clearing he quickened his step it was a risk to go that far and his name and description and his clothing would soon be radioed to the polizia who cruised and watched over the city but there were no alternatives because he worked directly to the minister of the interior francesco vellosis office was on the second floor of the lowering grey stonework of the viminale his subordinates were found either a kilometre away at the questura or far to the west in the criminalpol building at eur but the capo of the squadra antiterrorismo was required to be close to the seat of power just down the corridor from it which served to emphasize the recognition of the threat to the country posed by the rash of urban guerrilla groups a fine room he occupied reached through high double doors of polished wood with an ornate ceiling from which hung electric bulbs set in a shivering chandelier of light oil paintings on the walls a wide desk with an inlaid leather top easy chairs for the visitors a coffee table for magazines and ashtrays and a signed photograph of the president between the tail twin windows francesco vellosi thirty years in the police detested the room and would have given much to have exchanged the brilliance of the surroundings for a shirtsleeves working area the room got the sun in the afternoons but on this july morning the brightness had not yet reached it the radio telephone in his armourplated car had warned vellosi when midway between his bachelor flat and place of work that his men had met with a major and significant success that morning and waiting for him when he bustled into the office had been the initial incident report and photostats of the files held on franca tantardini and enrico panicucci vellosi gutted the paperwork with enthusiasm a bad winter and spring they had had built on the depressive foundation of the loss the previous year of aldo moro there had been arrests some significant some worthless but the plague of bombings and shootings had kept up its headlong pace prompting the disquiet of the deputies in the chamber of the democrazia cristiana the ridicule of the newspapers and the perpetual demand of his minister for solutions always they came to vellosi hurrying in pursuit of the news of a fresh outrage he was long tired of trying to find the politician or the senior civil servant who would take responsibility for what he called the necessary methods the hard and ruthless crackdown that he believed essential he was still looking for his man here at last was good news and he would issue his own order that the photographers should have a good look at the tantardini woman the national habit of selfdenigration went too deep and it was good when the opportunity presented itself to boast a little and swagger with success a tall heavily built boar of a man the roughness of his figure softened by the cut of his jacket the elegance of his silk tie vellosi shouted acknowledgement across the room of the light tap at his door the men who entered the presence were from a different caste two in tattered suede boots two in canvas training shoes faded jeans a variety of tshirt colours an absence of razors hard men whose faces seemed relaxed while the eyes were ever alert and alive and bright vellosis lions the men who fought the war far below the surface of the citys life the sewer rats because that was where they had to exist if they were to find the rodent pests the four eased a careful way across the thick carpet and when he gestured to them sat with care on the deep comfortable chairs they were the officers of the squad that had taken the woman destroyed the animal panicucci and they had come to receive their plaudits tell at first hand of the exploit and bring a little solace to the days of vellosi in the viminale he wriggled with pleasure in his seat as the work of the morning was recounted nothing omitted nothing spared so that he could savour and live in his mind the moment when panicucci and the woman had emerged from the post as it should be and hed wheel them in to shake the hand of the minister and blunt the backstab knives that were always honing for him he limited himself to the briefest of interruptions preferring to let the steady flow of the story bathe him in the triumph of his squad the telephone broke into the recital vellosis face showed his annoyance at the interference the annoyance of a man who hopes to make it and is on the couch with his girl when the doorbell sounds he waved his hand to halt the flow he would return to it as soon as the business of the call was dispatched it was the questura had vellosis men been certain when they took the woman that there was not another boy with her had they missed one the covo had been found the address taken from the telephone slip just paid by the tantardini woman the polizia had visited the flat and found there the clothes of another boy far too small to be those of panicucci there was a woman on the ground floor of the block sick and from the moment she was dressed in the morning she would sit and watch from her window the passing street when the ragazzi drove their car from the garage there were always three and there were three that morning fingerprinting had begun there was another set and fresh not to be confused with tantardinis and panicuccis the polizia had been careful to check with the woman at the window the time of the departure of the car from the block and compare it with the timing of the incident at the post it was their opinion that there had been no time for a substantial deviation to drop off a second male a cold sponge was squeezed over vellosi have you a description of this second man t h e woman says he is not a man just a boy really there are many identity cards in the flat one of the photographs may be genuine but we are working on a photofit now your own people are there now no doubt they will brief you we think the boy is eighteen perhaps nineteen we thought you would like to know you are very kind vellosi said quietly then hammered the telephone down he ran his eyes over the men in front of him brought them sitting upright and awkward on the edge of their seats we missed one spoken with coldness the pleasure eroded from the session there was no one else at the post the car had no driver waiting in it and only the two came out they were well clear of the doorway when we moved the defensive bridling argument came from a man who an hour earlier had faced the barrel of a beretta who had outthought outmanoeuvred his opponent and fired for his own survival three came from the flat the car went straight to the post the inquisition was resented he was not there when we came and after the shooting some of our people watched the crowd as is standard nobody ran from the scene vellosi shrugged resigned like eels these people always one of them wriggled away slipped through the finest meshes always one of a group escaped so that you could never cut off the head and know that the body was beyond another spawning he is very young this one that we have lost three of the men stayed silent peeved that the moment of accolade had turned to recrimination the fourth spoke up undaunted by his superiors grimness if it is a boy then it will have been her runner there to fetch and carry for her and to serve in the whores bed always she has one like that panicucci she did not use only the young ones she liked it is well known in the nap if you are right it is not a great loss it is an irritation nothing more the fat cat we have the gorilla we have killed that the flea is out is only a nuisance it was not yet ten oclock and there were smiles as vellosi produced the bottle from the lower drawer of his desk and then reached again for the small cutglass tumblers it was too early for champagne but scotch was right the brat had broken the pattern of perfection like a summer picnic when it rains and the tablecloth must be scooped up but the best of the day had gone before only a nuisance only an irritation the missing of the boy he knew they had been travelling many hours because the van floor on which he lay was warmed by the outside sun even through the layer of sacking the air around geoffrey harrison was thick tasting of petrol fumes pricking against his skin as if all the cool and freshness of the mornings start had been expelled thrust out it was painfully hot and under the weight of the hood over his head he had sometimes begun to pant for air with accompanying hallucinations that his lungs might not cope that he might suffocate in the dark around him occasionally he heard two slight voices in conversation but the words even had he been able to understand them were muffled by the engine noise two different tones that was all he could distinguish and they talked infrequently the two men riding in the seats in front there were long periods of quiet between them and then a brief flurry of chatter as if something they passed took their fancy attracted their eyes the motion of the van was constant its progress uneventful releasing him to his thoughts it was as if he were a package of freight being transported to a far destination by two men who had neither interest nor concern in him and thought only of their delivery time in the daily news and the daily american and the italian papers that he struggled with in the office harrison had read many times of the techniques practised by the flourishing italian kidnap gangs in the bar of the olgiata golf club little america little midwest where there were tom collins and bourbon mixes he had joined the drift of conversation when the foreigners had talked of the italian disease different setting different values easy then to relate all sickness to the bloody inefficiency of italians and what else could you expect when you were half way to the middle east well down the road to damascus here right wasnt it a scandal the transatlantic executives would say that a fellow could get picked off the street and have to cough up a million dollars however many noughts that was in lire to get himself back to his wife and kids and wasnt it about time that something was done about it couldnt happen at home of course not in london not in los angeles not in birmingham not in boston and thered always be one there elbow at the bar and face pulled with authority to drop his voice beneath the reach of the italian members and lean forward and whisper wouldnt happen if old musso was running the place and its what they need again a damn great shock up the ass and someone like musso to give it to them not exactly musso because he was an idiot but someone with a damn great stick simple answers more drinks and none of them had an idea he wondered whether theyd remember him young harrison quite a junior fellow didnt make it up this way that often always hanging on the edge of a chat and a wife with bright lipstick just a drinking member perhaps youre lucky geoffrey perhaps youre lucky you didnt struggle you put up a bit of a show but not much just enough for vague selfrespect remember the picture in the paper of the man from milan the man whod fought back and mixed it stone dead in a box with the wife in black and the kids holding her hands walking behind at least youre bloody alive because they dont muck about these people theyre not governed by queensberry or any other set of rules hard vicious bastards remember the blackandwhite images on the television in the livingroom the body of little christina eighteen years old being dragged out of the rubbish tip and the ransom had been paid remember the racecourse king he made the front pages trussed like a chicken and a hood on him just like you are now except that he had a hunk of cement to weight him down in the lake near como remember the boy in the village in calabria with his ear sliced away to encourage his father to dig deeper into the family savings horrible bastards not like anything those stupid sods in the bar would know about when they came off their nine holes all a bit of a joke over a prelunch gin a bit of a chuckle something local that didnt affect foreigners they should have seen them for themselves those bloody faces under the stockings the way the guns came and the hammer that would have splashed the tonic round a bit would have stifled all the rectitude the platitudes theyd never bloody laugh again those sods in the bar not if they saw that crowd coming at them remember the telegiornale geoffrey what happens to the italian families drawn curtains shuttered windows people hurrying by on the pavement below not wishing to look in as if that would somehow involve them with a family that flew the yellow flag of quarantine the face of a child or a mother in the doorway who looked for support and sympathy and found none the humble car of the priest pulling up on the pavement and scattering the waiting photographers geoffrey knew the pictures knew the way the story was chronicled on the first day and never mentioned again afterwards until the moment of conclusion stale in twentyfour hours pray god there isnt some pompous fool in there what do you mean well some stupid ass with a good lunch inside him and letters after his name who wants to talk about the principle of paying what do you mean well if some ape says its not right to pay that you have to stand up to these people that if you give way now what do you do next time they wouldnt say that would they not really say that theyre not where you are geoffrey theyre in a boardroom not in handcuffs they may have cut themselves shaving but they havent had a bloody great fist slammed in some of them are bloody geriatric all they know about the sodding country is what they see on a balance sheet they wouldnt be so stupid they couldnt dont they know people get chopped if theres no payola dont they know that calm it kid not bloody helping is it theyll know it and if they dont therell be someone there to tell them youre sure im sure im certain how can you know im certain because i have to believe that otherwise we go stark bloody mad straight insane with the sun playing on its roof without remorse or hindrance baking the closed interior the van headed at a steady and unremarkable one hundred and ten kilometres per hour southwards along the autostrada del sol chapter four his excellency the ambassador of her britannic majesty who had known the tap of her sword on his right shoulder and had kissed her hand and valued his audience was a man who admired discipline of action and protocol of approach he had not disguised his distaste at what he regarded as the breathy intervention of young charlesworth when he was only one foot out of his official burnished transport he had been short with his first secretary had permitted only the briefest of resumes and failed to raise his eyebrows in either shock or astonishment and as he had marched away smiling at the doorman with charlesworth snapping like a lap dog at his heels he had suggested that something on paper by lunchtime would satisfy his requirements for information as he strode down the drive to the security lodge charlesworth cursed himself for his flustered account for his failure to interest his superior regretting that he had allowed himself to be put down as a bubbling child is by an overburdened parent he recalled that the ambassador was hosting a luncheonparty that day the newly appointed foreign minister would be at his right hand the guest of honour present would be the senior members of the diplomatic corps a smattering of ranking civil servants the best bone china and the silverware out from the cupboard the ambassador had his priorities charlesworth growled to himself the soup shouldnt be too salted the plates must be warm the wine chilled the conversation clever he had too much on his mind to worry about the fears of a hysterical woman and a man trussed and perhaps half dead who was experiencing the greatest degree of terror he had known in his life hed be far too busy for such sordidness and a piece of paper with some aptly chosen words presented before the sherry flowed would be sufficient charlesworth dived out into the road beyond the regimented railings of the embassy scanning the traffic that burst through the arches of the ancient reddened brick city wall getting a taxi would need the luck of old jupiter but luck was with him the yellow fiat snaking to the pavement and he waved frantically and hurried towards its stopping point he saw the face in the back equal shades of mauve and pink buster henderson military cross in korea god knows how many years ago and for doing something nobody sane would have dreamed of military attache halfcolonel always took a cab in and one home in the afternoon charlesworth didnt know how he could afford it not that and the gin as well in a hurry young man charlesworth detested the way the older staff regarded him as a juvenile flap on is there eyeties declared war on u s a boom of laughter must have been the life and soul of some gory cavalry mess east of the rhine one of our people has been kidnapped this morning one of the embassy chaps henderson was waiting for the change from his lire note no its not the end of the world not one of ours its a businessman a fellow who works out here ive to get up to his wife poor bastard said henderson quietly his wallet was open the notes being carefully put away in order of value damnall of a tip poor devil rather him could be rather a shambles for us its the first time a foreigner has been lifted well only the getty boy and that was different i suppose henderson held the door open for charlesworth youll be handling our end eh well if you get a bit overwhelmed give us a shout damnall i have to worry about at the moment diarys empty as a larder these next three days dont hang about if you want a hand if you want to talk it over thank you thank you very much its most kind buster charlesworth had never called him that before never really had a conversation with the army officer on any more substantive subject than whether it would rain on qbp day whether theyd have to retire to the marquee for the annual queens birthday party celebrations silly little thing the offer of help but he was grateful grateful because he was stepping on stones that he did not know poor devil rather him charlesworth heard halfcolonel buster henderson mutter again as he closed the taxidoor on himself he walked in what shade he could find seeking out the places where the sun was denied sight of the pavements by the towering blocks of flats flanking the regina margherita unable now to control the speed of his legs as they pumped a way along the uneven flagstones hurrying when he knew he should be calm because the coolness he had first sought to impose on himself was disappearing slipping from his grasp giancarlo was feeling the stress and lead weight of the fugitive not that the shade offered him solace the stinking brutalizing heat of the morning penetrated the air broke open his white skin and thrust out the carousing sweat rivers that saturated his few clothes soaking and irritating him no wind down at street level just the furnace and the car exhausts nothing to bluster across his face and limbs he tramped on for the sanctuary of the university where a face might be familiar where the environs would be known where there would be an end to the perpetual swinging of his head for a first glimpse of the coasting police cars it was a new experience for giancarlo never before had he known the feeling of being hunted of being loose and adrift from the companionship of the group of being cast outside the protective womb of the nap when giancarlo had walked at the side of franca tantardini the nap had seemed to him a great and powerful organization limitless authority and potential gushed when he had been close to her and the words of victory and success and triumph had cascaded from her tongue now the sheen of safety was stripped from him and enrico was dead washing his face in his owh blood and franca taken he fled towards the reassurance of the nursery the safety of the creche to the university tired legs sore feet a heaving chest the classic symptoms of flight he turned left towards the piazza giorgio fabrizio then right into the viale del policlinico he stumbled from tiredness as he passed the huge drawnout complex of the hospital the signs of pronto soccorso that guided the racing sirenloud ambulances to where they should bring their emergencies were on his right where they brought francas victims where they deposited the men with the gunshot wounds for the first immediate lifesaving operation to counter the work of the p the boy saw the men who waited in their short white coats and the nurses in their belted dresses who lounged under the trees alert for the screaming of the ambulance approach that would send them scurrying in preparation to casualty reception going past the policlinico giancarlo knew with the sureness of the first lightning flash in a storm why they would hate him track him spend a lifetime edging towards his back no forgiveness no charity not while men lay in pain on the metal bedframes of the policlinico and shouted in the night for their wives a great army they would bring against him and a mind with a limitless and unbroken memory a boy who was as nothing devoid of possessions importance status armed with a p and a magazine of eight shells devoid of plan and programme and blueprint armed with a detestation of cruel force against the system that rallied now to crush him bereft of friendship and accomplices and the strength of a leader to guide armed with the love of a girl who had taken him into herself armed with the love of franca tantardini for she must have loved him she must have wanted him giancarlo battestini or he would not have known her bed and her warmth and her murmurs and her fingers if it took a week or a month or a year he would take her from them repossess her freedom the freedom of the bird to escape the cage because she had loved him dwarfing the boy were the great white stone walls and archway of the university designed for immortality designed to stand for a thousand years as proof to a grateful worker class of the power wielded by the black shirt and the leather boot giancarlo took in the daubed slogans of the paint spray aerosols bright colours of graffiti that disfigured the impression of omnipotence but only as high as a students arm could rise above the reach of the protestor was the cleancut stone of the rejected regime the slogans of the autonomia were here at shoulder height the painted outline of the closed fist with the first and second fingers extended the p trent otto here were daubed the cries of hate against the ministers of government the parties of democracy the polizia the carabinieri the borghese he had arrived at the place where succour might be found stretching away in front of him was the wide avenue between the science and medical faculties and the administration buildings many doors were closed many windows shuttered because the academic year and examinations had terminated six weeks earlier but there would be some students here those who had taken a cause and rejected the cloying parental hand over the family holiday they would have stayed giancarlo broke into a run he lifted the weariness from his legs lengthened his stride till he was sprinting down the gentle hill the taxi its driver displaying caution rare in his vocation nudged up the hill at a crawl and rounded the three police cars straddled in front of the mercedes charlesworth saw the drivers side window breached and shattered frozen glass glittering in the gravel surface of the road the polizia in blue and mauve trousers with the thin maroon cord astride their thighs and open blue shirts and caps pushed back on their foreheads were working round the smitten vehicle they dabbed on fingerprint dust and a tin was beside them in which plaster glistened wetly and which would be used if the impression of a tyre grip needed recording it was too warm for the polizia to move with energy and their inertia was augmented by the very familiarity of the scene there was nothing new the scene of crime procedures for a kidnap as the taxi circumvented the blockage charlesworth saw two men in civilian suits and they were the only ones that mattered only two not the young boys in their crumpled uniforms recruited from the mezzo giorno who knew less of crime than a neapolitan pickpocket or a milanese burglar and wore the uniform because it was the only escape from the region of unemployment just two the trained ones who took the privilege of wearing their own clothes enough to make him heave and throw up dear old carboni with his courtesy and his compromise who had promised nothing he knew the limitations of his force and why should they bust a gut because the man whod been lifted had a blue passport with a lion rampant and english scroll inside the front flap carboni had marked charlesworths card said there should be a payout that they should get the misery over forget the games so whats in it for a policeman standing on his big flat feet when more money will be paid than hell see in a lifetime and it wont be missed wont be noticed and his own chief says thats the way to do business he paid the driver stepped out of the taxi and looked around him a wide street on a sloping hill flats which owned areas of neat lawn in front and flowerbushes that had been tended and cropped and watered that morning by the porters blocks of five floors with deep terraces and canvas awnings and jungles of foliage the ladies cars parked bumper to bumper the little runabout city motors dust floated softly down on to charlesworths jacket and the maid in the starched apron stared him out as she shook her mop not much poverty here not much malaise from the economic crisis not up here on the hill and there was the reaction to the affluence for him to see provided by those who crept up the slope under cover of night paintsprayed swastikas the daubed morte al fascisti that could never be scrubbed from the marble veneer surfaces didnt do badly for their people the old multinationals if international chemical holdings had put their man in here then they were solvent they had no liquidity problems and the bastards would have known that or geoffrey harrison would be sitting at his desk right now clobbering his secretary for the lateness of the post straightening his tie for his next appointment money here and plenty of it and these people knew where to sniff the air for it where to strike where the dividend was assured charlesworth walked into the hallway of the block paused at the porters nook where a man with a saddened and troubled face sat mentioned the name and was told which floor a slow lift creaked and swayed upwards two policemen lolled against the wall beside the door of the flat they straightened when they saw the diplomat not dramatically but enough to swing the holstered pistols that hung from waistbelts charlesworth said nothing merely nodded and pressed the bell soft slippered feet shuffled to the door an age passed while four sets of locks were unfastened the door opened an inch and a half as far as a chain would allow like a bloody fortress he thought but they all lived like that on the hill and damnall good it did them when the vultures began to circle it was dark inside and he could see nothing through the gap who is it a small voice invisible and inanimate its charlesworth michael charlesworth from the embassy a pause and then the door was closed he heard the button on the end of the chain being withdrawn from its socket the door opened again not extravagantly but sufficient to admit him im violet harrison thank you for coming he turned almost startled two steps inside the hall as if he had not expected the voice to materialize from behind a quick movement that betrayed his unease she came out of the shadows and her hand took his elbow and manoeuvred him towards the livingroom where the blinds were drawn and the low table lights lit he followed meekly behind the tented swirl of her trailing cotton dressinggown with the big flowers embroidered across the shapes of her back and her buttocks and legs he stole a glance at the silhouette against a light and dug his nails into the palm of a hand youd have thought shed have dressed by now on a morning like this with a bloody deluge of visitors about to come tripping in youd have thought the woman would put some clothes on he saw her the first time when she reached her chair and angled her face at him she might not have dressed but shed made her face had worked at it long enough to give the tears scope to smudge and spoil her efforts she would have been crying from the time he telephoned the eyelids were puffy and bulging red above the dark broad painted eye shadow a small tightturned nose that had taken the sun and the freckles offset her cheeks that were smooth and bronzed attractive but not remarkable well shaped but not beautiful his eyes flickered over her unwilling but compelled and she gazed back at him no hint of embarrassment charlesworth looked away the blush rising in him been caught like a schoolboy hadnt he been seen peering in the soho bookshop windows during school holidays been noticed ogling a woman who wore a sheer nightdress and a light cotton wrap im very sorry for what has happened mrs harrison he said would you like some coffee theres only instant youre very kind but no thank you theres tea i can make a cup a small far voice no thanks thank you again but i wont would you like me to put the kettle on for you can i make you some tea i dont want any tea would you like a cigarette still staring at his eyes raking and examining them its very nice of you but i dont i dont smoke he felt he should apologize because he didnt want nescafe didnt want teabags didnt want a cigarette she sat down in an armchair flanked by the tables that carried last nights glasses and last nights coffee cups with a flurry of shin and knee glimpsing out he followed into a chair across the central rug felt himself going down slipping away falling into farsettling cushions the sort that you drown in and then for ever feel ill at ease with because youre too low and cant dominate the conversation and your nose is half way to the carpet she was still looking into him boring and penetrating mrs harrison first i should tell you who i am i have responsibility for political affairs at the embassy but i also double on matters affecting the police relations between the british community in rome and the italian police those that is that arent covered by the consular department come on charlesworth youre not doing your own testimonial not applying for a job e i t h e r so i was called this morning by a fellow called carboni hes one of the bigger men at the questura there wasnt very much known then it was just a few minutes after your husband had been seized doctor carboni gave me a solemn assurance that everything possible was being done to secure your husbands early release and thats bugger all she said slowly and with deliberation charlesworth rocked back rode it but the blow had done damage confused and deflected what was building in his mind can only repeat he hesitated they didnt use that sort of language the embassy secretaries and his wifes friends first secretary at the british embassy he was and she should be listening to him and grateful that hed taken the time to come out and see her what doctor carboni said was that everything would be done and whats everything half of nothing if that much charlesworth bridled its not a very sensible attitude to take in the circumstances mrs harrison youd be better ive had my cry mr charlesworth i got that over before you came it wont happen again you know you dont have to come here with platitudes and a bottle of librium im pleased you came grateful to you but i dont need a shoulder to weep on and i want to know whats going to happen whats going to happen not what a crummy italian policeman says hes doing and i want to know whos going to pay bit early wasnt it knots hardly settled on the old mans wrists and she was chattering about money god almighty i can advise you on procedures charlesworth ploughed on coldness undisguised i can tell you what has happened in the past to italians i can suggest what i think that you should do and i can indicate the areas where i think the embassy can be of service thats what i want to hear when they write about kidnapping in the italian papers they call it a successful growth industry thats a fair enough description since there have been more than three hundred cases what youd expect of course but the people responsible vary enormously there are the big gangs big organizations well led well funded well briefed probably originating from the real south probably with what wed call the mafia at their roots i never quite know whats meant by the mafia its an overused word something simplistic to cover whatever you want it to in my book the mafia means skill and ruthlessness and power and patience if your husband has been taken by these people then there will be an initial contact followed by a drawnout haggle over money and it will end with a business transaction very clinical and quite slow because they will want to know that their tracks are well covered and if its such a group how will they treat my husband a long time coming that question thought charlesworth probably quite well theyd keep him fed and dry and marginally comfortable enough to sustain his health in a basement perhaps a farmhouse thats as long as they think were going to pay yes and if they arent sure were going to pay charlesworth looked hard at her slipped behind the swollen eyes delved beyond the mascara he wondered how his own wife would react in these circumstances loved her and knew for all that shed be a disaster helpless as a bloody ship on the rocks and thrashing around for someone to blame she was different this woman different because she didnt wear her concern and her care on her shoulders hadnt even put her knickers on for the great day didnt sound as if it meant a damn to her beyond the inconvenience then theyll kill him she didnt react beyond a flutter of the eyebrows a slight and fractional quiver at the mouth but nothing that he would have noticed if he hadnt been watching her absorbing her face and if we go to the police and throw it all into their lap give it to your mr carboni what then if they see through an indiscretion or a clumsiness that we have offered full cooperation with the police and if they feel that endangers their security then too they will kill him he turned the knife because the realization of how much he disliked the woman how alien she was to his background seeped through him i put it to you mrs harrison that the people who have your husband will not hesitate to murder him if that serves their purpose better than keeping him alive he paused allowed the message to sink and spread find its own water level he found his advantage growing the signs of fear were shown by the slight pant in her chest the motion of the fingers and even if we pay if the company pays we still have no g u a r a n t e e he anticipated her there are never guarantees in these matters that was about as strongly as he had the stomach to put it he couldnt bring himself to tell her of luisa di capua whose husband had been dead two months before the body was found and who had received the last ransom note the day before the discovery no guarantees we would just have to hope he won a shrill short laugh from her how much will they ask mr charlesworth how much is my geoffrey worth on the italian market theyll ask for more than theyll be happy to end up with starters would probably be around five million dollars and theyll settle for perhaps two not less than one million which i dont have she was faster now and louder and the control was fracturing i dont have it do you understand that geoffrey doesnt his parents dont we dont own that sort of money its not really your husband thats being ransomed its his company the group will expect the company to pay and theyre tight bastards she spat across at him tight and mean and pennypinching he remembered the exterior of the block allowed himself to glance across the interior fittings of the flat im sure they will look favourably when they have had the situation explained to them i had intended to speak to them after i had seen you i thought that might be valuable to them so what happens now what do i do the questions rolled from her as if charlesworth were some allknowing guru on the subject of kidnap reaction we have to await the first contact probably by telephone then it can take quite a time for them to decide what arrangements they want to make for payment so what do i do sit by the bloody telephone all day and i dont even speak the bloody language just what i need round the shops in the morning i dont speak their bloody language i wont know what theyre bloody well saying shouting for the first time dipping into hysteria charlesworth fidgeted in the deep chair willed the session to end we can have it said in the papers that your husbands office is standing by to receive a message but theyre all bloody i t a l i a n s what the hell do they know about it a damn sight more than we do because they live with it every day of the year because every one of your husbands senior colleagues knows this can happen to him any time and a fair few of them will ring their wives each morning as soon as theyve sat down at their desks just so that the woman will know theyve made it safely they know more about this than you or i do or your husbands company in london if your husband is to come out of this alive youll need the help of all his friends in that office all of those bloody italians youll need all of their help he was out of the chair backside clear of the cushions fingers gripping for leverage into the upholstered arm rests poor old show charlesworth a stupid ignorant cow she may be but not your job to pass judgement lost your rag and you shouldnt have done he sagged back ashamed that he had battered the remnants of the calm destroyed the very thing that he had come to maintain the colour had fled from her face which had taken a pallid glow in the shock of his counterattack not a whimper from her not a choke only the eyes to give the message those of someone who has just stepped from a car accident in which driver or passenger has died and who knows dimly of catastrophe but does not have the power to identify and evaluate the debris mrs harrison you mustnt think yourself alone many people will now be working for your husbands release you must believe in that he stood up shuffled a little edged towards the door she looked up at him from her chair cheeks very pale below the saucer eyes knees apart and the gown gaping i hate this bloody place she said ive hated it from the day we arrived ive hated every hour of it hed told me we wouldnt have to stay here not more than another year hed promised me wed go home and now you want to go mr

shoulder ill be in touch and dont hesitate to call me at the embassy the numbers in the book trying to master the different locks delayed his flight sufficiently for him to hear her call from the remoteness of the living room youll come again mr charlesworth youll come again and see me he pulled the door brutally shut behind him erasing from his ears the trickle of her laughter some five minutes the colonnello spent attempting to marshal the moving waves of photographers and reporters into a straight line he threatened pleaded negotiated the issue of how many paces the prisoner should walk in front of the lenses and microphones before he was finally satisfied with his arrangements in the square internal courtyard of the questura and remember no interviews interviews are absolutely forbidden he shouted the last exhortation for discipline before the wave of his arm to the polizia who stood shaded in a distant doorway when she emerged franca tantardini held her head high jutted her chin thrust her eyes unwaveringly into the sun the chains at her wrists dangled against her knees as she walked her jeans and blouse were smeared with the street dirt of the pavement outside the post to her right the polizia linked arms to hold back the press of cameramen an officer gripped tightly at each of her elbows they were not the men who had taken her not the men who had killed enrico panicucci because those were anonymous and undercover and would not be photographed these were men in uniform spruced with combed and greased hair and polished shoes who preened themselves and swelled with importance she ignored the babble of shouted questions and walked on until she was level with the place where the crowd was densest the pushing at the police shoulders most acute the cameras closest a glance she spared for the scrummaging then ripped her right arm clear of her escorts hold swung it aloft into the air clenched her fist in salute seemed to hover a smile at the chatter of the camera shutters the policeman regained his hold dragged her arm down she was pulled through a doorway lost from sight show completed police taking their kudos cameramen their pictures satisfaction

sentenced months photographed fingerprinted more information would follow later but a name and a picture would be waiting on francesco vellosis desk when he returned from the questura another identity another set of features another case history to settle on the top of his mountain of files of wanted persons chapter five it had taken many minutes of the new motion of the van before geoffrey harrison was sufficiently aroused to realize that they were no longer travelling on the smooth worn surface of the autostrada the tang of the chloroform was just a memory now one receding aspect of the morning nightmare the smell of the moisture across his limbs and torso had become acceptable with familiarity the breathing through the hood became more possible as time went on the harsh smell of the carbon monoxide from the engine could be ignored it was a long time since he had tried to struggle with his bonds and he had abandoned the ambition to loosen the tapes with the greater calmness came a greater comfort no tears no fight no desperation no reason for him to compete any more just a need to lie back and let it all float across him to obliterate the more vicious fantasies that hovered near his imagination there was nothing he could do to change his situation and so he lay there feeling the jar and jolt and shift of the van wheels and gaining from the bruising impacts the knowledge that they had moved to a slower indirect road he thought of violet poor old violet shed know by now shed have heard and the police would be swarming round the flat and shed be shouting at them and crying and unless someone came who spoke english she wouldnt have a clue what they were talking about poor old violet whod wrung it out of him that they wouldnt stay past next summer two and a half years shed have existed then and shed said that was her limit that was enough she should have adjusted shouldnt she should have compromised made something of it of course it was different to england but people go abroad and people cope she should have been able to find some friends to coffeemorning with go walkabout the ruins with didnt seem to make the effort though did she and didnt seem interested not in anything not in his job not in his business colleagues not in the few foreigners who lived within walking distance of the flat shed never accepted living in a flat and not having neighbours she could lean over a fence and gossip with never accepted that people who spoke a different language were still human beings and intelligent and kindly and funny and that if they werent british it didnt mean they wiped their backsides with their hands bloody ridiculous it was old violet locked up in her castle on the hill and not letting the drawbridge down tried hard enough hadnt he yes geoffrey well what the hell else could be done couldnt throw her out of the front door with a street map and shout down the terraces that she mustnt be back before six he remembered when her parents had come to visit from stokeontrent never been out of england before didnt know whether they should put their teeth in the water at night didnt hold with all the wine at meals didnt master the coils of spaghetti falling off their forks when he took them all out to dinner set them back the pair of them that visit theyd argued about it endlessly after the old people had gone he telling her she should make more effort and not live like a bloody mole and what an advantage and opportunity she had she telling him she hated it wanted out and to england he telling her to get interested in the city get off her bottom and visit the vatican and the foro italico she telling him she was buggered if shed be ordered to tramp round museums poor old violet must have been out of her mind with boredom and she didnt even hit the bottle because he looked each night when he came home checked the gin level and the martini bianco level and the tio pepe level she didnt even drink the time away only thing she seemed to like was getting down to the beach and that was bloody ridiculous too there was a nice quiet pool just down the road for her to use and some very decent families using it but she preferred the beach and a hell of a drive down to ostia and all the filth and the oil to sit on pressed in close by those italians burning themselves nigger brown a total bloody mystery getting the sand in her hair not speaking to anyone poor old violet poor bored old violet hadnt thought about her for a long time had he not like this not examining her day well he didnt have time did he someone had to put the clothes on her back the food in her fridge a damn good job he had in rome better prospects better pay than he could have hoped for in london he wished shed see that working damned hard he was and he could do without the abuse when he flopped home in the evenings they were slow rambling thoughts indulgent and close lulling him from the crisis until there was another change in the engine pitch and he felt the movement of the gears the slowing of the engine the application of brakes the van bumped crazily on rough ground a dead stop voices that were clearer with the motor cut the complacency vanished the trembling began again because this was frightening to the man who was bound and gagged and hooded and who had no horizons of sight a way of existence that had become settled achieved tranquillity was ruptured the van had left the autostrada half way between cassino and capua bypassed the small town of vairano scalo avoiding the single wide street and central piazza they had turned east on a winding open hill road that would eventually reach the village of pietramelara the home of just over a thousand people with shuttered minds and uninquisitive tongues who would not question the presence of a strange vehicle with distant number plates that might rest for half an hour among the trees and off the road short of their community harrison felt himself bracing his muscles as if trying to push his way further back into the interior of the van crawl on his buttocks away from the rear door he heard the slamming at the front and the gouging scratch of feet on the ground that walked along the length of the side walls and then the noise of a lock being turned and a handle being tugged when the door opened there was a slight smudge of light filtering through the weave of the hood and the floor of the van bucked under a new weight he felt the shape alien and revolting to him brush against his knees and thighs and then there were hands at the hood scrabbling close to his chin at the back of his neck as the cloth was drawn back across his face he wanted to scream wanted to vomit to expel the fear taut tensed terrorized the smell of garlic was close to his nose and the odour of a farm the light brilliant blinding flooded over him hurting so that he screwed up his face and tried to twist away but he was not just turning from the intrusive sun but also from the man who was bent double under the low roof and now loomed above him boots close to his head hard roughened unpolished cracked with wear trousers that were old and patched and shapeless greasestained a shirt of red check material sleeves turned high on muscled forearms and dominating compelling his eyes was the hood black cloth with eye slits and the crudely cut hole that simulated the position of the mouth nowhere for harrison to writhe to nowhere for him to find refuge the hands coarse and blistered thrust to the tapes across his mouth one savage pull ripped them clear and left the skin as a vast single abrasion he coughed hard spluttered with his face smarting eyes heavy with tears at the sharpness of the pain no word from the man above who screwed up and tossed away the jumble of adhesive tape there was another silhouetted against the light of the doorway and harrison saw him pass forward a roll of bread that bulged with lettuce and tomato and ham big and fat and filling it would have been if he were hungry the bread was placed against his mouth he bit and swallowed bit again swallowed again around him an awareness of the surroundings grew the tastes were of the far countryside distant and removed from the city that was his home the air was closed to urban sounds open only to the calls of the birds that were free and roaming at their will harrison ate half the roll could stomach no more and shook his head and the man threw it casually behind him successful in his aim avoiding his friend they let him swig from a bottle of water aqua minerale lively with gas and bubbles from the movement of the van one drink and then the bottle was withdrawn he lay numbly still unresisting as his face was again taped instinctively he pleaded with his eyes because they were the only vehicle of argument left to him but the hood was returned to its place back in his realm of darkness his stomach ground on the food it had taken down his bowels were loose and confused by the content of what he had eaten he heard the back door close the lock being fastened the men walking back to the front of the van the engine started no threat no kindness no cruelty no comfort men without any minuscule foetal sensitivity vicious bastards without emotion without charity to take a blindfold off a man who was terrorized holding his muscles to keep his pants clean to rip the gag from his mouth and offer him nothing nothing in communication nothing as one human being to another the one who had fed him had worn on the third finger of his left hand the hand that held the bread the wide gold band of a weddingring he had a wife whom he would hold close to him and sweat and grunt his passion against and children who would call to him and laugh the bastard the fucking bastard who could extinguish compassion drown it say not a word give not a sign to a fellow creature who was in pain and suffering and alone so help me god if ever i have the chance ill kill that bastard beat his head with a stone smash and pound and break it while he pleads while he cries while the blood spatters so help me god i want to kill him i want to hear him scream youve never hit anyone in your life geoffrey you wouldnt know how the van moved off they drove slowly into the village of pietramelara the driver found what he was looking for without difficulty a bar with the circular sign of a telephone dial that heralded the presence of a coinbox machine he left his passenger in the seat nodded respectfully to the village priest hurrying home for his lunch accepted the smile of greeting conversation in the bar was not interrupted the driver pulled from his pocket a clutch of gettoni the tokens necessary for the call he took from the breast pocket of his shirt a packet of cigarettes and deciphered the number written on the inside of the cardboard lining six gettoni he required for rome he remembered the zero six prefix then carefully repeated the seven figure number from the packet when the answer came he spoke quickly gave only his first name and that of the village and his estimation that the journey would be completed in eight hours had there been difficulties there had been none the call was terminated by the other party the driver did not know to whom he was speaking he walked back to the van anxious to be on his way he faced a long drive far into the very toes of the italian boot into the mountain country of calabria and tonight he would sleep in his own cottage sleep against the cool stomach of his woman the drivers contact would permit the organization in the group that had kidnapped geoffrey harrison to make their first contact with the englishmans home they now knew that their merchandise was far beyond the reach of rescue by the polizia that the cordons and road blocks were way outstripped claudio stood with his hands in his pockets among the little groups of waving romans a varied sadness painted all those who watched the train the anaconda snake away from the long platform of the termini bending at the first far curve engine already lost mario and vanni gone settled into their seats in the grey carriage that carried the sign of reggio calabria nine hundred kilometres to the south their going left claudio without a companion condemned to wait away the night contain his resentment that he was not with his friends time to be killed and frittered as a man does when he is in a strange city that has no heart no belonging for him once he waved simply and without demonstration lifting his arm and waggling his fingers at the train as it diminished and blended with the softness of the heat haze that distorted and tricked as mario and vanni walked along the platform he had been tempted to follow and join them but fear of the men of the organization was enough to cast the apple from big claudios mouth some before had discarded the instructions of the organization trifled with their orders all had been awarded a fine funeral two or more priests to celebrate the mass many boys to sing in the choir enough flowers to cover all the stones in the cemetery enough tears to make a dead man believe he was mourned claudio had stayed behind and waved he would catch tomorrows train he swung his eyes away from the converging empty tracks and headed for the bar and the first of a new session of perroni beers that would help him watch the hour and minute hands of his watch later he would find a room near the station sometimes hurrying sometimes slowly when the lethargy bred from failure was on him giancarlo searched among the familiar places the rooms and corridors where he expected to find his friends he had gone to the faculty of letters where the walls were bright in a technicolour of protest paint and wandered the high plastercoated corridors past the stripped noticeboards past the locked lecture theatres into the quiet of the library to some who were relaxed and lounging in chairs he had spoken not with confidence but sidling towards them he had mentioned a name and seen a head shaken moved on another name shoulders shrugged in response on from the faculty of letters to the faculty of social sciences and further echoing and deserted corridors that rang with his thinsoled shoes and in which reverberated the laughter of those who belonged and knew their place hopeless for him to ask the question directly where are the people of the autonomia where can i find any member of the autonomia it was not information that would be given to a stranger not in a casual conversation he plodded on wet and constricted in his clothes dampened and caught in his unhappiness on from the faculty of social sciences heading for the faculty of physics two hours giancarlo paced the university complex there was no one he knew among the students who sat and talked in the sunshine or walked with their bundles of books or crouched over the printed words of their study texts no one who could send him with a smile and a gabble of directions to where he might discover the people of the autonomia still careful still watchful he hesitated by the great opened doors of the faculty of physics pausing in the shadow short of the sunbright steps that led down into the central yard of the university traversed with his eyes as a fox will when it sniffs the early air before leaving its den giancarlo quivered stiffened focused on the grey gunmetal alfasud parked back and out of the light far into the shade of the trees the car was distinctive because of its radio aerial high and set above the right rear wheel and because of the three men sprawled in the seats bearded two of them cleanshaven the third but all of them too old to be students he watched the car for many minutes hidden by shadow as it was observing the men fidget and shift in response to the comfort of their seats assimilating their mood their state of preparedness there was nothing exceptional about the police being there he told himself the place crawled with the pigs and their informers and there was no urgency about these men as they watched the young people move across their vision dumb bastards because even if they had his name and his picture they telegraphed their presence by their age by their location had they his name yet not so quickly surely not within a few hours confidence and depression ebullience and fear competed in the boys mind as he scurried for a side entrance and cover among the parked buses at the tiburtina termini rampant in his imagination was the sight of the three men low in the seats of their car the one with his newspaper the one with his arm trailing through the open window with the dangled cigarette the one with the barely opened eyes they had made him ran hastened the end of his fruitless wasted search and that was how it would always be till the gutter time till the shooting time till he no longer needed to scan the cars and the faces for the polizia pig bastards there would be a moment when he stood his ground a moment when they would know of him when giancarlo the moment when he would take franca tantardini from them by yourself giancarlo there was a pain at the boys eyes and agony behind the lids because this was a public place among the buses and the people who waited and they must not see him weep he climbed on to a bus chose it not for its route but because it was one that did not have a conductor to collect money and hand out tickets and relied instead on a machine and the honesty of passengers heart pumping blood coursing fast the little boy who had lost his protection and was running the girl in faded jeans and a flowing wristbuttoned blouse came quickly to the top of the high steps at the entrance to the faculty of social sciences she paused there raking the open ground in front of her then jogged down the steps and across the car park towards the grey alfasud it was not remarkable that she could identify the unmarked police car any student could have done that as she approached the car she saw the interest of the occupants quicken the cigarette stubbed the newspaper dropped the backs straightened at the drivers open window she hesitated as the mens eyes soaked into her for this was a public place for an informant to work you are looking for a boy the cool smile from the front passenger in response the lighting of another cigarette dark curly hair jeans and a shirt not tall thin the man in the back seat flipped casually at a notepad in which were scribbled words a boy like that came into the library it was just a few minutes ago he was nervous you could see that in his voice in his h a n d s the notebook was passed to the front examined with a secrecy as if the knowledge written there were to be denied to the girl he asked a friend if two boys were in the university the boys are both of the autonomia both were arrested after the last fight more than three months ago she was answered the front passenger drew his beretta pistol from the glove drawer and armed it the man in the back groped to the floor for a shortbarrelled machinegun the driver snapped a question where did he go i dont know there is the students lounge he went in that direction the girl had to step back as the car doors whipped open handguns pocketed the machinegun closed to view under a light jacket the three policemen ran for the faculty entrance they searched methodically for an hour in the public places of the university while more men of the antiterrorist squad arrived to augment their efforts there were curses of frustration at the failure of the hunt but satisfaction could be drawn from the knowledge that the identification if it were genuine showed that the kid was short of a covo it would not be long before the boy was taken not if he were scouting the university for friends more than twelve weeks in the cells that night the university and its hostels would be watched men would be detailed to stand in their silence in the shadows and doorways pray god the bastard returns by telephone the message from pietramelara was relayed to the capo that the initial moments of the kidnapping of the englishman had met with success he knew from the radio beside his desk the communique bearing the fruits of his enterprise had been broadcast with commendable speed by the rai networks how they help us he thought how they facilitate our business and now the cargo was moving beyond the scope of the road checks soon he would authorize the initial approaches to the family and the company and set in motion the financial procedures in the matter laid down by his specialist accountant a fat choice haul and the lifting sharp and surgical it was not for a man of the prominence of the capo to consider and burden himself with the machinery of the extortion of ransom a team he paid did that he paid them well so that tracks should be smothered and hidden he let himself out of his office locked his door from a wide ring of keys and crossed the pave ment to his car for the long journey to the south and the hill village where his wife and children lived he used the dino ferrari that would eat into the kilometres to the golfo di policastro where he would break the journey back to his family beside the sea in the sprouting coastal resorts his business was fuelled by the new and flourishing source of revenue he cut a good figure as he climbed athletically into the lowslung sports car to the superficial watcher there was nothing in his bearing or his dress to link him with profitable crime painstakingly organized ruthlessly executed he would be at the resort area by early evening in time to take a functionary of the regional planning office to dinner and when the man was drunk and grateful for the attention the capo would leave him and motor on to his villa in the aspromonte he drove aggressively from the kerbside attracting notice to those who saw him go there was a feeling that this was a man on whom the sun shone violet harrison had no clear intention of going to the beach at ostia that afternoon nothing definite in her mind no commitment to escape from the funereal movements of her maid but there had to be an alternative to sitting and smoking and drinking coffee and straining for the telephones first ecstatic ring she had taken the three newest bikinis from the drawer of the chest in her bedroom one in yellow one in black the third in pink with white dots and laid them with a neatness that was not usually hers out on the bedspread and looked at their flimsy defiance bit on the small side isnt it geoffrey had laughed bit of a risk running round in that in these parts that was last week and hed slapped her bottom kissed her on the cheek and never mentioned it again but written all over his bloody face whats an old girl like you wanting a teenagers fripperies for hed settled in his chair with a drink in his hand and a folder of accounts on his lap bit on the small s i d e and hed held her most recent purchase pink with white dots between his fingers dangling shed found it in the boutique window down past the market wanted it urged herself to buy it shed ignored the superciliousness of the stare of the shop girl tall and manicured and straightbacked haughty bitch who said with her eyes what her husband had spoken five hours later violet harrison had only worn the pink and white bikini once just the one time the day before while she lay on the beach at ostia and listened to the virulent run of conversation around her couldnt understand a word they said to her it was a medley of silly chatter and giggling and exuberance but it made a state of independence for her a secret hideout among the people and litter from the icecream wrappers and the beer bottles and pepsi cartons it was her place unknown to the cool and monied world of the inhabitants of collina fleming marvellous she felt there bloody marvellous and the sun burned into her skin and the sand flicked across her face and went unnoticed the nearest thing to happiness and guiltless pleasure and then the silly kid had started talking to her all part of the game wasnt it all part of the scenario of escape and freedom a silly little kid trying to pick up an english matron old enough to be his aunt anyway trying to pick her off as if she were an aupair on an afternoon out and hed said hed be there that afternoon its not my bloody fault geoffrey what am i supposed to do dress in black tights and put polaroid specs on so that people cant see that i havent cried for four hours put flowers round the livingroom and wear soft shoes so ill make no noise when i pace up and down and keep the bloody place looking like a layingout parlour what do you want me to do sit here all day sit here and weep and ask mummy to come out and hold my hand and make mugs of tea i dont mean that geoffrey not like that i dont mean you any harm i cant just sit here you understand that i cant just eke it all out im not strong enough thats what i mean im not a public persons wife but im not going to go anyway i mean it im not going to the beach im going to stay here and wait for the telephone thats what i have to do isnt it i have to suffer with you because youre out there somewhere are you frightened geoffrey a man came to see me some idiot from the embassy and he said they wouldnt hurt you well he didnt quite say that but they wont actually hurt you if everything goes well if nothing is wrong thats what he said she grabbed the bikini from the bedcover the little cotton triangles the linking cords the fastening straps crushed them in her fist and hurled the pieces towards the corner that housed the neat formation of geoffreys shoes she started to run from the bedroom drawn always faster by the piercing siren call of the telephone crashing through doors slipping on the smooth floor surface the caller was patient allowed the bell to ring out its summons let the persistence of the noise swamp the flat cutting the walls floating to the crannies again the airconditioning was not working michael charlesworth sat in his office jacket draped over his chair tie loosened top three shirt buttons undone no surprise the airconditioning had to be phlegmatic about it what chance of finding a maintenance man who wouldnt carve half the wall off pulling at the pipes and who wasnt like the rest of the city prostrate with the heat or on holiday sweat coated the paper in front of him running the ink where hed written with his ballpoint and beside his elbow the telephone was still wet from his palm print a great quiet in a building usually leaking with noise the ambassador and his guests at lunch attaches and first and second secretaries disappeared to the shaded restaurants near the porta pia and the via nomentana the typists had covered their machines the clerks locked their filing cabinets charlesworth scribbled on fiercely he had started with a list of his immediates a call to carboni at the questura to ensure the message was discreetly fed to the afternoon newspapers that harrisons office was standing ready to receive contact he had barely put the phone down when violet harrison rang she had seemed detached distant enough for him to wonder if a doctor had called with sedatives she had spoken of a message and a man who talked only in italian and she had shouted and he had shouted each obliterating the words of the other there was a great calmness about her as if a narcotic were at work and a politeness as she had told charlesworth that she was going out for a few hours i cant just sit here shed said matter of fact untroubled by crisis i cant just hang about i think you understand he had tried to reach the ambassador sent a spiritless message through to the personal secretary and received the reply he anticipated if nothing has changed the old man would be happy to see you about five he wouldnt want to be disturbed before that at least not unless its a case of life and death you know a nice girl the personal secretary long and leggy and combed and sweet projecting out of cotton print dresses but fierce and loyal in her protectiveness and what was a case of life and death a guy on his back crapping himself and bound so that he lay in his filth and savage bastards round him whod kill if it was to their advantage life and death not in the old mans terms not enough reason to spoil a good lunch and there wasnt anything new not if he were honest about it just that a woman was having a plucky try and likely to succeed at a nice and public nervous breakdown not a special woman who knew an mp back home with clout or whod figure on the embassy sconesandtea invitation list but michael charlesworth hadnt provided the granite pillar for violet harrison to support herself against nor the shoulder nor the handkerchief a dreadful woman awful manners disastrous sense of occasion but worthy of some small charity yes michael charlesworth his teeth played on his lower lip as he heaved in his chair and grabbed again for the telephone its ten minutes since i asked for that london call sweetheart ten minutes and thats too long he called her miss foreman normally i cant help it mr charlesworth the operator on international wont answer you know how it is the syrup voice of a lady who knitted and took holidays in welsh hotels offseason and thought of italians as dirty and wished she was twenty years younger not too old to be loved cant you just dial it for me darling you know thats not allowed mr charlesworth you can dial it for me wearying of the game youll have to sign for it one of the girls will have to come up to second when shes free and get your signature just get me the call charlesworths temper fraying ragged as soon as weve looked out a priority form and a girls available ill send her up get me that bloody call get it now dial it a mans bloody life may depend you dont have to swear theres no need for offensiveness just get me the call darling ill sign the priority later but its important that i speak to london and that cretins like you dont waste any more of my time the earpiece exploded in the sounds of switchboard mechanics plugs extracted plugs inserted numbers dialled and whirring on their arcs the ringing tone hed never spoken to miss gladys foreman mbe like that doubted if anyone ever had not in three decades anyway like urinating right across the lounge carpet at a standup buffet at the residence two rings and the plastic automated voice of a faraway girl international chemical holdings can i help you please its the british embassy in rome michael charlesworth speaking i need to talk with the managing director delays reroutings a false start and the call retrieved charlesworih sat at his desk soaking the sunlight telling a secretary that he was damned if he was going to prdcis his message and that he wanted her master and she should pull her bloody finger and get off the line yes he could wait a moment he could wait all day why not different whether the other blighter could whether geoffrey harrison could adams speaking what can i do for you mr charlesworth sir david adams captain of industry clipped voice a brusqueness that demanded information and warned against wasted time its good of you to speak to me i have to tell you that your representative in rome mr geoffrey harrison was kidnapped this morning on his way to your office charlesworth paused cleared his throat a guttural clatter then launched into the few available facts recounted his conversations with the questura not a great deal to say and the inadequacy hurt ive read in the newspapers of these happenings but i confess i was under the impression this was an italian problem a domestic one a sharp voice distorted to a high pitch by the static of the communication your man is the first of the foreign business community and it could be expensive very expensive sir david lurched to the heart of the issue hadnt he charlesworth contained himself from laughing get the priorities right lad get the balance sheets organized and the rest follows to get him back what sort of figure might we be talking about the asking price might be anything up to four or five million dollars thatll set him swinging in his black leather chair thatll start him gawping out over the city skyline there might be a possibility of negotiation but it wont be easy for a company like yours to plead poverty and if we dont pay then you are in for a long widows pension mrs harrison is a young woman well thats a board decision and in the meantime what action should we take the only thing you have to do is to get that decision taken and fast it could go very hard for mr harrison if the group that hold him thought you were prevaricating as you probably realize in this country there is a tradition of paying up they would not respond well to the breaking of that custom dont ever say i didnt root for you geoffrey harrison dont ever say i didnt go in there with two feet kicking a silence on the line the big man chewing on it deliberating a slow smile winning across michael charlesworths face when sir david adams spoke again the chisel had blunted in his voice its a great deal of money mr charlesworth my board would have be very certain that its totally necessary to pay the sort of sum you mention they wont like it and theres a question of principle too theres a tradition in this country that we dont crumble to blackmail then you would have to make the decision that on a point of principle you were prepared to sacrifice the life of mr harrison of course it might not come to that but the possibility perhaps the probability exists you are very frank mr charlesworth there was the trace of disapproval in the scraped gravel tones if we suppose and only suppose that we were to pay a very considerable sum then who would control the arrangements it would be best done by your office in rome the embassy couldnt get involved charlesworth heard the low laugh in response ten minutes theyd been talking ten minutes in querying the profit and loss columns and whether a ransom should be paid principle or expediency a martyr for the greater good of the majority or a shameladen deal for the return of one man perhaps charles worth thought hed minimized the issues at stake perhaps a line had to be drawn no deals no bargains no compromise there would be many willing to shout that clarion call if you gave in once if you slipped one time into the shadows with a suitcase of used banknotes and a string of zurich bank account numbers then how many other poor bastards were going to follow the road of geoffrey harrison not his business though not his concern because as hed said most clearly the embassy wouldnt be involved would stand detached within its glass walls and watch and murmur occasional interest that was why sir david adams managing director of international chemical holdings in the city of london could laugh lightly at him without humour without rancour at the moment of dismissal youve been very kind mr charlesworth ill get one of my people on the plane this evening id like him to be in touch with you the call was terminated michael charlesworth flopped back into the small comforts offered by the plastic padding of his chair a time for reflection he must call miss foreman he must apologize and there would be some flowers for her basement bunker tomorrow in the morning and then the bell again the bloody telephone the questura had been informed from the offices of ich in viale pasteur that a demand of two million dollars for the return of geoffrey harrison had been received there should be no contact with the police further details of arrangement for payment would follow through intermediaries dottore carboni was not in his office at present but he had requested that the information be passed to signor charlesworth there were mutual thanks and politeness two million dollars more than a million in sterling at whatever the fluctuating rate four million swiss francs cascades of figures and less than hed thought it would be as if those who had taken harrison had settled for a bargain basement price and would not haggle and barter but expect settlement without delay michael charlesworth changed his mind he would apologize in person to gladys foreman he fastened his shirt buttons straightened his tie slipped on his jacket and walked slowly out of his office he wondered what the man looked like geoffrey harrison how his voice sounded whether hed be good company for dinner if he told a good joke he felt himself inextricably involved with a man he did not know could not picture and might never meet unless a company on the other side of the continent jettisoned an issue of principle and made available more money than he could decently imagine chapter six the termini was a good place for giancarlo to come to a great extended white stone frontage before which the buses parked the taxis queued the traders hawked gaudy toys and shiny shoes and polished belts and where thousands streamed each morning and afternoon on their way to and from the business of the city shops and bars and restaurants and even a subterranean aquarium catered for those who had time to pass vast sprawling a dinosaur dedicated to the days before the private car and the growth of the autostrada businessmen were there neat and watching the departure board for the evening expresses for torino and milano and napoli families of impatient mothers and fretful children waited for connections to the resorts of rimini and ricci and the towns south of bari soldiers and sailors and airmen looked for the trains that would carry them to far distant barracks or back to their homes the routine of conscription broken for a few short days gypsy girls in anklelength wraparound skirts and painful faces of destitution held out paper cups for money noise and movement and blurred features and the mingling of accents of lombardia piemonte umbria and lazio and toscana tired famished with a throat desert dried he stalked slowly and still with care and watchfulness on to the main concourse it was a good place for giancarlo because there were many here too many people too many scuffling feet for the polizia to notice one small boy the training of the nap was well etched in the youth so that the places of concealment were second nature as he sought camouflage to his presence with his weariness had come no sense of defeat no will to cringe and concede only a con fusion as to how he might best strike back at those who had taken franca tantardini a white scabbed face bristle on his cheeks hair hanging eyes sunken past the stalls for the childrens toys past the stands of newspapers and magazines and books oblivious of the broadcast news of platform changes and delays he walked the wide length of the concourse the second time he passed the big bar the one that faced the platforms he saw the man and stirred the response of recognition it took giancarlo many more dragging steps as he racked his memory to identify the fatted face threatening body dropped shoulders of the man who leaned on his elbows with a glass in his hand and gazed out of the bar the boy had to examine a host of recent experiences sift through them and reject the failures before there was satisfaction and confirmation the one they called gigante the huge one that was the man in the bar he saw him on the iron steps that led between the landings his great strides that echoed down the yawning corridors men stepping back from his path and skirting his strength all had conceded precedence to the gigante all except the nap men on b wing claudio he could even place his name not his other name only the first one the given one claudio treated with respect in the regina coeli because his fist was the width of a pizza portion and his temper short and his sensitivity slight to the boy he seemed gross in his stomach looked to have taken his food and from the tilt of the glass his beer was not the early one of the day giancarlo turned on his heel retraced his way till he came and stood at the doorway of the bar that was open to lure the faint breeze into the heated interior stood stationary waiting for the head to rise and the gaze to fasten the boy stood statue still until the sleeplost narrow eyes of the big man rolled across the doorway and past him and then swept backwards as if awakened giancarlo smiled and slipped forward ciao claudio the boy said quietly close to him the big man stiffened the prodded bullock as if recognition ruffled and unsettled him its a long time claudio but i think you remember me he read the uncertainty in the others face watched the war going on between the frown lines of his shallow forehead the fight to put a name and a place to the boy who had accosted him giancarlo prompted at the queen of heaven claudio do you not remember me do you not remember my friends my friends were in the political wing and i was under their protection ive not seen you before something in the denial that was weak and furtive and the big man looked round peering about him but i know your name and i could tell you the number on the cell door perhaps even i could tell you the names of those that slept there with you a half smile played on giancarlos lips and an ebb tide of relaxation was running in him it was the first time in the day through the long hours since the post that he felt an intuition of advantage if we had coffee and we talked then you might remember more of me and of my friends my friends were in the political wing they were people of influence in the queen of heaven they still hold that influence his voice died away the message of menace inherent in the boast of his pedigree claudio laughed with a ripple of nervousness and looked past the boy as if to be certain that he was alone that a trap was not set for him he walked away without explanation to the girl at the cash desk shouldered his way past others giancarlo saw a thickened wad of notes emerge from the hip pocket saw the hands that trembled and scuffed at the notes before the lire note was produced money endless rolls of it enough to quicken the attention of the boy as a pilot fish clings to a shark that he may feed from the droppings at its jaws so giancarlo stayed close to the reluctant claudio you will have a beer with me said claudio when he was back from the bar slowly and stilted the man and the boy circled each other in sporadic conversation over the first beer claudio seeking to determine what the other wanted of him giancarlo working at the crannies of information and looking for advantage and the area of profit a second beer and a third and claudios head was rolling from the intake his words sluggish and with a creeping edge of confidence leading him forward by the fourth bottle of tight gassed perroni claudios arm was across giancarlos bent shoulder and together they scanned the front page of the afternoon paper a pudgy scarred finger grime to the quick of the nail stabbed at the report on the front page of the kidnapping of a british businessman as he had left his home that morning when giancarlo looked sharply into the big mans face there was a dissolve of giggles the boy struggled to stay alert to hose out the beer that flowed in him seeking the information that might lead to power over his drinking companion claudio was from the south giancarlos memory told him the fact confirmed by the thickened accent of calabria and he was waiting for a train from rome and there was the music of his laughter and his attention to a kidnapping here was a source of money a source of protection because the big man was running too was also a fugitive and had betrayed himself but we are not the most important news today muttered claudio with a tinge of disappointment an actor denied limelight because they have taken one of yours they have taken a whore of the nap they took her this morning and that is what excites the polizia giancarlo kept his peace and the finger was moving again dabbing down and smudging with dirt the picture of franca tantardini a leader of the nap they call her and the one that guarded her dead silly bitch to have been out in the open silly cow did you know her boy she looks worth knowing i had met her giancarlo kept the casualness in his words but there are many like her and she will be avenged they will not hold her in prison her friends will release her they cannot hold our people in the picture francas head was high and her blouse tight and the camera had caught the sting of the nipple and the clasp of the manacles at her wrists thats shit boy when they have her they hold her goodlooking bitch mouthed claudio and then it was as if a clarity had come to him and the beer vapour was dispersed and the interest crawled like a spiders path across his face that is why you are running why you are here without food without money sponging from an old peasant it is because they have taken her giancarlo looked back at him unwavering deep into the bloodstreams of his eyes it is why i seek the help of a friend you were with the girl i need the help of a friend because they have taken her you have no place i have no place to go in a city in rome you have nowhere to cover yourself i am alone said giancarlo but there are friends there are others we do not have that structure we have the cell grouping we are separated because that is the rule of the nap around their ears the noise and chaos of the bar was rampant arms pressing against them orders shouted to the whiteshirted men behind the bar humour rancour impatience buffeting at their ears but they had created their island were immune to disturbance perhaps you should go home something softer from the big man you should go back to your family bury yourself away let the thing pass i am hunted i was with her when she was taken and the other who was with her was killed by the pigs they are searching for me the supremacy over claudio was lost frittered away giancarlo was searching for comfort and turning for it to a hardened brutefashioned animal i have walked all day i have nowhere to go i remember you boy because you were the one that went always to their cells you had their protection the arm was tight on giancarlos shoulders and the breath of garlic bread and sausage and beer was close to his nostrils so you became a man in the movement something of substance and now you turn to a calabrian idiot for help a man from the farms one you would have dismissed as an ignorant and stupid pig i would not dismiss you as an ignorant and stupid one you have money in your pocket you are not the victim of exploitation and oppression you have eyes then my little lost one something cold and bovine in claudios face you watch a man when he has too much beer giancarlo smiled with richness and warmth and cracked the frozen stare more beers and claudio spoke of a hotel room but of a meal first playing the grand host he would be provider he said for a few hours of shelter and safety giancarlo wondered why laid the reasoning of the other man at the bottles of beer he had drunk and acquiesced the mafia and its tentacles were hated and despised by the politicized groups such as the nap to the organizations of the extreme left organized crime represented the total and complete control of the working classes its survival dependent on fear and repression inflicted on the lesser and weaker and its helpers were the senior and corrupt officials in administration in the revolutionary war of giancarlo high on the list of enemies would be the gangs that operated for money and chattels venality was despicable so claudio was giancarlos opponent but the boy would be patient because he had need of the other man and because he would use him for his purposes if claudio had been sober if his limited wits had been alerted he would not have countenanced the liaison but he was well oiled now and had lost his native and naive cunning for selfpreservation in the boys mind was the first budding of a plan something that needed to be cultivated and pruned if it were to show a bloom a way to win back from the bastards his franca a desperate deep yearning for her for her body and the cavities and the bright laugh and the brazen love he wanted it so that his shape quivered and glowed and his belly ached franca franca a muted shout and they went into the humid night air the political activist and the kidnap gorilla arms unequally around each other bloated by beer headed together from the termini in search of a plate of spaghetti caught now in a static turmoil of traffic on the raccordo annulare both lanes blocked the possibility of advancement denied violet harrison cursed and shouted her abuse at the unhearing uncaring audience one hundred metres she had crawled in the last eight minutes on the back seat of the car was the plastic bag with the towel thrown angrily inside so that on her return it would be creased and untidy and beneath it the pink polka dot bikini buried and unworn she had willed herself to stand her ground in the flat to sit beside the telephone because that was the proper and right thing for her to do the proper and right place for her to be but the desire for selfpreservation had won the field she had turned her back abandoned the apartment driven to the beach a ludicrous sight she must have seemed that much she knew a woman a foreigner pacing the length of the sand her feet slipping and stumbling in its insecurity scanning with her eyes peering at the boys with the golden torsos and bare legs and muscled shoulders seeking to keep an assignation and showing to all who cared to watch the torment and humiliation of not finding him whom she had chosen to meet a grown woman with a fertile womb and thighs that were thickening and a waist no longer slender and a throat that showed the time ravages and she had succumbed and come back to the beach to talk to a boy whose name she did not know salted angry tears ran without hindrance on her cheeks by the time she had climbed back into the car and surged away in the glowering dusk perhaps if she had come at the time she was always at the beach perhaps he would have been there bloody boy as if he had no knowledge of what she had sacrificed to come to find him he couldnt have known the pain he inflicted or he would have been there bloody child im sorry geoffrey as god is my witness i cant help myself i even ironed the bikini michael charlesworth cycled home without enthusiasm taking no pleasure from the ease with which he skirted the piled slowmoving cars and ignored the impatient defiles normally he revelled in the freedom of the bicycle but not this evening his meeting with the ambassador had been predictable the aftermath of the lunch and flowing hospitality had left his excellency with scant reserves of attention for matters outside the strict protocol of functions exercised by the embassy in a criminal kidnapping there can be no area of responsibility for us the ambassador had remarked his cigar tapering between his fingers its a matter for this poor devils company its their decision whether to pay and how to conduct their negotiations personally i dont think theyve any option in the matter local conditions being what they are the company can afford it and lets hope they get it over as quickly as is decently possible and dont forget the legal problems if theyre not discreet they can run into all sorts of internal problems with the law here its not that im unsympathetic just that its a fraught area and not one for us so i see no need for our feet to go in any deeper and we should let the matter rest in the hands of those directly involved so the bowl of water had been brought to the throne and the hands had been rinsed charlesworth returned to analysis of the newly announced power structure in the central committee of the pci the old man was right of course he invariably was paying out ransom money could be assessed as aiding and abetting a felony thin ice for diplomatic boots to step on but the ice wasnt thick under geoffrey harrison and he was without his woollies and a lifejacket poor bastard geoffrey harrison could scratch michael charlesworth off his list of angels he flung out his left arm failed to turn his head swerved across two traffic lanes ignored the hurt scream of tyres and brakes their country so do it their way local conditions he thought local conditions the catchphrase of the day through the afternoon and early evening francesco vellosi had wrestled with the temptation until at the time he would normally have left the viminale for his home he had finally asked his private secretary to warn the questura that he was coming to their offices and that he wanted to sit in on the interrogation of franca tantardini there was no place on such an occasion for a man in his position nothing that he could usefully learn by being present that could not as satisfactorily be taken from the transcripts that would await him in the morning but the admiration of the undersecretary the reverence in which the civil servant had clothed the distant chained figure as she had been paraded for the photographers had haunted and disturbed him through the day most of those taken were humbled figures by the time their photographs had been executed in the basement cells bravery leaking the struggle and fervour of the revolution drained it was the same with both factions with the red fascists and the black fascists the maniacs of the extreme left and the extreme right but to vellosi this girl had been particular unique haughty and proud as if beaten in only a skirmish not a battle as an experienced and dedicated policeman who had learned his trade in the hard schools of milano and reggio his favour was sought after his presence was the delight of a dinnerparty hostess he was a man regarded with envy by his colleagues because of his competence and singleminded determination yet the sight of the woman in the warm questura yard had unsettled vellosi two years they had hunted her countless manhours had been expended in the following of scrappy particles of information the watching of buildings the frustration and the disappointment two years of the treadmill and now that they had her there was an absence of the satisfaction that the capture should have brought in the back of his car mindful of the escort vehicle behind him without which it was deemed unsafe for him to travel vellosi pondered the equation he had set himself what made the tantardini woman turn aside from the world that the majority were grateful to accept where did the web of conformity break where did the grotesque mutation spawn there were more than five hundred of them red and black in the gaols mostly minnows mostly idiots mostly the cruel oddities of life who saw in violence and maiming the only outlet they might capture in their desire to be heard of shouted about but not this woman too intelligent too trained too vicious to be classified with the herd from a good family in bergamo from a convent school from money and opportunity the real and worthy opponent the one that taxed and exhausted francesco vellosi a woman who could make a man bend and crawl and suffer she could grind me this one he thought could squeeze and suck me dry between her legs between her brain and there was little to confront her with nothing to frighten her with no instrument with which to break her mauro ive said it before today and i say it again we should have shot the bitch on the pavement he spoke quietly to his driver the trusted dustbin for his musings more people have been killed or crippled in the name of renato curcio than ever were attacked while he was at liberty more of these bastard kids are motivated by the name of la vianale than ever were before we took her we shall build another rallyingpoint when we lock up franca tantardini we can put her down in messina throw the key away and it will change nothing if we segregate her from other prisoners then its called inhuman treatment mental torture if we put her with the pack its too easy for her shell be over the wall each month shes in messina the radicali will be yelling her name in the camera all ways we approach it we lose eh mauro it was not the drivers place to reply he nodded agreement his attention was on the road always watchful for a car closing too fast on the open side looking to his mirror that the escort should not have become separated they have called for a demonstration tonight vellosi continued his monologue the students the unemployed the men of the democrazia proletaria the children of the autonomia a medley of the discontented the questura has banned it no march no meeting is permitted but the rats will be out once they have the night to hide them the murder of enrico panicucci is the rallying cry they will break some limbs and smash some shops and burn some cars and scream about the violence of the state and tantardinis name will be heard in the centra storico and the ones that shout it would not have heard of her before this mornings radio maura i feel i should weep for italy the driver sensing the discourse was exhausted again nodded decisively and with agreement perhaps if the dottore had a wife and children then he would be changed not bleed himself so copiously but vellosi was alone and his home was his office and his furniture was his filing cabinet and his family were the young men he sent on to the streets at darkness to fight his war the cars swept into the back entrance of the questura recognized and saluted by the officer on the barrier francesco vellosi was not a man to be kept waiting a greeting party of three inclined their heads as he emerged from his car if the dottore would follow them they would lead to the interrogation room tantardini was eating in the cell block she had been questioned once a shrug of the shoulders and a grimace to demonstrate how much had been learned the session was about to be resumed vellosi followed his guides through pale lit corridors down steps past guards down into the bowels of the building there were more handshakes at the entrance to the designated room and then vellosis escort abandoned him he was left with his own people the ones prepared to dirty their hands while those who had brought him this far could retreat from the subterranean world of violence and counterviolence and breathe again the real air that was not conducted by ageing generators and fans there were two men in the room both known to vellosi because they were his appointees hard men and efficient and devoid of soul skilful in interrogation impatient of prevarication these were their credentials and what other criteria could be used in recruitment what other men could be found to muddy their fingers in defence of a gross and obese society the excitement was running for vellosi because these were his colleagues and in their company he was content and at ease he gestured his readiness and sat himself on a bare wooden chair in the shadow of the door where he would face the interrogators the prisoner would not see him as the lights shone in her eyes where she would be confronted by her questioners her back would be to him vellosi heard the far distant the approaching tramp of weighted shoes and he found himself arched and taut as the woman eclipsing the lights was brought through the door she blazoned her indifference casually flopped down in a chair in front of the lone table this was the enemy the opponent of menace and hazard and all he could see were the angular shoulderblades of a goodlooking woman with her hair circled by a cheap cotton scarf dirty jeans and unwashed blouse no lipstick and a sneer to substantiate the threat where were her tanks and her adcs where was her army and her regiments and platoons where was her serial number and her rank dead still vellosi stayed because that way she had no reason to turn and face him that way he was the voyeur the intruder at a private party one interrogator lounged across the table from her the second man was further back behind him with the file and the notepad on his knees there was no paper laid out on the table because the man who would ask questions and seek to find flaws in her defiance must demonstrate his knowledge must have no need for typed reports must dominate if he were to succeed you have had your food tantardini he spoke conversationally without rancour vellosi heard her snort the derision that communicated tension you have no complaints about the food no response and you have not been hurt you have not been tortured vellosi saw her shrug noncommittal as if the question were unimportant but then the woman had no audience she would be a changed person in the cockpit of the public courtroom we have not treated you in any way that violates the constitution we have behaved tantardini is that right he mocked her gently feeling his way forward amused again the shrug and that is not as you would have expected am i correct that is not what the communiques will state am i correct no response but then we play by different rules from yours she drove back at him seeking to destroy the smugness and complacency that he had fashioned on his face if you do not hurt me it is because you are afraid there is no compassion in lackeys like yourself there is no kindness among you pigs fear governs you fear of the reach of our arm the society that you are servile to cannot protect you if you lay a hand on me a finger a nail then we will strike you down that is why you give me food that is why you do not touch me we are afraid of no one tantardini least of all the little ones like yourself perhaps we are cautious of the strength of the brigate rosse cautious only perhaps we treat them with care but the nap does not match the brigate rosse the nap is trivia and without muscle you hunt us hard if we have no muscle you spend much time on us the interrogator smiled still sparring still dancing far apart as if unwilling yet to clash with the gloves then he leaned forward and the grin was erased in twentyfive years time tantardini how old will you be vellosi could see the outline of the womans neck could see the smooth bright skin of youth you have the files you have the information she replied you will be old tantardini old and withered and barren in twentyfive years there will be new generations young men and women will grow and take their places in society and they will never have heard of la tantardini you will be a dinosaur to them an ancient creature verging on extinction perhaps he has hurt her perhaps that is the way to her vellosi sat very still breathing quietly satisfied she was unaware of his presence there was no response from her that is the future that is what you have to consider tantardini twentyfive years to brood on your revolution the interrogator droned on youll be a senile hag a dowager of anarchy when you are released a tedious symbol of a phase in our history courted by a few sociologists dug out for documentaries by the rai and all will marvel at your stupidity that is the future tantardini will you say that when the bullets strike your legs she hissed the cobra at bay when the comrades are at you when there are no chains at their wrists will you make speeches to me then there will be no bullets because you and your kind will be buried behind the walls of messina and asinara and favignana removed from the reach of ordinary and decent people you will die in your own blood it will not be in the legs it will be to kill she shouted now her voice dinning across the room vellosi saw the veins leaping at her neck straining down into the collar of her blouse fierce and untamed the magnificent savage la leonessa as the civil servant had christened her la vianale cursed her judge but i think he is well and with his family tonight and it is now two years that her threat has been empty and hollow the interrogator spoke quietly be careful my friend do not look for paper victories for victories that you can boast of we have an arm of strength we will follow you we will find you and where will you find your army where will you recruit your children from which kindergarten you will find the answer you will find it one morning as you kiss your wife as you walk back from school from setting the children down you will see the power of the proletarian masses thats shit tantardini proletarian masses it means nothing revolutionary warfare nothing struggle of the workers nothing its gibberish boring and rejected gibberish you will see her voice was a whisper and there was a cold in the room that clutched at the man who wrote the notes behind the interrogator and which made him thankful that he was far from the front line a noncombatant obscure and unrecognized its shit tantardini because you have no army you go to war with sick children what have you to throw against me giancarlo bat testini is that the hero who will strike the pain fled her face she shrieked with laughter pealed it round the faces of the watching men giancarlo is that what you think we are made of little giancarlo we have his name we have his fingerprints his photograph where will he go tantardini what do you want with him little giancarlo his capture wont win you a war angered for the first time resenting the dismissal of a situation he had worked towards with care and precision the interrogator slammed his fist to the table we want the bpy tantardini panicucci battestini we want the package she jeered back at him he is nothing not to us not to you a little bedwetter looking for a mother a thrower of molotovs good for demonstrations good enough for your bed he chanced even you might be good enough for my bed even you little pig if there was darkness if you washed your mouth he was with you at the shooting of cesare fulni at the factory sitting in the car watching messing his pants masturbating most likely she laughed again as if in enjoyment vellosi smiled deep and safe in his privacy she was a worthy enemy unique styled irreplaceable as an opponent where will he go the interrogator was flustered and unsettled if you want giancarlo go and stand outside his mothers door wait till it is cold wait till he is hungry the interrogator shook his shoulders closed his eyes seemed to mutter an obscenity his fingers were clamped together knuckles showing white twentyfive years franca for a man or a woman it is a lifetime you know you can help us and we can help you you begin to bore me vellosi saw the hate summoned to the mans narrowed lips i will come one day each year and stand over the exercise yard and i will watch you and then you will tell me whether i bore you i will look for you and on the day that you have broken the rendezvous then i will laugh you will hear me pig however deep you are buried however far is your grave you will hear me you do not frighten me because already you are running you stupid little whore she waved her hand carelessly at him i am tired you do not interest me and i would like to go now i would like to go bac k to my room she stood up proud and erect and seemed to vellosi to mesmerize her questioner because he came round the table and opened the door for her she was gone without a backward glance leaving the room abandoned and without a presence the interrogator looked sheepishly at his chief the boy sweet little giancarlo she would have eaten him bitten him down to the bone a very serious lady replied francesco vellosi with as composed a face as he could muster she will have given her little bedwetter and molotovthrower a night he will not quickly forget chapter seven for four undemanding years archie carpenter had been on the sprawling staff list of international chemical holdings four years in which his life revolved around negotiated office hours a stipulated lunch break five weeks annual holiday and days off for working public holidays a soft old number archie his onetime friends in the special branch of the metropolitan police called it when the old ties proved too strong and he hunted them out in the pub behind the yard for a grouse and a gossip he had settled for a predictable backwater in an unremarkable current so it had been a traumatic evening first he had been summoned to the managing directors suite of offices hed stood with a puzzlement on his face through a briefing on the kidnapping of geoffrey harrison and its company implications the personnel director had handed him an opendated return ticket to rome on the way out in a fluster hed been ushered to the front entrance where a company car waited to speed him to heathrow last on to the plane but he wasnt in rome hadnt arrived at his destination archie carpenter was in front of the departure board at linate milans international airport strike in rome hed been told cockpit crew and he was lucky to have reached this far there might be a flight later and he must wait as everybody else was waiting hed asked repeatedly whether he would have a ticket for the first flight to leave for fiumicino he was smiled at and had learned in twenty minutes that the shaken shoulder of a man in uniform meant everything or nothing the interpretation was free all done up for the party and nowhere to go he paced cursing through the antscurrying crowds of fellow travellers always returning to the crush around the board four years ago he wouldnt have been flapping would have made his assessment and either sat back and let the tide take him or jumped off his backside and done something about it like a selfdrive hire car or a taxi down to the central station and an express to the capital but the improvisation was on the way out the mechanics of initiative were rusty and so he tramped the concourse and breathed his abuse a detective chief inspector in special branch had been archie carpenters lofty ranking in the metropolitan police when he had moved over into industry as his wife liked to spell it out to the neighbours all the big firms in the city had been frantic for securitytrained personnel to advise them on protection from the rash of provisional ira bombings in london frightened half to death theyd been at the prospect of letter bombs in the mailbags of explosive devices in the corridors and the underground car park looking for chaps with a confident jargon who seemed to know what they were at ich a multinational colossus offices and factories half way round the world had one small plant outside ballymena county antrim in northern ireland the board of directors had determined that this put the vast conglomerate at risk and was sufficient reason to lure archie carpenter from sixteen hours a day five days a week of plodding with the branch they had popped him into a nice clean airconditioned office with a secretary to write his letters a pension when he was senile and nine thousand a year for his bank account it had seemed like one long holiday no more surveillance on winter evenings no more meetings of the political loonies to drift into no more irish pubs to swill guinness in no more tetchy arabs to stand alongside with a smith and wesson rammed in his belt it had taken him a month to seal chemical house to put a system into operation that reduced the always faint threat to a minimum and after that it had been more than comfortable with little to worry him beyond the occasional pilfering from the typists lockers and the one great drama of the loss of a set of boardroom minutes he didnt complain didnt want it to change he wasnt a small man had a good set of shoulders on him and a stomach to go with it from four years of canteen lunches but they availed him nothing when the herd of wouldbe passengers responded to the loudspeaker announcement and surged for the nominated checkin counter slight little girls bouncing him aside chaps with concave chests pushing him half off his feet never seen anything like it wait a minute excuse me wont you you dont have to push like that you know helped him not at all archie carpenters anger rose the tired flush driving up his cheeks and he thrust with the best of them and was almost ashamed at his progress the gaps opened for his sharp driving kneecaps and the heave of his elbows and there were pained stares bit heavy perhaps but i didnt start it darling did i so dont curl your bloody lip and flick your fingers a little victory it had been and one worth winning if there wasnt anything else about to compete for ticket and boarding card in his hand step a little lighter archie carpenter headed for the security gates dividing the concourse from the departure lounges his face twisted in distaste at the sight of the polizia slacks that looked as if theyd been sat in for a week dowdy pointed shoes and those bloody great machinepistols what were they going to do with them in a crowded space like an airport lounge what was going to happen if they let one of those things off be a massacre a bloody sunday a st valentines day job needed marksmen didnt they chaps whod be selective not wallpaper merchants first impressions archie and theyre the worst fair enough sunshine but if thats the mob that has to bust out harrison then draw the curtain and forget it hed carried a gun a dozen times in eight years with the branch always under a jacket and it hurt him professionally to see these kids with their hardware lolling against their chests with no moon and a heavy darkness round them the alitalia dc lifted off hours late theyd be into rome and then all the joke of the money change queue and finding whether hed been met and if the hotel had a booking stop bloody moaning archie off on your holidays arent you remember what the wife said her mum had brought back from viareggio some nice leather purses be good for christmas presents for the family mustnt forget to bring something like that im not going for my health for a saunter round darling but youll have some time off not for a shopping spree well what are you going for havent time to tell you now darling but its all a bit messy and the planes leaving five minutes ago and he hadnt any clean underwear hed rung off gently put down the telephone in the chemical house hallway would have shaken the poor old sweetheart werent many fellows in churchill avenue motspur park who charged off abroad without so much as a toothbrush to hold on to all a bit messy archie carpenter no drinks on the flight cockpit crew strike ended cabin crew strike continuing the managing director had been explicit enough theyd pay up and pay quickly head office didnt want it lingering the locals would set it up and he was there to oversee the arrangements and report back going to cause a bit of pain paying out that sort of cash surprised him really that theyd made up their minds so fast and hadnt thought of brazening it out fifty minutes of sitting cramped in his seat and nothing to read but personnels photostat file on geoffrey harrison with a six digit number stamped on the outside in the file was a blownup passport photograph of the man dated eighteen months earlier he looked to be a reasonable enough chap pleasant nondescript sort of face the sort people always had problems describing afterwards but then archie carpenter thought thats what he probably is pleasant and nondescript why should he be anything else they had stripped the hood from him before he was brought from the van affording a vast relief at the freedom from the musk of the material that had strained and scratched at his throat the plaster too had been pulled away from his mouth just as they had done hours earlier when they had fed him the tape around his legs had been loosened and the blood flowed quick and tingling to his feet all that geoffrey harrison had seen of his new prison had been from the beam of the torch that one of the masked men had carried as they pushed him along a way between small stones and across sundried earth until they had come after a few metres to the shadowed outline of a farmers shed the beam had played vaguely on a small sturdy building where the mortar was crumbling from between the roughhewn stones and replaced by dangling grass weed windowless and with twin doors at each end and a shallow sloping corrugated tin roof they had hurried him through the door and the light had discovered a ladder set against piled hay bales no words from his captors only the instruction of the jabbed fist that he should climb and immediately he started to move there was the weight and shudder of another man on the rungs below him steadying and supporting because his hands were still fastened at his back between the roof and the upper level of the hay bed was a space some four feet in height the man in the darkness behind shoved harrison forward with a lurch and he crawled ahead along the noisy shifting floor of bales then there was a hand at his shoulder to halt him his wrist was taken in a vice grip one ring of the handcuffs was unlocked he looked upwards as the man worked in haste by torchlight his hand that was still held was jerked high and the ratchet action of the handcuff closed on a steel chain that hung from a beam to which the roofing iron was nailed a chain of the width and strength to subdue a farmyard alsatian dog geoffrey harrison had been brought to the safe house he had been hidden in a distant barn long disused for anything except the storage of winter fodder for cattle the barn lay a hundred metres off a dirt track that in turn was a tributary of the highbanked tarmac road a kilometre away that linked the town of palmi with the village of castellace in the pimpled foothills of the aspromonte through the day and the greater part of the night the van had travelled more than nine hundred kilometres to the northeast of the barn was the village of san martino to the southeast the village of castellace to the northwest were melicucca and san procopio to the southwest the community of cosoleto from the rooftop of the barn it would have been possible to identify the separated lights of the villages bandaged tightly by the darkness lonely and glowing places of habitation this was the country of lightly rolling rockstrewn hills decorated with the cover of olive groves the territory of shepherds who minded small sheep flocks and herds of goats and who carried shotguns and shunned the company of strangers these were the wild hill lands of calabria that claimed a fierce independence the highest crime rate per capita in the republic the lowest incidence of arrest a primitive feudal batteneddown society the low voices of two men were harrisons company as he lay on the bales the talk of men who are well known to each other and who speak merely because they have time on their hands and long hours to pass as a formality he ran his left hand over the handcuff then tested with his fingers the route of the chain over the bar and groped without hope at the padlock that held it there no possibility of movement no prospect of loosening either his wrist or the chain attachment but it had been a cursory examination that of a man numbed with exhaustion who had burned deep into the core of his emotion on the warm softness of the hay he was soon asleep curled on his side with his knees pressed up against his chest his mind closed to all around him permitting neither dream nor nightmare he found a peace stirring hardly at all his breathing calm and regular the clashes spread far through the centro storico of the capital city under cover of darkness the gangs of young people small and coordinated smashed a trail of broken shop windows and burnedout cars the night air echoed with the crack of molotovs on the cobbles the howl of police sirens and the reports of carabinieri rifles that threw gas shells into the narrow streets a night full of the noise of street battle and the cries of death to the fascists death to the assassins of panicucci and freedom for tantardini twentynine arrests five polizia injured eleven shops damaged and eighteen cars and the name of franca tantardini had been heard and would be seen when morning came to the city written large on the walls in dripping paint his guests gone the dinner table of the executive suite in ich house cleared sir david adams retreated to his office in midweek he frequently worked late his justification for prohibiting business interference during weekends at his country retreat the principal officers of the company had learned to expect his staccato tones on the telephone at any hour before he cleared his desk and walked across to his barbican flat for the trifle of sleep that he needed his target this evening was his personnel director who took the call on a bedside extension line the conversation was typically to the point the man we sent to rome he got away all right yes sir david i checked with alitalia he was diverted to milan but he managed an onward to rome have you called harrisons wife couldnt get through i tried before i left the office but this fellow carpenter will do that hell be in touch with her first thing in the morning hows harrison going to stand up to all this the man from the embassy who called me was pretty blunt in his scenario ive been through harrisons file sir david doesnt tell us much hes a damn good record with the company well thats obvious for him to have had the posting hes a figures man i know all that whats he going to be like under this sort of pressure hows he going to take it hes fine under business pressure the personnel director heard a sigh of annoyance whistle at his ear is he an outdoor type does he have any outdoor hobbies listed on his file not really sir david he listed reading there was a snort on the line you know what that means that he comes home switches on television drinks three gins and gets to his bed and his sleep a man who offers reading as a hobby is a recreational eunuch in my book what are you implying that the poor blighter is totally unfitted for the hoop hes going to be put through ill see you in the morning sir david adams rang off in a restaurant in the northern outskirts of rome secure and far from the running street fight giuseppe carboni shuffled his ample wife around the cleared dance floor the tables and chairs had been pushed back against the walls to make space for the entertainment a gypsy fiddler a young man with a bright accordion and his father with a guitar provided the music for the assortment of guests it was a gathering of friends an annual occasion and one valued by carboni the kidnapping of geoffrey harrison provided no reason for him to stay away from the evening of fancy dress enjoyment he had come dressed as a ghost his wife and her sewingmachine concocting from an old white sheet and a pillowslip with eye slits the costume that had caused loud acclamation on his entry she was robed in the costume of a sardinian peasant girl they had eaten well and drunk deep of the friuli wine and the night would serve as a brief escape from the dreary piling of reports on his desk at the questura and there was advantage for carboni in such company an undersecretary of the ministry of the interior in a mouses habit with tail hanging from his rump was dancing close to his shoulder across the floor a deputy of the democrazia cristiana and one spoken of as ambitious and wellconnected clutched at the hips of a girl both blonde and beautiful and attired solely in a toga created from the stars and stripes good company for carboni to be keeping and what good would be achieved sitting in his flat with an ear cocked for the telephone it was too early in the harrison matter for intervention always it was easier to work when the money had been paid when there were not tearful wives and stonefaced legal men complaining in high places that the life of their dear one and their client was being endangered by police investigation he bobbed his head at the undersecretary smirked beneath his pillowcase at the deputy and propelled his wife forward there were few enough of these evenings when he was safe from disturbance and aggravation he bowed to the man in property who wore the fading theatrical uniform of a napoleonic dragoon and who was said to be a holiday companion at the villa of the president of the council of ministers diamonds catching brightly in the guttering candlelight the crisp cackle of laughter the sweet ring of the violin chords movement and life and pleasure and the whitecoated waiters weaved among the guests dispensing brandy tumblers and glasses of sambucca and amaro the man in property was beside him more smiles and a hand released from his wifes waist so that carboni could greet the interloper please forgive me signora carboni please excuse me may i take your husband for a moment he dances badly she tinkled the man in property kissed her hand laughed with her it is the cross of marrying a policeman always there is someone to take him aside and whisper in his ear my extreme apologies for the interruption you have the gratitude of my feet the ghost and the dragoon huddled together in a corner far from earshot achieving among the sounds of talk and music a certain privacy dottore carboni first my apologies for nothing you are busy at this time with the new plague the blight over us all you are involved in enquiries into the kidnappings it is the principal aspect of our work though less intense here than in the north and always the problem is to find the major figures am i right they are the hard ones they protect themselveswell they cover their activities with care perhaps it is nothing perhaps it is not my business i t was how they all began when they wished to pour poison in a policemans ear but something has been brought to my attention it has come from the legal section of my firm we have some bright young men there and it was something that aroused their interest and that involved a competitor that was predictable too thought carboni but the man must be heard out if it were not to reach the head of government that a policeman had not reacted to the advice of a friend a year ago i was in competition for a site for chalets on the golfo di policastro near to sapri and the man against me was called mazzotti antonio mazzotti around two hundred millions were needed to settle the matter and mazzotti outbid me he took the site i took my money elsewhere but then mazzotti could not fulfil his commitments it was said he could not raise the capital that he was overextended and i am assured he sold at a loss it is a difficult game property dottore many burn their fingers we thought nothing more of him another amateur then two weeks ago i was in competition for a place to the south of sapri at the marina de maratea there was another location where it was possible to build some chalets but my money was insufficient then yesterday my boys in the legal section told me that the purchaser was mazzotti well it is possible in business to make a fast recovery but he paid in bank draft the greater proportion of the sum from an outside bank outside italy the money has run back sharply to the hands of this mazzotti i set my people to find out more and they tell me this afternoon that he is from the village of cosoleto in calabria he is from the bandit land i ask myself is there anything wrong with a man from the hills having brains and working hard and advancing himself nothing i tell myself nothing but it was in foreign draft that he paid dottore that you will agree is not usual it is not usual carboni agreed he hoped the man had finished wished only to get back to the music and i would have thought it a matter for the guardia di finanze if there have been irregularities of transfer you do not follow me i do not care where the fellow salts his money i am interested in where he acquires it and how its source springs up so quickly you are very kind to have taken so much trouble i have told no one else of my detective work a light laugh in the morning i will make some enquiries but you understand i have a great preoccupation with the kidnapping of the englishman i would not wish my name to be mentioned in this matter you have my word said carboni and was gone to the side of his wife something or nothing and time in the morning to run a check on antonio mazzotti time in the morning to discover whether there were grounds for suspicion or whether a disgruntled businessman was using the influence of the network of privilege to hinder an opponent who had twice outwitted him giuseppe carboni scooped the pillowslip over his head and downed a cooled glass of stock brandy wiped his face dropped again his disguise and resumed with his wife a circuit of the dance floor when they reached the secondfloor room puffing because they came by the turning staircase as there was no lift in a pensione such as this giancarlo stood back witnessing the drunken effort of claudio to fit the room key to the door lock they had taken a room in a small and private place between the piazza vittorio emanuele and the piazza dante with a barren front hall and a chipped reception desk that carried signs demanding prepayment of money and the decree that rooms could not be rented by the hour the portiere asked no questions explained that the room must be vacated by noon pocketed the eight thousand lire handed him by claudio and presumed them to be from the growing homosexual clan on the landing waiting behind the fumbling claudio giancarlo looked down at his sodden jeans dark and stained below the knees and his canvas shoes that oozed the wine he had poured away under the table in the pizzeria he had eaten hugely drunk next to nothing was now sobered and alert and ready for the confrontation that he had chosen the calabrian needed a full minute interspersed with oaths to unfasten the door and reveal the room it was bare and functional a wooden table with chair a wooden singledoor wardrobe a thinframed print of old rome two single beds separated by a low table on which rested a closed bible and a small lamp claudio pitched forward as if it were immaterial to him that the door was still open and began pulling with a ferocious clumsiness at his clothes dragging them from his back and arms and legs before sinking heavily in his underpants on to the grey bedspread giancarlo extracted the key from the outside lock closed the door behind him and then locked it again before pocketing the key cold and detached no longer running no longer in flight giancarlo looked down with contempt at the sprawled figure on the bed ranged his eyes over the hairencased legs the stomach of rolled fat and on up to the opened mouth that sucked hard for air he stood for a long time to be certain in his mind that the building was at peace and the other residents asleep an animal he seemed to giancarlo an illiterate animal the pig had called his franca a whore the pig would suffer with a deliberation he had not owned before as if sudden age and manhood had fallen to him he reached under his shirt tail and pulled the p from his belt on the balls of his feet and keeping his silence he moved across the linoleum and stopped two metres from the bed close enough to claudio and beyond the reach of his arms claudio can you hear me a strained whisper in response only the convulsed breathing claudio i want to talk to you a bellydeep grunted protest of irritation claudio you must wake up i have questions for you pig a little louder now insufficient to turn the face of claudio enough to annoy and to cause him to wriggle his shoulders in anger as if trying to rid himself of the presence of a flea claudio wake yourself the eyes opened and were wide and staring and confused because close to them was the outstretched hand that held the pistol and the message in the boys gaze was clear even through the mist of station beer and pizzeria wine claudio you should know that you are very close to death i am near to killing you there as you lie on your back you save yourself only if you tell me what i want to know you understand claudio the voice droned at the dulled mind of the prostrate man dripping its message spoken by a parent who has an ultimatum on behaviour to deliver to a child the bedsprings whined as the bulk of the man began to shift and stir moving backwards towards the head rest creating distance from the pistol giancarlo watched him trying for focus and comprehension substituting the vague dream for the reality of the p and the slight figure that held it the boy pressed on dominating sensing the moment was right there is nowhere to go no one to save you i will kill you claudio if you do not tell me what i ask you kill you so that the blood runs from you the boy felt detached from his words separated from the sounds that his ears could hear no word from the pig it is the p claudio the weapon of the fighters of the nap it is loaded and i have only to draw back the trigger only to do that and you are dead and rotting and flyinfested am i clear claudio the boy could not recognize himself could not recognize the strength of his grip upon the gun it is the p many have died by this gun there would be no hesitation not in sending a calabrian pig to his earth hole what do you want i want an answer dont play with me boy if i want to play with you claudio then i will do so if i want to tease you then i will if i want to hurt you then you cannot protect yourself you have nothing but the information that i want from you give it me and you live it is that or the p the boy watched the man strain in the night stillness for a vibration of life from the building ears cocked for something that might give him hope of rescue and saw the dumb collapse at the realization that the pensione slept cloaked in night the big body crumbled back flat on to the bed as if defeated and the coiled springs tolled under the mattress what do you want he is ready thought giancarlo as ready as he will ever be i want to know where the man is hidden that was taken this morning the message came in a flurry as a transitory shower of snow falls on the high places of the apennines quick and brisk and blanketing if you want to live claudio you must tell me where to find him easier now for claudio easier because there was something that he could bite at half a smile on his face because the drink was still with him and he lacked the control to hide the first frail amusement how would i know that you will know it because if you do not you will die i am not told such things then you are dead claudio dead because you are stupid dead because you did not know from the toes of his feet moving with the swaying speed of the snake giancarlo rocked forward never losing the balance that was perfect and symmetrical his right arm lunged blurred in its aggression till the foresight of the gun was against the mans ear momentarily it rested there then raked back across the feardriven quivering face and the sharp needle of the sight gouged a ribbon welt through the jungle of bristle and hair claudio snatched at the gun and grasped only at the air and was late and defeated while the blood welled and spilled from the road hewn across his cheek do not die from stupidity and idiocy claudio do not die because you failed to understand that i am no longer the child who was protected in the queen of heaven tell me where they took the man tell me the demand for an answer harsh and compelling winning through the exhaustion and the drink abetted by the blood trickle beneath the mans hand they do not tell me such things inadequate claudio to save yourself i dont know in gods name i dont know giancarlo saw the struggle for survival the two extremes of the pendulum if he spoke now the immediate risk to the pigs life would be removed to be replaced in the fullness of time by the threat of the retribution that the organization would bring down on his dulled head should betrayal be his temporary salvation the boy sensed the conflict the alternating fortunes of the two armies waging war in the mans mind then in your ignorance you die noisily because it was not a refined mechanism giancarlo drew back with his thumb the hammer of the pistol it reverberated around the room a sound that was sinister irretrievable claudio was half up on the bed pushed from his elbows his hand flown from the wound eyes saucerlarge and peering into the dimness perspiration in bright rivers on his forehead dismal and pathetic and beaten his attention committed to the rigid unmoving barrel aimed at the centre of his ribcage they will have taken him to the mezzo giorno claudio whispered his response the man who is behind the velvet curtain of the confessional and who has much to tell the father and is afraid lest any other should hear his words the mezzo giorno is half the country where in the south has he gone giancarlo pickaxed into the strata of the man domineering holding in his cage the trapped rat and offering it as yet no escape they will have gone to the aspromonte the aspromonte stretch a hundred kilometres across calabria what will you have me do walk the length of them and shout and call and search in each farmhouse each barn each cave you do not satisfy me claudio spoken with the chill and deep cold of the ice on the hills in winter we are a family in the aspromonte there are many of us some do one part of it others take different work in the business they sent me to rome to take him there was a cousin and a nephew of the cousin that were to drive him to the aspromonte where he would be held there is another who will guard h i m where will they guard him the gun hammer arched inched closer to claudios head gods truth on the soul of the virgin i do not know where they will hold him the boy saw the despair written boldly sensed that he was prising open the area of truth who is the man that will guard him the first minimal trace of kindness in the boys voice he is the brother of my wife he is alberto sammartino where does he live on the acquaro road and near to cosoleto i do not know those names it is the big road that comes into the mountains from sinopli and that runs on towards delianuova between acquaro and cosoleto is one kilometre there is an olive orchard on the left side about four hundred metres from cosoleto where the road begins to climb to the village you will see the house set back from the road there are many dogs there and some sheep once the house was white his car is yellow an alfa if you go there you will find him and he will be guarding the englishman that was what had been arranged perhaps you try only to trick me on the virgin i swear it you are a pig claudio a snivelling coward pig you swear on the virgin and you betray the family of your wife and you tell all to a boy in the nap we would die rather than leave our friends what will you do with me now a whipped dog one that does not know whether its punishment is completed whether it is still possible to regain affection on a lower floor a lavatory flushed i will tie you up and i will leave you here the automatic response turn over to your face on the pillow your hands behind your back giancarlo watched the man curl himself to his stomach in his vision for a moment was the shamed grin of selfpreservation on claudios face because he had won through with nothing more than a scratch across his cheek gone then lost in the pillow and its grease coat when the man was still giancarlo moved quickly forward poised himself stiffened his muscles he swung down the handle of the pistol with all his resources of strength on to the sundarkened balding patch at the apex of claudios skull one desperate rearing convulsion that caused the boy to adjust his aim the breaking of eggs the shrieking of the bedsprings and the tremor of breathing that has lost its pattern and will fade giancarlo stepped back an aching silence encircled him as he listened not the creak of a floorboard not the pressure of a foot on a staircase step all in their beds and tangled with their whores and boys blood on the wall behind the bed spattered as if the molecules had parted on an explosive impact was running from drops in downward lines across the painted plaster and above their furthest orbit untainted was the smiling and restful face of the madonna in her plastic frame with the cherubic child the boy did not look at claudio again he cleared the hip pocket from the strewn trousers on the floor and went on tiptoe to the door he turned the key carried outside with him the non disturbare sign attached it to the outer door handle locked the door again and slipped away down the stairs to the portiere he saidthat his friend would sleep late that he himself was taking an early coach to milano the man nodded scarce aroused from his dozing sleep at the desk far into the night and with little traffic to impede him as he crossed the streets the wraith giancarlo battestini headed for the termini chapter eight what in christs name am i doing here the first thoughts of archie carpenter he was naked under a sheet illuminated by the light that pierced the plastic blind slats he flailed his arms at the hanging cloud of cigarette smoke spat out the reek of brandy from the glasses that littered the dressingtable and windowsill archie carpenter sat up in bed putting his memory together slotting the evidence into place half the bloody night hed spent with the men from ich all the way from the airport in the limousine hed listened and theyd talked hed asked and theyd briefed convincing the big man from chemical house of their competence thats how he saw it theyd taken care of his bags at the hotel with a finger snap and tramped into his room rung down for a bottle of cognac and kept up the barrage till past three hed slept less than four hours and he had to show for it a headache and the clear knowledge that the intervention of archie carpenter had no chance of affecting geoffrey harrisons problems he climbed out of bed and felt the weakness in his legs and the mindbending pain behind his temples half midnight at the latest they wound things up in motspur park had to didnt they with babysitters at a pound an hour there wasnt much time after the icecream and fruit salad to sit on your arse and chat about the rate of income tax and the brandy didnt flow not out there in the suburbs not at seven pounds a bottle a quick splash after coffee and the mums and dads were on their way not that the carpenters had kids thats another trial archie not for now old sunshine hed need a shower to flush it out of him beside his bed under a filled ashtray was his diary he thumbed through for the number the managing director had given him a chap called charlesworth from the embassy and said to be helpful he dialled listened to the telephone ringing out took a time to answer what youd expect at this time in the morning pronto charlesworth my names carpenter archie carpenter of ich im the companys security director since when had he had a title like that but it sounded right just sort of slipped out like a palmed visiting card theyve asked me to come out here and see whats going on with this fellow harrison i mean its nice of you to ring but im a bit out of touch since yesterday evening they said in london youd put yourself out in this business i was asked to pass on the thanks of the company thats very kind of you it was nothing they thought it was i have to go out to this eur place wherever that is and i have to visit harrisons missus so id like to meet you before that first thing carpenter was aware of a hesitation on the line a natural request but it had sparked prevarication i dont think theres very much that i can tell you id like to hear views other than from the company people theyre italians every last one of them id like your views there really isnt much that i can tell you not in the line of duty carpenter clipped in cold awake the brandy disgorged i double between political and security security doesnt warrant a great deal of time and the desk is pretty loaded with the political stuff at the moment my plates more than full so is harrisons a flare of anger from carpenter what was the bloody fool at hes british isnt he entitled to a bit of help from the embassy he is came the cautious reply but theres debate in the shop about how much help youve lost me im sorry then carpenter closed his eyes grimaced begin again archie boy start all over again mr charlesworth lets not waste each others time im not a moron and ive kidnapping coming out of my ears after last night with the locals i know its not straightforward i understand the threat that exists that harrisons on the edge i know its not just a matter of sitting in the front parlour and waiting for the shareholders to cough up so harrison can come back and kiss his sweet wife hello i know the risks for harrison they told me about ambrosio shot because a mask slipped and he saw his captors i heard how they chopped michelangelo ambrosio they told me about de capua now on to the other side of things i did eight years in special branch before i moved to ich my rank at scotland yard was chief inspector this isnt the time for a need to know show a laugh on the line thanks for the speech mr carpenter whats the problem then i wouldnt want what i say repeated ive signed the bloody official secrets act mr charlesworth just like you have its a tedious matter of keeping our hands clean theoretically its a criminal offence to pay ransom money and it would be damaging to us if we could be linked with such a felony in the ambassadors view this is a private matter between ich and a gang of italian criminals he doesnt want us to be seen to be condoning the extortion of money and he feels that any public involvement could give the impression that were bending the knee to criminal action if harrison worked for whitehall we wouldnt be paying its as simple as that and a chat in your office thats involvement in the ambassadors eyes thats bloody ridiculous carpenter barked into the telephone i agree particularly in a country where ransom payment is the normal way of extrication if youre that well briefed youll have heard of a man called pommarici in milano hes a prosecutor and has tried to freeze kidnap victims assets to prevent payment he l o s t the families said he was endangering the lives of their loved ones it all went back to the jungle so what it adds up to is that the embassy has no role to play off the record we can help but not if its visible do you read me carpenter slopped back on to his bed i read you mr charlesworth give me a ring this afternoon well have an early bite in town id like that carpenter said and rang off poor bloody harrison but how inconsiderate of him to get himself kidnapped and embarrass hmg not a very good show my old love the wooden shutters bent and paintpeeled but still capable of restricting light stayed late across the upper window of the narrow terraced home of vanni the driver the noises made by children and cars in the cobbled street behind the main road through cosoleto merely lulled the man as he lay in the drowsy pleasure of his bed it had been close to midnight when he had returned to his home and there was the radiance in his worn face to tell his wife that the journey had been profitable she had not asked what the work had been what the danger what the stake but had busied herself first in the kitchen then against the muscles of his stomach in the great bed that had been her mothers and when he had slept she had slid from the sheets and looked with a glowing excitement at the hard roll of banknotes before replacing them in the hip pocket of the trousers thrown with abandon on a chair a good man he was to her and a kind man while she worked in the kitchen beneath vanni was content to idle the early morning hours not time yet for him to dress throw on a freshly ironed shirt put a sheen on his shoes and drive his car into palmi for a coffee and a talk with mario who would make a similar journey if ever he woke she was an animal marios woman consumed in the brute passion of the sicilians a coffee with mario if he had satisfied his woman if he had the sap to leave his bed and when claudio had returned on the morning rapido then perhaps they all would be summoned to the villa of the capo to take a glass of campari and talk of the olive trees the goat herds and the death of an old man of the village they would not speak of anything that was immediate and close to them but they would smile at their mutual knowledge and each in his own way reflect a peculiar glory at least another hour vanni could keep to his bed at criminalpol where the rome police forensic effort is mounted the first particles of evidence were being gathered in the scientific analysis section brought from the central telephone exchange were recordings of all calls received by ich in eur and of those directed to the private number of the harrisons one of the most farreaching advances in the hunt for the kidnappers had been the development of a voice bank programmed for the computer to match similarities the same man the electronics decided who had called ich with the ransom demand had also made the abortive call to mrs harrison nothing particular in that the stir of interest among the technicians came when they fed to the brain scores of recordings made from previous interceptions and sought a similarity with their latest material on the readout screens the file on the marchetti case was flashed eight and a half months earlier a fouryearold boy taken from a foreign national nanny in the aventino district of rome no arrests no clues left on site a ransom payment of million paid marked notes no sign of ransom money the marchetti communication and the calls on the harrison case had been made by the same man vocal interpretation located an accent from the extreme south the night work of machines the recordings were sent by line to the questura to await the arrival of giuseppe carboni the agente di custodie hurried from the prison officers mess to the main gate of the asinara gaol he had not eaten the breakfast provided for the men coming off night shift after they had supervised the first feeding of the prisoners the weight of the message that he must telephone to the contact number bore down on him spiriting up the fear waves of nausea his recruitment as a pigeon for the leading members of the nap held on asinara when they wished to communicate with the outside world had been a longdrawnout affair as a badger will sniff and dig for choice roots so members of the group at liberty had discovered the turmoil that the agente and his family lived with as they devoted themselves to the care of their ailing spina bifida baby reports had come back of crippling doctors bills in the town of sassari on the sardinian mainland to the south of the prison bland there had been word of the inability of the father to pay for visits to roma or milano for consultation with specialists the agente had been ripe for plucking there was money for his wife used notes in envelopes he was no longer in debt and muttered instead and without conviction to the medical men of the help of a distant relative not that the child could improve only that the conscience of the parents might be easier the numbers that he must telephone changed frequently and the cryptic messages that he must pass on became a deluge on asinara is the maximum security cage of the italian forces of justice escape deemed impossible it is the restingplace of the most dedicated of the male urban guerrilla community the receptacle for those found guilty of armed insurrection against the state originally a prison colony then a gaol for the liberal few who opposed mussolinis fascism the gaol drifted into disrepair before the refurbishment that was necessary for the incarceration of the new enemy the renovation had been from the drawingboard of the magistrate riccardo palma he had done his work well and died for it but through the agente the words of the chief of staff of the nap could pass beyond the locked cell doors along the watched corridors with their high closedcircuit cameras through the puny exercise yards piercing the lattice of the electrically controlled double gates and their dynamiteproof bars the message had been given to the agente as he lined the prisoners in a queue for their food slipped into his hand drowned in the sweat sea of his palm beyond the gates and heading for his home the free house of the prison service where only anxiety and pain awaited him he had read the message on the scrap of sharply torn paper per la tantardini rappresaglia numero quattro for tantardini reprisal number four the agente held in the clutch of compromise walked in a tortured daze that vanished as the pale broken face of his wife greeted his arrival at the front door his child was dying his wife was failing and who cared who helped he kissed her perfunctorily went to their room to change out of uniform and then looked in silence through the halfopen door at the child asleep in her cot in his own clothes and without explanation he strode down into the hamlet to telephone to the number he had been given at porto torres across the narrow channel on sardinia within one day perhaps two he would witness on the little black and white television screen in the corner of the livingroom the results of his courier work the swollen pressure of his bladder finally awoke geoffrey harrison he stretched himself jerking at the handcuff wrenching at his wrist aware immediately of the inhibitions of his sleptin clothes still the suit that he had dressed in for the drive to the office still with the tie at his neck and only the top button undone as a concession to the circumstances the sun had not yet played on the roof of the barn and he was cold shivering his socks smelt pervading the limited space between the rafters and the bales the nylon ones that he always wore in the summer and that he changed when he came home in the early evening didnt speak the language did he had never taken a berlitz he could only order a meal and greet his office colleagues at the start of the day so what to shout to the men in the other half of the barn he wanted to urinate wanted to squat and relieve himself and didnt know how to say it basic human function basic human language he couldnt mess his trousers that was revulsion and so from necessity came the shout couldnt have an accident hey down there come here in english as if because of his urgency they would understand him theyll come geoffrey theyll want to know why the prisoner shouts come here he heard the sudden movement and the voices of two men that were closer a creaking from the swing of the barn door that was hidden from him by the bales and the laddertop slid into position and shook from a mans weight a gun first black and ugly held in a firm grip and following it the contortion of a hood with eye slits eerie and awful in the half light before it gave way to the recognizable shape of shoulders and a mans trunk the gesture of the gun was unmistakable he obeyed the order of the waved barrel and stumbled back as far as the chain would allow he pointed down to his zip then across with his free hand to his buttocks a grotesque mime and the hooded head shook and was gone lost below the lip of the hay there were noisy chuckles from below and then a farm bucket arched up from an unseen hand old and rusted and once of galvanized steel a folded wad of newspaper pages followed he was left to a slight privacy as he pulled the bucket towards him turned his back on the ladder and fingered at his belt humiliated and hurt one arm aloft and fastened he contorted his body over the bucket he speeded his functions willing his bladder and bowels to be emptied before the slitted eyes returned to laugh at his dropped pants and his bared thighs and genitals how half the world does it geoffrey so get used to it dont think i can bloody well take it not every day not like this god what a bloody stink the sandwich all stink and wind remember the sandwich back sometime yesterday that the men in the van gave you the curse in the guts he groped down for the paper damp with the morning dew must have been outside through the night and it tore soggily in his hands he wanted to cry wanted to weep and be pitied harrison cleaned himself as best he could tears smarting pulled at his underwear and trousers zipped himself and fastened the belt ive finished you can come and take it movement and repetition the ladder moved as before and the gun and the hood reappeared he pointed to the bucket ive used it you can take it away just a belly laugh from the covered face and a jumping in merriment of the shoulders and the hood sinking and going and the muffled call of fun and entertainment a bloody great joke geoffrey do you see it do you see why hes splitting himself you asked for the bucket theyve given it to you given it for keeps theyve given you a little present its going to sit there a couple of yards away stinking and rotten and foul own pee own shit own waste youve given them a bloody good laugh come here come back all the command that he could summon the tone of an order unmistakable and enough to arrest the disappearance of the hood the laugh was cut come here the head came upwards revealed again the shoulders geoffrey harrison leaned back on his left foot then swung himself forward as far as the chain permitted he drove his right instep against the bucket saw it rise and explode career against the shoulder of the man spill its load across his mask and faded cotton shirt stained dripping and spread you can have it back harrison giggled you can have it again now what in gods name did you do that for dont know just sort of happened theyll bloody murder you geoffrey harrison theyll half tear you apart for that its what theyre for those bastards to be crapped and peed on right dead right when youve a bloody army at your back youre an idiot geoffrey harrison i dont know why i did it you wont do it again they came together for him the other man leading the one with the smears on his shirt and hood a rung on the ladder behind no words no consultation no verbal reproach nothing but the beat of their fists and the drumming of their boots against his face and chest and the softness of his lower belly and his thighs and shins they worked on him as if he were a suspended punchbag hanging from the beam they spent their strength against him till they panted and gasped from their effort and he was limp and defenceless and no longer capable of even minimal selfprotection vicious angered creatures because the act of defiance was unfamiliar and the bully had risen in them sweet and safe harrison crumpled down on to the hay floor feeling the pain that echoed in his body yearning for release wishing for death the worst was at his ribcage covered now in slow funnels of agony when did you ever do anything like that in your life before geoffrey never before never stood up not to be counted and no bastard here this morning with his calculator no one there to see him to cheer and applaud just some mice under his feet and the stink of his body and the knowledge that there was a man close by who loathed him and would cut off his life with as little ceremony as picking the muck from his nostrils he worked a smile over the pain of his jaw and gazed at the emptied bucket hed tell violet about it tell her it blow by blow not what they did to him afterwards but up till then and his foot still ached he struggled upright knees shaking stomach in torment youre animals he shouted slobbering miserable swine fit to shovel shit you know that the scream wobbled under the low cut of the rafters get down in your shit and wash yourselves you pigs rub your faces in it because thats what makes pigs happy pig shit pig thick and then he listened braced for a new onslaught and heard the murmur of their voices they took no notice of him ignored him he knew that he could shout till he lifted the roof and that they had no fear of it he was separated from every civilization that he knew of without hunger without thirst numbed by the annihilation of the big calabresi giancarlo sat on a bench in the termini waiting the hours away close to exhaustion near to drifting to fitful sleep hands masking his face elbows digging at his legs he thought of franca there had been girls in pescara the daughters of the friends of father and mother flowing skirts starched blouses and knee boots and the clucking approval of mother as she brought the cream cakes out the ones that giggled and knew nothing existed with emptied minds crucifixes of gold at their necks and anger in their mouths if he reached for buttons or zips or eyefasteners there had been girls at the university brighter and more adult stars who regarded him as an adolescent there he was someone who could make up the numbers for the cinema or the beach but who was shunned when it was dark when the clinching began the spots the acne and the titter behind the hand it should have been different with the autonomia but the girls would not grovel for a novice for a recruit and giancarlo had to prove himself and win the acclamation far out in the front of the crowd running forward with the fire eating into the rag at the hilt of the milk bottle arcing the molotov into the air the battle for approval and his ankle had turned would they even remember him now the girls of the autonomia giancarlo battestini had no experience other than in the arms between the thighs wrapped warm by franca it was the crucible of his knowledge a long time he thought of her franca with the breasts golden and devoid of the rim of suntan franca with the cherrypip nipples with the flattened belly holed by a single crater franca with the wild forest that had tangled and caught his fingers the one who had chosen him darling darling sweet franca in his ears was the sound of her breathing the beat of her movement on the bed her cry as she had spent herself i am coming franca i am coming to take you from them he whispered to himself i am coming franca believe it know it thinking of franca as the station began to live again to move and function participate in a new day thinking of franca as he walked to the ticket counter and paid the single fare on the rapido to reggio thinking of franca as he climbed up to a firstclass carriage away from the herd of neapolitans and sicilians with their bundles and salads and children and hallucinating noises of discussion and counterdiscussion no other passengers in the compartment thinking of franca as the train pulled away from the low platform and crawled between the sidings and junctions and high flats draped in the days first washing the boy slumped back slid his heels on to the seat in front and felt the pressure power of the p against his back out across the flatlands to the south of the city carving through the grass fields and the closepacked vineyards skirting the small towns of cisterna di latina and sezze away on the hills and terracina at the coast the train quickened its pace blurring the telegraph poles homing and seeking out the dustdry mountains and the bright skies of the aspromonte believe in me franca believe in me because i am coming the boy spoke aloud above the crash of wheels on the welded track tomorrow they will know of me tomorrow they will know my name tomorrow you will be proud of your little fox chapter nine at the questura there were barely disguised smiles from the uniformed men who watched dottore giuseppe carboni disgorged from his car the evidence of the night before was plain and clearcut bulldog bagged eyes blotched cheeks a razornicked chin a tie not hoisted he swept uneasily through the door searching straight ahead of him as if wary of impediments and took the lift instead of risking the flight of stairs carboni had greetings for none of those who saluted and welcomed him along the secondfloor passage ignoring them all he was thankful to make the haven of his desk without public humiliation they would think he had been drinking all night would not i t t know as they whispered and clucked in disapproval that he had left the party before two and back at his flat had collapsed in a chair with a tumbler of whisky that he might better search his memory for patterns and procedures in his latest kidnap burden never time for thought for analysis once he was at work with the telephone ringing and the stream of visitors humble and distinguished and a tumbler had become two and merged into half a bottle as he had picked into the recesses of the problem before him he had stayed up till his wife magnificent in her flowing nightdress had dragged him to her bed and little enough chance of sleep then he sat heavily in his chair and buzzed the connecting speaker for his aide a moment and the man was there sleek and oiled and ready with an armful of files battered brown folders encasing a hillock of typed paperwork what did the dottore intend the priority of the day to be carboni winced the stab of pain ringing in his head the harrison case there is nothing else we have the tapings of the calls to mrs harrison and to ch the one to harrisons wife was futile she couldnt understand what she was being told and rang off there was a sneer at the mouth of carbonis assistant the first tangible steps towards extortion were made in a message to his company also from criminalpol there is voice analysis they believe there is similarity here with the communication at the marchetti kidnapping the child just the one message to the company a single message the establishment of lines of approach leave me with the tapes said carboni eyes closed head spinning wishing deliverance from intelligent and confident young men when he was alone he played the cassette many times hands over his face shutting out the noise through the open windows of the traffic below concentrating his effort on the brief and staccato message a callow rasping voice he heard and the policeman did not need the help of the memorandum that was attached to the package to know that this voice came from the toe of the country from calabria from the land of the mafiosi chieftains where else a humble inarticulate voice reading a message that had been written for him which was normal then there was the tape of the first call to the marchetti family to be heard a match it didnt take a computer to tell him that time now for work on the telephone he mopped at his neck with his handkerchief half an hour in his office and his shirt was soaked calls to his subordinates drew blank no further eyewitnesses had been produced since he had left for home the previous evening there was nothing to feed into the machines beyond the very basics of description supplied by the single woman on collina fleming bulk and height and generality of clothing no faces no fingerprints no escape car yet traced no information had emerged from the tenuous links with the underworld maintained by the discreeter elements of the antikidnap squad no word and none expected because to inform in these matters was the sure and fast way to a wooden box not for the first time since he had reached his lofty eminence giuseppe carboni pondered the value of his work the servant of a society which stepped back from commitment and involvement the servant neither trusted nor appreciated and struggling for standards that those who lodged even in the higher places renounced lockheed friuli esso italiana belice even the quirinale even the presidency scandals nasty and deceitful and the guilty were from the chief echelons of the great mama italia so who wanted law who wanted order the ache was back at his head the throb of a hungover man wetted with disillusion he could take his pension he could go on his way and the president would hang a medal round his neck and his parting would be unseen unimportant carboni smacked his pudgy hand down on to the desk felt the shockwaves vibrate back up to his elbow enjoyed the affliction there was time for a few more of the great ones to go behind bars time for a few more handcuffs to be wrapped on the wrists of those who at last would show shame as the doors of the regina coeli closed on them abruptly he pressed the intercom button and heard the silked voice of his assistant a man called antonio mazzotti originally from cosoleto in calabria he had slipped away from the priority of the day because he did not know how to harness the energy he wished to exude for harrisons freedom he has an office in rome and deals in property speculation he has made some development deals in the golfo di policastro i want the telephone number of his office just the number and i will call it myself it will be attended to dottore and not this evening not this afternoon carboni growled i want it this morning of course dottore and the firm of harrison rang they would like an archibald carpenter to see you he is the security director of ich head office from london around twelve i could see him i will let the company know and the number of this man mazzotti no delay of course not dottore the voice dripped carboni hated him would have him shifted dottore the news is coming of another kidnapping from parioli i cannot handle it someone else will have to they have taken the nephew of a considerable industrialist i told you i have enough to concern me an industrialist who is generous to the democrazia cristiana with funds carboni sighed in annoyance and resignation get my car to the door and when i am back i want that number on my desk and i want this carpenter here at twelve of course dottore vengefully carboni slapped the intercom button to the off position locked his desk and headed for the corridor far out on the nomentana nuova set among the highrise flats that the planners had dubbed popular shadowed by them was a simple row of garages of precast concrete with swinging warped doors the garages were skirted by waste ground stray dogs and discarded rubbish few were in use as the occupants of the flats found them too far from their front doors and out of sight of their windows and therefore unsafe from the work of thieves and vandals the garages were generally deserted and distant from the motion and life of the flats one was a chosen burrow of an nap cell rented through an intermediary not to house a car but to provide storage and meeting space there were guns here pistols and automatic weapons from the factories of countries with widely disparate political creeds quarry explosives stolen by sympathizers boxes full of car number plates sleepingbags and a camping stove and the roneo machine on which the communiques were run off none of the possessions of the cell would have been visible if the doors had been carelessly opened because time had been lavished on the garage if the dirt on the floor were brushed away the outline of a trap door became apparent they had carved through the cement and underneath had dug out a tomb some two metres wide two and a half metres long and a metre and a half high a narrow plumbing pipe to the surface brought air to them this was the hideaway in times of great danger and this was where three young men sheltered because it was just a day since la tantardini had been taken and they had abandoned their safe house though she was a leader who could say whether she would talk to her interrogators dark and closed the pit provided a lair for the men who breathed the damp and mustladen air there was the son of a banker the son of a landowner the son of a professor of economics at the university of trento above them and muffled through the thickness of the cement came four sharp raps at the closed wooden doors of the garage it was a sign they recognized the signal that a courier had visited them an envelope had been pushed far from sight under the cover of the doorway the message it held dispatched four hours earlier from the island of asinara for tantardini reprisal number four in the pit among the cells papers would be the code sheet that would identify number four the target the young men must reach for they would wait several minutes in the calm of the darkness before levering aside the entrance and crawling upwards to find and read the communication through the morning as the sun rose and blazed with its full force on the tin roof above him they left harrison to himself no food no water and he hadnt the stomach and courage to call for either preferring not to risk another beating he kept his peace chained in the oven space that they had chosen for him there were pains in many parts of his body slow and creeping and twisting at the bruised muscle layers and there was the heat combining with the welts and bruises to empty his mind leave his imagination as an unused void deep in sweat heavy in selfpity slumped on the hay and straw conscious of his own rising smells he ebbed away the hours without hope without anticipation giancarlo was half asleep meandering in the demistate between dream and consciousness relaxed and settled the plan in his mind evaluated and approved small and lone and hungry for the action he had decided upon he was sprawled indifferently between the padded seat back and the hard face of the windows glass the sights beyond the comfort of the speeding train were ignored it would be hot that day in pescara hot and shrouded in a seatop mist and noisy and dusty from the car wheels and the tramping of the thousands who would have come to roast themselves on the thin sand line between promenade and water the shop would be open and his father wheedling the lady customers perhaps his father would know by now would know of his boy perhaps the polizia would have come pained and apologetic because this was a respectable citizen his father would curse him his mother cry in her handkerchief would he shut the shop if the polizia came and announced with due solemnity that little giancarlo was with the nap and living in a covo with a feared terrorist the most dangerous woman in the land and their lad cohabiting they would hate him hate him for what he had done to them and the base rock of their hatred would be their majestic colossal absence of understanding of why he had taken his road stupid pathetic insignificant little crawling fleas giancarlo rolled the words round his tongue grovelling servants in perpetual obeisance to a system that was rotten and outworn cowering behind the facade of phoniness savagely he recalled the wedding of his elder brother hair oil and incense an intoning doddering priest a hotel reception on the sea front that neither the grooms nor the brides father could afford new suits and hair trims for the men new dresses for the ladies and jewellery out from the wall safes an exhibition of waste and deception and giancarlo had left early walked across the evening town and locked himself in his room and lain in the darkness till his father much later hammered at the door and shouted of the offence given to aunts and cousins and friends the boy had despised his father for it despised him for the chastitybelt of conformity governing them was the necessity of normality the mayor must come to the flat each year the bishop to the shop and after mass in april the shining new bmw must be blessed by the priest and a fee given they buckled their knees ran their hands together damp with nervousness when a town hall official visited to safeguard his votes a rotten little creep with his hand in the till and they treated him like christ almighty the relationship was past repair past patching and bandaging the boy mouthed his insults sometimes aloud sometimes without sound working off as an athlete sheds weight in roadwork the relaxed rest that had held him during the early hours of the journey the society of clientilismo who his father knew in business had been to school with was owed a favour by the way towards a job for a growing boy the society of the bustarelle the little envelopes of old banknotes that smoothed and purred their way around the town hall the society of evasione avoidance of commitment to the weak the ethic of selfishness and personal preservation that was their society and he had vowed that the break was final and the adhesive quality of family blood was inadequate to change his determination the train rolled on napoli left behind a boy who had killed and found it no special experience who sometimes smiled and sometimes laughed and who had no companion giancarlo battestini on the rapido to reggio the screams of the cleaning woman carried far down the column of the staircase well the shrieks brought the day porter of the pensione as fast up the steps as his age and infirmity would permit and when he arrived panting at the upper landing the woman was still bent to the door keyhole the clean folded sheets on the floor beneath her feet her bucket in one hand her sweeping broom in the other he had fished the pass key from his pocket opened the door taken a cursory look mouthed a prayer and pushed the woman back from the door he had locked the room again and without explanation scrambled back down the stairs to raise management and authority with sirens and gusto the carabinieri arrived running from the car leaving the winking blue light revolving pacing through the hall in a clatter of heavy boots and pounding on the stairs past the opened rooms of those who had been roused and wondered at the intrusion the barest glance at the battered head and the accompanying bloodstains was sufficient to convince the maresciallo that hope of life and survival had long expired one man he sent to the car to radio for the necessary assistance another he detailed to stand by the door and prevent entry by the gathering crowd on the landing salesmen servicemen on leave and waiting for later trains in the day and the prostitutes who had kept them company during the night by the time the maresciallo had found the dead mans identity card there were more sirens in the air warning all those who heard of further misery the reckoning time for an unfortunate below on the street another gathering few of their faces betraying sympathy the day porter stood among them a man much in demand at this time with the story to tell of what he had seen a blue fiat limousine brought archie carpenter from international chemical holdings through the old battered dignity of central rome to the formidable front archway of the questura like a bloody great museum hed thought more churches per square yard than any place he knew cupolas and domes by the dozen the history the markets the shops the women bloody fantastic the whole place oozing chic steady class hed felt dirty and sophisticated filthy and smart women with a couple of hundred pounds worth of summer dress picking their way between the rubbish bags dogs crapping on the pavements of the high street never seen anything like it and now this place police headquarters for the city a great grey stone heap coated in pigeon dirt flag limp and refusing to stir on the pole above him he gave carbonis name at the front desk and showed the official the name written on paper had to do that because theyd looked blank when he opened his mouth but the name seemed to mean something because heels clicked together and there were bows and ushering arms towards the lift archie carpenter laughed behind his hand wouldnt be like this if one of their lot came over to the yard be made to sit down for half an hour while they sorted out his accreditation checked through to his appointment made him fill out a form with three carbons and no chance of getting called dottore no bloody chance all a bit strange but then it had been strange all morning from the embassy man who wouldnt talk to the time when hed gone into an empty office at ich and dialled the number theyd given him for violet harrison yes he could come round if he wanted to if there was something that he had to say to her then he should come round otherwise shed be going out carpenter had stuck at it he had to see her head office was particularly keen that he should personally make sure everything possible was being done for her well in that case shed said hed better come and she wouldnt go out shed stay at home like she was doing him a favour and would about six oclock be right and they could have a drink well not what youd expect was it archie down the corridors they went carpenter a pace behind his escort bisecting the endless central carpet worn and faded hearing all about him the slow crack of typewriters turning his eyes away when two men came out of an office in front and gave each other a big smacker on the cheeks round a corner down another corridor like a charity hike and then he was there a young man was shaking his hand and prattling in the local and carpenter was smiling and nodding catching on with the manners the inner door of the office burst open the man who came through the door was short grossly overweight but moving with the speed of a crocodile on the scent of fresh meat papers and a cassette recorder were gripped in his left hand the other remained free for waving as a stage prop to the waterfall of words carpenter understood not a phrase stood rooted to the carpet both of them hammering away and at the body work arms round the shoulders heads close enough to recognize the toothpaste something had gone well he was acting as if hed drawn the favourite in the irish sweepstake the little fellow with the big belly a change of gear an effortless switch to english and the recorder and paperwork passed to his subordinate giuseppe carboni introduced himself i am carboni and you are carpenter good you come from london from ich excellent you come at the right moment everything is well come into my room cant be bad thought carpenter and followed the disappearing figure into the inner office where he looked round him swayed a bit massive and tasteful furnished and carpeted prints on the wall of old rome velvet drapes on the windows a framed portrait of the president on a desk half submerged in an everest of files he sat himself down opposite the desk carpenter this morning i am proud this morning i am very happy and i will tell you why carpenter inclined his head had the routine straight gave him a flash of teeth roll on let the dam break let me tell you that from yesterday morning when i first heard of what happened to your mr harrison from the time i first telephoned to the embassy this has been a case that has worried and disturbed me to be frank there are not many of these kidnappings that greatly affect me most of the people who are taken are excessively rich and you will have read of how much money they can pay for their release and after they have been freed many are investigated with enthusiasm by the guardia di finanze our fiscal police one wonders how it is in a modern society that individuals can legally accumulate such funds hundreds of thousands of dollars are necessary to win freedom they give us little help these people neither the families during the imprisonment nor the victim after return they shut us out so that we must work from the side from the edge when our record of arrests is decried then i sweat carpenter because we work with only one hand free i understand said carpenter he had heard this and it stank and ran against all his police training intolerable when it is children or teenage girls the innocent parties then it hurts more but your mr harrison he is an ordinary businessman i do not seek to denigrate him but an ordinary fellow not important not rich not prepared the shock for him the ordeal may be psychologically catastrophic you know carpenter i was up half the night worrying about this man why carpenter cut in partly from impatience at having the news that provoked the ebullience withheld from him partly because the syrup was too thick benedictine when he wanted scotch you laugh at me you laugh at me because you do not believe i am serious you have not been a policeman for twentyeight years in italy had you been then you would know my feelings harrison is clean harrison is not tainted harrison observes legality he is in our country as a baby a baby without clothes without malice and he deserves our protection which is why i work to bring him back thank you carpenter spoke with simplicity he believed he understood and warmed all the time to the barely shaven perspiring man across the desk from him you have come to supervise the payment of an extraordinary sum for harrisons release why else would you c o m e carpenter flushed it does not embarrass me it was my own advice to your embassy what i have to tell you is that it may not be necessary it may not be required the jolt shuddered through archie carpenter straightbacked in his chair peering forward we try to use modern methods here we try not to justify the image that you have of us we do not sleep through the afternoon we are not lazy and stupid we have a certain skill carpenter we have the tapes of the telephone calls to mrs harrison and to ich the computer gobbles them then we feed other calls into the machine from other events and we have made a match we have two cases where the contact was from the same man you understand police work i did eight years with special branch in london with the metropolitan police what youd see as the political wing carpenter spoke with a certain pride i know what is special branch carpenter flashed his molars creased his cheeks carboni acknowledged then launched himself again so i have a match and that tells me that i am not dealing with a first time out group i am working against an organization that has been in the field it tells me a little it tells me something just now i am talking to a man from the office of a business fellow that i have been asked to investigate you know the situation many times when you have my position people come with a whisper for the ear look at this man they say look at him and think about him is everything correct about him and if he is a calabrese if he is from the south and has much cash then you look closely i rang the office of a property speculator in rome this morning but he is not available he is away on business i must speak to his junior carboni paused master of theatre paused and waited while carpenter willed him on seemed to fill his lungs as if the ten minutes of near continuous talk had vacuumed them carpenter we need fortune in this business you know that we need luck this morning we have been blessed you saw me in the office when i hugged that little prig i detest the man arrogant and sneering and i hugged him because to my ear the voice of the man that says his master is in calabria is the same as that of the man who called the office of harrison carpenter bobbed his head in praise congratulations sincerely mr carboni my congratulations you have a wrapup it is not definite of course i await the confirmation of the machines a coyness across the desk but you have no doubts in my own mind there are none i say again congratulations but we must move with care and discretion carpenter you understand that we go into surveillance and tapping caution is required if we want your harrison returned sharply an intrusion on the mens concentration the telephone rang carboni reached for it and even where carpenter sat he could hear the strident talk carboni scribbled on his notepad as the englishmans excitement dissipated and waned he had not wanted the spell of success broken and now had to endure interruption of the sweet flow carboni had written on and covered two sheets of paper before without courtesies he put the telephone down dont look worried carpenter complications yes but those that thicken the mixture a man has been found dead in a small hotel close to the railway station he had been clubbed to death we have the teleprint of his history he was held briefly on a kidnapping charge but the principal witness declined to testify at his trial the prosecution was lost he comes from the village of cosoleto in the far south in calabria the man that i tried to telephone this morning he is from that village too there is a web forming carpenter a web is sticky and difficult to extract from even for those who have made it i think youd prefer that nobodys hopes were raised yet not in london not with the family carboni shrugged sending a quiver through his body and eased his fingers through the rare strands of his forehead hair i have given you much in confidence im grateful to you because youve wasted much of your time if i could see you tomorrow id be more than pleased archie rose out of his chair would love to have stayed because the atmosphere of investigation was infectious and for too long he had been away from it come tomorrow at the same time said carboni and laughed deep and satisfied the man who has enjoyed a lively whore spent his money and regretted nothing come tomorrow and i will have something to tell you we should put some champagne on ice carpenter trying to match the mood from this morning i dont drink carboni laughed again and gripped carpenters hand with the damp warmth of friendship for two and a half years francesco vellosi had accepted the escort of a loaded alfetta three men of his own squad always in place behind him as he made the four daily journeys to and from the viminale and his flat sun and frost summer and winter they dogged his movements he had people coming for drinks that evening at home he told mauro with his clipped even voice but he would be returning to his desk later would mauro fix the movements and coordination of the escort a flicker of the eyes went with the request for vellosi there was now time for a brief rest before his guests arrived he would not permit them to stay late not with the papers piling on his desk when he was inside his front door and passed to the responsibility of the guard who lived with him the motor escort withdrew because he would later return to his office there were curses from the men who accompanied him and who would again suffer a broken evening chapter ten the shadows had gone now called away by the sun that had groped beyond the orange orchard over to his right the lines had lengthened reached their extremity and disappeared leaving in their wake the haze of the first darkness with their going there was a cold settling fast among the trees and bushes that giancarlo had taken for his watching place the building in front of him was no more than a blackened outline indistinct in shape difficult to focus on around him the noises of the night were mustering swelling in their competition the barking of a far distant farm dog the droning of the bees frantic for a last feed from the wild honeysuckle the engine drive of the skeleton mosquitoes the croak of an owl unseen in a high tree the boy did not move as if any motion of his body might alert those who he knew stayed unaware and unsuspicious in the barn that was less than a hundred metres from him this was not the moment to rush forward better to let the darkness cling more tightly to the land throw its blanket more finally across the fields and olive patches and the rock outcrops that were submerging in the dusk the ideas of giancarlo convoluted and hesitant when conceived in the rocking pace of the rapido were now near to fulfilment wild and illthought at their birth they now seemed to him to own a pattern and a value worth a smile little fox worth a grin unchallenged he had walked out of the small station with its wide platforms on the reggio esplanade gulped at a waft of seablown air and mingled with the stream of descending passengers if there were watching polizia at the barrier giancarlo had not seen them and there had been no shouted command to halt he had walked from the station among the people laden with suitcases and string bags the snakes of humanity had slithered in their differing directions splintering again and again till he was alone in a tabacchi he purchased a map of calabria the names were clear and well remembered sinopli delianuova acquaro cosoleto he found them where the red ribbons of the roads began to twist into the uplands of the aspromonte beyond the greenshaded coastal strip far into the deeper sand and brown of the rising ground in early afternoon with the time of siesta weighty on the empty streets giancarlo found his car among the whitewashed houses with the light battering back at his unprotected eyes parked haphazardly as if the owner were late for an important meeting not just restless for his lunch the life of the mezzo giorno ruled the land of the half day washing hung down bleached and stiffened from the balcony of a house under which was abandoned a red fiat right outside the front door keys in the ignition shutters fastened to protect the cool in the interior not a child crying not a grandmother complaining not a radio tuned to music he slipped into the driving seat eased off the handbrake and coasted slowly down the incline waiting till he was clear of the corner before firing the engine he headed north for the long viaduct where the mafiosi had made their fortunes in extortion from those who needed to move in materials and equipment and found it cheaper to concede the dues than to fight he drove slowly because that was the style of the calabrian after lunch and his need to avoid drawing attention was as acute as ever his face was sufficient of a problem white with the pallor of prison and confinement in the covo not the complexion of the south not the burned and dark wood tan of those who owned this country he drifted past the turnoff signs to gallico and carnitello and climbed high with the road above the sea channel that separated the sicilian island from the mainland for a moment he slowed and stared hard away to his left his gaze held on the sprawl of messina away across the azure of the water messina blurred and indistinct lay white in the sun among the spreading green and rust of parks and waste ground messina where they had built the gaol for the girls this was where they had taken la vianale where curcios nadia had waited for her trial where if he did not succeed his franca would decay and crumble he could not see the prison not across eight kilometres of reflecting sea but it was there a spur and a goad the car increased speed past the road on the left to scilla and on the right to gambarie through the booming length of rock cut tunnels and on into the interior sinopli and delianuova were signed to the right and he pulled the little fiat off the dual carriageway and started the winding negotiation of the hill road through santa eufemia daspromonte a barren and meagre community where his coming scattered only the chickens feeding in the road gravel and his going raised barely an eyebrow of attention from the elderly who sat in black skirts and suits in front of their homes through sinopli where he hooted for the right to pass a bus that struggled in an exhaust cloud on the main street and where the shops were still padlocked and it was too hot too sickly clammy for the ragazzi to have brought out their plastic footballs bitter country now laden with rock and precipice covered with the toughened scrub and trees that grew from little earth in low gear rising and descending giancarlo drove on till he was over the old and narrow stone bridge across the vasi and into acquaro perhaps some saw him go through the village but he was unaware of them studying by turns the map laid out on the front passenger seat and the perils of the curving route a halfkilometre further he stopped there was a layby and a heap of gravel where the workmen would come in the winter when there was ice to make the road safe for motorists further back was a turnin among the trees where perhaps the hunting parties parked their cars on sundays or the young men took the virgins when they could no longer suffer the claustrophobia of the family in the front room and the watch of the madonna above the fireplace giancarlo grinned to himself wrong day for hunters too early in the evening for virgins this was a place for him to park hidden from the road he drove as far between the trees as the track permitted from habit in the quiet of his seat giancarlo checked over the p stroked its silk barrel length and wiped on his shirt waist the faint stains on the handle eight bullets only eight to do so much with he climbed lightly from the car eased the pistol back into his belt and was lost in the close foliage he skirted the road leaving it what he judged to be a hundred metres on his left seeking the thickness of the wood easing on to the toes of his canvas shoes thankful for the cover it took him only a few minutes before he found the vantage point for the oncewhite house from which paint and plaster alike peeled served by a rutted track a hovel to giancarlo a place for sheep and cows medieval had it not been for the car parked outside the only door this was the home of a contadino a peasant and his wife moved beside the building with a bucket and his halfclothed children played with a spar of wood the boy settled himself comfortably on the mould of generations of fallen leaves and watched and waited for the brother of the wife of claudio not long not long enough to try him a big man balding above a flat weatherbeaten forehead cheeks that were not shaved trousers that were held at the waist with string a shirt that was torn at the armpit contadino giancarlo spat the word but of the proletariat surely he smiled mirthlessly a servant of the bosses the boy agreed satisfied in the ideology equation the man carried a plastic bag and walked down the track from his house to the road paused there and his eyes traversed a sweep that covered the boys hide the man had passed close to where giancarlo lay before his sounds subsided like a stoat giancarlo was after him ears cocked and attuned to the distant noises in front eyes fastened on the dried twigs and oak leaves that he must not break nor displace the tree line covered the rim of a slight hill beyond it was a roughened field indented from the cattles wet spring grazing on the far side of the open ground giancarlo saw the stonebuilt barn with its rainreddened tin roof and two doors facing him the man he had followed was met by one who had come from the righthand door and who carried a singlebarrelled shotgun the weapon of the country people they talked a brief discourse before the bag was handed over and a gust of laughter carried to the boy as the man retraced his steps giancarlo melted among the trees and undergrowth unseen unheard when it was safe he came slowly forward to the dry stone wall that skirted the field and picked his watching place a boundless pride swept through him he wanted to stand up and shout defiance and exultation giancarlo battestini remember the name because he had found the englishman of the multinationals and would exploit him as the foreign companies exploited the proletariat later giancarlo would begin his advance edge closer to the building later now was the time for him to rest and to relax if that were possible and to d r e a m and the images of the thighs warm and muscled in moisture and of the curling growth and the breasts where his head had lain blasted and echoed through his mind alone on the ground the myriad earth creatures converging on him he shuddered and knew he would not sleep archie carpenter had been shown round the flat hed made the right noises and stood hesitantly at the bedroom door casting a quick eye over the wide pink coverlet studied the wall pictures paced the corridors with his hands joined behind his back in the pose of royal males factoryvisiting and expressed his opinion as to what a fine place it was she was a queer one this violet harrison making it all seem so natural as she marched him over the marble floors pointing to this and that offering the limited history of the furniture shed poured him a drink gin with hardly enough tonic to notice and splashed some ice cubes in and hed seen her hand shaking rocking like a sick mans and hed known it was all a damn great sham all the poise all the silly chat just a counterfeit thats when the sympathy had started to roll watching the trembling fist and the way the finger talons clutched at the bottle loose and slim in the full flow of her dress she sat on a sofa the shape and form projecting without angular emphasis the sort of woman you could take to your chest archie sort of nuzzle against and it would be all soft and wouldnt hurt anywhere he wasnt looking at her eyes when he started to speak just at the cleavage where the freckles ran down his suit was tight and hot and too thick for roman summer bloody strange dress shed put on for a time like this you have to know mrs harrison that the company are doing all they can to get geoffrey back to you as quickly as humanly possible hell be home again thats very kind she said and her words were not easy to follow it wasnt the first drink shed had that day you dont have to stand up like a preacher archie and tell people how to behave and conduct themselves not when their whole worlds falling in everything possible carpenter hurtled on the board will rubberstamp the managing directors decision to pay he wants you to know that the company will pay whatever is required to get your husband back theres nothing on that count for you to worry about thank you she said raised her eyebrows at him as if trying to show how impressed she was that the board should make such a commitment bloody marvellous he thought what a pair and not a trace of sweat on her where the neckline cut down and him dripping wet like a horse at the derby finish theres not a great deal that we can do at the moment but your husbands colleagues at ich in rome are geared to take calls and make the financial arrangements itll probably all be outside the country which makes it smoother he paused drank it all in watched the shift of the material as she crossed her legs but you have to soldier on for a bit mrs harrison for quite a few days it takes time this sort of thing we cannot settle it in a matter of hours i understand that mr carpenter youre taking it very well im just trying to go on as i usually would as if geoffrey were away on a business trip something like that she leaned forward slightly in her chair what to say now what ground to stumble over carpenter swallowed was there anything you wanted anything i could help with i doubt it mr carpenter it may take a few days but were working on two fronts we can pay thats no problem at the same time the police are cooperating and have a major and discreet recovery effort underway they have their best men on the case and i dont really need to know that do i she asked quietly carpenter bridled i thought youd want to hear what was happening cool it archie shes under stress a brave front and damnall underneath so what youre offering me is that after a week or two ill know whether geoffrey is going to walk through the door or whether im never going to see him again i think we should look on the bright side of things mrs harrison out of training archie bloody years since hed been a beat copper in uniform and knocking on doors with a solemn face to tell the wife that her old mans come off his motorbike and if she doesnt hurry shell see him in the hospital chapel she seemed to sag and the tears came and then the deeper sobs and the protest in the choked voice you dont know anything nothing at a l l mister bloody carpenter you treat me like a bloody child lets all have a drink lets believe it isnt for real what do you know about this place sweet fuckall of nothing you dont know where my husband is you dont know how to get him back all you talk about is everything possible and major effort best men on the case its just bloody bromide mister bloody carpenter thats not fair mrs harrison and dont swear at me and dont you come marching in here oozing your platitudes telling me everything is going to be marvellous too bloody right i wont theres people that dont know when someones trying to help them carpenters voice rose his neck flushed he pushed himself up from the seat gulping at the remains of his drink when someone comes and tries to give a hand theres no call for foul language he couldnt get smoothly out of his chair couldnt make a quick and decent exit with dignity by the time he was on his feet she was between him and the door and the tears were wet on her face gleaming in the sheen of her makeup i think id better go he said mumbling his words conscious of his failure to complete his task she stood very close to him barring his way a frail little thing for all the bravura of her language and looked straight into his face her head was turned up towards him with a small neat mouth and her arms hung inert down to her hips i think id better go dont you i dont think i can help any more if you think you ought to brown hazel eyes deepset and misted and around them the morass of freckles that he followed the patterns of followed where they led geoffreys bloody useless you know her hand came up wiping hastily across her face smudged the cosmetic grease and the smile was there again curtained herself from him just as she had done when she showed him round the flat taken a public stance there was a little laugh bright in his ear im not shocking you am i mr carpenter quite bloody useless to me anyway i dont mean to shock you but people ought to understand each other dont you think so one hand was sliding under his jacket fingers rifling at the damp texture of his shirt the other played at the uppermost buttons of her dress dont lets mess about mr carpenter you know the geography of this flat you know where my room is oughtnt you be taking me there now t her nails dug into the small of his back a small bone button slipped from its hole the spirals of excitement climbed at his spine come on mr carpenter you cant do anything for geoffrey i cant do anything for geoffrey so lets not pretend lets pass the time there was pressure on his back ribs drawing him closer the mouth and the pink painted lips mesmerizing him he could smell her breath could smell that she smoked but she must have used toothpaste just before he came peppermint toothpaste i cant stay carpenter said a hoarseness at his throat out of his depth wallowing in deep water and not a liferaft in bloody miles i cant stay i have to go the hands abandoned his back and the buttons and she stepped aside to leave him space to pass into the hall no hesitations mr carpenter she murmured behind him he was fiddling with the door locks anxious to be on his way and therefore hurrying and in the process slowing himself the man who is impatient and cannot unfasten a brassiere strap no second thoughts teased bowed by a shame that he could not recognize as coming from either inadequacy or morality archie carpenter ninetofiver optout from the grownup world finally opened the door youre a boring bastard mr carpenter she called after him a proper little bore if youre the best they can send to get my husband out then god help the poor darling the door slammed he didnt wait for the lift but took the stairs two at a time in prewar rome the fascist administration sometimes ordered the lights of the principal government offices to be left burning long after the bureaucracy had gone to their trams and buses a grateful population would believe that the state was working late and be impressed the spirit of such deception had long since passed and the prevailing dictates of austerity decreed that unnecessary lights should be extinguished giuseppe carboni was one of only a very few who worked late into that night in the shadowed sepulchre of the questura by telephone he had indefinitely postponed his dinner at home as he put off and avoided the anathema of communication with the force that he saw as his principal rival the paramilitary carabinieri the polizia and carabinieri existed at best as uneasy bedfellows between the communal sheets of law and order competition was fierce and jealous the success of either was trumpeted by its senior officers and a weak executive power was satisfied that neither should become overpowerful a recipe for inefficiency and a safeguard against the allencompassing police state power that italy had laboured under for twentyone years carbonis problem and it had taken him many hours to resolve it in his mind was whether or not he should place in the lap of the opposition his information on the speculator mazzotti the man was in the far south apparently at the village of cosoleto and beyond the striking and administrative range of the polizia at the calabrian capital of reggio cosoleto would come under the jurisdiction of the carabinieri at the small town of palmi his maps showed him that his option was to allow the man mazzotti to return from calabria to the roman district where he would again be liable to police investigation but if the gorilla claudio were linked to the kidnapping of the englishman harrison then the report of his killing in rome would serve only to alert those involved for another few hours perhaps the name of the dead man could be suppressed but not beyond the dawn of the next day it was immaterial at whose hand the strong man had met his death sufficient for carboni that it would be enough to set into play the fallback plans of the kidnap group it was not possible for him to delay in his action but if he acted now made a request for help that were successful then what credit would be laid at the door of giuseppe carboni trivial plaudits and victim and criminals in the hands of the blackuniformed carabinieri enough to make a man weep he broke the pledge of the morning and poured himself a scotch from his cabinet the bottle reserved for times of celebration and black depression then placed the call to palmi just this once he would do the right deed he promised himself just this once break the habit of a professional lifetime when the call came the static was heavy on the line and carbonis voice boomed through the quiet offices and out through the opened doors into the emptied corridors of the second floor of the questura many times he was obliged to repeat himself to the carabinieri capitano as he was urged to great explanation he stressed the importance of the harrison affair the concern in the matter of high administrative circles in rome twice the capitano had demurred the action suggested was too delicate for his personal intervention the mazzotti family were of local importance should there not be authorization from the examining magistrate carboni had shouted louder bellowed bulllike into the telephone the matter could not wait for authorization the situation was too fluid to be left till the morning appearance of the magistrate in his office perhaps the very vehemence impressed the carabinieri officer perhaps the dream of glory that might be his he acquiesced the home of antonio mazzotti would be placed under surveillance from three oclock in the morning he would be arrested at eight and be careful i want no suspicions i want no warnings given to this bastard carboni yelled a little mistake and my head is hanging you understand hanging on my belly you have the man mazzotti in the cells at palmi and ill be with the magistrate by nine and have him brought to rome you will reap full praise for your initiative and flexibility and cooperation it wont be forgotten the capitano expressed his gratitude to the dottore nothing my son nothing good luck carboni put the telephone down there was a black sheen on the handpiece and with his shirt cuff he smeared the moisture from his forehead rome in high summer an impossible place to work he locked his desk switched off his desk light and headed for the corridor for a man so gross in stomach and thighs there was something of a spring in his step the scent sharp in the nose of the professional policeman the old one the one above pride and expediency time to go home to his supper and his bed uncomfortable irritated by the sharpness of the hay strands impeded by the wrist manacle geoffrey harrison had been denied the relief of sleep they left no light for him and the darkness had come once the slanting sun shafts no longer bored through the old nail holes of the roof a long darkness aggravated by the absence of food a punishment he thought a punishment for kicking the bucket over them as if the beating wasnt enough his belly ached and groaned out loud in its deprivation he lay full length on his back the chain allowing his right arm to drop loosely on the hay beside his body still and inert occasionally dozing eking out minutes and hours and not knowing nor caring of their passage the voices of his guards were occasional and faint through the thickness of the dividing wall of the bam indistinct at best and punctuated by laughter and then loud silence little he heard of them and since one had walked heavily outside the building and urinated with force there had been nothing his concentration was sharpened by the whisper of the scurrying feet of rats and mice who had made their nests in the gaps between the hay bales under him little bastards eating and crapping and copulating and spewing out their litters performing their functions of limited life a few feet below his backside he wondered what they made of the smell and presence close to their heartland whether theyd summon the courage or curiosity to investigate the intruder each movement of the rodents he heard the vibrations of the small feet frantic as they went about their business perhaps there would be bats tonight there might have been last night but the sleep had been too great too thick for him to have noticed all the phobias all the hates and fears of bats rushed past him so that he could examine and analyse the folklore the scratchers the tanglers the diseasecarriers and there was a new sound harrison stiffened where he lay rigid now on his back fingers clenched eyes peering upward into the unbroken darkness a footfall beyond the side wall away from where his guards rested frightened to move frightened to breathe harrison listened a softsoled shoe eased on to the dirt and mess beyond the wall a step taken slowly as if the ground were being tested before the weight of a man was committed a tree brushing with a laden branch against the coarse granite stone sweeping across it with the gentle motion of the night wind that harrison could identify that was not what he had heard an outside man a stranger was coming silently and in stealth to the barn without warning without announcement a person had come before the sun had set and had called from some way off and there had been greetings and conversation this was not as then another footstep clearer this time as if nerve and caution were failing as if impetuosity and impatience were rising harrison willed him forward anyone who came with the hush of feet on the tinder grass and the scraping stones anyone who came with such secrecy had no love nor friendship for the men who waited in the far room of the barn cruel and mocking came the long void of silence unbroken to harrisons alert ears each noise of the night available to him he rejected because the sounds he searched for were lost the last footstep had been clear and perhaps the man had taken fright and would stay still and listen before he came on the perspiration invaded harrisons body floating to the crevices of his body who was it who had come who would travel to this place a shatter of noise a warning shout a blasting pistol shot ripped an echo through the space under harrisons low ceiling in the half light from the storm lamp set low giancarlo saw the man nearest him pitch forward the cry in his throat destroyed for a moment he caught the reflection of the eyes of a second man a rabbits in headlights and then a stool careered in the air towards him and his ducking weave was enough to take the force of the blow on his shoulder and to distort his gathering aim like a huge shadow the man dived against the wall but his movements were sluggish and terrorized and without hope giancarlo had time before the man reached the shortened shotgun he held the p close with his two fists cursed as the barrel wavered and the ache sagged in his upper arm the man stole a last glance at him without hope of salvation and reached the last inches for the shotgun giancarlo fired two shots for certainty into the target that sank to the earth floor harrison heard the answering whimper a moan of supplication perhaps a prayer before a choked sob sliced it to silence he was frozen still unmoving uncomprehending the leaning door old and protesting on its hinges was opened beneath him the chain was tight between his arm and the roof denying him escape what in gods name happens now this was not the noise the police would have made not the way it would have been if they were here there would have been voices all round and shouts and commands and organization only the door below him deep in the darkness being prised open his name was called arrison arrison difficult for him to register it at first slow and tentative almost a request where are you arrison a young voice nervous a young italian they could never get their tongues round his name not in the office not at business meetings not in the shops when he was out with violet the fear swelled inside him the child that lies in the blackness and hears a stranger come to answer or not to identify or to remain silent pulsing through him the dangers of the unknown where are you arrison speak tell me where you are arrison his reply was involuntary blurted out made not because he had worked out the answers but because there was a plea for response and he had no longer the strength to resist up here i am up here i am coming arrison heavy in the stumbled english was the tinge of pride the door scraped across the floor the caution of the footsteps was abandoned there are more of them arrison there were two are there more just two there were only two he heard the sound of the ladder thudding into position against the hay wall and the noise was fierce as the feet came against the rungs come down quickly we should not stay here they have me by a chain i cannot move would the stranger understand would his english be competent i am a prisoner here harrison slid into the staccato language of the foreigner believing that was how his own tongue was best understood two hands clawed at his feet and he could make out the slight silhouette of a man rising towards him he cringed backwards dont fear me dont be afraid arrison a soft little voice barely out of school with the grammar fresh from the reading primers the fingers cruising and exploratory reached along the length of his body across harrisons thigh scratching at his waist onwards and upwards to the pit of his arm and then away out past his elbow to the wrist and the steel grip of the handcuff a cigarette lighter flicked on wavering and scarcely effective but from the kernel of light geoffrey harrison could distinguish the face and features of the boy beneath the shortthrown shadows unshaven pallid eyes that were alive and burned bright a shape to marry to the garlic smell of bread and salad sandwiches take it an order and the lighter was directed towards harrisons free hand turn your face away harrison saw the shadowed pistol drawn squat and revolting a macabre toy he bucked his head away as the gun was raised and held steady squinted his eyes shut forced them closed tearing at his ears was the noise of the gun wrenching at his wrist the drag of the chain the pain burned in the muscle socket of his shoulder but when his arm swung back to his side it was free it is done the boy said and there was the trace of a smile sparse and cold in the flame of the lighter he pulled at harrisons hand led him towards the ladder it was a cumbersome descent because harrison nursed his shoulder and the boys hands were occupied with the gun and the flick lighter the pressed earth of the floor was under harrisons feet and the grip on his arm constant as he was led towards the opaque moon haze of the doorway they stopped there and the fingers slipped to his wrist and there was a sharp heave at the bulletbroken handcuff ring a light clatter on the ground the men those who were watching me i killed them the face invisible the information inconsequential both of them i killed the two of them out in the night air harrison shuddered as if the damp loose on his forehead were frozen the waft of fresh wind caught at his hair and flipped it from his eyes he stumbled on a rock who are y o u r it is not of concern to you the grip on his wrist was tight and decisive harrison remembered the fleeting sight of the pistol he allowed himself to be dragged away across the uneven thistled grass of the field the eyewitnesses to the attack melted and died from the pavement with the wailing approach of the ambulance sirens few would stay to offer their account and their names and addresses to the investigating police out in the middle of the road slewed at right angles to the two traffic flows was the ambushed alfa of francesco vellosi mauro the driver lay death pale across his steeringwheel his head close to the holed and frosted windscreen alone in the back half down on the floor was vellosi both hands clamped on his pistol and unable to stifle the trembling that invaded his body the door of reinforced armour plate had saved him above his scalp the back passenger windows for all their strengthening were a kaleidoscope of reflected colours amid the fractured glass splinters so fast so vivid so terrifying had been the moment of assault after eight years in the squadro antiterrorismo eight years of standing and looking at cars such as his at bodies such as mauros yet no real knowledge had accrued of how the moment would find him everything he could previously have imagined of the experience was inadequate not even in the war in the sand dunes of sidi barrani under the artillery of the english had there been anything as overwhelming as the trapped rat feeling in the closed car with the sprays of automatic fire beating over his head the escort car had locked its bonnet under the rear bumper of vellosis vehicle here they had all survived and now they were scattered with their machinepistols one in cover behind the opened front passenger door one away in a shop doorway the third man in vellosis guard stood erect in the middle of the street lit by the high lights his gun cradled and ready and pointing to the tarmac lest the prone figures should rise and defy the blood trails and the gaping intestinal wounds and offer again a challenge only when the street was busy with police did vellosi unlock his door and emerge he seemed old almost senile his steps laboured and heavy how many of them do we have he called across the street to the man who had been his shadow and guard these three years whose wife cooked for him to whose children he was a godfather there were three capo all dead they stayed beyond their time when they should have run they stayed to make certain of you he walked into the lit centre of the street and his men hurried to close around him wanting him gone but reading his mood and unwilling to confront it he stared down into the faces of the boys the ragazzi grotesque in their angles with the killing weapons close to their fists only the agony left in their eyes the hate fled and gone his eyes closed and his cheek muscles hardened as if he summoned strength from a distant force the one there he pointed to a shape of denim jeans and a bloodflawed shirt i have met that boy i have eaten at his fathers house the boy came in before we sat down at dinner his father is a banker the director of the contrazzioni finanziarie of one of the banks in the via del corso i know that boy he turned reluctantly from the scene dawdling and his voice was raised and carried over the street and the pavement and to the few who had gathered and watched him the bitch tantardini spitting her poison over these children the wicked contaminating bitch hemmed in on the back seat of his escort car francesco vellosi left for his desk at the viminale chapter eleven with the headlight beams flashing back from the roadside pine trees hurling aside the startled shadows the little twodoor fiat ground its way into the inky night leaving behind the cluster of the cosoleto lights giancarlo forced the motor hard regardless of the howling tyres the crack of the fastchanged gears and the drift of harrisons shoulders against his own his purpose now was to be rid of the vacuum of the darkened roads and fields the silhouetted trees and the lonely farmhouses he was a town boy and nurtured the urban fear of the wide spaces of the country where familiarity was no longer governed by a known street corner a local shop or a towering cement landmark he drove on the narrow road to seminara scarcely aware of the silent man beside him contemplating perhaps the gun that rested on the shelf of the open glove compartment the p ready and willing even though its magazine had been rifled in the barn still with sufficient cartridges in its bowels to remain lethal through melicucca where the town was asleep where men and women had taken to their early beds heavy with the wine of the region the weight of the food and the condemnation of the priest for late hours through melicucca and beyond before even the lightest sleepers could have turned and wondered at the speed of the car that violated the quiet of their night he turned sharp left at santa anna because that was the route to the coast and the main road and the task was only begun believe that giancarlo the starting of a journey the pits the swamps all ahead all gathering all conglomerating they are nothing the boy said soundlessly to himself nothing he slowed as they came to seminara a town where people might still be alert where his caution must be exercised hed studied the map in the field near the barn knew the town had one street the mayors office would be there a formidable building it was but decayed and in need of money for repair heavy doors tight shut sandwiched between lesser constructions and close to the central piazza illuminated by the street lights he braked and the man beside him lunged forward with his hands to break an impact get out of the car giancarlo said get out of the car and put your hands on the roof and stand still because the gun watches you harrison climbed out his shoulder still paining did what he was told to do giancarlo watched him straighten flex himself and shake his head as if internal dispute had been resolved he wondered whether harrison would run or whether he was too confused to act he held the gun in his hand not with aggression but with the warning implicit he would see the p and he would not play the idiot the movements on the pavement of the englishman were sluggish those of a netted carp after a protracted struggle he would have few problems with this man from the shelf he took a pencil and a scrap of paper on which had been written on one side the petrol purchases and additions of the cars owner we will not be long arrison stand still because it is not sensible that you move afterwards it will all be explained there was no response from the sagging trousers that he could see against the opened door he began to write with the bold flourished hand that had been taught him by a teacher at the secondary school of pescara who prided herself on copperplate neatness the words came quickly to the paper there had been time enough on the train to formulate the demand that he would make communique of the nuclei armati proletaria we hold prisoner the english multinational criminal geoffrey harrison all those who work for the multinational conspiracy whether italian or foreigners are exploiters of the proletarian revolution and are the opponents of the aspirations of the workers the enemy harrison is now held in a peoples prison he will be executed at cet the th of this month the day after tomorrow unless the prisoner of war held in the regime concentration camp franca tantardini has been freed and flown out of italy there will be no further communiques no further warnings unless tantardini is freed from her torture the sentence will be carried out without mercy in memory of panicucci victory to the proletariat victory to the workers death and defeat to the borghese the capitalists and the multinationalists nuclei armati proletaria giancarlo read over his words screwing his eyes at the paper in the dim light as franca would have wanted it she would be satisfied with him well satisfied arrison do you have any paper something that identifies you an envelope a driving licence he thrust the gun forward so that the weight of his message would be augmented and accepted the thin hip wallet in return money there but he ignored it and drew out the plastic folder of credit cards eurocard american express diners club american express was the one he coveted perhaps you will get it back at sometime arrison with this paper push it under the door it is important for you that it is found early in the morning push it carefully and the card with it that too is important giancarlo folded the sheet of paper and wrote on the outside leaf in large capitals the letters of the symbol of the nappisti he handed the paper and the credit card to his prisoner and watched him bend to slide the two under the main door to the office of the mayor of seminara you will drive now arrison and you will be careful because i am watching you and because i have the gun i have killed three men to come this far you should know that giancarlo battestini slid across into the passenger seat vacating the drivers place for geoffrey harrison their stop in the centre of seminara had delayed them little more than three minutes in the rhythm of driving the numbing shock wore away chipped from the mind of geoffrey harrison neither attempted conversation leaving harrison free to absorb himself in the driving while in the darkness beside him the boy wrestled with the map folds and plotted their route and turnings as the minutes went by the doldrums cleared from harrisons thoughts no explanation yet from the boy everything left unsaid unamplified but he felt that he understood everything had been given the signs which he now used as the text book of his assessment the way the hand had gripped his wrist that told him much told him he was incarcerated and under guard the pistol told him more evidence of lightning attack of a ferocity of purpose there was the warning too the warning in seminara spoken as if it were meant kindly i have killed three men to come this far three men dead that harrison should drive in the warm night past signposts to towns he had not heard of along the lightconstricted visions of a road he had never before travelled on a prisoner a second time a hostage with a dropped note setting out terms of release yet he felt no fear of the gun and the youth with the bowed head beside him because the capacity for terror had been exhausted devoid of impatience he would wait for the promised explanation out beyond laureana racing alongside the driedout river bed harrison forced the fiat away from the memories of the barn at cosoleto and the men with their hoods and kicking boots and fouled shirts hours more till dawn he reckoned he had no complaint only a dulled brain that was exerted by the need to hold the car on the road the dipped lights on the verge only rarely did his attention waver and when he turned he saw that the boy sat with his arms folded and that the pistol was cupped by an elbow and the barrel faced the space beneath his armpit an hour down the road from seminara past the sign to pizzo the silence broke you dont have a cigarette do you harrison asked i have only a very few frank enough thought harrison marking the bloody card i havent had one for a couple of days you know id really like one i have only a very few the boy repeated harrison kept his eyes on the road i dont ask what the hells going on i dont throw a fit i wait to be told all about it in your own good sweet time all i do is ask for a cigarette you speak too fast for me i do not understand hiding the little bastard behind the language i just said that perhaps we could share a cigarette what do you mean i mean i could smoke it and you could smoke it and as we were doing that you could talk to me we could both smoke the cigarette ive no known disease the boy reached into the breast pocket of his shirt reluctant as a bloody fagan and from the corner of his eye harrison saw the red packet emerge tight wasnt he not what youd call the generous type not like youve hit one of the big spenders of whatever creepy scene this kid owned inside the car there was the flash of the igniting lighter then the slow glow of the cigarette burning tantalizing and close to him thank you harrison spoke out clearly the boy passed the cigarette first contact first humanity harrison wrapped his lips on the filter end pulled hard into his lungs and eased his foot on the accelerator thank you harrison spoke with feeling and nicotine smoke eddied inside the cars confines now its your turn therell be nothing funny ill keep going but its you for the talking right harrison looked quickly away from the roads illuminated markers and the direction lines gave himself time to absorb the furrow of frown and concentration on the boys face you should just drive and there was the first simmering of hostility give me the cigarette again please it was passed to him one desperate intake like the swill minutes in the pub back in england when the beers are on the counter and the landlords calling for empty glasses whats your name giancarlo and your other name whats that giancarlo t harrison spoke as if the question were pure conversation as if the answer carried only trivial importance you have no need to know that please yourself ill call you giancarlo im geoffrey i know what your name is it is arrison i know your name brutal going like running up a bloody sandhill remember the shooter if you dont want the ketchup running out of your armpit how far are you going to want me to drive giancarlo you must drive to rome uncertainty in the boys voice unwilling to be pulled through the wet clothes wringer with his plan how fars rome perhaps eight hundred kilometres jesus you will drive all the time we will only stop when the day comes its a hell of a way arent you taking a turn i watch you and the gun watches you eh arrison the boy mocked him im not forgetting the gun giancarlo believe me im not forgetting it start again try another route geoffrey but youre going to have to talk to me otherwise ill be asleep if that happens its the ditch for all of us harrison giancarlo and his pistol all going to be wrapped round the ditch were going to have to find something to talk about you are tired a query anxiety something not considered not exactly fresh harrison allowed a flicker of sarcasm we should talk about yourself for starters the car bounced and veered on the uneven road surface even the autostrada the pride of a motoring society was in a creeping state of disrepair the last time the section had been resurfaced the contractor had paid heavily in contributions to the men in smart suits who interested themselves in such projects for the privilege of moving machines and men into the district he had cut hard into his profit margins economies had been made in the depth of the newly laid tarmac which the winter rains had bitten harrison clung to the wheel i told you my name is giancarlo right harrison did not turn from the windscreen and the road in front the smells of the two mingled closely till they were inseparable unifying them i am nineteen years old right i am not from these parts nor from rome no need any more for harrison to respond the floodgates were breaking and the atmosphere in the little car ensured it i am a fighter arrison i am a fighter for the rights and aspirations of the proletariat revolution in our group we fight against the corruption and rottenness of our society you live here and you know what you see with your eyes you are a part of the scum arrison you come from the multinational you control workers here but you have no commitment to the italian workers you are a leech to them try and comprehend him geoffrey because its not the time for argument we have seen the oppression of the gangsters of the democrazia cristiana and we fight to destroy them the communists who should be the voice of the workers are in the dc pockets the boy shook as he spoke as if the very words caused him pain i understand what you say giancarlo on the day that you were taken in rome by those calabresi pigs i was with the leader of our cell we were ambushed by the polizia they took our leader took her away in their chains and with their guns round her there was another man with us panicucci not of our ideology at first but recruited and loyal loyal as a fighting lion they shot panicucci like a dog where were you giancarlo far across the street she had told me to bring the newspapers i was too far from her i could not help i understand harrison spoke softly tuned to the failure of the boy he should not humiliate him i could not help i could do nothing and soon the little bastard will be crying thought harrison if the gun wasnt at his ribcage geoffrey harrison would have been laughing fit to bust saga of bloody heroism away across the road buying newspapers what sort of medal do you get for that one driving hard past the road to vibo valentia hammering over the bridge and the low reflected waters of the droughtstarved mesima river the one you call the leader tell me about her she is franca she is a lovely woman arrison she is a lady franca tantardini she is our leader she hates them and she fights them they will torture her in the name of their shitty democratic state they are bastards and they will hurt her and you love this girl giancarlo that deflated the boy seemed to prick him where the gas was densest i love her giancarlo whispered i love her and she loves me too we have been together in the bed i know how you feel giancarlo i understand you bloody liar geoffrey when did you last love a woman how long not that recently not last week bloody liar in the early days with violet that was something like love wasnt it something like i t she is beautiful she is a real woman very beautiful very strong i understand giancarlo i will liberate her from them the car swerved on the road swung out into the fast lane to wards the crash barriers harrisons hands had tightened on the wheel his arms had stiffened and were unresponsive clumsy you are going to liberate her together we are going to liberate her arrison harrison stared eyes gimlet clear out on to the ever diminishing road in his lights pinch yourself kick your arse push the bedclothes off and get dressed just a bloody nightmare it has to be he knew the answer but he asked the question how are we going to do it giancarlo you sit with me arrison we sit together they will give me back my franca and i will give you back to them it doesnt work like that not any m o r e not after moro you have to hope it is like that the cold back in his voice the ice chill that the boy could summon from the high ground not after the moro business they showed it t h e n they dont bend no negotiation then it is bad for you arrison where were you when moro was done at the university of rome and werent there any bloody newspapers there i know what happened harrison felt his control sliding and fought it his eyes were no longer on the road his head was swung towards the boy noses faces unshaven cheeks mouth breath all barely separated if thats your plan its lunatic that is my plan they wont give in a child can see that they will surrender because they are weak and soft fattened by their excesses they cannot win against the might of the proletariat they cannot resist the revolution of the workers when we have destroyed the system they will talk of this day god how do you tell him harrison said quietly chopping his words with emphasis they wont give in the boy screamed if they do not return her to me than i kill you the wail of the cornered mountain cat and the spittle flecked giancarlos chin please yourself then wasnt true wasnt real not happening to geoffrey harrison he had to escape from it had to find a freedom from the snarling hatred harrison swung the car hard to the right stamped his foot on the brake whistled to himself in tune with the tyre screech and wrenched the car to a halt the pistol was at his neck nestled against the vein that ran behind his ear lobe start again giancarlo hissed drive yourself harrison muttered sliding back in his seat folding his arms across his chest drive or i will shoot you thats your choice listen arrison listen to what i say the mouth was close to his ear competing for proximity with the gun barrel and the breath was hot and gusting in the boys anger at seminara at the town hall i left a message it was a communique in the name of the nuclei armati proletaria it will be read with care when it is found when the first people come in the morning with the message is your card they will know that i have you and later in the morning the barn will be found it will confirm also that i have taken you when they find the bodies i have no more need of you arrison i have no more need of you while they think that i hold you am i clear so why doesnt he do it harrison wondered not scruple not compassion didnt know and didnt ask the gun was harder against his skin and the defiance sagged not going to call the bluff are you geoffrey harrison engaged the gears flicked the ignition key and coasted away they would talk again later but not now not for many minutes giancarlo lit another cigarette and did not share it where the carabinieri lay close to the twostorey villa of antonio mazzotti they could hear without difficulty the stumbling account of the woman close to hysteria at the front door of the house she wore a cotton shift dress and a cardigan round her shoulders and rubber boots on her feet as if she had dressed in haste and the man she spoke with displayed his pyjama trousers beneath his dressinggown there had been a brief pause when mazzotti disappeared inside leaving the woman alone with her face bathed in light so that the carabinieri who knew the district and its people could recognize her when mazzotti came again to the door he was dressed and carried a doublebarrelled shotgun as they hurried down the road and on to the wood path the woman had clung to mazzottis arm and the volume of her tale in his ear had covered the following footsteps of the men in camouflage uniforms she had heard shots from the barn and knew her husband had work there that night she knew he stayed at the barn for signor mazzotti of what she had seen there she could not speak and her wailing roused the village dogs mazzotti made no attempt to silence her as if the enormity of what she described had stunned and shaken him when the carabinieri entered the barn the woman was prostrate on the body of her husband her arms cradling the viciously wounded head her face pressed to the coinsized exit wound in his temple mazzotti isolated by the flashlights had dropped his shotgun to the earth floor more light poured into the musty room and searched out the second body owning a face contorted by surprise and terror men had been left to guard the building till dawn while the capitano hurried with his prisoners to their jeeps within minutes of arriving at the palmi barracks the officer had telephoned to rome prised the home number of giuseppe carboni from an argumentative night clerk and was speaking to the policeman in his suburban flat twice carboni asked the same question twice he received the same deadening answer there was a chain from a roof beam with part of a handcuff attached that is the place the englishman could have been held but he was not there when we came a solitary car lonely on the road fast and free on the auto del sol closing on the ankle of italy the heel and toe left in its wake coming at speed geoffrey harrison and giancarlo battestini headed towards rome geoffrey and giancarlo and a p archie carpenter was at last asleep his hotel room was cruelly hot but he had lost the spirit to complain to the management about his reverberating airconditioner hed drunk more than hed intended in the restaurant michael charlesworth had been purging his guilt at the embassys stance by maintaining a high level in carpenters glass gin first followed by wine and after that the acid of the local brandy the talk had been of strings that could not be tugged of restrictions on action and initiative and they had talked late and long on the extraordinary mrs harrison violet known to them both who behaved as no one else would that they could imagine in those captured circumstances shes impossible quite impossible i just couldnt talk to her all i got for the trouble of going up there was a mouthful of abuse you didnt do as well as i did carpenter grinned she bloody near raped me that would have been a diversion shes off her rocker im not going back there not till we march old harrison through the door shove him at her and run i wonder why she didnt fancy me charlesworth had said and worked again on the brandy bottle violet harrison too was deep in sleep still and calm in the bed that she shared with her husband week after week month after month she had gone to bed early stripping her clothes off after the flight of the man from head office had dressed in a new nightgown silky and lacetrimmed that rode high round her thighs she wanted to sleep wanted to rest so that her face might not be lined with tiredness in the morning so that the crows feet would not be at her eyes geoffrey would understand geoffrey would not condemn her geoffrey wherever he was would not blame her would not pick up and cast the stone she would not be late again at the beach her legs wide and sprawled she slept on a clear bright star night with a small torch to guide them their bodies heaving their feet stumbling vanni and mario charged along the trail in the forest towards the rock face above the tree line word of what had happened at the barn and the villa of the capo raced in a community as small as cosoleto travelled by a spiders web of gently tapped doors calls from upper windows across the streets by telephone among those houses that possessed the instrument vanni had flung his clothes on his back snapped to his wife where he was going and run from the back door to the home of mario it was a path known to them since their childhood but the pace of the flight ensured bruised shins torn arms and guttural obscenities beyond the trees the way narrowed to little more than a goat track necessitating that they use their hands to pull them higher who could have been there vanni struggled on out of condition seeing no reason to reply who knew of the barn the persistence of shock and surprise consuming mario its certain its not the carabinieri vanni drew the air down into his lungs paused certain who could have been there mario wrung advantage from the rest spattered his questions no one from the villages here would have dared they would face the vendetta no one from these parts no one who knew the capo who could it have been cretino how do i know the climb was resumed slower and subdued towards a cave beneath an escarpment the bolthole of vanni past five in the morning the discreet banging at his door woke francesco vellosi in the attics of the viminale were the angled ceiling closets where men in haste who coveted the clock could sleep he had worked late after the attack calming himself with his papers and neither he nor his guards were happy that he should drive back to his home and the death of his driver the killing of mauro had rid him of his desire for the comforts of his flat at the second persistence of the knocking he had called on the man to enter sitting on his bed naked but for a pale blue vest his hair ragged his chin alive with the growth of the small hours he had focused on the messenger who brought blinding light into the room and a buff folder of papers the man excused himself was full of apologies for disturbing the dottore the file had been given him by the men in operations in the basements of the building he knew nothing of the contents had simply been dismissed on an errand vellosi reached from his bed took the folder and waved that the messenger should leave when the door was closed he began to read there was a note of explanation handwritten and stapled to the long telex screed signed by the night duty officer a man known to vellosi not one who would waste the capos time workmen had come at four in the morning to the offices of the mayor of the town of seminara in calabria the message reproduced on the telex was the text of what they had found along with an american express credit card in the name of geoffrey harrison it was the work of a few seconds for him to absorb the contents of the communique god how many more of these things how much longer the agony of these irrelevances in the lifespan of poor tottering brokennosed italia after the pain and division of the last one after the affair of moro was all this to be inflicted again dressing with one hand shaving with the battery razor provided thoughtfully beside the washbasin vellosi hurried towards the premature day the fools must know there could be no concessions if they had not weakened for the elder statesman of the republic how could they crumble now for a businessman for a foreigner for a life whose passing would hold no lasting climax idiots fools lunatics these people why because they must know there cannot be surrender what if they have judged right what if their analysis of the malaise and sickness of italia were more perceptive than that of francesco vellosi what if they had discerned that the country could not again endure the strained preoccupation of sitting out ultimatums deadlines and photographs of prospective widows was he confident in the sinew of the state over his body they would free franca tantardini let the bitch out to fiumicino bend the constitution for her not as long as he held his job not as long as he headed the antiterrorist squad badly shaven temper rising he headed for the stairs that would lead him to his office his aides would be at home in their beds the dawn meetings with the minister with the procurator with the carabinieri generals with the men handling the harrison affair at the questura would have to be scheduled by himself the route to a coronary vellosi told himself the sure and steady road he tripped on the narrow steps and cursed aloud in his frustration chapter twelve the first spars of light pushed across the inland foothills greying the road in front of harrison and giancarlo a watercolour brush dabbed on the land softening with pastel the darkness the grim hour of the day when men who have not slept dread the hours of withering brightness that will follow they wound down from the hills running from the mountains as if the sniff of the sea had excited them towards the beaches of salerno for more than an hour they had not spoken each wrapped in his committed hostile silence a fearful quiet lulled only by the throb of the small engine harrison wondered whether the boy slept but the breathing was never regular and there were the sudden movements beside him that meant lack of comfort lack of calm perhaps he thought it would be simple to disarm him perhaps a soldier a man of action would risk all on a sudden swerve a quick braking and a fast grapple for the p but youre neither of those geoffrey the most violent thing hed ever accomplished in his adult life was to kick that bucket at the guerrillas in the barn and a smack at violet once just once not hard thats all geoffrey all your offensive experience not the stuff of heroes but it isnt in your chemistry and for heroes read bloody idiots geoffrey harrison had never in his life met the dedicated activist the political attack weapon it was something new to him of which he had only limited understanding newspaper photographs yes plenty of those wanted men captured and chained men dead men on the pavement but all inadequate and failing those images when it came to this boy theyre not stupid not this one anyway he worked out a plan and he executed it found you when half the police in the country were on the same job and late at the post this isnt a gutter kid from the shanties down on the tevere banks a gutter kid wouldnt argue hed have killed for the stopping of the car giancarlo im very tired we have to talk about something if i dont talk well go off the road there was no sudden start no stirring at the breaking of the quiet the boy had not been asleep the possibility of action had not been there harrison felt better for that you are driving very well we have covered more than half the distance now much more than half the boy sounded alert and prepared for conversation harrison blundered in are you a student giancarlo i was some years ago i was a student sufficient as a reply giving nothing what did you study humour the little pig humour and amuse him i studied psychology at the university of rome i did not complete my first year when the students of my class were taking their first year examinations i was held a political prisoner in the regina coeli gaol i was a part of a struggle group i was fighting against the borghese administration when the fascist police imprisoned me cant they speak another language harrison thought are they reduced only to the compilation of slogans and manifestos where do you come from giancarlo where is your home my home was in the covo with franca before that my home was in the b wing of the regina coeli where my friends were harrison spoke without thought he was too tired to pick his words and his throat was hoarse and sore even from this slight effort where your parents were where you spent your childhood that was what i meant by home we use different words arrison i do not call that my home i was in chains again the warm spittle spread on harrisons face im very tired giancarlo i want to talk so that we dont crash and i want to understand you but you dont have to give me that jargon harrison yawned not for effect not as a gesture giancarlo laughed out loud the first time harrison had heard the rich little treble chime you pretend to be a fool arrison i ask you a question answer me the truth and i will know you answer me if you were a boy who lived in italy if you were from privilege of the dc if you had seen the children in the popular quarter in their rags if you had seen the hospitals if you had seen the rich playing at the villas and with their yachts if you had seen those things would you not fight that is my question arrison would you not fight the dawn came faster now the probes of sunlight spearing across the road and there were other cars on the autostrada passing or being passed i would not fight giancarlo harrison said slowly with the crushing weariness surging again and his eyes cluttered with headlights i would not have the courage to say that i am right that my word is law i would need greater authority than a bloody pistol drive on and be careful on the road the attack of the angered wasp as if a stick had penetrated the nest and thrashed about and roused the ferocity of the swarm you will learn my courage arrison you will learn it at nine oclock if the pigs that you slave for have not met nine tomorrow morning harrison spoke distantly his attention on the tail lights in front and the dazzled centre mirror above him you give them little time time only for them to express your value away to the left were the lights daubed on the bay of naples harrison veered to the right and followed the white arrows on the road to the north and rome another dawn another bright fresh morning and giuseppe carboni alive with the lemon juice in his mouth arrived at the viminale by taxi it was a long time since he had been to the ministry for many months there had been no reason for him to desert the unprepossessing questura for the eminence of the top table the building that housed the minister of the interior and his attendant apparatus his chin was down on his tie his eyes on his shoes as he paid off the driver this was a place where only the idiot felt safe where the knives were sharp and the criticism cutting here the sociologists and the criminologists and the penologists held court and rule was by university diploma and qualification by breeding and connection because this was close to power the real power that the questura did not know carboni was led up the stairs a debutante introduced at a dance his humour was poor his mind only slightly receptive when he reached the door of francesco vellosi who had summoned him he knew of vellosi by title and reputation a wellknown name in the pubblica sicurezza with a history of clean firmness to embellish it the one who had made a start at cleaning the drains of crime in reggio calabria ordered significant arrests and not bowed to intimidation but the corridor gossip had it that he delighted in public acclamation and sought out the cameras and microphones and the journalists notebooks carboni himself shunned publicity and was suspicious of fast won plaudits but the man across the desk appealed to him vellosi was in his shirtsleeves glasses down on his nose cigarette limp between his lips in the gesture of the tired lover tie loosened and his jacket away on a chair across the room no reek of aftershave no scent of armpit lotion and already a wellfilled ashtray in front of him vellosi was studying the papers that piled up on the desk carboni waited then coughed the obligatory indication of his presence vellosis eyes fixed on him dottore carboni thank you for coming and so soon i had not expected you for another hour i came immediately i had dressed as you know carboni from this office i manage the affairs of the antiterrorist unit the rapid patter had begun if one can make such a distinction i am concerned with affairs political rather than criminal it was to be expected that time would be consumed before they arrived at the reason for the meeting carboni was not disturbed obviously i know the work that is done from this office and now it seems that our paths cross which is rare seldom do criminal activities link with those of terrorism it has happened carboni replied noncommittal watchful the bird high on its perch an englishman has been kidnapped it happened two mornings ago i am correct vellosis chin was buried in his hands as he gazed hard across the desk an englishman from one of the big multinational companies that have an operation in italy tell me please carboni what was your opinion of that case there was something to be wary of carboni paused before speaking i have no reason to believe that the kidnapping was not the work of criminals the style of the attack was similar to that previously used the limited descriptions of the men who took part indicated an age that is not usually common among the political people they were in their thirties or more a ransom demand was made that we have linked with a previous abduction a further connection has been found with the office of a speculator in calabria there is nothing to make me doubt that it was a criminal affair you have been fortunate you have come far carboni loosened the man opposite him talked like a human being playing down the superiority of his rank the man from the questura felt a freedom to express himself last night i was able to ask the carabinieri of palmi near reggio to keep a watch on this speculator his name is mazzotti from the village of cosoleto he has connections in local politics i acted without a warrant from the magistrate but the time would not allow if i might digress a man was found yesterday in a roman pensione battered to death he had a record for kidnapping his family is from cosoleto i return to the point the carabinieri behaved faultlessly carboni permitted himself a slow smile one policeman to another histories of rivalry with the paramilitary force mutual understanding on the scale of the compliment the carabinieri followed mazzotti to a barn he was taken there by a woman who had heard sounds in the night the womans husband was dead there shot at close range another man also had been killed there were signs of a temporary holding place flattened down hay bales and there was a chain with a manacle a pistol vellosi had been used to break the lock of the handcuff it had been broken by gunshot we did not find harrison nor any trace of him vellosi nodded his head the picture unveiled the drape drawn back what conclusion carboni did you draw from this information someone came to the barn and killed the two men that he might have harrison for himself it was not a rescue since there have been no messages from the south of harrisons arrival at a police station or a carabinieri barracks i checked before i left my home i cannot draw an ultimate conclusion the head of the antiterrorist squad hunched forward voice lowered and conspiratorial as if in a room such as his there were listening places last night i was attacked ambushed as i left my home and my driver killed vellosi understood from the stunned frowns building and edging across carbonis forehead that he knew nothing of the evenings horror i survived unhurt we have identified the swine who killed my driver they are nappisti carboni they were young they were inefficient and they died for it i congratulate you on your escape carboni whispered i mourn my driver he was a friend of many years i believe i was attacked as a reprisal for the capture of the woman franca tantardini taken by my squad in the corso francia she is an evil bitch carboni a poisoned evil woman carboni recovered composure it was a fine effort by your people i have told you nothing yet hear me out before you praise me there is a town seminara in calabria i have no map but we will find i am sure that it is close to your cosoleto under the mayors door an hour ago was found a scribbled statement not typed not neat from the nap a credit card of harrison was with the paper they will kill him tomorrow morning at nine oclock if tantardini has not been freed carboni whistled an expiry of wind from his lungs his pen fumbled between the fingers of his two hands his notebook was virgin clean i make an assumption carboni the nappisti reached your man claudio they extracted information they have taken harrison from the custody of mazzotti the danger now confronting the englishman is infinitely greater with his head bowed carboni sat very still in his chair as if a heavy blow had struck him what has been done this morning to prevent an escape nothing has been done a snarl from vellosis mouth and above it the cauterized cheeks the whitened skin at the temples nothing has been done because until we sat together there was no dialogue on this issue i have no army i have no authority over the polizia and the carabinieri i do not have the numbers to stifle an escape i have given you the nappisti and you have given me a location and now we can begin carboni spoke sadly unwilling to stamp on the energy of his superior they have five hours start on us and they were close to the autostrada and at night the road is free his head shook as he multiplied kilometres and minutes in his mind they could travel hundreds of kilometres in a fast car the whole of the mezzo giorno is open to t h e m he tailed away awed by the hopelessness of what he said bluster the local carabinieri the polizia breathe some fire under their backsides get back to your office now and hunt the facts shouting now consumed by his mission vellosi banged on his desk to emphasize each point it is outside my jurisdiction what do you want a rule book and harrison dead in a ditch at five minutes past nine tomorrow get yourself on to the fifth floor at the questura all the computers all the honeywell machines there get them moving let them earn their keep resistance failing carboni subsided may i make a telephone call dottore make it and be on your way youre not the only one to be busy this morning the minister will be here in forty minutes carboni was on his feet galvanized into activity with quick sweaty fingers he flicked in his diary of telephone numbers for that of michael charlesworth of the british embassy the early sun was denied entry to the reception lounge of the villa wolkonsky by the drawn drapes the more fancied of the rooms collection of rare porcelain had been put away the night before because there had been a small reception and the ambassadors wife was ever wary of light fingers among her guests there remained enough to satisfy the curiosity of charlesworth and carpenter as they stood close to each other in the gloom they had come unannounced to the ambassadors residence spurred by giuseppe carbonis call to charlesworth sketching the nights developments the diplomat had collected carpenter from his hotel a servant in a white coat not hiding his disapproval of the hour had admitted them if we broadcast were on our way charlesworth had said in the car then the barricades go up hell stall till office hours the irritation of the ambassador was undisguised as he entered the room a puckered forehead and a jutting chin sand wiched the hawk eyes of annoyance he wore his familiar dark striped trousers but no jacket to drape over the braces that held them firm his collar was unfastened the opening was abrupt good morning charlesworth i understand from the message sent upstairs that you wished to see me on a matter of direct and pressing importance lets not waste each others time in the face of this salvo charlesworth did not falter ive brought with me archie carpenter hes the security officer of international chemical holdings in london his excellencys eyes glinted a bare greeting i have just been telephoned by dottore carboni of the questura there have been disturbing and unpleasant developments in the harrison c a s e carpenter said quietly we judged that you should know of these whatever the inconvenience of the hour the ambassador threw him a glance then turned back to charlesworth lets have it then the police have always believed harrison was kidnapped by a criminal organization during the night it seems this organization was relieved of harrison who is now in the hands of the nuclei armati proletaria what do you mean relieved it seems that the nap have forcibly taken harrison from his original kidnappers said charlesworth with patience the police are offering this as a theory we are to believe this spoken with the killer chop of sarcasm yes sir carpenter again interjected we believe it because there are three men on their backs in the morgue to convince us two have died of gunshot wounds the third of a dented skull the ambassador retreated coughed wiped his head with a handkerchief and waved his visitors to chairs whats the motive he said simply charlesworth took his cue the nap demand that by nine tomorrow morning central european time the italian government shall release the captured terrorist franca t a n t a r d i n i the ambassador sitting far to the front of the intricately carved chair reeled forward oh my god go on charlesworth dont spare the rod the italian government shall release franca tantardini or geoffrey harrison will be killed in a few minutes the minister of the interior will get his first briefing i imagine that within twenty you will be called to the viminale rock still his head in his tired aged hands the ambassador contemplated neither charlesworth nor carpenter interrupted the buck had been passed for a full minute the silence burgeoned causing charlesworth to feel for the straightness of his tie knot carpenter to look at his unpolished shoes and the lace that was loose the ambassador shook himself as if to dislodge the burden it is a decision for the italian government to make any interference any pressure on our part would be quite unwarranted indeed any suggestion of action would be quite uncalled for so you wash your hands of harrison carpenter was flushed as he spoke temper surging i dont think thats what the ambassador m e a n t charlesworth cut in unhappily thank you charlesworth but i can justify my own statements the ambassador said we dont wash our hands of the fate of mr harrison as you put it mr carpenter we face the reality of local conditions when this was a criminal matter when there was only money at issue then we were prepared to deal your company was prepared to negotiate mr carpenter the british foreign office remained uninvolved whats so bloody different between a couple of million dollars and freedom for one woman thanks to all that bloody brandy that charlesworth had plied him with he couldnt marshal his sentences couldnt hit at the smug little sober bastard opposite him the frustration welled in his mind dont shout at me mr carpenter the ambassador was cold aloof on his pedestal the situation is indeed different before as you rightly say only money was involved now we add principle and with that the sovereign dignity of the republic of italy it is inconceivable that the government here can bow to so crude a threat and release a public enemy of the stature of the tantardini woman it is equally inconceivable that the government of great britain should urge such a course i say again you wash your hands of geoffrey harrison youre prepared to see him sacrificed for the dignity of italy whatever bloody nonsense that is carpenter looked across to charles worth for an ally but he had been anticipated and the gaze was averted well thank you gentlemen thank you for your time im sorry you were disturbed that the day started badly and early carpenter stood up a little pencil of froth at the sides of his mouth youre putting our man down the bloody bog and youre pulling the bloody chain on him and i think its bloody marvellous there was a passionless mask across the ambassadors features and he stayed far back in his chair we merely face reality mr carpenter and reality will dictate that if the losers in this matter are to be either geoffrey harrison or the republic of italy then it will be harrison who loses if that is the conclusion then the life of one man is of lesser importance than the lasting damage to the social and political fabric of a great and democratic country that is how i see it mr carpenter its a load of b u l l s h i t your rudeness neither offends me nor helps harrison i think we should be on our way archie charlesworth too was standing ill see you later in the office sir when they were out in the sunshine and walking towards the car charlesworth saw that there were tears streaming down archie carpenters face for several minutes harrison had been watching the jumping needle of the fuel dial that bounced against the left corner of the display arc bringing him the knowledge that the tank was drying emptying he wondered how the boy would react to the idea that the car would soon be static and useless considered whether he should alert him to the impending halt of their progress or whether he should simply drive on till the engine coughed and died barren of petrol it depended what he wanted from it whether it was a fight or whether it was the easy way and safety however temporary tell him now that they were about to stop on the hard shoulder and perhaps the boy wouldnt panic would work at his options allow it to happen and the boy might crumble under a crisis and that was dangerous because of the ready presence of the p same old question geoffrey same old situation to confront or to bend and no middle road same old answer geoffrey dont shake it dont rock it dont kick the bucket of muck in his face because thats the short way to pain and the guns close and armed we wont be going much further giancarlo harrisons softly spoken words boomed in the quiet of the car beside him the boy straightened from his lowslung sitting posture the gun barrel dug at harrisons ribs as if demanding explanation were almost out of petrol the boys head in its curled and tangled hair darted across harrisons chest to study the dial harrison eased back in his seat gave him more room and heard his breathing speed and rise theres not much more in the old girl giancarlo perhaps a few more kilometres the boy lifted his head and the hand that did not hold the gun scraped at his chin as if this were a way to summon inspiration and clarity of decision its not my fault giancarlo silence the boy snapped back just the breathing to mingle with the steady purr of the little engine and time too for harrison to think and consider behind their different walls the man and the boy entertained the same thoughts what would a stoppage mean to the security of the journey what risk would it offer giancarlo of identification and subsequent pursuit what possibility of escape would it present to his prisoner and its not only the boy with decisions to make geoffrey its you as well he couldnt be as vigilant could he if they were stopped on the roadside pulled into a toll gate going in search of a petrol station opportunities were going to loom opportunities for flight for a struggle then hell shoot sure cant be sure but likely worth a try whether hell shoot or not perhaps if the opportunitys there thats the crawling way out thats the gutless way for christs sake its not a bloody virility contest its my bloody life its my bloody stomach with the p stuck into it its my neck with the axe hanging over it its not gesture time i said perhaps that should bloody be enough you wont do it you wont take him on you wont fight perhaps but only if it presents itself we take the monte cassino turnoff giancarlo was out of his dream breaking harrisons debate high above them to the right of the autostrada perched the triumphant monastery it loomed on the mountain top a widows shrine for women of many far countries whose men had staggered and fallen distant years back under the rain of shrapnel and explosive and bullet swathes the car plunged past the signs for the turnoff giancarlo raised himself in his seat and pulled from a hip pocket a wad of notes and the autostrada toll ticket taken hundreds of kilometres back from a machine i had not thought of the petrol he laughed with a quick nervousness a drip of weakness before the tap was turned tighter arrison you will not be silly you will pay the ticket the gun will be at you all the time you are not concerned with what will happen to me you are concerned with what will happen to yourself if you are silly then you are dead whether i am too does not help you you understand arrison yes giancarlo harrison pulled the wheel hard to the right felt the tyres bite beneath him heard their squeal and the pace of the autostrada diminished from his windscreen mirror he had slowed the car as they wound on the tight bend towards the toll gate giancarlo reached back to the seat behind and grabbed at his light anorak arranged it over his lower arm and his fist and the gun and again pressured the barrel into the softness at harrisons waist you dont speak what if he talks to me harrison stammered the tension exuding from the boy spread contagiously i will talk to him if it is necessary if i fire the pistol from here i kill you arrison i know giancarlo perhaps but only if it presents itself you know the answer geoffrey he pressed the brake as the cabins of the toll gate loomed in front of him he stopped the car as the bonnet edged against the narrow barrier carefully wound down the window and without looking passed the ticket and a banknote out into the cool dawn air grazie the voice startled harrison contact again with the real and the permanent life contact with the clean and the familiar his eyes followed his arm but there was no face in his vision only a hand that was dark and haircovered with a worn greasy palm that took his money and was gone before snaking back with a fist full of coins it had not presented itself the gun gouged at his flesh and the man would not even have seen their faces the voice beside him was shrill una stazione de servizio per benzina cinquen cento metri grazie prego the barrier was raised harrison edged the car into gear shouldnt he have crashed the gears stalled the engine dropped the change in the roadway shouldnt he have done something but the gun was there round and penetrating at the skin all right for those who dont know all right for those without experience let them come and sit here let them find their own answers to cowardice within moments the lights of a petrol station shone at them in the half light diffused with the growing sun you follow my instructions exactly yes giancarlo go to the far pumps where it was darkest where the light was masked by the building harrison stopped giancarlo waited till the handbrake was applied the gear in neutral before his hand snaked out at speed to rip the keys from the ignition he snapped open his door thrust it shut behind him and jogged around the back of the car till he was at harrisons door he held his anorak across his waist with an innocence that was above suspicion harrison saw a man in the blue overalls of agip stroll without urgency towards the car venti mila lire di benzina per fa vore s i would he look into the car would the curiosity bred from the long night hours cause him to turn from the boy who stood beside the drivers door and wish to examine the occupant why should it why should he care who drives a car this has to be the moment geoffrey now right now not next time not next week how fling the door open crash it into giancarlos body youd knock him back with it hed fall hed slip for how long long enough to run sure well not sure but its a chance and how far do you run before hes on his feet five metres its the opportunity then he shoots and he doesnt miss not this kid and who else is here other than a halfasleep idiot with his eyes closed wholl have to play the hero giancarlo passed the man the notes and waited as he walked away then hissed through the window i am going to walk round the car if you move i will shoot it is no problem through the glass do not move arrison only if it presents itself geoffrey harrison felt the great weakness creeping into his knees and shins lapping in his stomach his tongue smeared a dampness across his lips youd have been dead geoffrey if youd tried anything you know that dont you he supposed he did supposed he had been sensible behaved in the intelligent responsible way that came from education and experience wouldnt have lasted long on that mountainside in geoffrey wouldnt have lasted five bloody minutes beneath the triumphant monastery on monte cassino giancarlo ordered harrison to turn off the autostrada he held the pistol hidden between his legs as harrison paid the sleepy toll attendant at the barrier with the money the boy had given him they drove sharply through the small town rebuilt from the ravages of bombardment into a characterless warren of flat blocks and factories and headed north on a narrow road among the rock defiles ever watched by the great whitestone eye on the mountain top they bypassed the sombre war cemetery for the german dead of a battle fought before the birth of giancarlo and harrison and then the roads turns became more vicious and the high banks more intrusive three kilometres beyond the rugged message of the graveyard cross giancarlo indicated an open field gate through which they should turn the car lurched over the bare grass covering the hardened ground and was lost to sight behind a gorse hedge of brilliant yellow flowers shepherds might come here or the men who watched the goat flocks but the chance was reasonable in giancarlos mind among the grass and weed and climbing thistle and the bushes of the hillside they would rest rome lay just one hundred and twentyfive kilometres away they had done well they had made good time with the car stationary giancarlo moved briskly the flex that he had found in the glove compartment in one hand the pistol in the other he followed harrison between the gorse clumps he ordered him down pushed him without unkindness on to his stomach and then kneeling with the gun between his thighs bound harrisons hands across the small of his back the legs next working at the ankles wrapping the flex around them weaving it tight binding the knot he walked a few paces away and urinated noisily in the grass and was watching the rivulets when he realized he had not offered the englishman the same chance he shrugged and put it from his mind he had no feelings for his prisoner the man was just a vehicle just a machine for bringing him closer to his franca harrisons eyes were already closed the breathing deep and regular as the sleep sped to him giancarlo watched the slow rise and fall of his shoulders and the gaping mouth that was not irritated by the nibbling attendance of a fly he put the gun on the grass and scrabbled with his fingers at the buckle of his belt and at the elastic waist of his underpants franca darling sweet lovely franca i am coming franca and we will be together always together franca and you will love me for what i have done for you love me too my beautiful love me giancarlo subsided on the grass and the sun played on his face and there was a light wind and the sound of the flying creatures the p was close to his hand and the boy lay still chapter thirteen giancarlo asleep seemed little more than a child hurt by exhaustion and dragged nerves coiled gently his real age was betrayed by the premature haggardness of his face the witness to his participation in the affairs of men his left forearm acted as a shield to the climbing sun and his right hand was buried in the grass fingers among the leaves and stalks and across the handle of the p he was dreaming the fantasy was of success the images were of achievement tossed and tumbling through his febrile mind were the pictures of the moment of triumph he would win an indulgent masturbation of excitement sharp pictures and vivid men in blue fiat saloons hurrying with escorts of outriders to the public buildings of the capital men who pushed their way past avalanches of cameras and microphones with anger at their mouths rooms that were heavy in smoke and argument where the talk was of giancarlo battestini and franca tantardini and the nap crisis in the air crisis that was the embryo of chaos crisis that was spawned and conceived from the sperm of the little fox papers would be set in front of the men and pens made ready by the acolytes at their shoulders official stamps weighty and embossed with eagles would clamp down on the scrawl of the signatures the order would be made franca would be freed plucked clear from the enemy by the hand of her boy and her lover the order would be made in giancarlos dreaming and restless mind there was no doubt because he had done so much he had come so far he had done so much and they could not deny him the pleasure of his prize there was one more element among the images of the boy sleeping in the field there was a prison gate dominating the skyline and shadowing the street beneath and doors that would swing slowly open dragged apart against their will by the hands of giancarlo there was a column of police cars sirens and lights bright on a july morning bringing his franca free she sat like a queen among them contempt in her eyes for the truncheons and beretta pistols and machineguns franca coming to freedom it would be the greatest victory ever achieved by the nap loving himself loving his dream giancarlo groped downwards with his right hand urging his thoughts to the diminishing memory of his franca conjuring again her body and the sunswept skin and the spell was broken the mirror cracked the dream was gone with the speed of a disturbed tiger at a waterhole a blur of light a memory and a ripple lost and wrecked vanished and destroyed trembling in his anger giancarlo sat up giancarlo giancarlo geoffrey harrison had called i want to pee and i cant the way im tied harrison saw the fury in the boys face the neck veins in relief the intensity of the little swine frightened him the loathing that was communicated across the few metres of stone and burned field flowers he wormed back from confrontation i have to pee giancarlo its not much to ask the boy stood up uncertain for a moment on his feet then collected himself he scanned all the surroundings as if they were unfamiliar to him and in need of further checks to establish his security he examined the long depth to the horizon breaking the fields and low stone walls and distant farm buildings into sectors to vet them more thoroughly harrison could see that the boy was rested that sleep had alerted and revived him he used a bush of gorse with yellowpetalled flowers to screen himself from the road as he looked around there was something slow and workmanlike and hugely sinister about his calm better to have tied a knot in it or soaked his trousers harrison thought than to have woken him giancarlo walked towards him feet light on the springy grass avoiding the stones set deep in the earth the hand with the gun extended aimed at harrisons chest dont worry dont point it im not playing heroes giancarlo the boy moved behind harrison and he heard the scuff of his feet theres a good lad giancarlo you know how it is im fit to bloody burst you know the blow was fierce agonizing and without warning the full force of the canvas toecap of giancarlos right shoe digging into the flesh that formed the protective wall for the kidneys the pain was instant blending with the next stab as the following kick came in fast and sharp three in all and harrison slid on to his side you little pig vicious bullying little pig the words were gasped out strained and hoarse and the breath was hard to find more pain more hurt because the wounds of the men in the barn were aroused again and mingled with the new bruising harrison looked up into the boys eyes and they bounced his gaze back with something animal something primitive where do they make them these bloody creatures wheres the production line wheres the factory deadened and unresponsive and cruel wheres the bloody stone theyre bred under slowly and with deliberation the boy bent down behind harrison the barrel of the pistol indenting the skin where it was smooth and hairless behind the ear with his free hand giancarlo untied the flex it was the work of a few moments and then harrison felt the freedom come again to his wrists and ankles the shock surge of the blood running free he didnt wait to be told but rose unsteadily to his feet he walked a halfdozen paces with a drunken gait and flicked at his zipfastener the spurting draining relief thats what it had come down to ten minutes of negotiation a kicking a gun at the back of his head all that because he wanted to pee to spend a penny as violet would have said being pulled down into the cesspool being animalized he looked down into the clear reflecting pool in front of his feet and in a moment of hesitation between surges saw the traces of his own concerned and wrungout face geoffrey we want to go home were not fighters old lad were not like those who can just sit in a limbo and be pushed and tugged by the wind were just a poor little bloody businessman who doesnt give a stuff about exploitation and revolution and the rights of the proletariat a poor little bloody businessman who wants to wrestle with output and production and raw materials the things that pay for summer holidays and the clothes on violets back and a few quid to go on top of a widowed mothers pension its not our war geoffrey not our bloody fight harrison shook himself swayed on his feet pulled up the zip and turned his hips so that he could see behind him his movements were careful designed to cause no alarm the boy was watching him impassive and with as much emotion as a whitewashed wall the two of them devoid of relationship without mutual sympathy stared at each other hed kill you as hed stamp on a dragonfly geoffrey and it wouldnt move him wouldnt halt his sleep afterwards thats why he doesnt communicate because the bastard doesnt need to what are we going to do now harrison asked in a small voice the boy stood out of arms reach but close another gesture from the arm that held the pistol and they walked the few metres towards the car where are we going harrison said giancarlo laughed opening his mouth so that harrison saw the fillings of his teeth and felt the stench of his breath this is the way the jews went to the cattle trucks in the railway sidings without a struggle making obeisance to their guards thought harrison understand geoffrey how they forsook resistance youre gutless lad and you know it thats what hurts he opened the door of the car climbed in and watched giancarlo walk round the front of the engine the keys were exchanged the p took up position by his ribcage the brake was eased off the gears engaged harrison headed the car back towards the road its headlights shining vainly in the morning brilliance a white alfetta swept down the sloping crescent of the driveway outside the viminale an identical car with the smoked halfinchthick windows and reinforced bodywork had latched itself close behind the worrying terrier that must not leave its quarry alone among the members of the italian government the minister of the interior had discarded the midnight blue fleet of fiat s after the kidnapping of the president of his party for him and his bodyguards bulletproof transport was decreed the minister had said in public that he detested the hermetically sealed capsule in which he was ferried in high summer from one quarter of the city to another but after the chorus of interservice recrimination that followed the attack on the vulnerable moro car and the massacre of his fiveman escort the ministers preferences mattered little with siren blaring and driving the motorists on quattro fontane languidly aside the alfetta plied through the mounting traffic the driver was hunched in his concentration left hand steady on the wheel the right resting loosely on the gear stick beside the driver the ministers senior guard cradled a shortbarrelled machinegun on his lap one magazine attached two more on the floor between his feet for the minister and his guest the british ambassador conversation was difficult each clinging to the thong straps above the darkened side windows the ambassador was travelling at the ministers invitation his presence hurriedly requested would he care to be briefed on the situation concerning the businessman harrison while the minister was in transit between his offices and those of the prime minister somewhere lost behind them in the dash and verve of the roman streets was the embassy rolls that would collect the ambassador from palazzo chigi public men both of them and so they were jacketed the italian sported a red silk tie above his blue shirt the ambassador favoured the broad colour bands of his wartime cavalry unit the two men were stifled near to suffocation with the heat in the closed car and the minister showed his irritation that he should be the cause of his guests discomfort his apologies were waved aside and there was the little clucking of the tongue that meant the problem was inconsequential unlike many of his colleagues the minister spoke english fluently and with little of the mediterranean accent an educated and lucid man a professor of law an author of books he explained the nights events to the ambassador and so sir we have at our doors another nightmare we have another journey into the abyss of despair that after the murder of our friend aldo moro we hoped never to see again for all of us then in the council of ministers and in the directorate of the democrazia cristiana the decision to turn our backs on our friend provoked a bitter and horrible moment we all prayed hard for guidance then all of us sir we walked across to church from the deliberations at the piazza gesii and as one we went on our knees and prayed for gods guidance if he gave it to us he manifested himself in his own and peculiar way his message bearer was berlinguer it was the secretarygeneral of our communist party who informed us that the infant understanding between his party and ours could not survive vacillation the pci dictated that there could be no concession to the brigate rosse the demand that we release thirteen of their nominees from gaol was rejected the chance to save one of the great men of our country was lost who can apportion victory and defeat between ourselves and the brigatisti the minister mopped a smear of sweat from his neck with a handkerchief scented with cologne sufficiently to offend the ambassadors nostrils the monologue the exposition of the days business continued now we must make more decisions and first we must decide whether we follow the same rules as before or whether we offer a different response the hostage on this occasion is not an italian nor is he a public figure who could by some be held accountable for the society in which we live the hostage now is a guest and totally without responsibility for the conditions that unhappily prevail in our country i wont elaborate i turn to the nature of the ransom demanded one prisoner one only thirteen we could not countenance but one we might swallow though the bone would stick but swallow it we could if we had to the ambassador rocked pensively in his seat they had cut down the curved hill from the quirinale and surged with noise and power across the piazza venezia scattering the locust swarms of jeaned and tshirted tourists not for him to reply at this stage not till his specific opinion was required the minister sighed as if he had hoped for the load to be shared and realized with regret that he must soldier on we would be very loath to lose your mr harrison and very loath to lose the tantardini woman we believe we should do everything within our power to save mr harrison the dilemma is whether everything in our power constitutes interference in the judicial process against tantardini the ambassador peered down at the hands in his lap with respect minister that is a decision the italian government must take you would pass it all to us the ambassador recited anything else would be the grossest interference in the internal affairs of a longstanding and respected friend the minister smiled grimly without enjoyment we have very little time ambassador so my questions to you will be concise there should be ho misunderstandings i agree the minister savoured his question before speaking the critical one the reason that he had invited the ambassador to travel with him is it likely that her majestys government will make an appeal to us to barter the woman tantardini with the intention of saving harrisons life most unlikely the ambassador was sure and decisive we would not wish to take a course of action and afterwards receive a request from whitehall for a different approach i repeat minister it is most unlikely that we would ask for the freeing of tantardini the minister looked with his jaded blue eyes at the ambassador a dab of surprise at his mouth you are a hard p e o p l e you value principle highly it does not have much merit in our society my government does not believe in bowing to the coercion of terrorism i put another hypothesis to you if we refuse to negotiate with the nappisti for the freedom of tantardini and if as a consequence harrison dies would we be much criticized in britain for the hard line la linea dura as we would say most unlikely the ambassador held the ministers questioning glance unswerving and without deviation the reply clear as a pistol shot we are not a strong country ambassador we prefer to circumvent obstacles that fall across our path we do not have the mentality of your cavalry we do not raise our sabres and charge our enemy we seek to avoid him the car came fast to a halt and the driver and bodyguard leaned back to unfasten the locks on the rear doors out on the cobbled courtyard of the palazzo chigi the ambassador breathed in the clean freshened air and dried his hands on his trouser crease the minister had not finished busily he led the ambassador into the centre of the yard where the sun was bright and where there was none who could overhear their words the minister held the ambassadors elbow tightly without a request from your government there is no reason for our cabinet even to consider the options over tantardini you know what i am saying to you of course you value the point of principle we value that consideration the ambassador said quietly and with no relish the minister pressed principle even when the only beneficiary could be the republic of i t a l y still it would be important to us the ambassador pulled at his tie wanting relief from its grip a man came to see me earlier this morning he is a representative of harrisons firm and i told him what i have told you he called me pilate he said i was washing my hands of his man perhaps he is right i can only give my opinion but i think it will be ratified by london the minister still sombre still clinging to the ambassadors arm as if unwilling to break away for his cabinet colleagues waiting upstairs said if we refuse to release tantardini i do not think we will see harrison again the ambassador accepted his opinion nodded gravely i will relay your view to whitehall the two men stood together the ambassador disproportionately taller high frescoes in centuriesold paint leered down at them mocking their transitory plans for history both perspired both were too preoccupied to wash away the moisture beads we understand each other my friend i will tell my colleagues that the british ask for no deal no barter no negotiation and whatever happens we win the victory of principle the ambassador interrupted his short choked laugh i am sure that defence would send the special air service the closequarter attack squad as they did for moro they could be here this afternoon if it were helpful the minister seemed to snort give his judgement on an irrelevance and walked away towards the wide staircase of the palazzo those who came late that morning to their desks in the viminale on the second floor found that already the corridors and offices were nests of harsh and total activity vellosi paced among rooms querying the necessity of bureaucrats and policemen alike to occupy their premises and their precious telephones and where he found no satisfaction he commandeered and installed in their place his own subordinates by ten he had secured an additional five rooms all within shouting distance of his own technicians from the basements were kept busy hoisting the mess of cables and wires attaching the transmitters and receivers that would secure him instant access to the control centre of the questura and the office of carboni some of the dispossessed hung about in the corridors sleek in their suits and clean shirts and smiled sweetly at the pace and moment of the working men around them and vowed they would have vellosis head served up on a charger were he not to deliver geoffrey harrison free and unharmed by the next morning it was not the way that things were done in the viminale noise rising voices the ringing of telephone bells the pleas of radio static all mingled and coalesced in the corridor vellosi bounced between the sources of the confusion he had told an examining magistrate that he was a hindrance and an obstruction a carabinieri general that if he didnt push reinforcements into the cosoleto area he would face speedy retirement the persistent editor of the largest socialist newspaper in the city that his head should be down the lavatory pan and would he clear the line and sent out for more cigarettes more coffee more sandwiches at a hectic pace bewildering to all those who were not central to the knot of the enquiry the operation and investigation was launched those who participated and those who were idle and smirking behind their hands could agree on the one common point the mood on the second floor of the viminale was unique very few though were privy to the telephone conversation between vellosi and the minister who spoke from an anteroom outside the cabinet deliberations at the palazzo chigi only the inner court the hard men on whom vellosi leaned for succour and advice he had slammed the telephone down barely a grunt of thanks to the minister and confided to those in the room near him theyre standing firm our masters the men of deviation and compromise are holding a line the bitch stays with us tantardini stays in her cell and rots there the four who heard him understood the importance of the political decision and they smiled to each other in a grim satisfaction and dropped their shoulders and raised their eyebrows and returned to their notepads and their internal telephone directories the information began to flow as the team hustled begged and screamed into the telephones shapes and patterns emerging from the kaleidoscope of mystery and dead alleys with which the day had started photographs of the known nappisti at liberty had been spread out on a table for the portiere of the pensione where claudios body had been found he had not wished to be involved this elderly man whose job required a short tongue and shorter memory he had turned over many pictures showing little interest muttering repeatedly of the failure of his recollection one flicker of curiosity nullified his reluctance and a detective had seen the betrayal of recognition that the portiere had tried to hide it was the work of a police photographer and the typed message on the back of the picture gave the name of giancarlo battestini what name had he used what identity card had he shown what had he been wearing what time had he arrived what time had he left the questions battered at the old man in his fading uniform till he had broken the reticence born of the sense of survival and told the story the police wanted to hear the information breathed a new activity into the squad of men around vellosi whipped up their flagging morale and drove them on its beside the station vellosi stormed down his telephone to a maggiore of the pubblica sicurezza right beside the station this pensione so get the photograph of battestini down to the ticket counters get it among the platform workers check him through all the trains to reggio yesterday morning find the ticket inspectors on those trains find their names where they are now and get that picture under their noses there was so much commitment so much cajoling and abuse that for a full minute giuseppe carboni stood ignored in the doorway of vellosis office he bided his time he would have his moment and it would be choice he thought choice enough for it to have been worth his while to abandon his desk at the questura and come unannounced to the viminale vellosi was on his way for another prowl along the corridor to chase and jockey his men when he careered into the solid flesh wall of the policeman carboni my apologies vellosi laughed we have been very busy here we have been going hard excellent vellosi excellent a measured reply tolerant and calm you will forgive my hurry but we have discovered an important connection excellent the boy of the nap battestini the one we missed when we took tantardini this is the kernel of this matter it was he who killed the gorilla in the hotel we have established that and this claudio was from those who took your h a r r i s o n we have not been idle excellent vellosi saw the smile on carbonis face as though the man had picked up a book and found it already familiar his revelation won no recognition of achievement and are you prospering too carboni subdued already vellosi braced himself tell me carboni led the head of the antiterrorist squad back to his desk with his heavy rounded fingers he produced from a neat briefcase two facsimile documents he laid them on the desk carelessly pushing aside the piles of handwritten notes that had accumulated there through the morning with his forefinger carboni stabbed at the upper sheet this is the statement taken from battestini by the polizia more than eighteen months ago after his arrest for some student fracas it carried his handwriting at the bottom i have seen it vellosi said curtly carboni pulled clear the under sheet this is the statement from the nappisti found at seminara along with harrisons card observe the writing vellosi observe it closely vellosis nose was a few inches from the papers as he held them to the light it has been checked at criminalpol they ran it through the machines for me the scientists have no doubt that they match carboni savoured the moment it was perhaps the finest of his professional life he stood among the gods the princes of the elite force the cream of the antisubversion fighters and he told them something they had not seen for themselves giancarlo battestini nineteen years old born in pescara university dropout probationer of the nap he is the one who has taken geoffrey harrison harrison is in battestinis hands and i venture to suggest that is the limit and extent of the conspiracy vellosi dropped back to his chair a hush spread across the room and on into the corridor and further offices men in shirtsleeves holding cigarettes and plastic coffee beakers crowded to the doorway is it possible for one man a mere boy to have achieved all this vellosi it has happened the pleasure shone on carbonis face i wont detain you but you should know we are sifting the reports of stolen vehicles from the area of the city of reggio there are not many not at the times that fit two cinquencentos but they would be too small for the purpose there was a bmw but that is a conspicuous car close to the main station at reggio a few minutes walk away there is reported missing within ninety minutes of the arrival of the rapido from roma a onetwoseven it is red and the registration is going out now there is the same problem as always with the road blocks because we do not know where to set them but if it is on the radio and the lunchtime television then perhaps shut up carboni vellosi spoke quietly he reached up with both arms put them round carbonis neck and pulled the illshaven face towards him their cheeks met the kiss of friends and equals youre a genius carboni nothing but a genius carboni blushed swung on his heel and left with a little wave of his fingers for farewell he had stirred vellosis ant hole changed its direction shifted the whole basis of the enquiry well dont stand about vellosi snapped at his audience weve let an amateur show us whats happening point to whats been staring at us for hours we have more in a day than we had in a month with moro use it but for moro he had had time for harrison he had less than twentyfour hours till the expiry of the ultimatum vellosi scuffed among his papers till he found the photograph of battestini he searched the mouth and the jaw line and the set of the eyes for information scrabbling to catch up scratching to make do with diminishing hours the tools of a policemans trade the little bastard could be anywhere and vellosi swore and reached for his coffee that was cold he must go back to the basics back to deep and quiet thought in the midst of the noise surrounding him back to analysis of the minimal factual evidence available start again start from the beginning return to the face of battestini drag from those features the response that should be made giancarlo battestini imprisoned in rome after studying in the capitals university and a member of an nap cell in that city could the boy have links with the far countryside likely or unlikely vellosi flexed his fingers the answer was obvious the boy would know nothing of calabria a city boy a town boy a foreigner in the mezzo giorno he turned and called to a colleague who stubbed his cigarette drained his coffee and came to him battestini would not believe he could survive in the countryside it is beyond his experience correct correct he would try to return to the city possible in the files he is linked only with rome would he try to get back here perhaps he is divorced from pescara he has nothing there and if he comes back towards rome he must come by car because he cannot take a prisoner by train probable the momentum carried vellosi on if he comes by road he must decide for himself whether he will attempt speed on the autostrada or whether he will go for the safer and slower old roads i think he would choose the autostrada vellosi slapped his fist into the palm of his other hand and he must stop for petrol he has to stop certain either at a station on the autostrada or he must come off and use a toll gate and a station off the main route if he is coming to rome if he is coming by car if he is on the autostrada then that is correct vellosi thrust his chair behind him rose to his full height and shouted work on the petrol stations and the autostrada tolls each side of naples call carboni tell him that too his colleague was no longer beside him vellosi slumped back into his seat there was no one to praise him no one to smile and slap his back and offer congratulations to himself he muttered over and over again the boy will come back to the city the boy will return to rome chapter fourteen while the disparate arms and commands of security forces strove to drag themselves into a state of intervention the small red fiat slipped unremarked through the toll gate marking the terminal of the autostrada at roma sud and away towards the raccordo annulare the ring road skirting the capital with the passing of the massproduced common car through the toll check the chances of its detection always remote were reduced to the minimal the two men had exchanged only desultory conversation preferring to brood to themselves in the confined space geoffrey harrison the pain gone from his back drove in a careless and detached way as if concern and anxiety were no longer with him his mind numbed his brain deadened he performed the automatic tasks of keeping the car in the centre lane of traffic the speed constant at two places the petrol station and the toll gate he told himself there had been the possibility of a breakout from the car but the will to seek his freedom was reduced he had sat meekly in the driving seat neither looking at nor avoiding the man who secured the fuel tank cap and wiped wetly over the windscreen he had held his silence as the young man at the toll had handed the change through the open window manipulated and broken too destroyed to weep too cudgelled to fight harrison guided the car around the east side of the city for violet harrison the mood of the morning alternated between remorse and defiance she had lain in bed curling slowly over switching the images of a prisoner husband with those of a darkchested boy with a flat stomach and sinewed haircovered legs both caused her pain if she could again find the boy at the beach and forge her liaison then it would not be the first time nor the second nor the third it was the usual way she found relief when the strain became too much for her it had nothing to do with loving geoffrey whatever that meant nothing to do with being his wife sharing his life all that was irrelevant but there had to be a valve somewhere when the steam built up and this was her release writhing under a stranger without obligation without attachment there had been an irish barman from evesham in worcestershire sought out on the day after geoffrey the young industrial trainee had told her there was a discrepancy in the books and that the branch chief accountant believed him responsible he had been cleared of suspicion but only after violet had spent an afternoon in an autumn field with a man whose name she had never known there had been a west indian bus driver from dalston in east london after a friday night when geoffrey had come home to report that he had drunk too much that lunchtime and told the head of his department to stuff his job where it would hurt and smell geoffrey had apologized on the monday morning been accepted back with handshakes and smiles and had never known of violets two hours on a sunday morning in a railway hotel close to kings cross ridden hard by a muscled lad who called her darlin and bit her shoulders other crises had come some greater some lesser same palliative same escape and geoffrey had remained unaware of them of that she was sure and grateful she remembered once watching on television the wife of the british governor of an island colony just widowed after her husband had been terribly murdered while taking a late evening stroll in the gardens of the residence the woman had worn white and sat on a sofa with her daughters and talked to the cameras with composure and dignity had it been violet she thought she would have been in the chauffeurs bed she knew it hated it and told herself she did not have the strength to resist and if geoffrey did not know if geoffrey were not wounded then what did it matter who elses business was it there had been no boy in rome god knows there were times when she would have wished for one hoped for the release from an arched back and a driving thrust but there had been none until she had been to the beach she had not given herself even the opportunity isolated and cocooned in a flat where the telephone never rang the doorbell never sounded she had been protected from the predators she dressed with studied care as if anxious not to crease the bikini and the covering dress as if forgetful that she would be sitting in her car for the hourlong drive to ostia or fregene or santa marinella a peahen jealous of her scant plumage the bikini was new and the dress a month old had not been worn adornment for the fall her hair she combed loosely sitting at her dressingtable mirror and aware of the excitement and the tremble that came with the narcotic with the contemplation of the unmentionable it was the only gesture of independence that violet harrison was capable of to climb into her little car drive away down the road and spend and punish herself of her own volition in her own time in her own panting scenario would geoffrey have cared if he had known perhaps perhaps not but it didnt matter because geoffrey did not know geoffrey was away bound like a chicken with the stubble on his face and a gun at his head geoffrey would be thinking of her hers would be the face in his mind as clear and sharp as it was in the mirror before her geoffrey would be leaning on her conjuring in his mind only the good times that was when the remorse always won through from the defiance that was when it hurt when the urge was strongest when she was weakest least able to struggle smudges of tears were summoned below the neatly careened blonde hair she was aware of the telephone bell long brilliant calls summoning her to the kitchen perhaps it was mother from london announcing which flight she was taking and was her little poppet all right and did she know that it was all over the papers perhaps it was those miserable bastards who had called before and jabbered in an alien language the ringing would not abandon her would not leave her and pulled her off the low chair and dragged her through the doorway towards it every step and she prayed that it would cease its siren call her entreaties were ignored the telephone rang on violet harrison whos that it was carpenter archie carpenter of ich good morning mr carpenter a cool voice the confidence coming fast because this was the little man who had run from her the little suburban man had she heard the latest information on her husband ive heard nothing since last night i dont read the italian papers the embassy havent called me she should know that her husband was now thought to be in the hands of an extremist political group she should know that demands had been made to the government for the release of a prisoner before nine the next morning she should know that if the condition was not met the threat had been made that her husband would be murdered violet rocked on the balls of her feet eyes closed two hands clutching at the telephone the pain seemed to gather at her temples then sear through deep behind was she still there a faint small voice im here mr carpenter im listening and it was a damned scandal the whole thing the embassy wouldnt lift a finger did she know that could she credit it geoffrey had been relegated in importance dismissed and left to the incompetence of an italian police investigation fear now and her voice shriller but it was all agreed it was agreed wasnt it that the company would pay it was all out of the italians hands different now money was one thing easy plenty of it no problem different now because it was said to be a point of principle said to be giving in to terrorism if the prisoner were to be released well whats a fucking principle got to do with geoffrey do they want him dead or what she shrieked into the telephone voice raucous and rising theyd say it was the same as in the schleyer case in germany the same as in the moro case locally theyd say they couldnt surrender theyd use words like blackmail and phrases like dignity of the state those were the things theyd say and the embassy would support them every damned inch but it will mean geoffreys killed the hysteria was rampant and with it the laughter and the breaking of flimsy control they cant just sacrifice him this bloody place hasnt had a principle in years its not a word in the bloody language they couldnt even spell it here carpenter was going to call head office in london they wouldnt take this lying down she could rely on that hed call back within an hour she should stay by the telephone her voice had risen to its summit to its highest pitch and was now the product of crouched and humiliated shoulders could you come and see me mr carpenter did she want him to come to the flat could you come and tell me whats happening yes to the flat carpenter was sorry very sorry indeed but he had an appointment an urgent appointment she would understand but he had a fair amount on his plate didnt he but carpenter would telephone her as soon as he had something to say and that would be he thought within an hour the cycle of her changing mood swung on the screaming past the whimpering gone cold again with the veneer of assurance dont call again mr carpenter because i wont be here perhaps ill be back this evening thank you for telling me whats going on thank you for telling me whats going to happen to geoffrey before he could speak again she had cut carpenter off the line violet harrison strode into her bedroom swept a swimming towel off a bedside chair and the underclothes that she had discarded the previous evening to the floor she dropped them into her via condotti shoppingbag and headed for the lift and the basement garage forty minutes after the red flat had moved on to the raccordo with its centre reservation of pink and white oleanders giancarlo gestured to harrison to turn off to his right it was the via cassia junction and within five miles of his home strange to harrison to be in the midst of tried and trusted surroundings but the disorientation won through and he obeyed the instruction without question the silence which for both of them was now safe and losing its awkwardness remained unbroken they had made good time giancarlo could reflect that the stamina of the driver had been remarkable they had given up the speed of the raccordo for a slow winding road heavy with lorries and impatient cars flanked by the speculative flats that overburdened the facilities several times they stopped in the bumper to bumper jams harrison sat passively not knowing where he was being led declining to ask along the length of the reggio calabria to rome autostrada patrol cars of the polizia stradale and carabinieri had begun the pin and haystack game of searching for a red fiat car of the most popular model in use scores of motorists found themselves pitched out of s covered by aimed machineguns as they were searched ordered to produce identity papers while their faces were examined against the photostated likenesses of battestini and harrison the road blocks were large and impressive each utilizing a minimum of a dozen armed men and were comprehensive enough to warrant coverage by the rai electronic camera teams the concentration of effort and manpower was blessed from the toll gate at monte cassino a fiat of the right size and colour was remembered a young man had asked for petrol a small success and one sufficient to whet the appetite as the police concentration built up in the community of monte cassino the garage owner was quizzed in his office yes he could tell them who had been manning the pumps at that time yes he could tell them the address of that mans home yes and also he could tell them that this man had said the previous evening when he came on duty that after he finished the night shift it was his intention to take his grandchildren into the central mountains no he did not know where they would go and he had waved expansively at the big hazed skyline and shrugged the helicopters were ordered from rome the military twinengined troop carriers were loaded with armed men sweating in the confined spaces on the baked makeshift landingpad outside the town fourseater spotter machines were dispatched to fly low over the high ranges and valleys brushing the contours lorryloads of polizia were slowly given the coordinates on large scale maps that the whole rugged area might be sealed the white walls of the mountain monastery looked down upon the hopeless task while the shouting and irritation of the flustered staff officers in the commandeered school reflected the feeling that the terrain rugged and vast would mock their efforts to find a boy and his captive and his car but the element of chance born from the routine moved the chase on gave it a new impetus a new urgency the chance without which the police cannot hope for success in a manhunt and which had forsaken them when the centre of the country was scoured for the illfated president of the democrazia cristiana a young man had gone off duty from his work at a gate on the roma sud toll he had taken the bus home after a sixhour shift had doused himself under the shower and dressed and sat down at the kitchen table for cheese and fruit before lying on his bed to rest his daughter just a baby had been crying and therefore he could not be certain he had heard correctly the description of the two men that had been broadcast on the radio the detail rigidly held to from which he would not deviate caused the men in uniform and suits to paw at the air in their frustration but giuseppe carboni was master of his own office was at pains to thank the young man for his gesture in calling his nearest police station past eleven in the morning time hurtling on its way and carboni demanded the patience of those around him the photograph was produced the picture of geoffrey harrison and the young man nodded and smiled and looked for praise it was strange he said to carboni that a man who wore an expensive shirt should be unshaven with grime at his neck and his hair untended carbonis room had disintegrated into movement leaving the witness to gaze long and hard at the picture telephones telexes radios all into play now to seal the city of rome close it up was the order block the routes to laquila to the east to firenze in the north tighten a net on the autostradas and damn the queues pull off the men beginning the search of the monte cassino hills bring them back to the capital carboni set it all in motion then came back to the young man and there was a boy just a ragazzo with this man i think so it is the older man that you are clear on that was the one that gave me the money it is difficult to see across the interior of a car from where we sit in the cabins a good witness would not admit to that which he was not certain of carboni replaced the photograph of harrison with that of giancarlo battestini could it be this boy could this be the passenger i am sorry dottore but really i did not see the passengers face carboni persisted anything at all that you can remember of the passenger he wore jeans and they were tight that i remember and his legs were thin he would have been young the toll attendant stopped head low frowning in concentration he was tired and his thoughts came slowly unseen to him carboni held up his hand to prevent any interruption from those who were now filtering back into the r o o m he paid the driver that is and he paid with a big note and when i gave him the change he passed it to the passenger but the others hands were beneath a light coat that was between them i could see that from my cabin the driver dropped the change on to the top of the coat they did not say anything and then he drove away pain on carbonis face to the general audience he announced that is where the gun was that is why harrison drives because the boy battestini has the pistol to his body the young man from roma sud was sent home fuel for the computer for the dispersal system of information and with each piece of typed paper that slipped from his office carboni fussed and plotted and tell them to be careful for gods sake to be careful tell them that the boy has killed three times in fortyeight hours and will kill again there was no smirk on the features of giuseppe carboni no expression of euphoria geographically they had run their quarry to a ground comprising a trivial number of square kilometres but the ground he could consider ruefully was not favourable one man and a prisoner to hunt for in a conurbation that housed four million citizens chance had taken the sad worndown policeman up a road of promise and had left him at a great crossroads which boasted no signposts he reached for his telephone to ring francesco vellosi at noon the men held in maximum security on the island of asinara were unlocked from their cells and permitted under heavy supervision to queue together in the communal canteen for their pasta and meat lunch conversation was not forbidden the longterm prisoners those serving from twenty years to the ultimate maximum of ergastolo the natural end of life all had radio sets in their cells behind the heavy doors and barred windows news had been carried of the kidnapping of geoffrey harrison the ultimatum for the freedom of franca tantardini the failed reprisal against francesco vellosi several men sidled close to the leader of the nap who was the boy battestini they asked a name blasted from every news bulletin in the previous hour how big was the infrastructure organization from which he worked the capo the movements spiritual leader in intellect and violence had shrugged his shoulders opened his hands and said quietly that he had never heard of the boy nor sanctioned the action a few had felt he was being obsessively secretive but there were those who waited and shuffled forward with their steel trays who understood the bafflement of the man who claimed absolute domination of the nap from his island cell it was one thing to give orders another to have them implemented many men in the questura and the viminale had lent their names and authority to instructions for the sealing of the city contingency plans for such measures were to hand but it was not easy to mount a police and paramilitary effort of the scale required which were the vital routes which were the areas for the greatest concentration of manpower where in the streets of the city should the maximum vigilance be observed they were questions that demanded time for answers and time was a lost commodity the fiat had turned off the main cassia road at the village of la storta travelled fifteen more kilometres and then turned again choosing a narrower route that would skirt the hill town of bracciano and lead towards the deep bluetinted volcanic lake beneath the collection of straggling grey stone houses the car was forty kilometres now from the heart of the capital and here the country was at peace and the bombs and killings and kidnappings were matters delivered only by the newspapers and television bulletins this was a place of small farmers small shopkeepers small businessmen people who valued their tranquility drank their wine and drew their curtains against the wind of brutality chaos and graft that blew from across the fields and the main road abruptly giancarlo pointed to an open field gate that was set in a wall of stone and blackthorn to the left of the road and some four hundred metres short of the waters edge the field into which they drove jerking over the thick grass was skirted on two sides by a wood of heavyleafed oaks and sycamores tall shadebearing trees giancarlo had taken a great risk to travel this far in daylight but he was sufficiently secure in himself sufficiently buoyant after coming so far to believe that he had outstripped the apparati of the nation far up the side of the field where it was shielded from the road he waved for harrison to stop glanced around him and then motioned towards a place close by where the grazing of the field merged with the trees a place where the cattle would come in winter to escape the ferocity of the rainstorms there was a darkness and shadow in the interior of the car as harrison finally pulled at the brake handle and switched off the ignition the place was well chosen hidden from the air hidden from the road perfect in its safety and loneliness giancarlo grabbed decisively at the keys smiled with contempt at his driver and watching him all the time with the gun cocked climbed out he stretched himself flexed his barely developed chest enjoyed the sun that filtered and dappled between the leaf ceiling are you going to kill me here harrison asked only if by nine oclock tomorrow morning they have not given me franca it was the first time that giancarlo had spoken since they had left the autostrada international chemical holdings with representation in thirtytwo countries of the first and third worlds maintained close links with the foreign and commonwealth office and the ministry of overseas development its board members and principal executives were frequent guests at the black tie dinners given by government to visiting delegations they figured cautiously in the new years and birthday honours lists and to some the workings of the company were regarded as an extension of british foreign policy an aid package to a newly independent member of the commonwealth often contained the loan necessary to launch an ich plant sir david adams was well known to the minister both as a businessman aloof from party politics and as a social guest to be valued for his ease and humour in difficult company on the telephone pad of sir davids desk in the city tower block was the foreign secretarys direct number he had spent a few brief moments pondering archie carpenters call from rome before scanning the pad for the number he had been connected with a private secretary had requested and been granted a few minutes of the foreign secretarys time before lunch a desolate sort of room the ministers working office seemed to sir david not the sort of quarters hed ever have tolerated for himself wretched velvet drapes the furniture out of a museum and a desk large enough for snooker hed have had one of those young interior decorator chaps in with a bucket of white paint and some new pictures and something on the floor that represented the nineteeneighties not the days of dropping tigers at amritsar he was not kept waiting sufficiently long for the completion of his refurbishment plans for the office they sat opposite each other in lush highbacked armchairs there was a campari soda for the minister a gin and french for the managing director no aides no stenographers not to beat about the bush minister the message from my chap out there came as a bit of a shock my chap and hes no fool got his feet on the ground says your ambassador has just about told the italians that so far as whitehall is concerned they should run this new phase in the harrison business as if our man was any italian businessman i find that a bit heavy sir david sipped at his glass enough to dampen his tongue little more bit of an oversimplification david not quite the full story the foreign secretary smiled over the bulldog lapping folds of his cheeks the actual situation is that a senior member of the italian cabinet and this is of course confidential asked hmg via the ambassador and at a time when the italians were having to make early but very important decisions of approach in this matter whether hmg would be requesting the release of a terrorist to safeguard your fellow thats not quite the same thing is it with respect its the germ of the same thing ill put it another way and ask you what initiative the british government are taking to secure the release unharmed of geoffrey harrison another sip another faint trembling of the liquid line in the glass you should know there can only be one answer there is no initiative that i can take with regard to the internal politics of i t a l y you can suggest that it is desirable to get my man back whether or not that requires unlocking a door for this woman theyre holding david i have a full programme of meetings there was a sternness in the rebuke i should have been at one now but ive relegated it to a junior when i make that gesture please do me the courtesy of hearing me out accepted apologies and sincerely meant an inclined head acknowledged the ministerial rap italy isnt a business competitor david its not a rival company if it collapses if it goes bankrupt morally or financially if its greatly weakened the members of the commons wont stand up and cheer and wave their order papers as your shareholders would its not just a place of funny foreigners david of spaghetti and gigolos and bottompinchers its a major power in the west its a nato ally its the seventh industrial power in the world you know all that better than i do when things are difficult there we draw no pleasure from it we do our damnedest to support them and a friend needs support when shes on her knees the moro affair nearly crippled them the state was held to ransom the very system of democracy was threatened but they held firm and in doing so they lost they sacrificed a leader of great standing its a fine speech minister and it will do you credit in the house on the day my company buries geoffrey harrison youll send a wreath i trust the two men eyed each other the counterpunches had bloodied the noses and the eyes were puffing and there were many rounds to go not worthy of you david and you know better than to taunt me when the german was missing in northern ireland the one we never found the minister of the day didnt have bonn snapping at him when herrema the dutchman was kidnapped in eire the hague was quick to express support for all the measures that dublin was taking youre still hiding minister sir david adams was not one to be easily deflected he pushed his adversary towards the ropes leading with his chin a lifetimes habit youre hiding behind a screen of meaningless protocol i want a young and innocent man back i want him back with his wife i dont give a damn for italian terrorism nor do i give a damn for italian democracy ive done business there and i know the place i know how much of our payments go to the bank in milan how much goes to zurich i know about the yachts and the bribes and the villas i understand why theyve an urban guerrilla problem on their doorstep its a nasty clannish society that cant look after itself and its not for you to abandon an englishman in the sewer there in order to start giving those people lessons in principle or whatever you havent been listening to me david ice cold the foreign secretary but the temper concealed beneath the frozen smile they sacrificed one of their principal postwar leaders wrote him off and on a point of principle were going in circles we are indeed but i suggest you are leading sir david gulped at his glass the impatience winning half drained it i put it to you minister that there is something you can do that doesnt infringe on the question of principle he rolled over the word gutting it of all feeling you can find out from your friends in rome the exact importance of this woman you can find out her importance to the guerrilla movement and lets not stand on too high a pedestal i know my recent history northern ireland right we emptied long kesh when we were after a political initiative chucked the provisionals out on to the streets to get on again with their bombing and maiming what happened to principle then weve given their leaders safeconduct we sent the palestinian girl leila khaled home from ealing courtesy of an raf jet were not lilywhite we can bend when it suits us whos making speeches david dont be flippant minister my fellow has little more than twenty hours to live the gimlet eyes of sir david adams offered no concessions italy can live without this woman in a gaol italy can s u r v i v e he broke off in response to a light knock on the door behind him irritation at the interruption registered on both mens faces the foreign secretary glanced at his watch a young man shirtsleeves and club tie glided across the room with a telex flimsy in his hand he gave it without explanation to the minister and withdrew as silently as he had come there was quiet in the room as the message was read the ministers forehead lined his lips pursed its the harrison business thats why they interrupted no emotion in the voice just an ageing and a sadness hes held by a young psychopath responsible for three killings in two days the assessment of the italians is that he will kill your man without hesitation or compassion should the deadline expire the woman involved is called franca tantardini she is classified in rome as a major activist and will face charges of murder attempted murder armed insurrection theyre putting the book on her our embassy records the observation that several of the senior and most respected officers of the italian public security forces would resign should she be released in addition the italian communist party have endorsed in a statement the governments no deal approach the foreign secretary looked across the room to the shadowed face of the industrialist its not in our hands david it is beyond the british government to offer intervention i am very sorry sir david adams rose from his chair a little over six feet in height a dominating and handsome man and one unused to failure you wont forget the wreath minister and he was gone leaving his glass half filled on the small table beside the chair michael charlesworth from his office and archie carpenter from his hotel room had spoken by telephone these two men of differing backgrounds drawn from divergent social groups seemed to want to talk to each other because their feeling of helplessness was overpowering both were eunuchs with little to do but listen to the radio as charlesworth did and scan the newspapers and gaze at the staring photographs of battestini plastered in the afternoon editions as carpenter did shouldnt you be with violet harrison charlesworth had asked i called her this morning said id call her back she said not to bother its not my job thank god holding her hand not mine either carpenter had snapped perhaps charlesworth had let it sink let the thought drown he sensed the desperation of the man who had been sent to take decisions to move mountains and who was failing youd better come up to my place tonight and have a bite with us id like that charlesworth had returned to his radio moodily flitting between the three rai services they portrayed activity and haste and effort and nothing of substance it had taken giancarlo fully thirty minutes to find the place that satisfied him he had prodded geoffrey harrison through the deeper recesses of the wood using him as a plough to clear a way between the whippy saplings that sprang back at the eyes and ears and forearms but the place that pleased him was close to a slight path where once a giant oak had grown before the wind had pulled it down tearing open a great gouge in the earth beneath its raised roots a shallow pit had been left that would only be found if the searcher stumbled to its very rim giancarlo methodically repeated the drill of earlier in the morning he bound harrisons ankles with the flex and then again tied his wrists behind his back the spare lengths he used to loop around the stronger roots exposed under the earth roof if harrison lay still he could rest on his side in some attitude of comfort if he moved if he struggled then the wire would bite at his flesh and cut and slash it the boy had thought of this introducing knots that dictated that the reward for movement was pain there was one refinement from the morning the handkerchief from harrisons trouser pocket twisted like a rope was inserted between his teeth knotted behind his ears giancarlo was careful in tying the handkerchief as if he had no wish to suffocate his prisoner when the work was finished he stepped back and admired it he was going to get some food harrison should not worry he would not be away long within moments he was lost among the lines of trees and shadows and the slanting columns of light chapter fifteen geoffrey harrisons field of vision was minimal it comprised only a slight arc encompassing a score of rising treetrunks heavy with lime and flaking bark that soared above the rim of the small crater in which he lay above and around him was the motion of the isolated wood a pair of woodpeckers in pursuit of a jay cackling protest at the intrusion of the nesthunting bird a tiny pettirosso its reddened breast thrust forward proudly as it dug and chipped for grubs and insects a young rabbit that darted in terror among the trees after a brief encounter with a skilful stoat the wind in the upper branches that collided with one another high up and beyond the limit of his vision action and activity those that were free and liberated going about the business of their day while he lay helpless and in fear beneath them but his brain was no longer stifled the very solitude of the wood had roused him made him aware of each miniature footfall keened and sharpened his senses the drug effect of the endless miles of autostrada driving was drifting from his system and with the withdrawal from the approaching headlights and the perpetual traffic lanes came the increasing awareness of his situation that something was stirring in him some desire once again to affect his future was clear from the way he tested the skill with which he had been bound he tried to move his arms apart seeing how tightly the knots were tied whether there was stretch in the plasticcoated flex the sweat crawled again on his chest several minutes the effort lasted before the realization came that the binding had been done well that it was beyond his capabilities to loosen the wires so what are you going to do geoffrey going to sit there like a bloody turkey in its coop waiting for christmas eve and the oven to heat up are you going to lie on your side and wait for it and hope its quick and doesnt hurt should have done something in the car or at the petrol stations or at the toll gates or when the traffic stopped them on the cassia when you had the chance when you were body to body close in the seats of the car and what would he have done about it precious giancarlo might have fired might not cant be sure but it would have been better than this better than sitting the hours out would it have been that easy in the car hed kept the door locked because that way there was one more movement required before it could have been opened and more delay more confusion more chance for him to shoot idiot geoffrey harrison bloody idiot it wouldnt have mattered how long it took to get the door open because hed have been flattened by then squashed half out of existence youre damn near double his bloody weight starved little scarecrow but you didnt do it geoffrey and theres no thanks in dreaming no thanks in playing the bloody hero in the mind the time was there and you bucked it preferred to sit in the car and wait and see what happened you can see it now lad cant you half scared to bloody death already and theres a pain in your balls and an ache in your chest and you want to cry for yourself scared out of your mind too bloody right and who wouldnt be because its curtains isnt it curtains and finish and theyll be getting the bloody box ready for you and cutting the flowers and choosing the plot and the chaps in head office will have sent their black ties to the drycleaners through his mind the misery was fuelled no chance in a hundred bloody light years that franca would get her marching orders all in the imagination of the little prig couldnt let her out not a hard line girl that it had taken months to get the manacles on but that doesnt leave room geoffrey leaves you on a prayer and a hope and what had geoffrey bloody harrison done how come his number was spinning with the lottery balls god he was going to cry again could feel the tears coming thirtysix years old and fit to wet himself and no stake in the place no commitment wrong again geoffrey youre bleeding the masses crucifying the workers thats lunacy bloody madness not to this kid not to little mister giancarlo battestini and hes going to blow the side of your bloody head off just to prove its real harrison lay with his eyes tight shut fighting the welling moisture the foul taste of the cotton handkerchief suppurated around his back teeth nausea rising and with it the terror that he would be unable to be sick and choke in his own vomit what a bloody way to go choking in your own filth eyes so tight closed lids squeezed so that they hurt so that they were bruised violet darling bloody violet my bloody wife i want to be with you darling i want you to take me away from here violet please please dont leave me here to them near to his head a small branch cracked harrison flashed open his eyes swung his body up and blinked away the tears ten feet from him was a pair of childs kneehigh boots their sheen broken by smears of dried mud and bramble scratches the miniature replicas of an adults farm wear and rising out of them were little baggy trousers with the knees holed and the material faded with usage and washing he twisted his head slowly higher and gulped in the salvation of a check sports shirt with the buttons haphazardly fastened and the sleeves floppily rolled there was a sparse and skinny bronzed neck and a young clean face that was of the country and exposed to wind harrison sagged back dropped himself hard against the earth thank god a bloody ministering angel white sheets wings and a halo thank god he felt a shiver the spasm of relief running hard in him but not to hang about not with giancarlo gone only for food come on kid god i love you come on but dont hang about youre a bloody darling you know that but theres not all day he looked up again into the childs face and wondered why the little one just stood stationary and still like a pan statue three paces away not speaking demonstrating a graveness at the cheeks a caution in the eyes come on kid dont be frightened he tried to wriggle his body so that the bound wrists would be visible waste of time the child could see the gag and the trussed legs the little feet backed away as if the movement disconcerted him whats the bloody matter with the kid well what do you expect geoffrey what did your mother tell you when you were small and went out into the fields and woods to play and along the street and out of sight of the row of houses that belonged in their road dont talk to strangers theres funny people about dont take sweets from them harrison stared at the boy stared and tried to understand six perhaps seven years old deep and serious eyes a puzzled and concerned mouth hands that tugged and pulled the cloth of his trousers not an idiot not a daft one this child but hesitant in coming forward as if the man who lay in this contorted posture was a forbidden apple as best he could through the impediment of the gag geoffrey harrison tried to smile at the child and beckon with his head for the boy to come closer but he won no response be a loner wouldnt he a selfcontained tiny entity wont take chewing gum from a man he doesnt know it cant bloody happen to me please not now god please god not a trick like this on me it was going to take time but time wasnt available not with giancarlo gone only for food what would the mean bastard do with the child think on that geoffrey think on that as you try to win him forward try to bring him closer what does giancarlo do with the kid if he finds him here all bright eyes and a witness thats an obscenity thats foul but thats truth geoffrey hurry up kid come closer quickly not just my life your life is hanging on a cotton thread geoffrey harrison knew that he had no call on the child that this was a private matter between himself and the boy giancarlo but he beckoned again with his head and above the cloth at his mouth his cheeks creased in what he thought of as a welcome greeting the child watched him with neither a smile nor fear and the small boots stayed rooted neither slipping forward nor back it would take a long time and giancarlo might return before the work was finished there were many young campers on the wooded hills and beside the lake at bracciano and the stubblecheeked boy in the alimentari on the waterfront aroused no comment high summer holiday season and for many the cool shaded slopes and the deep lake in its volcanic crater represented a more welcome resting ground than the scrum pack of the beaches for those who had abandoned the city however temporarily the news bulletins went unheard the newspapers unread in the alimentari giancarlo attracted no attention as he bought a plastic razor an aerosol of shaving soap and six rosetti filled with cheese and tomato slices from the alimentari he headed for the back lavatory of one of the small trattorie that stretched out on precarious stilts over the grey beach dust with the cold water and the thickness of his cheek growth and the sharpness of the new blade he had to exercise care that he did not lacerate his face it would not be a clean shave but sufficient to change his appearance and tidy him in the minds of any who looked at and examined him he had once read that the art of successful evasion was a dark suit and a tie he believed it who searches for the fanatic among the closely groomed he grinned to himself as if enjoying the selfbestowed title the fanatic many labels they would be handing down from the top table of the directorate of democrazia cristiana and the central committee of the pci and they had seen nothing yet his humour was further improved by the wash and there were more shops to visit he bought socks and a light tshirt that carried a cheaply stencilled rendering of the fifteenthcentury castle of bracciano that dominated the village his former clothes he stuffed into a rubbish bin further along the pavement he stopped and bought with coins from the newspaper stand the days edition of il messaggero he looked into geoffrey harrisons picture holding the page hard in front of his face the company portrait serene and sleek harmless and smug beaming success on an inside page was the information that had led him to need a newspaper the full story of the hunt with the facts available till two oclock that morning and the name of the policeman who controlled the search dottore giuseppe carboni working from the questura giancarlos mouth twisted with his innate contempt for his adversary among the clatter of loose change in his pocket were four gettoni enough for his task he hunted now for a bar or trattoria that had a closed phone booth not willing to be overhead when he made his telephone call at a bar he passed there were two coin telephones for the public but both open and fastened to the wall where there would be no privacy he walked on till he reached the ristorante attached to the sailing club at the end of the halfkilometre esplanade there was a closed telephone booth in the hallway leading from the street door to the inner eating sanctum he had to wait some minutes for two giggling girls to finish neither bothered to glance at the frail built boy as they plunged out loud in their shared noise this near to the capital the telephone booths were equipped with rome directories he flicked through the first pages of the scruffed edition of the yellow pages running down the addresses and numbers listed under commissariati ps with his cleaned fingernail at the bottom of the page he found the answer questura centrale v di s vitale this would stir the bastards he would carry the fight to them as franca would have wished carry it right to the doors of the questura where they sat with their files and their minions and their computers they would hear of giancarlo the hacks and lackeys would hear his name he was trembling taut as a whiplash at the moment it cracks on a horses back the shaking convulsed his palms and the gettoni rattled dully in his fist no nearer no further from harrison the child had sat down he was crosslegged his elbows resting on his knees and his hands supporting his chin the kindergarten pose listening to a teachers story like youre a bloody animal geoffrey like hes found a fox half dead in a gintrap and he has the patience to wait and see what happens all the hours in the world the child had to be patient too young for a watch for a sense of fleeting time harrisons attempts to draw him closer to engage those small sharp fingers in the binding knots had failed all the nodding and gesturing with his head had been ignored except for the few times when his most violent contortions had gathered a flash of fear to his face and the childs slim muscles had stiffened and prepared for escape dont get excited harrison had learned and for gods sake even with the eyes dont threaten him the child has to be kept there his confidence has to be conserved he has to be wooed you want to keep him there geoffrey with giancarlo coming back giancarlo and the p coming back with the food and youre trying to keep the child there god i dont know and the moments were marching the hands would be sliding on the watch face on his wrist there was almost a sadness on the childs face as harrison peered into its shallow depths he would be a kid from a farmhouse selfsufficient selfreliant in his entertainment a creature of the woods and owing loyalty and softness only to his parents a pleasant child youd fine one like this on the yorkshire uplands or the devon moors or on the far west shoreline of irelands donegal god knows how to communicate with the blighter cant frighten him cant please him if there had been a child of his own but violet had said that her figure cant blame bloody violet not her fault you dont know how to talk to a child hope was fleeing from harrison his head movements became less frequent and he noticed that when he subsided into inertia then the start of boredom glazed the childs eyes that way he would leave pick himself off the earth and wander on his way thats what he should do lie still bore the kid out and hope that he was gone before giancarlo was back that was saving the kid that was the proper way that was diving clothed into an icy pool to pluck a baby out god i dont want him to go the fear came again the horror of being abandoned by this child mind and he nodded again with his head and wore the pantomime face of the clown in his urgency hating himself with the fever in his eyes as he called mutely for the child to come forward harrison strained to hear the footfall of the returning giancarlo pronto questura giancarlo stabbed with his finger at the button that would release a gettone to fall into the caverns of the machine questura please the office of dottore giuseppe carboni a m o m e n t thank you for nothing sir a hesitation the sounds of connection perspiration dribbled down giancarlos chest yes may i speak to dottore giuseppe carboni he is very busy at the moment in what connection in connection with the englishman arrison can i help myself i work in dottore carbonis office i must speak with him directly it is important there would be a taping of all incoming calls for carboni giancarlo assumed that but unless suspicions were aroused the trace procedures would not be automatic he kept his voice calm regulated a m o m e n t who is it calling giancarlo flushed it does not matter a moment more delays and he fed another gettone he smiled mirthlessly not the time to lose the call for lack of coins his last two rested in his hand more than sufficient he started clenched at the receiver carboni speaking what can i do for you the voice seemed to come from a great distance a whispering on the line as if there were a great tiredness and the resignation was heavy listen carefully carboni do not interrupt this is the spokesman of the nuclei armati proletaria dont gabble giancarlo remember that you are kicking them remember that you are hurting them as surely as the p in francas hand we hold the englishman arrison if franca tantardini has not been released and flown out of italy to the territory of a friendly socialist nation by nine oclock tomorrow morning then the multinationalist arrison will be executed for his crimes against the proletariat there is more carboni we will telephone again this evening and when your name is asked for then the call must be put through to you immediately and in your room must be franca tantardini we will speak to her ourselves if the connection is not made if comrade tantardini is not there to talk to us then arrison will be killed the call this evening will come at twenty hours forty seconds on the revolving hand of his watch since he had announced the source of the communication and the trace system would be in operation mad giancarlo mad its the behaviour of a fool is that understood thank you giancarlo the boys head jolted forward fingers white and bloodless on the plastic telephone a breathy whisper how did you know we know so much giancarlo giancarlo battestini born pescara father a clothes shop there one metre sixtyeight tall weight on release from regina coeli sixtyone kilos call again giancarlo another twenty seconds departed on his watch lost giancarlo snapped you will have her there you will have comrade tantardini on this telephone if it pleases you do not doubt us when we say we will kill the man arrison do not doubt us i believe you will kill him giancarlo it would not be clever but i believe that you are capable with his forefinger giancarlo pulled down the hook beside the telephone box felt the moment of sliding pressure before the sound that told him the call was terminated franca had told him they needed two minutes for a trace he had not exposed himself to their reach time in hand he walked out of the ristorante and into the lively afternoon sun knees weak breath summoned fast his mind a confusion of spattered images they should have grovelled and they had not they should have bent and they had held the mast erect perhaps in the sinking pit of his stomach there was an alien and unholy presentiment of the imminence of failure but the mood was soon discarded the chin jutted and the eyes glowed and he hurried back on the dustcovered road retracing his way towards the wood it was more than an hour now since the child had come and the crease lines of interest still wrapped his face harrison no longer moved no longer attempted to wheedle the small boy closer tried you poor bastard tried all you knew the ants were at him virile swine monsters with a swingeing bite hitting and retreating and returning calling for their friends because the mountain of food was defenceless and amusing and the kid hadnt spoken one bloody word go away you little blighter get lost get back to your mama and your tea youre no bloody use to me a pretty face the child had and the frown lines were worn as if by a martyred infant in the colours of a church window violet would notice a face like this childs and shed enthuse on it and want to tousle his hair and coo to him why didnt the child respond god knows and hes not caring hell be in church this brat on sunday morning with his hair combed and his face washed with a red cassock down to shined sandals and white socks probably be singing his bloody heart out in the choir stall and he wont even remember the strange shape of the man in the woods with the wild gaze and the body twist of fear hell be in church if giancarlo isnt back soon the child started up the rabbit alerted slid fast to his feet easily and with the suppleness of youth for harrison there was nothing beyond the lethargic motion of the wood the child began to move away and harrison watched fascinated for there was a silence under the boots that glided over the dry minefield of leaves and sticks his place thought harrison here among the animals and birds and the familiar he probably didnt know what the inside of a schoolroom looked like because this was his playground he watched the child go his slight body merging with the pale grey lines of the treetrunks when he was at the murky edge of vision harrison saw him drop to his knees and ease the fronds of a sapling across his face and shoulders the child had covered less than twenty yards but when he was settled harrison had to strain and search with his eyes to find his hidingplace into view trying to move with caution but failing to find quiet places for his feet came giancarlo source of the disturbance he closed quickly gun in hand and the brown paper bag held between the crook of his arm and his body he was alert hunting between the trees with his eyes but finding nothing to caution nor alarm him he dropped to his knee and slipped the pistol into the waist of his trousers the cleaned face and the bright tshirt gave him a youth and innocence that harrison had not seen before food and i havent had mine either we are both equally starved there was a little laugh and giancarlo leaned forward and put his arms behind harrisons head and unknotted the handkerchief pulled it clear and dropped it beside him better yes harrison spat from the side of his mouth cleared the spittle still bent low giancarlo bounced on his toes down into the earth crater and worked quickly and expertly at the wrist flex still better yes even better harrison looked deep into his face and struggled to comprehend the volatile changes of atmosphere after hours of silence in the car after the kicking of the early morning the new direction of the wind was too complex for him to comprehend what did you get for us to eat he asked lamely rubbing his wrists and restoring the glow of circulation and what the hell did it matter what importance did it hold not much some bread with cheese and salad it will fill us very good and i spoke to the man who is trying to find you a fool at the questura i called him by telephone i told him what would happen if franca were not freed by tomorrow morning giancarlo took a bulging bread roll from the bag ignored the cheese spillage and passed it to harrison he spoke proudly he tried to keep me talking to give them time for a trace but thats an old trick you wont hear sirens tonight arrison i told him also that i would talk direct to franca this evening and that they should bring her to his office a chatty banal conversation that of two men who have been buried for too long and for whom the quiet has proved oppressive what did you say would happen if franca were not freed harrisons words were mumbled through the sea of bread and salad i told them you would be executed thats what you told them i said that i would kill you and what did they say harrison ate on the words of both of them too unreal to be of value carboni is the name of the man who is hunting for you he was the only one that i spoke to he said nothing did he say if franca would be freed he did not answer that giancarlo smiled there was a certain warmth a certain charm in the scrubbed shaved features he did not answer any of my questions you know he knew my name he knew who it was that he was speaking to he was pleased with that the man carboni i mean it i mean it very deeply arrison i would be sorry to kill you it would not be what i want it was too much for geoffrey harrison to assimilate once in the yard behind his fathers house they had watched the chickens prowling beside the fence and decided which one would make their meal and which should survive and he had tried to communicate to the chosen fowl that there was nothing personal in the choice no malice it doesnt help you if you shoot me harrison trying to be calm trying to soften and mollify through dialogue only that each time you make a threat you must carry it out if you are to be believed you understand that arrison if i say that i will kill you unless i am given something then i must do it if i am denied it is credibility you understand that arrison why do you tell me this because you have the right to know harrison turned his head a slow casual movement traversed across the treefront and caught like a flash that was there and then gone the blue and white of the check shirt of the idiot child who had sat where giancarlo now squatted will they give you back your franca giancarlo no he said simply and his hand dived again in the bag and he passed another roll across to harrison an afterthought well i do not think so but i must try right arrison you would agree that i should try with the arrival of francesco vellosi from the viminale the summit meeting in carbonis office could begin just preceding the head of the antiterrorist unit had been the minister of the interior and before him the examining magistrate who had successfully jockeyed among his profession for the nominal role of heading the investigation tired men all of them harassed and without small talk at the outset there was argument over priorities around the bowed figure of the minister who knew the penalty for failure to arrest terrorist outrage was resignation and could not find in the bearing of the men about him the stimulus for a new initiative there were many points for dispute should any new advice be presented to the council of ministers regarding the decision to refuse consideration of the freeing of franca tandardini should franca tantardini be permitted to speak by telephone to the boy battestini at least two gettoni had been used on the telephone communication the call had come from outside the rome city limits and in the countryside the principal enforcers of the law were the carabinieri should they now control any further search operation or should the overall direction remain with the polizia was it useful to contact the vatican secretariat to explore the possibility of his holiness issuing a similar appeal to the rejected call of pope paul vi for aldo moros life should the president of the council of ministers broadcast to the nation why had it not been possible to extract greater information from the location of the telephone message much of it was unnecessary much of it timewasting sapping the concentration of the men in the room but then many had to clear themselves if there was a chance of failure to be found in tomorrows dawn reputations could be damaged perhaps destroyed backs must be protected as one of the most junior men in the hierarchy present giuseppe carboni was finally given what amounted to a free hand he would be provided with a liaison team to link him with criminalpol the carabinieri force and the armed forces if he succeeded then those who had set in motion the search operation would be well to the fore if he failed then shoulders would droop heads turn away and carboni would stand alone when they rose from the meeting the room emptied quickly it was as if the paint daubs of disaster already swept across the walls as he stood beside his desk smiling weakly at the ministers departing back carboni reflected that little had been gained only time frittered and disposed of look at it another way said vellosi his arm around carbonis short shoulder there is little likelihood of us saving harrison and perhaps that is not even the first priority what matters is that we find this scum you talk as if we have reached a state of war carboni murmured what matters is that we find this scum whether tomorrow or in a month or a year and we kick the shit out of him he never reaches asinara they are dragging us down vellosi that is the ground where we meet them where we fight them and where we win if in such times victory is available i am less certain concern yourself with the present carboni find me the boy battestini vellosi squeezed his arm and walked on out through the door in the front parking area of a small trattoria violet harrison parked her car not tidily not quietly but with a splash of movement and rising dust and the protest of an overextended engine the parking area was for patrons but she would take a cup of coffee and perhaps half a carafe of white wine and that would satisfy the whiteshirted waiters of her right to a table the verandah of the trattoria was at the back and she walked through the small construction of timber and corrugated iron roofing and past the kitchen where the fires were being stoked for the lamb and the veal she would sit beneath a screen of interlaced bamboo and from there she could watch across some scrub grass and shallow shifting hills of sand the boys who walked on the beach she seemed relaxed at peace but the polaroids on her face hid reddened eyes she showed a calm pose to the world obliterated her inner self sat at the table and waited occasionally she swung her head and gazed away down the beach a searchlight roving hunting all the time haunting and punishing chapter sixteen early afternoon in the great slumbering capital a wicked heat clamping on the bodies of the few romans who moved listlessly on the steaming paperstrewn streets little protection for walkers even from the high buildings of nineteenthcentury finery on the corso the pavements abandoned by their own citizens were given over to the perspiring grumbling tourists the mapclutchers guidebookscanners icecreamsuckers groped from ruin to ruin expressing their admiration for what they saw in shrill japanese blaring american dominant german like a stranger in his own community giuseppe carboni threaded an impatient way between the loiterers he crossed the small square in front of the colonnaded church and hurried up the six shallow steps to the central entrance of the church of san pietro in vincoli the visitors were thick shoulder to shoulder huddled close to their guides serious and solemnfaced as they mopped up the culture and the dampness of their armpits here carboni had been told he would find francesco vellosi the church of saint peter in chains is where the bonds of the saint are reverently kept shining and coated in dark paint inside a gold and glassfaced cabinet the central nave was occupied by the groups soaking up the required information the age of the construction the dates of renovation the history of the tomb of julius ii the smooth sculpture of the bearded and muscled moses that was the work of michelangelo but in the aisles in the narrower naves where the tourists gave ground to the worshippers carboni would find his man where the shadows were thicker where the tall candles burned in flickering insecurity where the women in black came in from the streets to pray in the righthand nave he saw vellosi three rows from the front kneeling hunched on a red hassock the hard man of the antiterrorist squad was now bent in prayer because his driver was slain and would be buried in the morning it was no surprise that vellosi chose this church on the same steps that carboni had climbed the carabinieri had shot to death antonio la muscio and captured the girls la vianale and salerno the place acted as a symbol to those who fought the underground of subversion and anarchy it was their place of triumph and riposte carboni did not intrude he crossed to the small side altar and waited with hands joined across his stomach the voices of the guides seemed distant the brush of scores of feet was near eliminated a place of tranquil value a place to shed for precious moments the fearsome and desperate load that the two men carried watching and waiting curling his toes ignoring the passage of time that could not be recouped carboni curbed himself he could be thankful that if nothing else he had escaped from his desk his aides his telephone and the endless computer printouts abruptly vellosi jackknifed himself from his knees and back on to his chair carboni darted forward and eased himself down beside him when their eyes met carboni could see that the man was rested that the purgative of prayer had refreshed him you forgive me capo for coming here to find you nothing carboni i came to say some words for my m a u r o a good place to come to carboni spoke softly with approval here we killed the rat exterminated la muscio it is a good place to come to speak with my friend it is right to remember the success catastrophe is burdening deadening there was a wry smile at vellosis lips catastrophe we are familiar with success is the star we seek and too often the cloud obscures the star it is seldom visible the two men spoke in church whispers vellosi content to idle till carboni was ready to unveil the purpose of his visit a deep sigh from carboni the man who will jump into a winter sea from a breakwater and must strip off his robe and discard his towel we talked long enough at the meeting carboni plunged long enough to have settled every matter that was outstanding but at the end we had decided nothing nothing beyond the fact that giuseppe carboni should take responsibility you had expected something different perhaps yes perhaps no carboni stared in front of him as he spoke over the shoulder of the wizened sparrow woman with her bones angular under the black blouse who mouthed quiet words to the altar a gathering like that is a farce a babble of men seeking with one voice to disclaim ultimate responsibility prepared only to pile it on my shoulders they are broad enough chuckled vellosi you should work at the viminale you would quickly learn then what is normal what is acceptable do we let the woman tantardini speak to the boy carboni sharper now playacting completed vellosi too responded the smile draining a savagery in his voice i hate that bitch believe me dear friend i hate her i wish to dear jesus that we had slaughtered her in the street understandable and unhelpful vellosi snatched back at him what do you need most now i have nothing i know only that battestini was early this morning in the area of rome i know that he has travelled on i have a car number but that could have been changed i have no hope of intervention before tomorrow morning the ebbing of the bravura so you must have a trace you must have a location if the bitch is there and talks to him then you give your engineers the possibility she has to speak to him you have to make her there was a snarl in vellosis voice as if the discussion had reached obscenity if i were to ask her she would spit in my face carboni looked around him in response to the protest coughs of those who objected to the interference of raised voices in their worship he stood up vellosi following and together they walked down the aisle between the colonnade and the chairs what would you tell her that you have to decide for yourself i came for help vellosi i cannot aid you you must read her when you see her when you meet her you will know why i cannot help you the inhibitions of the church quiet were lost on vellosi she is poison and you must think of the consequences for yourself if you involve her carboni stared back at vellosi as they stopped at the great opened doors a small and pudgy figure dwarfed by his colleague of the open and strong face he weighed his words for a moment you are nervous of her even from her cell in the rebibbia she frightens you no denials no stuttered protests vellosi said simply be careful carboni remember what i say be careful of the bitch through the afternoon little had passed between geoffrey harrison and giancarlo battestini harrisons arms had not been tied again since the food and he lay on his side on the earth of the bunker his only movements to swat the flies from his face and brush the ants and insects from his body and legs he might have slept had certainly dozed in the twilight area all the while giancarlo watched him with a casual and intermittent observation and with the gun resting on the leaves close to his hand the summer sun was high burning even now through the ceiling of foliage sufficient to shrivel any wind that might have infiltrated earlier sticky hot and defeated harrison slipped into a vegetable sloth his mind devoid of ideas and expectations no longer did the presence of the check shirt in the undergrowth a few yards beyond and behind giancarlo offer any hope of salvation just another witness to his helplessness another voyeur the body functions drove harrison to speak again its the call of nature giancarlo ridiculous that he was embarrassed couldnt use the language of the dressingroom of the mens club couldnt say i want to have a crap giancarlo i want to have a shit giancarlo didnt want to say it any other way and feared to foul his trousers its been a long time giancarlo looked at him curiously as if experiencing some new buttress of his power the great man of the multinational must ask giancarlos permission again because otherwise he would smell and lose his dignity and no more be a person of stature and importance the cat with the mouse the boy and the butterfly with the broken wing giancarlo teased in mock disbelief perhaps you are trying to trick me arrison really giancarlo i have to go im not tricking you the boy warmed to the hint of desperation perhaps you would try to escape from me i promise there is no trick but quickly what do you say then arrison what were you taught to say when you wanted something please giancarlo the boy grinned a sneer playing over his lips and you want to go in the trees where you cannot be seen you think many are watching you please giancarlo the boy was satisfied another victory another demonstration of strength enough and the pleasure was satiated he left the p on the ground and slowly taking his time manoeuvred himself behind harrison it was the work of a few seconds to detach the flex that fastened the ankles to the tree roots four or five metres only arrison no more arent you going to loosen my legs giancarlo was further amused crawl arrison and watch where your hands move that they do not go close to my knots once more harrison gazed away past giancarlo and towards the hidingplace of the child still visible were the flecks of the shirt between leaves and branches anger was rising out of the frustration the little bastard like a bloody puppy thats too young to have been trained that stays and mocks and will not come on his hands and knees harrison crawled the performing pet towards a cluster of birch trunks not too fair arrison the mocking call of derision his knees scuffed a trail through the leaves and surface earth before he was partially hidden by the trees he lowered his trousers squatted using his hands to support himself and felt the constriction and pain gush away god the bloody relief of it bloody freedom and the bloody smell too please giancarlo do you have any paper there was a ripple of laughter from past the trees i have no bidet for you i have no aerosol for you to spray under your armpits but paper i have for you subdued harrison thanked him and then repeated himself when the bag that had carried the rolls landed close to his feet thrown with accuracy he cleaned himself retrieved his trousers scuffed some dirt over the soiled paper and dragged himself back to his captor and his prison he crawled to the flattened earth in the cavity and lay down resuming his familiar position pliant and nonresistant and curled his arms behind his back close your eyes a command and with his legs trussed what chance nothing just pain nothing he clenched his eyes shut and heard only the slight sounds of giancarlos feet and then the hands were cruelly at his wrists and the flex was wound tight and brutally across his flesh and there was the pressure of a knee on the small of his back the weight slid from him and with its going there was again the mocking voice you can open your eyes above the horizon of the crater rim harrison saw giancarlo standing observing hands on hips something mindless something vacuous about the smile and the mouth and the dulled glare of the eyes youre enjoying yourself giancarlo its sick to be that way it means that you are i l l now we have a grand speech derision from the boy the void unbridged by the contact to treat anyone like this it means youre deranged youre a bloody lunatic you know what that means youre mad giancarlo youve flipped your bloody kd why say it why bother what bloody difference does it make i understand what you say but the boy was not roused youve become an animal giancarlo a vicious infected little giancarlo with studied care turned his back i do not listen to speeches i am not obliged to hear you why dont you do it now the whisper without fervour without passion the words of a second in the boxers ring when he has seen enough blood when he is ready to throw in the towel because it is not time because i am not ready i say it again giancarlo you enjoy it you must have felt like a kid giving yourself a wrist job when you killed the men back in the barn jerking yourself what are you going to do when you kill me take your bloody trousers d o w n giancarlo narrowed his eyes and on his slight forehead the frown deepened in its ruts his voice came as a rush of breeze among the trees you know nothing of us nothing you cannot know why a man goes sottoterra why a man discards all the trappings so sought after by your stinking breed why a man fights to destroy a system that is rotten you were smug and safe and fat and you were blind you know nothing of the struggle of the proletariat half into the dirt harrison shouted back bloody cliches parrot talk you learned in the drains you do not make it easier for yourself attempting an order and a sternness harrison called get it over with i have said to them that it will be at nine oclock if i have not my franca i will wait till nine that was my word keeping you till then does not threaten me giancarlo walked away a few paces discarded the conversation withdrew to his inner recesses gone from harrisons reach and hes right geoffrey you know nothing of them nothing at all of the new and embryo species nothing of the hate squashed into that mind and theres no help no succour the cavalry dont come this time just a bloody carcase already thats all geoffrey harrison looked into the green grey mist of the trellis of sapling branches and leaves and felt the falling of a greater loneliness he could not see the child perhaps it was his eyes perhaps he looked in the wrong place but he could not find the checked shirt though he peered till his eyes ached and hurt him a second carafe now stood emptied on the table the bopeep act and the boy not to be found the waiters had served the lunches waved their patrons away and stripped the cloths from the chipboard tables violet harrison seemed not to notice and with their studied politeness they waited on her pleasure as she toyed and sipped at the last glass of wine on the big circus wheel she alternated between hope and despair as the young men of the beach sauntered by straightbacked tanned from wind and sun and the flailing blows of the fine grains cocky assured eyes combeddown hair any would have served her purpose she saw the boy a long way off on the beach walking between two companions recognized him instantly could i have my bill please she rummaged in her bag for the notes gestured to the waiter that she required no change and was on her feet and smiling sweetly she walked out from the eating verandah taking what she hoped was a casual saunter and following a line that would intercept the boys path she did not look to her right the direction from which he was coming but held her head high and straight and focused on the blue seas depths and its breaking flecks of spume she strode on waiting for the greeting consumed with a growing creeping nervousness t h e english lady good afternoon she spun round gouging at the warm sand beneath her sandals not that she could claim surprise but when his voice came almost behind her it cut and burned at her consciousness oh its you how else did you do it how to flick up a clever answer when all you were confronting was the stud required for half an hours brisk anonymous work i did not expect to see you here again its a public beach dont frighten him off too trite violet god youd kick and curse yourself i come here quite a lot she saw the boys little gesture with his hands the clipping of his forefinger against his thumb the message to the other two that the principal wished to be left to his opportunities close together but untouching no bridging contact of fingers no brushing of thighs they moved together towards the sea you would like to swim signora how hed speak to a friend of his bloody mother thought violet not yet i thought id just lie on the beach for a bit give me your towel she dived into her bag and produced it for him he spread it out on the sand gestured with his hand for her to sit and followed her down there was little room for both of them if they were to share it his swimming costume was brief and bulging grotesquely you understand geoffrey their hips touched you wont cast a rock geoffrey my name is marco and geoffrey wouldnt know that was the rule no blows below the belt for geoffrey no knowledge and therefore no hurt i am violet that is the name of a flower in english yes a very beautiful flower i think i know you are alone geoffrey i too am alone you cannot move you cannot help yourself i too geoffrey i said it the last time we met and i was right you are a very cheeky boy marco he smiled across the inches of towel at her the toothpaste advertisement the smile of a child taken to a shop who knows it is his birthday knows if he is patient he will receive his present what time is it giancarlo past five the boy returned to his own chasm of silence he had much to think of much to concern himself with less than three hours to the schedule that he had set himself had insisted on less than three hours till he spoke once more with his franca problems and options bombarded his limited intellect if they met his demand if they agreed to the exchange where should he fly to algiers libya iraq the peoples republic of south yemen would any of those places take them and how to choose a boy who had never been out of italy how would he guarantee their safety if an airport rendezvous were permitted what was the capability of the antiterrorist pigs would they seek a shooting gallery regardless of the prisoner it was too much for him to assimilate too great the difficulties too encompassing a great team the brigatisti had for the moro operation and they now sat in asinara locked in their cells the failed men as he weighed each trick in the card pack so too grew the realization of the sheer mountainface he must scale start with the haven start there because with nowhere to go they were lost a country to welcome them and harbour them start there an arab country what else but even their own people were now shunned and ignored he had seen the pictures of the lorries blocking the runways in algiers and benghazi and tripoli if they would do that when an arab brother was seeking r e f u g e late for the answers to the questions the time was ripe for answers before claudio walked to his room in the pensione before the rapido sped towards reggio before the calabresi whimpered in their terror perhaps it was all irrelevant did he know in his heart there would be no exchange and if there were to be no exchange what then would the leadership want of him he wrestled in the growing purgatory of the dilemma where lay the victory in this skirmish the body of his arrison in a ditch the head blasted with the shell of the p that or his prisoner released to walk away on a road with a communique in his pocket to be printed the next morning in paese sera and il messaggero where lay the victory for the proletariats revolution how had the brigatisti advanced when they took the life of aldo moro on the slimecovered beach at focene he was old enough only for questions too young for their responses if he could not conjure the answers then he would not see his franca again not for twenty years and that was for ever three days since his hands had travelled her skin since her golden head had passed across the softness of his belly to be denied that for a lifetime the boy felt a gust of pain there was nothing that was simple facile and that was why there was a steel in the comrades who fought in franca tantardini and the men in the island gaol and what was the sinew of giancarlo battestini in his twentieth year lover of tantardini son of a borghese member of the nap a dozen hours slow and tardy hours and he would have the answer his hands clutched together white to the knuckles giancarlo waited for the time when he should leave harrison and make his way again to the lakeside of bracciano in his hotel room archie carpenter listened to michael charlesworths clipped and exact resume a voice far away on a bad connection the situation if anything had deteriorated reuters and upi carried on their wires that a boy giancarlo battestini categorized as little more than a probationer of the nap had telephoned the questura to emphasize the terms of his ultimatum i dont know how it is that the italians allow this sort of information out but nothing stays secure here it seems battestini was full of his threats theres a fair depression about the way its going charlesworth had said holding himself the diver conserving his oxygen carpenter had heard him out then the explosion so what are you all doing about it what we were doing about it earlier archie it has not changed sweet damnall you can put it that way charlesworth placated t h a t way if you want to what other bloody way is there abuse doesnt help archie youve spoken to the ambassador yourself hes explained our situation ive heard since that london have called him they back him hes written off my man histrionics dont help either im sorry youre sorry were all s o r r y but youll come and have that meal tonight if you want me to come on up and help us through a bottle did you get in touch with the wife i rang again took a bloody effort to but i tried theres no answer its a filthy business archie but dont think youre alone with the hair shirt its shared about a bit you know charlesworth rang off archie carpenter straightened his bed brushed his hair raised his tie knot and drew on his jacket he took the lift downstairs and walked out through the front foyer of the hotel stepping irritably over the piled suitcases of an arriving tour he summoned a taxi and asked for the questura early summer evening the traffic rushing for home and guaranteeing him an exciting and lively journey among the pedestrians and across the traffic lanes carpenter barely noticed a telephone call from the enquiry desk had promptly led to his being ushered up the stairs to the offices of giuseppe carboni now transformed into a tactical crisis centre shirtsleeves tobacco smoke coffee beakers a threequarters emptied scotch bottle faces lined with weariness the howl of electric fans the chatter of teletype machines and radiating energy carboni in the midst rotund and active carpenter hesitated by the door was spied out waved forward come in carpenter come and see our humble efforts carboni shouted at him this was the old world the known scents an emergency room under pressure this was something for carpenter to feel and absorb he felt an interloper yet at home among the men he could find sympathy for the clock was turned back as he came diffidently past the desks where the paper mountained past the photographs stuck with tape to the walls that showed shocked and staring faces past the telephones that demanded response i dont want to be in the way but you cannot sit in the hotel room any longer something like that mister carboni and you come here because everyone you speak to gives you bad news or no news and from me you hope for a difference something lovable about him carpenter thought overweight ugly as sin dirty fingernails a shirt that should have seen the wash and a bloody good man it was getting at me just sitting a b o u t you know how it is i will educate you carpenter carboni was sliding on his coat then turning away to bellow what seemed to carpenter a score of differing instructions to varied recipients and simultaneously i will show you our enemy you will witness what we fight against i know you policemen from england detailed and organized men who have believed that you are the best in the world im not a policeman any more you retain the mentality it has stayed with you carboni laughed without a smile a nervous tic the rest of the world are idiots secondclass people i understand well come with me my friend we go across the city to the rebibbia gaol that is where we hold the tantardini woman and i must play the taxidriver and bring her here because that is what little giancarlo wants and we must please him carpenter sensed the swollen anger in the man wondered where it could find an outlet the laugh came again raising and suspending the flesh rolls of the jaw i must please him because if he does not talk to tantardini then your harrison is dead i am here to save him i will do my humble best to save him i hadnt really doubted that sir carpenter let the respect run in his voice because this was a professional man this was a caring man so come and see her know your enemy that is what you say in england the better you know him the better you fight him carboni caught carpenters arm and propelled him back towards the door you will see that we risk much at this stage but dont tell me that it was never like that in london dont tell me that always you were supreme we had the black times we have experience we know the black times tonight it is that but darker his arm still clamped by carbonis fist carpenter surged down the corridor across the bonnet of the little red fiat the child drew with a pliant finger the letters of his name in the dirt covering the paintwork it had perplexed him at first to find a car edged from the field into the shelter of the trees and he had skirted it twice before gaining the courage to approach it he had gazed inside admired the shiny newness of the seat leather and let his hand flit to the bright chrome door handle and felt it slide down under pressure but he did not dare to climb into the car and sit in the drivers seat and hold the steeringwheel as he would dearly like to have done his compensation was the writing of his name in big and bold and shaking letters that task completed his interest moved on and he walked away as the sun slipped delaying his journey home to the farm only for the time it took to pluck some hedgerow flowers for his mother he had little sense of the hour but the chill that was rising from the grass carried by the freshening wind was enough to dictate his going he ambled between the chewing cows holding tightly to the stems of the flowers admiring their colours that his mother and father might be cruelly anxious for him was beyond the comprehension of his young mind chapter seventeen together archie carpenter and giuseppe carboni stood in the courtyard of the gaol far on the inside from the high swinging gates ringed by walls and watchtowers and men who patrolled catwalks with the guns ready in their hands the rebibbia prison carboni said was the maximum security holding centre for the capital city a fearsome and odious place it seemed to carpenter where even in the open where the wind could blow there was the smell of kitchens and lavatories and a community in confinement she will be here one more day carboni intoned t h e n we transfer her to messina to await the courts god willing it will be months before they drag her into the light again this is not your work these are not the people you are normally with a gentle query from carpenter i am a criminal policeman i do not have a political background that is the can of worms for a policeman but everyone is very willing that i should be the man who takes the weight of this action there are others better fitted than i but they did not raise their hands there was a tight resigned sadness on carbonis face but that is how we live here that is our society we do not fall down and wag our tails and demand to be given the hardest task because there lies the way to honour and promotion when the risk of failure is greatest we are survivors carpenter you will learn that he broke off his attention directed to the side door of a small building that fronted a towering fivestorey cell block carabinieri with light machineguns led the way officers with medal ribbons followed and then the prisoner it was the sound of the chains intrusive and strange to carpenter that alerted him to the presence of franca tantardini diminutive when surrounded by so many taller men a flower choked by weeds carpenter shrugged stop the bloody politicizing archie shes not a badlooker either good pair of hips on her there was no fear on the womans face a battleship under steam proud and devastating and intimidating the face that launched giancarlo chucked him far out to sea an impressive bit of woman mister carboni if you find a psychopath impressive carpenter then this one would meet your definition youve overstepped the line archie taking the guided tour for granted as of right youre the workhouse boy here out on a charity ride and taking favours and remember what they brought you here to see the bloody enemy archie the enemy of the state they watched as franca tantardini was led into the windowless grey van with her gaolers and around them there was running and movement and the revving of engines from the escort cars four of them back windows lowered machineguns protruding the rear of the van was held open and carboni moved rapidly inside carpenter following and chastened we are sensitive at this m o m e n t about these people t a k e my apology it was the remark of an idiot thank you a half smile fast and then obliterated replaced by the set hard features of a man about his work carboni offered a hand to help carpenter climb inside there were two lines of benches in the interior running against the sides and the woman rested in a corner far from the door illumination came from a single bulb protected by steel mesh carboni felt in his waist and produced his shortbarrelled pistol and handed it without comment to an escort who would sit at a distance from the prisoner you are armed carpenter no a blush as if he had displayed an inadequacy the van drew away slowly at first then speeding forward and the echo of the sirens in front and behind bathed the shallow interior come and join me carboni a hand against the ceiling to preserve his balance had struggled across the heaving floor and subsided on to the bench beside the woman carpenter took a place opposite her tantardini eyed them indifferently franca the policeman spoke as if it hurt to use her first name as if afterwards he would soaprinse his mouth i am carboni of the questura i am in charge of the investigation into the kidnapping of an english businessman geoffrey harrison am i to be accused of that too she laughed clearly is every crime in rome to be set against the terrible the fearsome tantardini listen to me franca listen and do not interrupt the talk was fast and in italian leaving carpenter uncomprehending his attention held only by the calm bright face of the woman hear me out he was taken this englishman by a calabresi group now he has been removed from them and he is in the hands of your boy your giancarlo again the laugh and the rich diamond smile battestini could not deliver a letter he has killed three men he has moved harrison half across the country carboni pierced her with his small pig eyes the heat in the van was intolerable and he mopped at his face with a stained handkerchief battestini holds the englishman in rome and demands your freedom against his prisoners life there was a trickle of wonderment and surprise battestini has done all this on his own that is what we believe almost a chuckle so why do you come to me you are going now to my office in little more than an hour in eighty minutes battestini will telephone that office he has demanded to talk to you we have agreed carpenter the eyewitness watched the tightening of the womans body saw the muscles ripple against the cloth of her jeans he is very young this boy too young i tell you something very honestly franca if any harm should come to harrison then giancarlo will die where we find him why tell this to me you bedded him franca the words ripped in distaste from carbonis mouth you poured the paraffin on his calflove he does this for you the van had lost its speed telling the occupants that the builtup sprawl of northeast rome had been reached and the sirens bellowed for passage with a greater ferocity carpenter watched the woman as she lapsed into silence as if pondering what she had been told the blanket of warm air wrapped all of them and there was a drop of sweat eking from her hairline across the fine chiselled nose what do you offer me i offer you the chance to save the boys life he is not of your sort franca he is not a man of the nappisti he is a boy you will go to gaol for many years not less than twenty help us now and it would be taken into account at your trial there would be clemency as if from instinct her mouth curled scornfully before the softness of the womans lips reappeared you ask me to secure the release of the englishman t h a t is what we ask of you and i will talk with giancarlo you will talk with him carboni looked hard into her waiting for the response conscious that he had committed much of his future to the conversation of a few minutes whitened skin pale as the flesh of an underground creature hair that was not greased and ordered tired to exhaustion he is very young the woman murmured just a boy just a pair of clumsy little hands thank you franca your action will be rewarded what had been settled carpenter could not know carboni had leaned back against the discomfort of the rolling metal wall and tantardini sat very still except that her fingers played on the links of the chains that fastened her wrists and she wasnt wearing a bra either bloody marvellous sight and the blouse must have shrunk in the last wash wrap it archie carboni seemed happy enough something would have been sorted the van travelled at steady speed towards the inner city only when the last of them had retreated noisily through the low yellow gorse clump beneath the pines did violet harrison open again her eyes it was too dark under the trees for her to see his fleeing back but there were the sounds for a long time of his blundering feet and his calls for his friends the pain in her body was intense bitter and vivid and there was a chill seeping against her skin but the cold was nothing set against the agony of the wounds provided by the boy marco and his friends the worst was at the gentle summit of her thighs on the line where the tan and the whiteness split where the bruises would be forming she did not cry out was beyond tears and remorse her horizon set only on controlling the violence of the aching the scratches on her face were alive where the nails had ripped at her cheeks as she had writhed and sought to escape from them and the harshness of the ground dug deep into the weak slackness of her buttocks that had been pounded battered into the earth surface at first it had been right as she had prepared it as her fantasies had dictated she and the boy marco had gone together from the heat of the beach to the shade of the pine canopy a tight path that flicked the gorse against her bared legs below the hem of the loose beach dress had led them to a place that was hidden where the scrub formed a fortress wall of privacy swimming to the ground she had slipped the dress over her head an absence of words and invitation because everything was implicit and unspoken first the bikini top loosened by herself because his hands were jumping with nervousness and then the cupping of her breasts till the boy was panting frantic fingers leaping over her and violet harrison lying back willing him on exposed fingers on the smoothness of her belly and reaching down and feeling for her and hunting for her and she clutching at the dark curled hair of his head that was when she had heard the giggles of the watchers and she had started up arms crossing her chest and they had come like hyenas to a prey one on each arm and marco pulling her knees apart cutting at her with the sharpness of his nails and tugging at the slight cotton fabric of the bikini bottom the sweet smile of respect lost from marcos face replaced by the bared teeth of the rampant rat first marco penetrating and deep and hard and hurting her because she was not ready and when he was spent then the first friend came and there was a hand across her mouth and her arms were spread for crucifixion after the first friend the second and then again marco and nothing said among them just the driving of the hips and the gush of their excitement at the forbidden too good to miss marcos fortune right that it should be shared among his friends the last had not even managed and when she spat in his face and his friends jeered encouragement he had raked her cheek and she had felt the warm blood sprinkle her skin he had rolled away leaving only his eyes and those of the other two boys to perpetuate the violation the tears would come later back in the flat back at their home when she thought again of geoffrey she stood up on her weakened legs said aloud god help me that he should ever know what if this were the time that he was preparing to die what if this was the moment that he clutched at an image of violet what if it were now that he looked for her as she was walking on a path in strange woods her clothes devastated her modesty wrecked and laughed over and splintered never let him find out please god never she had not even spoken to him when he left the house that morning she had lain in the bed her nightdress tight around her aware of his movements in the flat but she had not called him because she never did because they had only banalities to speak of forgive me geoffrey please please only if geoffrey died would he never know only then would she be safe in her secret and he must live because she had betrayed him and was not fit for the weeds of the widow for the hypocrisy of condolence she must will him to live a terminal patient of catastrophic internal illness sometimes comes back always there is hope always there is chance and then he will know if the miracle is enacted he will know violet harrison ran on the pine needle rug the pain of the wounds was subsidiary to the greater hurt of shame and humiliation she skirted the trattoria darkened and shuttered and sprinted for the car park her hand plunged in her bag wrenched at the cosmetics in the search for the car keys when she sat in the driving seat and the ignition fired she trembled with the tears that had been stifled come home geoffrey even if no one is there come home my brave darling come home goodbye arrison giancarlo could barely see his prisoner against the dirt black of the earth pit goodbye giancarlo a faint voice devoid of hope i will be back soon as if harrison needed to be reassured as if all his ordeal was a fear of being alone with darkness a slight stirring of warmth and the nudge of communication was the confidence of the boy failing was the certainty sliding giancarlo slipped away along the path feeling with his arms outstretched in front of him for the low branches there was plenty of time he had come so far and yet where was the measure of his achievement a bramble stem caught with its spikes at the material of his trousers he tore himself clear had he advanced his claim to francas freedom his ankle turned under a protruding root the p dug at the skin of his waist the acknowledgement that this was his sole power of persuasion his only right to be heard and known in the great city basking in its summer evening to the south the breath of darkness had eddied into the great courtyard of the questura the headlights and roof lamps of the convoy from the rebibbia gleamed out their urgency as they swung through the archway from the outside street into the parking area more shouting more running men more guns as the van was backed towards an opened door that led directly to the cell corridor among those who worked late in the citys police headquarters there were many who hurried down the internal staircases and craned from the upper windows that they might catch a brief glimpse of la tantardini they were rewarded sparsely a flash of the colour of her blouse as she was manhandled the few feet from the van steps to the entrance of the building and disappearance carboni did not follow her but stood in the centre of the courtyard among the reversing straightening cars that jockeyed for the last parking places archie carpenter stood a few feet from him sensing that the policeman preferred his own thoughts for company she had been long gone from their sight when carboni threw off the spell turned to look for carpenter you would not have understood what passed between us not a word im sorry i have to be brief carboni began to walk towards the principal entrance to the building ignoring the many who watched him as a related secondary object of interest now that the woman was gone t h e boy will telephone at eight i have to trace that call i must know the location from where he telephones to trace the call i must have time only when he talks to tantardini will he gabble on he will talk to her carbonis face was etched with anxiety i have told her also that if harrison is harmed then we will kill battestini wherever we find him but that if she cooperates then clemency will be shown her in the courts which you have no power to guarantee right carpenter no power at all but now they have plenty to talk of and they will use quickly the time that the engineers need i have no other option but reliance on the trace procedure carpenter spoke quietly you have one other option to free tantardini for harrisons life dont joke with me carpenter not now later when it is finished they stopped at the outer door of carbonis office the retort was rising in carpenters throat and he suppressed it and thought for the first time how ludicrous to these people was the proposition that seemed straight and clear and commonsense i wish you luck mister carboni only luck you are mean with your favours englishman they entered the office and carpenter was quick to appraise the mood sensitive to the atmosphere of downed heads flattened feet gloom and frustration this was carbonis own team and if they were not believing in success then who was he to imagine in his mind the incredible carpenter watched as carboni moved among the impromptu desks and tables and the teleprinters in the outer room speaking softly to his men he saw the queue of shaken heads the mournful mutters of the negative like hes going round a cancer ward and nobodys carrying the good news nobodys lost his pains nobody thinks hes coming through poor bastard thought carpenter carboni expended a long powered sigh and slumped to the chair behind his desk with the sense of theatre of tragedy he slapped a hand on to the cream telephone receiver in front of him call vellosi get him to come here not the same room as this but ask him to be close he rubbed at the weariness in his eyes bring her up now bring tantardini the child fled from the raw opened hand of his mother neat and nimble on his feet he dodged the swinging blow scattered the posy of hedge flowers on to the stone slabs of the kitchen floor and scampered for the corridor that led to his bedroom all afternoon ive been calling you from the h o u s e i was only in the wood mama he called shrilly in his fright from the sanctuary of his room i even went and bothered your father in the field he called too he wasted his time when he was busy she did not follow him he had achieved safety mama in the wood i saw his mothers voice boomed back surging to him as in falsetto she mimicked his small voice i saw a fox i saw a r a b b i t i followed the flight of a hawk youll have no supper tonight into your night clothes sick with worry you had me he waited trying to gauge the scale of her anger the enormity of his fault then wheedled in justification mama in the wood i saw she snapped her interruption back at him silence your chatter silence it and get yourself to bed and youll not sit with your father after his supper not another sound from you or ill be in and after you but mama ill be in and after you good night mama may the virgin watch over you and papa tonight the voice was small the fluency broken by the first tears on the childs smoothdowned cheeks his mother bit her lower lip it was not right to shout at a small child and he had so few to play with and where else was there for him to go but to the woods or to the fields with his father it would be better when he started school in the autumn but she had been frightened by his absence and she consoled herself that her punishment of her only little one was for his own good she returned to the preparation of her mans supper throughout the city and its suburbs the security net was poised more than five hundred cars and trucks and riot vans were on the streets they wore the colours of the primo celere and the squadra volante and the squadra mobile others were decorated in the royal blue of the carabinieri there were the unmarked cars of the undercover men and of sisde the secret service the agencies of government were poised to spring should the engineers of the questura basement provide the map reference from which giancarlo battestini telephoned engines ticking idly watches and clocks repeatedly examined machineguns on the back seats of cars on the metalled floors of vans a great army but one which rested till the arrival of the orders and instructions without which it was a helpless useless force on the fifth floor of the questura in the control centre the technicians had exhausted the lights available on their wall map for marking the position of their interception vehicles a clock creeping up to twenty hours had silenced conversation and movement leaving only the mindless hum of an airconditioning system grimfaced wearing his years francesco vellosi strode from the central doors of the viminale to his car that waited at the apex of the halfmoon drive the men who were to escort him to the questura fidgeted in the seats of the car that would follow as he settled in the back seat he was aware of the clatter of the arming of weapons from an upper room the minister watched him go then resumed his tiger pacing of the carpet he would hear by telephone of the nights developments nothing impeded giancarlo a fierce moonlight guided his way there was a stream of cars on the road but of course there would be cars for this was a resort of the roman summer and no driver would see anything extraordinary in a youth with the long hair of a student the tshirt and jeans uniform of the unemployed on the road he did not flinch from the blinding beams of the headlights on down the hill he walked till he could see the still reflection of the lights of the trattorie and bars playing on the distance of smooth water on down the hill with only occasional stolen glimpses at the slowmoving hands of his watch the fools with their wives and girls they would know of giancarlo battestini those who rushed past him impatiently in their cars would know of him tomorrow tomorrow they would know his name and roll it on their tongues and savour it and try to ask how and try to ask why the pavements beside the lake were filled with those who drifted in aimless procession they did not glance at the boy safe in their own lives safe in their own business they ignored him at the ristorante the kiosk with the telephone was empty he darted his eyes again to his watch patience giancarlo a few more minutes only he collected the gettoni from the knot in his handkerchief where they had been segregated noise and moneypurchased happiness crept from the interior where he stood hemmed in by the glass walls of the cubicle he could see the mouths that burst with pasta the hands grasping at the wine bottles the bellies that rocked over the tabletops tomorrow they would not shriek in their gusts of laughter tomorrow they would talk of giancarlo battestini till it consumed them till it burned them the very repetition of the name his name the childs father came to the stonewalled tinroofed farmhouse when there was no longer light for him to work his fields a tired sleepridden man looking for his food and his chair and his television and his rest his wife chided him for the late hour played the scolder till she kissed him light and pecking on a hairroughened cheek to her he was a good man full of work heavy in responsibility a loyal man to his family who depended on the longdrawnout power of his muscles to make a living from the coarse hillside fields his food would soon be ready and she would bring it on a tray to their living parlour where the old television set provider of black and white pictures sat proudly on a coarse wood table perhaps later the boy could sit with him because her anger had evaporated with the passing of her fear at his absence but only if he had not already drifted to sleep he had not replied when she had told her man of the time their child had returned and the punishment imposed just shrugged and turned to the sink to wash away the days grime she held sway over the domestic routine and it was not for him to challenge her authority hearing him safely settled she hurried to her stove lifted the big grey metal saucepan down and drained the steaming water from the pasta while through the opened doorway blazoned the music of the opening of the evenings news programme she did not go to watch beside her husband all day the radio channels had been obsessed with an event from the city city people city troubles not relevant to a woman with stone floors to be scrubbed daily a neverfilled purse and a distant difficult child to rear she set the pasta on a plate doused it in the brilliant red of the tomato sauce flecked it with the grated cheese and carried it to her man flopped in his chair she could draw satisfaction from the happy and contented smile on her husbands face and the way that he shook off his weariness sat himself upright and the speed with which his fork drove down into the eel lengths of the brilliant buttercoated spaghetti on the screen were photographs of a man with combed hair and a knotted tie and the smile that read responsibility and success replaced by those of a boy whose face showed confrontation and fight and the trapped gaze of a prisoner there was a picture of a car and a map of the mezzo giorno she stayed no longer animals she said and returned to her kitchen and her work at one hundred and forty kilometres an hour violet harrison careered along the dual carriageway of the raccordo her handbag lay on the seat beside her but she did not bother to winkle out the square lace handkerchief with which she might have dabbed her puffed tearheavy eyes only geoffrey in her thoughts only the man with whom she lived a rotten neutered life and who now in her fear she loved more than she had ever before been capable commitment to geoffrey the boring little man who had shared her home and her bed for a dozen years geoffrey who polished the heels of his shoes brought home work from the office thought marriage was a girl with a gin waiting at the front door for the return of the frontiersman husband geoffrey who didnt know how to laugh poor little geoffrey in the hands of the pigs as she had warmed and nestled close to a stranger on a crowded beach and watched the front of his costume and believed that prayers were answered beyond the grass and crash barriers of the central reservation cars rushed past her swallowed in the night blazing headlights lost as fast as they had reared in front of her the lights played on her eyes flashed and reflected in the moisture of her tears cavorted in her vision as tumbling cascades and aerosols of lights and stars that was why beyond the aurelia turnoff from the raccordo she did not see the signs beside the road that warned of the approaching end of the dual carriageway did not read the great painted arrows on the tarmac that was why she was heedless of the closing headlights of the fruit lorry bound for naples the impact was immense searing in noise and speed the agony howl of the ripped bodywork metal of the car a fractional moment of collision and then the car was tossed away as if its weight were trifling the car rose high in the air before crashing down destroyed and unrecognizable in the centre of the road the face of geoffrey harrison its lines and contours was frozen to his wifes mind in the final broken seconds of her life the sound of herself speaking his name was bolted to her tongue there was much traffic returning at that time from the coast many sitting behind their wheels would curse the unseen source of the queues that built on either side of the accident and then shudder and avert their faces as they witnessed in their lights the reason for their delay in front of carbonis desk franca tantardini sat on a hard unprepossessing chair she was upright taking little notice of the men who bustled around her gazing only at the window with its dark abyss and undrawn curtains the fingers of her hands were entwined on her lap the chains removed more like a waiting bride than a prisoner she had not replied when she had first come into the room and carboni had taken her to a corner and spoken in his best bedside hush beyond the ears of his subordinates archie carpenters eyes never left her not the sort of creature that he had handled when he was with special branch in london his career spanned the years before the irish watch before the bombers came in earnest not much colour in those days for carpenter who was concerned with the machinations of the farout shop stewards the marxist militants and that old source of inspiration the soviet trade delegation from highgate his had been the old branch the archaeological specimen that withered and died in its ice age before learning the new techniques of the war against urban terrorism the guerrilla fighter was a new phenomenon for archie carpenter something only experienced through newspapers and television screens but there seemed to be nothing special about the woman nothing to put her on the pedestal well what do you expect archie a che guevara tshirt the hammer and sickle tattooed on her forehead the telephone on carbonis desk rang difficult really to know what to expect criminals the world over all the same whether its political whether its material big fat bouncy kids when theyve the air of freedom to breathe miserable little bastards when the door closes behind them when theyve twenty years of sitting on a blanket carboni grabbed at the receiver snatching it from the cradle thought shed have more fight in her from the way they cracked her up belt it archie for christs sake carboni t h e call that you have been waiting for dottore connect it the light bulb had been removed from the telephone kiosk in the half dark giancarlo watched the second hand of his watch moving slowly on its path he knew the available time was aware of the ultimate danger with one hand he held the telephone pressed hard against his right ear the noise of the ristorante stifled pronto carboni a voice fused in metallic interference battestini he had used his own name chipped at the pretence good evening giancarlo i have little time you have as much time as you want giancarlo the sweat rivers ran on the boys face will you meet the demands of the nuclei armati proletaria the voice cut back at him smothering his words the demands of giancarlo battestini not of the nappisti we stand together as a movement we he broke off absorbed in the motion of his watch ticking on its way edging towards fiasco you are there giancarlo the boy hesitated forty seconds gone forty seconds of the two minutes that was required for a trace i have demanded the freedom of f r a n c a that is what must happen if arrison is to live it is a very complicated matter giancarlo there are many things to be considered there was an awful deadening calmness in the responses a sponge that he hit at but could not corner and pinion oose to a minute gone there is one question only carboni yes or no the first hint of anxiety broke in the distorted voice the noise of breathing mingled with the atmospherics we have franca here for you to talk to giancarlo yes or no that was my question more than a minute gone the hand on its second arc franca will talk to you all eyes in the room on the face of franca tantardini carboni held the telephone mouthpiece against his shirt looked deep and far into the woman saw only the blank proud composed eyes and knew that this was the ultimate moment of risk nothing to be read from her mouth and from her hands that did not fidget showed no impatience total silence and an atmosphere leadladen that even carpenter without the italian language could sense and be fearful of i trust you franca barely audible the words as carbonis hand with the telephone stretched out towards the responding arm of la tantardini there was a carelessness now in her smile almost human long slender fingers exchanged for the fatty stumpy grip of carbonis fist when she spoke it was with a clear and educated voice no roughened edges no slang of the gutter the daughter of a wellset family of bergamo it is franca my little f o x do not interrupt me hear me to the finish and little fox do as i instruct you exactly as i instruct you they have asked me to tell you to surrender they have asked me to tell you that you should release the englishman carboni permitted his eyes in secrecy to float to his watch one minute and twenty seconds since the call was initiated he saw the image of activity in the questura basement the isolation of the communication the evaluation of the digital dialling process the routing of the connection back towards its source he strained forward to hear better her words you have asked for my release little fox listen to me there will be no freedom so i say this to you giancarlo this is the l a s t it was the action of a moment franca tantardini on her feet right arm high above her head the fist in clenched salute a face riven with hatred muscles of the neck bulged like sewer pipes kill him giancarlo kill the pig forza la proletaria forza la rivoluzione giancarlo la lotta continua even as they were rising to their feet the men about her struggling to reach her she had moved whiplash fast towards the receiver on carbonis desk as she wrenched at the telephone tearing its flex from the wall fitting they pounded her to the ground the little men of the room kicked and punched at the unresisting body of the woman while carboni and carpenter separated by the mele and on their different sides of the office sat stock still and assessed the scope of the catastrophe take her back to the rebibbia and i want no marks on her none that can be seen a terrible ice cold in his voice as if the shock wave of betrayal had broken giuseppe carboni another telephone ringing he picked it up placed it to his ear and dropped his weight on to an elbow as he listened he watched franca tantardini half carried half dragged take her leave of him carboni nodded as information was given him offered no gratitude for the service they say from the basement that i had told them they would have a minimum of two minutes to find the trace they say that i gave them one minute and forty seconds they say that was not sufficient i have failed your man carpenter i have failed your man carpenter spat back at him they gave you nothing just that it was from the north of the c i t y carpenter stood up and walked towards the door he wanted to say something vicious wanted to let the frustration go and couldnt find it in himself you couldnt kick a dog not one that was already limping that had the mange at its collar there was nothing he could say grown men werent they not kids who could bully all adults all trying all confronted by the same cancer that was eating deep and ravenously im going round to charlesworths place the embassy fellow you can reach me there till late i will be here of course he would be where else for him no embassy dutyfree scotch for giuseppe carboni no shutting out of the problem with seventy per cent proof carpenter let himself out didnt look back at carboni and walked down the corridor to the staircase through the connecting door and into the inner sanctum marched francesco vellosi there was uninhibited hatred on his face brutal and devastating informing carboni that he had heard the words of tantardini i told you to be careful carboni i told you you told me a strand of sympathy shone anything with the time available nothing of substance nothing that matters their arms around each others waists in mutual consolation the two men walked from the room to the wirecaged lift for the fifth floor they would saturate an area of slightly more than three thousand five hundred square kilometres from viterbo in the north to la storta in the south while the western limit would be the coastal town of civitavecchia and the eastern line would be the romafirenze autostrada formality the task provided by the basement technicians too great an area for a manhunt too great an area to lift the mens bowed shoulders as they emerged from the lift vellosi said softly t h e y will crucify you they will say she should never have spoken to the boy it was the best chance to make him talk for longer who will say that you will be torn apart carboni the entertainment of the wild dogs arms still round each other faces close carboni looking up and vellosi down eyes meeting but you will be with me vellosi only a smile only a tightening of the fist in the material of carbonis shirt as they came to the operations centre the childs head wearing a winning smile drifted around the kitchen door m a m a the plaintive call can i sit with papa you were a bad boy today im sorry mama she had no stomach for the fight was pleased the child had come from his room exorcizing her shame that she had lost her temper and tried to strike him god knows they both worshipped their lone son papa is tired she heard the distant steady snore from her mans throat the warm food cosseted in him the burned energy of the day seeking replacement you can sit with him but dont you bother him dont you wake him the child waited for no more hesitation from his mother he raced in his light bare feet his loose pyjamas flowing through the kitchen and into the livingroom his mother listened papa are you asleep papa can i tell you what i saw in the wood please papa she slapped the towel across her hands summoned herself across the room in a cloak of annoyance and hissed through the doorway at the sofa where the child snuggled against his sleeping father what did i say to you that you were not to wake him another word from you and you go to your bed leave papa alone you talk to papa in the morning yes mama can i watch the programme a concert flickered on the aged screen the harmony of the notes suffering from the distortion of the set she nodded her head that was permitted and it was good for the boy to sit with his father but dont you wake p a p a and dont you argue when i call you for bed chapter eighteen the sounds of the returning giancarlo carried from far away to geoffrey harrison the arrival was blundering and clumsy as if silence and stealth were no longer of importance the noise spread through the quiet of the wood where there was nothing to compete with the snapping of branches the crushing of fallen leaves he would not be able to see the boys face when he came would not be able to recognize the mood and the danger a blessing or an additional wound better to know when the boy was still far from him better his news while the creature was still distant they say some men die well and others die badly harrison remembered when he was a kid and hed read in a magazine stories of executions by law in a gaol they said some had screamed and some walked with a high head and some were carried and some went unaided and thanked the men around them for their courtesy what bloody difference did it make who looks at a skinned pig hanging from a butchers hook and says that pig would have died well you can see it on his face brave bugger well done who looks at the carcase and thinks of its going youll crawl geoffrey grovel on your knees because thats the way you are the bender and the compromiser have to be dont you because thats the way you do business and youre good at business geoffrey thats why international chemical holdings sent you here sent you to lie on your side with the hair growing on your face and the smell from your socks and pants and the hunger in your belly and the pain at your wrists and a kid coming to kill you crawl geoffrey play the lizard on his stomach scuffing through the deadwood thats the way of commerce know when you can fight and when you can lose and if its defeat then turn the cheek and summon the sweet words and save something for the shareholders bloody shareholders fat women in hampstead poodles and jewels apartments with lifts and deceased husbands for you you bitches for you im lying here listening to him coming there were the escape moments geoffrey in the car plenty of them each time you stopped god do we go through all that again its a big grownup world geoffrey nanny isnt here any more no one to save you but yourself why isnt little giancarlo messing his knickers why isnt he frightened that his time is coming because he believes in something idiot its a faith it has a meaning to him and geoffrey harrison has no creed who does geoffrey harrison fight for what principle where is his army of companions who will weep if one of their number falls another bloody casualty geoffrey and there will be a public sadness in head office and a few will scratch their heads and try and remember the chap who went abroad because it paid more but dont expect theres going to be any wet on the blottingpaper any stains on the ledgers any flags pulled down remember the bar at the olgiata golf club red faces and long gins men who were always right always knew certainty of opinion remember the bar of the gold club when aldo moro was cringing for the world to see and urging in letters to his friends for government weakness to preserve his life from the red brigades despicable behaviour the mans no dignity what youd expect from these people only have to go back to the war in north africa show em a bayonet and youve more prisoners on your hands than you can feed what a wonderful wallowing security membership of the golf club theyll make hay of you geoffrey the man who came back for nine holes after hed been on his knees with the tears on his cheeks and the sobbing in his throat and pleaded and held the legs of a boy half his age got to fight em show em theres going to be no nonsense thats the way to beat the scum giancarlo was very close and his voice pierced the darkness they want you dead arrison harrison wriggled and dragged at the wires tried to turn to face the boy managed a few inches what do you mean they do nothing to save you what did they say they tried only to use up time so that they could trace the call what did franca say the questions from harrison blurted at the centre of the shadow above him franca told me to kill you she said they would not release her she told me to kill you a whisper from harrison the breached corn sack from which the essence is lost franca said that its a bloody dream geoffrey theres no reality here its fantasy im not your enemy giancarlo ive done nothing to hurt you and where was the bastards face moulded in the blackness how could you creep before a boy with no face how did you win him with your fear and your misery ive never tried to harm you franca said i was to kill you for christs sake giancarlo im no enemy of the italian proletariat im not in the way of your revolution you are a symbol of oppression and exploitation its like youre reading out of the telephone book they dont mean anything those words you cant take a life for a slogan the same dripping voice the same cruelty in the unseen eyes there can be no revolution without blood not just your blood arrison we die in the streets for what we believe is a just struggle we face the living death in the concentration camps of the regime twenty years she will exist in messina dont talk to me about other people the dream clearing the nightmare fading it helps you not at all if you kill me you must see that giancarlo please say you can see t h a t you are pathetic arrison you are of the middle class you are of the multinational you have a flat on a h i l l should you not defend that way should you not defend that exploitation i despise you the silence fell fast because the killing words of the boy struck far harrison abandoned his efforts lay still and heard the sounds of giancarlo dropping to sit on the ground a dozen feet from the bunker man and boy they drifted to their own thoughts crawl to him geoffrey its not the golf clubs life forget the humiliation screw the dignity lapse that he couldnt grovel what a thing for a man to die over shrill little words and a voice he did not recognize as his own what do i have to do giancarlo what do i have to do for you not to kill me the judas moment geoffrey the betrayal of his society the boy had read him that he belonged nowhere was a part of nothing answer me please endlessly the boy waited the wave rolled back from the beach then gathered itself in whitecrested accumulation burst again shattering with force on the sand the reply of giancarlo you cannot do anything afterwards i will say what you have told me to say franca has ordered it you cannot do anything i will go to the newspapers and the radio and the television i will say what you want me to the boy seemed bored as if wishing the conversation terminated could the man not understand what he was told you chose a way for your life i have chosen mine i will fight against what is rotten you will prop it i do not recognize the white flag that is not the way of our combat harrison was crying convulsing the great tears welling in his eyes dribbling on his cheeks wetting his mouth you take a pleasure in i t there was a sternness in the boy we are at war and you should behave like a soldier because you do not i despise you it will be at nine oclock in the morning you have till then to become a soldier you horrid repulsive little bastard theyll give you no mercy youll die in the fucking gutter we ask for no mercy arrison we offer none quiet again in the forest giancarlo spread himself on the leaves he pushed with his hands to make the surface more even wriggled on to his side so that his back was turned on geoffrey harrison and beneath a ceiling of moonlight flecked by the high branches settled himself for a few minutes he would hear the foreign sounds of his prisoners choking sobs then he found sleep and they were lost to him the sun of the day and the food of the evening ensured the farmers sleep and the comatose rest was escape from the worries that burdened his life the price of fodder the price of fertilizer the price of diesel oil for the tractor could be shut out only when his mind was at peace his child stayed silent close to the rise and fall of his fathers chest and waited with a concentrated patience fighting off his own tiredness beyond the doorway the child heard the sounds of his mothers movements and they encouraged his stillness as he lay fearful that any stirring on the damaged springs of the sofa would alert and remind her that he was not yet in his small narrow bed mingled with the music were the mind pictures that the child drew for himself pictures that were alien and hostile come on in archie thank you michael didnt slip off the tongue that easily not the christian name bit not after the hard words charlesworth stood in the doorway with a loose shirt on him no tie and slacks and sandals carpenter fidgeted at the door in his suit come on into the den carpenter was led through the hall delicate furniture a case of hardback books oil paintings on the wall a vase of tall irises do all right these p e o p l e stop the bitching archie drop the chip off your shoulder you cant blame people for not living in motspur park not if theyve the choice darling this is archie carpenter from harrisons head office my wife caroline carpenter shook hands with the tall tanned girl presented to him the sort they bred down in cheltenham along with foxhunters and barley fields she wore a straight dress held at the shoulders by vague straps the wife back in the semi would have had a fit blushed like an august rose no bra and entertaining im sorry im late mrs charlesworth ive been at the questura you poor thing youd like a wash well he wouldnt have asked for it himself but hed worn a jacket all day and the same socks and he stank like a hung duck ill take him darling an older man was rising heavily from a sofa washing could wait introductions first charlesworth resumed the formalities this is colonel henderson our military attach pleased to meet you colonel they call me buster archie ive heard about you i hear youve a straight tongue in your head and a damned good thing too carpenter was led to the peace of an outer bathroom time for him as he stood in front of the pan to examine the sentry row of deodorant sprays on the windowsill enough to keep the embassy smelling sweet for a month and books too who was going to read classical greek history and contemporary american politics while having a quick squat extraordinary people the reek of public school and private means he washed his hands let the days grime dribble away pushed a flannel round the back of his neck long live the creature comforts soap and water and a waiting gin they sat around in the lounge the four of them separated by rugs and marble flooring and sprouting coffee tables carpenter didnt resist the demand that he shed his jacket loosen his tie well tell us archie whats the scene at the questura charlesworth setting the ball rolling i think theyve screwed i t for that poor mr harrison carpenter ignored caroline charlesworth what did they want a coffeemorning chat with the neighbours or something from the bloody horses mouth tantardini got her hands on the telephone too early in the game for the trace people told her boy to chop harrison then pulled the connection the call was still at switchboard but the boy had the message he rang off and thats about it charlesworth was leaning forward in his seat glass held between his hands the honest earnest young man he seemed to carpenter she gave a specific instruction for the boy to kill harrison thats the way carboni put it i have failed your man those were his words biggest bloody understatement of the day hes a good man giuseppe carboni charlesworth spoke with enough compassion for carpenter momentarily to squirm its not easy not in a country like this right buster the colonel swirled his whisky round the glass we had full powers in many places what youd call nowadays totalitarian powers in palestine and malaya and kenya and cyprus here the legacy of prewar fascism is that the security forces are kept weak but for all we had it didnt do us a great deal of good but that was far from the great mother britain carpenter interjected impatiently this is different its on their own doorstep that theyre being whipped carboni excepted theyre ambling about like bloody zombies theyre trying archie charlesworth intervened gently i wouldnt care to make a judgement on their efficiency if id been here just a few hours the colonel cut at the air the swinging of the old cavalry sabre carpenter put his hands above his head grinned for a moment dissolved the temper im outnumbered outflanked whatever so what i want to know is this when they say theyll chop him when battestini says it do we take that at face is it gospel caroline charlesworth started from her chair the plea to be excused from the blunt assessments t h e dinner wont be more than a few minutes you answer that buster charlesworth said its the pertinent question of the evening the hard clean eyes of the veteran fixed on carpenter t h e answer is affirmative when they say theyll kill theyre as good as their word black tie job i repeat mr carpenter theyre as good as their word caroline charlesworth appeared from the kitchen doorway the food was ready she led the men followed in the diningroom carpenter saw the wine on the table the port and brandy on the sideboard there was solace to be found here escape from a hideous and crippling mess late into the evening the childs mother came at last for him with a sweep of her hand she hushed his protest and swept him up so that he sat on her hip as she took him from the side of his father it was done quickly and expertly and the farmer seemed as unaware of the childs going as he had been of his presence she nuzzled her nose against her sons neck saw the fight that he made to keep his eyes open and chided herself that she had left him for so long she carried him to his room mama yes my sweet she lowered him into the bed mama if papa wakes soon will he come to see me you will be asleep in the morning you will see him she pulled the coarse sheet to his chin i have to tell him what i saw what was it a wild pig the big dog f o x she watched the yawn break on the childs face mama i saw her kiss stifled his words and she tiptoed from the room it was the work of the agente to check finally the cell doors after the prisoners held in maximum security had finished communal recreation and were consigned for the night to their individual cells his practice was to take a quick glance through the spyhole and then slide the greased bolt others would come after him when the lights were dimmed to make the last muster call of the night the agente had found the paper folded once on the mat at the front door of his house a small piece ragged at an edge where it had been torn from a notepad there was a pencilwritten number on the outside flap that was immediately relevant to the agente three digits the number of the cell of the chief of staff of the nappisti when he reached that door the agente pushed it a few inches tossed the paper inside crashed the bolt home and was on his way any colleague who might have seen him would not have been aware of the passing of the message the capo abandoned his weekly letter to his mother in the hill city of siena saw the paper and slipped from his chair to gather it uamministrazione dice non per tantardini no freedom for tantardini it was as he had said what he had anticipated because the englishman was of insufficient importance inevitable but better that way better if the ultimatum were to expire the gun were to be fired the strategy of tension they called it in the roman newspapers the creation of intolerable fear the death of the enemy created fear something not achieved by negotiation and the making of deals better if the englishman were killed but who was the boy battestini why had he not heard of a youth who could implement so much the radio in his cell had told him the police held the opinion that the boy worked alone remarkable outstanding and the commentator called him the lover of franca tantardini and expounded that this was the reason for the boys action who in the movement had not been the lover of franca tantardini how many of the nappisti in this same cell block had not taken comfort from hours spent strangled by the arms and legs of tantardini taken pleasure from the flesh and fingers of the woman his table lamp lit a mirthless smile perhaps it was the boys first time and he believed he had made a conquest if it was the first time the boy would climb a mountain for that woman perhaps hed die for tantardini certainly he would kill for her when the ultimatum was met he would issue a communique in his own name from inside the walls of asinara courage my child we love you we are with you but why had he not been told of this boy like sharks homing for offal the mosquitoes slipped through the opened window of the farmhouse parlour and turned their incisive attention to the arms and neck of the resting man instinctively he slapped the side of his face in irritation and in his growing consciousness there was the drone of their wings the rising surge of their attacks he started up blinked in the flickering light of the television and heard the sounds of the kitchen through the closed door water running the quiet clatter of dishes and tins he scratched savagely at the bitten skin where the bite mark had grown enough for him to gouge a sharp trickle of blood he rubbed the back of his hand into his eyes then headed for the kitchen time for him to be going to his bed time for him to encourage her to follow his wife put her finger across her mouth the call for quiet and pointed to the halfopen door that led to their sons room a tall broadshouldered woman redfaced dark hair pulled back in an elastic band thick bare arms and a faded apron she had been his woman since he was seventeen and had shyly courted her with the encouragement of her parents who knew of the farm he would inherit the little one is sleeping she worked at the final flurry of the days sink work its taken him long enough but hes nearly there did he tell you where hed been she slopped warm water from a kettle into the bright plastic sink bowl in the woods where else what kept him there he was tired yearning for his bed and there was much hay to be moved by trailer in the morning perfunctory conversation made only because she was not ready to follow him to their cumbersome heavy oak wedding bed he saw something he said what did he see i dont know something he wanted to tell you about it i said it would keep till morning perhaps it was a pig t not this far down the hillside he said softly she sluiced the pan in which she had made the sauce for the pasta you have much more to do he asked i have to wash some socks through then it is finished she smiled at him kind and darkeyed ill say good night to the boy the frown crossed her face dont wake him not now hes dead to the world dont wake him now ill see his bedclothes arent on the floor when he had gone she could muse as she doused the socks in water that her man loved his child as the most precious thing in his life god be thanked she thought that if we were to have but one child it should have been a boy someone for him to work for someone for him to dream would one day take over the running of the farm she worked quickly the soap lathering in a sea of bubbles among the wool some whole and some darned shirts she would do in the morning after the chickens had been fed mama she turned abruptly in response to the strained voice of her man he stood at the kitchen door his face dazed and in shock his hand resting loosely on the shoulder of his son youve woken him the petulance rose in her voice you never asked him what he had seen the farmer spoke hoarsely a fox a rabbit perhaps a heron what difference does it make what difference at his age she bridled before her senses responded to the mood her man set what did he see he found a red car hidden in the bushes beside the small field and the wood he has a toy a toy car that your mother gave him last easter the one he plays in his bed with he said to me that the toy was the same as the car that he had found his toy is a red fiat uno vente sette they showed a car on the television the car for the foreigner who was kidnapped fiat uno vente sette and red a red there would be half a million her hands were drawn from the water wiped nervously at her apron there should be no involvement not with something hostile he found a man who was tied t h e boy dreams it is a world of his own he saw a youth come with a gun she stammered its not our business dress him her eyes wide her lips moving in fear she attacked in defence of her child you cannot take him there not in the darkness not if you believe that he has seen these things get his clothes and dress him it was an instruction a command she did not resist and scurried to the childs room for his day clothes from the hallway the farmer took a thick sweater and the smallbore shotgun that he used for pigeon and rabbit when he went with his neighbours to shoot on a sunday morning from a nail high in the back door to the yard he unhooked a rubbercoated torch together they dressed their son you remember mama what father alberti said at the mass after moro he said these people were the antichrist even paolo sesto they rejected even the appeal by him that moro should be spared they are the enemies of the church these people they are the enemies of all of us you remember what father alberti said on the television it was said they would kill the foreigner tomorrow morning we have to go mama we have to know what the boy has seen they slipped the childs shirt and coat and trousers over his pyjamas drew on his boots over his bare feet the mothers hands fumbled and were slower than her mans be careful papa be careful with him the father and his son walked out of the door and into the night she followed the passage of the torch before the bend in the lane obscured its light and then she sat at the kitchen table very still very quiet the wine had gone and the port after it and caroline charlesworth had fled the scene for her bed the three men sat around the table and the ash and cigarette ends made their molehills in the coffee saucers theyd been over all the ground all the old and trampled paths the issues of principle and pragmatism were digested and spat back the debate on negotiation had been fought with anger and spite and then the brandy had taken its toll and soaked and destroyed the attack of carpenter and the defence of charlesworth and the attache they were resting now and the talk was sporadic geoffrey harrison was no longer the principal subject replaced by the rate of income tax church aid to the patriotic front of rhodesia decadence on the streets of london the familiar fodder for britons abroad michael charlesworth stood up from the table murmured something about checking with the embassy and moved unhappily away from the safety of the chairs hes a damn good man carpenter had problems with the words damn good growled buster henderson youre right you know a damned good man ive given him some stick since ive been here wouldnt give a hoot knows youve a job to be getting on with a damn good man ive never felt so bloody useless not in anything before i once did a stint at g ops shut up in a bloody office out in aden we had a couple of brigades in the radfan tribesmanbashing damn good shots they were gave our chaps a hell of a run for their money i couldnt get clear of my desk and mbrotherinlaw was up there with a battalion used to rub it in with his signals wicked devil used to get me damned cross just talking and not doing i know how you feel carpenter the weathered hand reached again for the bottleneck neither man looked up as michael charlesworth came back into the room he paused and watched henderson refilling the glasses slopping brandy on the polished wood surface youll be needing that buster ive just heard something a w f u l his voice attracted mothlike the eyes of his guests its harrisons wife violet harrison shes just hit a lorry on the raccordo shes dead ran slap into a lorry killed outright headon collision the bottle base crashed down on to the table and trembled there together with the hand that held it carpenters fist shot out for his glass and dashed a saucer sideways spewing ash on the white crocheted mats not bloody fair the colonel spoke into the hand that masked his face i made them repeat it twice i couldnt believe it charlesworth was still standing carpenter swayed to his feet could you get me a taxi michael ill wait for it downstairs he didnt look back headed for the front door no farewells no thanks for hospitality going getting out and running he didnt call the lift kept to the stairs hand on the support rail the fresh air freezing the alcohol god archie youve screwed it now throwing the shit at everyone else but not yourself laying down the law on how everyone else should behave ran out on the poor bitch archie hid behind the prim chintz curtain and clucked your tongue and disapproved bloody little pharisee with as much charity as a weasel up a rabbit burrow preaching all day about getting geoffrey harrison back to his family but he hadnt shut the door and seen there was a family for the bastard to come home to what had carboni said ive failed your man join the club giuseppe meet the other founder member he fell into the back of the taxi gave the name of his hotel and blew his nose noisily the dog fox crept close to the two sleeping men with a front paw it scratched the p a little further from giancarlo and its nose worked with interest at the barrel and the handle before fascination was lost four times the fox went over the ground between giancarlo and the pit as if unwilling to believe there was no food remnant to be rifled disappointed the animal moved on its way along the path that led to the fields and hedgerows where mice and rabbits and chickens and cats could be found abruptly the fox stopped ears straight nostrils dilating the noise that it heard was faint and distant would not be felt by the men who slept but for a creature of stealth and secrecy it was adequate warning a dark shadow flitting comfortably on the path the fox retraced its steps the farmer had laid the shotgun on the ground and knelt at the front of the car the torch was in the boys hands and the farmer cupped his hands around it to minimize the flare of the light as he studied and memorized the number plate not that it was necessary after he had seen the prefix letters before the five numbers rc and the television had said that the car had been stolen from reggio calabria cunningly hidden too a good place well shielded by the bank and the bushes and the trees he rose to his feet trying to control his breathing feeling his heart battering at his chest he switched off the torch in the boys hand and retrieved his gun better with that in his hands as the wood threw out its death hush the farmer reached for his sons hand gripping it tightly as if to provide protection from a great and imminent evil t w o men were in the wood he sensed the nodded response where was the path to their place the boy pointed across the cars bonnet into the black void of the trees by touch the farmer collected with his fingers three short fallen branches and made an arrow of them that followed his sons arm he put his hand on the boys shoulder and they hurried together from the place back across the fields back to the safety of their home chapter nineteen giuseppe carboni was dozingat his desk head pillowed lopsided on his folded arms dottore the shout of excitement and pounding feet boomed in the outer corridor carboni flicked his head up the attention of the owl his eyes large in expectation the subordinate surged through the open door and there was a gleam and an excitement on his face we have the car d o t t o r e stuttered out because the thrill was great chairs were heaved back files discarded telephones dropped men hurrying in the wake of the messenger gathered at carbonis desk where carboni snapped the sleep shed fast on the hill below bracciano between the town and the lake excellent carboni sighed as if the burden of atlas were shifted better than excellent dottore a farmer found the car his son a small boy took him to the place and he thinks the boy watched battestini and harrison in the wood in the d a y excellent excellent carboni gulped at the foetid air of the room which had taken on a new freshness a new quality he felt a weakness in his hands a trembling at his fingers where is vellosi at the communications centre he said he would not return to the viminale tonight get him the room had been darkened and now carboni moved to the door and rammed down the wall switch the response was blinding light in the room all bulbs on the chandelier illuminated sweeping away the shadows and depressions t h e liaison officers of carabinieri and sisde get them here too within ten minutes back at his desk moving with uncommon speed he pulled from a drawer a largescale map of the lazio region his aides pencil raked to the green plot of woodland dividing the builtup grey shades of the town of bracciano from the blue tint of the lago di bracciano carboni without ceremony relieved him of the pencil and scratched the crosses on the yellow road ribbons for the perimeter that he would throw around the boy and his prisoner seal the road to trevignano the road to anguillara the road to la storta the road to castel giuliano to cerveteri to sasso to manziano seal them tight block all movement has the farmer alerted them at a l l is there that risk he was asked that dottore he says not he went with his son to the car identified it and then returned home he left the child there and then he walked to the home of a neighbour who has a telephone he was careful to walk because he feared the noise of a car would startle the people in the wood though his farm is at least a kilometre away from the house of his neighbour he telephoned the carabinieri in bracciano the carabinieri they will not blunder carboni exploded as if success was so fragile could be snatched from him be calm dottore the carabinieri have not moved the aide was anxious to pacify you have them carboni the direct shout vellosi striding into the office hands clapping together in anticipation more followed a carabinieri colonel in pressed biscuitbrown uniform the man from the secret service in grey suit with sweat stains at the armpit another in shirtsleeves who was the representative of the examining magistrate is it confirmed the s i g h t i n g what has already been d o n e where do you have them the voices droned around his desk a gabble of contradiction and request shut up carboni shouted his voice carried over them and silenced the press around his desk he had only to say it once and had never been known to raise his voice before to equals and superiors he sketched in his knowledge and in a hushed and hasty tone outlined the locations he required for the block forces the positioning of the inner cordon and his demand that there should be no advance into the trees without his personal sanction t h e men best trained to comb the woods are mine vellosi said decisively a boast but not backed by fact the carabinieri are the men for an assault a defiant response from the carabinieri officer my men have the skills for close quarters we can get five times as many into the area in half the time carboni looked around him disbelieving as if he had not seen it all before heard it many times in his years of police work his head shook in anger it is of course for you to decide giuseppe vellosi smiled confident but my men do not have the qualities of the carabinieri the colonel chipped in his retort gentlemen you shame us all we discredit ourselves there was that in carbonis voice that withered them and the men in the room looked away did not meet his gaze i want the help of all of you i am not administering prizes but seeking to save the life of geoffrey harrison and then the work began the division of labour the planning and tactics of approach there should be no helicopers no sirens a minimum of open radio traffic there should be concentrations before the men moved off on foot across the fields for the inner line advance from three directions one force congregating at trevignano and approaching from the northeast a second taking the southern lakeside road from anguillara a third from the town of bracciano to the west to sweep down the hillside it is as if you thought an army were bivouacked in the trees vellosi said quietly as the meeting broke it is a war i know little of carboni replied as he hitched his coat from the chair on to his wide shoulders they walked together to the door abandoning the room to confusion and shouted orders and ringing telephones activity again and welcome after the long night hours of idleness carboni hesitated and leaned back through the doorway the englishman who was here in the day i will take him with me call him at his hotel he hurried to catch vellosi he should have felt that at last the tide had turned the wind had slackened yet the doubt still gnawed at him how to approach by stealth through trees through undergrowth and the danger if they did not achieve surprise the thing could be plucked from him yet even at the last even at the closest time we can still lose everything carboni said to vellosi not everything we will have the boy and that is important it is the trophy for my wall they destroy us these bastards they make the calluses in our minds they coarsen our sensitivities until a good man a man of the quality of francesco vellosi believes only in vengeance and is blinded to the value of the life of an innocent when you were in church francesco last n i g h t i prayed that i myself with my own hand might have the chance to shoot the boy carboni held his arm they emerged together into the warm night air the convoy stood ready car doors open engines pulsing the damp of the earth rising through the leaf mattress crawled and nagged at the bones of giancarlo till he writhed in irritation and the refuge of sleep fell from him the hunger bit and the chill was deep at his body he groped across the ground for his pistol and his hand brushed against the metal of the barrel p i love you my p present to the little fox from franca sometimes when he awoke in a strange place and suddenly he needed moments to assimilate the atmosphere around him not at this awakening his mind was sharp in an instant he glanced at the luminous face of his watch close to three six hours to the time that franca ordered for the retribution on geoffrey harrison six hours more and then the sun would be high and the scorch patterns of the heat would have flung back the cold of darkness and the wood would be dying and thirsting for moisture there would have been two or three of them with aldo moro on this night two or three of them to share the desperate isolation of the executioner as he made ready his equipment two or three of them to pump home the bullets so that the blame was spread blame giancarlo blame is for the middle classes blame is for the guilty there is no blame for the work of the revolution for the struggle of the proletariat two or three of them to take him to the beach by the airport fence of fiumicino and they had had their escape route what escape route for giancarlo no planning no preparation no safe house no car switch no accomplice did franca think of that it is not important to the movement attack is the factor of importance not retreat they will hunt you giancarlo hunt you for your life the minds of their ablest men hunting you to eternity hunting you till you cannot run further the enemy has the machines that are invulnerable and perpetual that invoke a memory that cannot weary it was an order orders can never be bent to accommodate circumstance in the movement there has been great sacrifice and there is advantage in the killing of arrison not for your mind to evaluate a soldier does not question his order he acts he obeys the insects played at his face nipping and needling at his cheeks finding the cavities of his nostrils the softness of his ear lobes he swatted them away why should the bastard arrison sleep when he was about to die how could he a man with no belief beyond his own selfish survival how could he find sleep for the first time in many hours giancarlo summoned the image of his room in the fiat at seaside pescara bright on the walls of alitalia posters the hanging figure of the wooden christ the thinframed portrait from a colour magazine of paul vi the desk for his schoolbooks where he had worked in the afternoons after classes the wardrobe for his clothes where the white shirts for sundays hung ironed insidious and compelling a world that was lit and conventional and normal giancarlo onetime stereotype who sat beside his mother at meals and wanted in the evenings to be allowed to help his father at the shop a long time ago an age ago when giancarlo was on the production line held in the same precision mould as the other boys of the street arrison had been like that the ways had parted different signposts different destinations god and it was a lonely way terrifying and hostile your choice giancarlo he slapped his face again to rid himself of the insects and the dream collapsed gone were the savours of home replaced by a boy whose photograph was stuck with adhesive tape to the dashboards of a thousand police cars whose features would appear in a million newspapers whose name grew fear whose hand held a gun he would never see franca again he knew that and the thought ripped and wrenched at him never in his life again never again would he touch her hair and hold her fingers just a memory a recollection to be set beside the room in pescara giancarlo lay again on the ground and closed his eyes up the cassia northwards from the city headed the convoys the riot wagons of the primo celere the fiat lorries of the carabfnieri the blue and white and prettily painted cars of the polizia the unmarked vehicles of the special squads there were many who came in nightclothes to the balconies of the highrise flats and watched the stream of the participants and felt the thrill of the circus cavalcade more than a thousand men on the move all armed all tensed all drugged in the belief that at last they could assuage their frustration and beat and kick the irritant that plagued them at the village of la storta where the road narrowed and was choked the drivers hooted and blasphemed at the traffic police and demanded clearance of the chaos because all were anxious to be in bracciano when dawn came past la storta on the narrower via claudia with its sharp bends between the tree lines giuseppe carbonis car was locked into a column of lorries it was a quieter more sedate progress because now the sirens were forbidden the rotating lights were doused the horns unused archie carpenter shared the front seat with the driver vellosi and carboni were behind among the bulletproof waistcoats and the submachineguns taken as if by a careful virgin from the boot before the departure from the questura water dripped from carpenters hair on to the collar of his shirt and down the back of his jacket the remnant of his shower after the telephone had broken the total drinkinduced sleep that he had stumbled to now that he was awake the pain between his temples was huge a boring bastard shed called him a proper little bore violet harrison on archie carpenter well what was he supposed to do get her on to the mattress in the interests of ich take her on the livingroom c a r p e t not what it was about archie not cut and dried like that just needed someone to talk to someone to talk to wearing a dress like that hanging out like it was going out of fashion wrong archie a girl broken up and falling down who needed someone to share it with and you were out of your depth archie lost your lifebelt and splashing like an idiot you ran away you ran out on her and had a joke with charlesworth had your giggle you ran because they dont teach you about people under high stress in safe old motspur park all cosy and neat there in the mortgaged semis where nobody shouts because the neighbours will hear nobody has a bit on the side because the neighbours will know where nobody does anything but sit on their arses and wait for the day when theyre pushing up daisies and its too late and theyve gone silent fools and un remembered she needed help archie you galloped out of that flat as fast as your bloody legs would take you a proper little bore and no one had ever called him that before not to his face did you hear about harrisons wife mr carboni spoken offhand as if he wasnt concerned wasnt involved what about her she was killed in a car crash late last night where was she puzzlement rang through carbonis preoccupation with the procedures of the coming hours out on whats called the raccordo it is many kilometres from where she lives she was driving home she was alone carpenter spewing it out no one with her no friends with her so if we get the man out that is what we have to confront him with a light chilled laugh from vellosi incredible carboni when a mans cup is overfilled it is criminal that at this time a woman should be alone a distaste hung in carbonis words i suppose no one thought about it said carpenter dully at the junction to the lake road they saw the stationary rows of lorries and vans parked on the grass verge they passed queues of walking men in uniform the headlights glinted on the metal of firearms and there were glimpses of cordons forming in the fields the car winged on down the steep hillside before turning hard to the right along a weeded driveway with a military barrier and a concentration of elderly brick buildings awaiting them carpenter tried to loose the load of selfpity and stared about him as the car stopped the doors snapped open carboni was out quickly and mopped himself and turned to carpenter it used to be a flyingboat station long before the war with its lake frontage it is a place now just for dumping the conscripts they maintain a museum but nothing flies but we are close to the wood here and we have communications he took carpenters arm stay near to me now is the time for you to wish me well they were swept through the ill lit door of the administration block carpenter elbowing to keep contact with the bustling carboni and on into a briefing room hands out to greet carboni hugging and rubbed cheeks a clutch of bodies around him and carpenter relegated to a chair at the back while the policeman found sufficient yet reluctant silence to make a short address on his plan another surge of the men in suits and uniforms and battledress and carboni the emperor of the moment was speeding for the doorway they wont stop for you archie they wont hang about for that bloody englishman carpenter shoved and pushed winced as a beretta holster dug at his stomach and won his way to carbonis side in the wedge at the door carboni smiled at him looking up perspiring i have made a great decision the antiterrorist unit demanded the right to lead so did the carabinieri both thought they were best fitted i have satisfied everybody the carabinieri will come from the north vellosis men from the south i am an italian solomon i have sliced battestini in two carpenter stared coldly at him allow me one levity i have nothing else to laugh at at any moment battestini may kill your man he may already have done so we are going forward in the dark we are going to stumble in the dark through the wood youre not waiting for daylight to wait is to take too great a risk if you pray carpenter now is the moment they were out of the building muffled subdued orders men in the grey half light hitching over their heads the heavy protective clothing that would halt all rounds other than high velocity the cocking and arming of weapons ripples of laughter tramping feet away into the last remnants of the night should have a bloody stirrup cup archie and a red coat and a man to shout tally ho the group with carboni at its heart set off towards the road and walking beside him was a short firmbodied man who wore torn trousers and boots and a thick sweater and carried an old shotgun broken and crooked farmers style across his inner elbow from the hard bare mattress of her cell bed franca tantardini heard the softsoled footsteps in the outside corridor a bolt was drawn back a key inserted and turned and the man who had been her interrogator let himself in he smiled at the woman as she lay with her head propped on her clasped hands with the golden hair spilling on the one pillow i have some news for you franca something that you would wish to know her eyes lit at first then dulled as if her interest betrayed her before the discipline triumphed i should not be telling you franca but i thought that you would wish to hear of our success involuntarily she half rose on the bed her hands forsaking her neck propping her up now we know where he is your little fox franca we know where he hides in what wood close to which village they are surrounding the place now at first light they will move in on your little fox the light from the single bulb behind its casing of closemesh wire bit down at the age lines of her face the muscles at her mouth flickered hell kill the pig first the interrogator laughed softly if he has the courage when the guns are around him hell kill him because franca told him to because franca from the safety of her cell ordered it his pants will be wetted his hand shaking guns round him aimed on him and he is dead if he does what his franca has told him he will do as he was ordered you are certain you can make a soldier from a bedwetter that was what you called him franca get out she spat her hatred the interrogator smiled again let the dream be of the failure franca good night and when you are alone think of the boy and think of how you have destroyed him she reached down beside her bed for the canvas shoes snatched at one and hurled it at the man in the open doorway wide and high and bouncing back from the wall he chuckled to her and grinned she heard the key in place the bolt thrust across the noise of giancarlo twisting from his side to his back was the agent that roused geoffrey harrison from sleep as soon as he woke the bite of the wire at his wrists and ankles was sharp the first instinctive stretch of his limbs tautened the flex dug the knots into the underflesh of his wrists and ankles a man who awakens in hell who has purchased a great vengeance nothing but the bloody pain first sensation first thought first recollection god the morning that i die the mental process that became a physical happening and his body cowed to a foetal position of fear no protection nothing to hide behind nothing to squirm to the morning that i die he felt the tremble and the shudder take him and the awareness was overwhelming god the morning that i die the first precious beginnings of the day were seeping into the wood not the sunlight but its outriders in the grey pastel that permitted him to detect the lines of the nearest treetrunks this morning with the birds singing at nine oclock another shape suffused and vague and hard to alert himself to as giancarlo rose and stood above him and looked down giancarlo called by harrisons movements and inspecting the fatted goose of the feast what time is it giancarlo he could hear the watch ticking on his wrist could not see it a little past four the little bastard had learned the role of gaoler thought harrison had taken on the courtesy of the death cell attendant the hushed tone and dont you worry lad it doesnt hurt and its quick the warm eyes of sympathy well that never helped a poor lad who was going to swing at nine what do you know about that geoffrey i read it that was other people geoffrey and half the fucking population saying and a damn good thing too thats for a criminal no sympathy and deserves all hes getting thats for men whove shot policemen and raped kids thats not for bloody geoffrey harrison did you sleep only a little giancarlo spoke simply it was very cold on the ground i slept very well i didnt dream giancarlo peered down at him the definition of his face growing with the slow coming light t h a t is good are you going to get some food he could have kicked himself when hed said it could have spat on himself i am not going for any f o o d not n o w later later i will eat cheaper to feed one more economic to sustain the single person family silly man geoffrey should have your calculator there the one beside the desk in the office the one you use for all the arithmetic of ich then youd know the boy would be only shopping for one and how many lire he would save that way only for one because there will only be one mouth not on the bloody bread list geoffrey because youll be past food past caring about the ache in your guts geoffrey harrisons voice rose in crescendo down the paths of the wood high with the branches fluttered the thrushes and blackbirds dont hurt me giancarlo please please dont hurt me he was answered far back from the shadows among the trees distant and beyond sight by the rampage of a dogs bark and in the wake of the bark was the drumming of running feet and the crash of branches swept aside an avalanche circling and nearing giancarlo had crouched bent double at the sound of the dog at the noise of the approach of men he surged towards harrison pulled him to the limit of the wire and flung himself into the gap between his prisoner and the earth roof where the roots had taken the ground high out of the pit he panted for breath wriggled to get lower held the gun at the lower hairs of harrisons head if you shout now you are dead the gun squirming against his neck harrison played his part the one he was familiar with run you little fool run now he could sense the boys shock of terror imparted through their clothes body to body flesh warmth through the quivering and pulsing of the blood veins he didnt know why he called only that this is what he would have done this was his way avoid contact avoid impact stall the moment the lifestyle of geoffrey harrison if you go now you have a chance he felt the boy drive deeper into the pit and then the voice small and reeded i need you arrison now you have to go now father and mother didnt the little bugger understand time for running time for ducking time for weaving if i go now they will kill me what was he supposed to do feel sorry for the little pig wipe his bottom for him clean his pants out we stay together arrison that is what franca would have done the man and the boy ears up lying in the shallow hole and listening around them unseen among the trees an army advanced clumsy and intimidating in its approach breaking aside the wood that impeded its progress closing on them sealing them the net tightening fractured and splintered branches in front and behind them stamped leaves and curses of discomfort to right and left and the baying of dogs harrison turned his body from his side a ponderous movement then twisted his neck further until he could see the face of the boy it is too late giancarlo he spoke with a kind of wonderment astonished because the table was turned and the fear exchanged you had to go when i said shut up the boy spat back at him but there was a shiver in his voice and then more slowly as if the control were won with great effort that is not our way carboni with his pistol drawn vellosi trailing in one hand a submachinegun carpenter keeping with them all were running in their own fashion down the narrow path spurred on by the shouts of the advance and the roars fierce and aggressive full and deepthroated of the police attack dogs they sprinted on the shadowed surface buried in the surrealism of the dawn mist that ebbed between the tree towers carpenter saw the shape of the polizia vice brigadiere materialize from the foliage at the pathside rising to block carboni and vellosi the stampede stopped men crouched about them and struggled to control the heaving of their lungs that they might be quieter the trees were infested the undergrowth alive static from the portable radios whispered voices distorted replies a council of war grown and elderly men on their knees huddled to hear the weapons in their hands carpenter come close carboni called his voice blanketshrouded the dogs heard voices and barked they are about a hundred metres from us we are all around them but i do not wish to move further till there is light we wait here for the sun battestini will he pack it in will he give himself up the big sad eyes rolled at carpenter the shoulders heaved their gesture we have to try if the spell of tantardini is still on h i m left unsaid because carpenter mouthed his obscenity and understood but he can kill him now while we are here we wait for the sun carboni turned away resumed the hush of conference this was where it all ended in a damp wood with mud on your shoes and dirt on the knees of your trousers right archie where the family picnickers might have been or boys with tents or a kid with his condom and his girl only the method and the style to be decided to be determined only whether it was champagne or a mahogany box youre within rockthrowing distance of him archie you could stand up and shout and hed hear you a few seconds running youre that close god the bastard cant shoot him now not now not after all this not after violet the dawn came steadily imperceptibly winnowing behind the trees and across the leaves cloaking the men who peered forward and fingered the mechanisms of their firearms drawnout lethargic mocking their impatience the light filtered into the wood chapter twenty horizontal and thrusting with its brilliance the dart of a lance the first sunray pierced the wall of trees the shaft picked at the ground in front of the fallen trunk faded in the eddy of the branches then returned the sharpness held sway over the grey shadowed light it was the moment of ultimate decision for giancarlo battes tini move now or be damned and finished vulnerable to the snipers aim naked to the gas and nausea cartridges open to the bonesplintering bullets of the marksmen his hands furtive he reached for the flex at geoffrey harrisons ankles swore at the skill of his own knot and with difficulty loosened it by the collar of the shirt he pulled his prisoner close to him and back down into the pit so that the wire tied to the wrists and the roots would have more play that was easier to unfasten the work of a few seconds what are we doing giancarlo a grim set smile we go on another journey arrison where are we going busy with his work scraping together the strands of wire giancarlo muttered you will know the boy bound together the length of wire that he had used on harrisons legs to the piece now trailing from his wrists kneel upright harrison stretched himself to the extent of the pit wriggled and turned his ankles to restore the circulation and slowly raised his head above the rim he lifted his shoulders tautened his spine and grimaced at the stiffness carried by his trapped nights sleep giancarlo looped the wire around the front of his chest then snuggled it behind his own back drew it beneath his armpits and then again to harrisons wrists pressed hard against his man the boy entwined the knot that closed them together linked them as one with a hand he pulled harrisons shirt from the waist of his trousers and the metal pistol barrel was formidable against the skin in the small of harrisons back the front gunsight carved a scratch line in the flesh as giancarlo armed the weapon it is a light trigger arrison when we start you should not talk you should not slip my finger will barely have to move you understand harrison nodded the questions stifled in his throat choked on his tongue no more compulsion to ask questions just a new horror and what use explanation just a new abyss and he was plunging we stand up and carefully they straightened as one the vibrations mingled and giancarlo pressed his head against harrisons collarbone but your legs dont work geoffrey been tied too long youll slip youll bloody s t u m b l e and then the bloody trigger goes how far does the finger move how far quarter of an inch eighth of an inch concentrate you bloody fool one leg forward put it down slowly ease the weight on to it stop put the other foot forward test the balance stop again put the next foot f o r w a r d harrison looked around him blinked in the air drank in its freshness felt the erosion of giancarlos stale breath it was a certain sort of freedom a certain sort of release breathing something other than the odour of the earth nothing moved at the front but there would be an army there concealed close and waiting the voice bellowed behind his ear is carboni there ahead of them was the path that they had walked down the previous morning long ago separated by infinite time the route that giancarlo had used to get his food and to drift away down when he went to the telephone in the darkness and it was the way the child had come the stream of the sun caught the three men square as thev came forward on the path they wore their badges of nationality their flags for recognition a short rolling man at the front balding sallow one behind him who held a submachinegun diagonally across his waist hair combed the trace of a clipped moustache at his upper lip his tie sombre and silk the last was a stranger clothes of a different cut hair of a different trim rounded shoulders and a pallor denied the mediterranean two italians and an englishman harrison felt the weakness at his knees the shake at his thighs and shins that was irresistible the bastards had come long enough about it harrison and giancarlo were fused as one responsive to each others tremors pliant to each others movements three men facing them i am carboni the words echoed in the trees bounced from the mosscoated trunks harrison felt the boy stiffen readying himself the last great battle striving for strength and steel stamina listen carboni this is your arrison this is your foreign dirt i have tied him to me and against his back behind his heart i have the p it is a hairtrigger carboni tell your criminals tell your gunmen that if they shoot my finger will move on the trigger you are listening carboni if you hit me arrison is dead i am going to walk down the path i am going to walk to my car if you want arrison alive you do not impede me harrison was aware that the pressure of the circled barrel grew in his back the impetus growing for movement i am going to move forward if you want arrison stay back what does he say carboni did not turn towards carpenter and his sharp anxiety he gazed on down the path at harrison and giancarlo the boy has the gun at harrisons back he says it is hairtriggered he wants to drive away from here vellosi in english because that was the language of the moment giuseppe he doesnt walk out of here t h e n harrison dies t h e boy cannot leave here the spitting whisper of the cobra i am here to save harrison confusion catastrophe ravaging at carboni if battestini walks out of here if he leaves the wood he has ridiculed us one boy and he has beaten u s i have to save harrison carboni wavering torn and pulled and tossed we have to save i t a l y think carboni of the implications if the boy walks clear one against so many and he wins because we have no courage violet harrison dead and mangled on her back in a plastic sack on the morgue slab incised for autopsy viewed by pathologists and geoffrey harrison to lie beside her with a pencil hole in his back and a cavity large enough to fit a lemon into at his chest get off your arse archie carpenter get into the big boys league its your man out there archie so get off your bloody arse and get walking a short jab of his elbow and archie carpenter was past carboni and vellosi three quick strides and he was clear of them and who was going to run forward to pull him back watch the boy carboni watch the boy and be ready giancarlo watched him come saw the purposeful clean steps eat into the dividing distance nothing to be read from the face of the man nothing that spoke of danger and risk nothing from which to recognize his emotions the command to halt the shout was beyond the boy fascinated spellbound and the light caught at the mans face as he passed between two trees and there was no shop window of fear a man with a job to do and getting it over with and wearing a crumpled suit giancarlo felt his hand on the pistol butt cavort with the weapon he could not hold it still and motionless francesco vellosi spun on his heel raking the trees and bushes behind him till he saw the carabinieri sergeant with the rifle kneeling and in cover his fingers snapped for the mans attention and he tossed the submachinegun towards him gestured for the rifle and caught it as it was thrown to him the rifle slipped to his shoulder rock steady unwavering and the needle of the front sight rested centrally in the v of the rear attachment by his right eye the line was on the small part of giancarlo battestinis head that was visible to him the void cut the gap halved archie carpenter spoke almost surprised to hear his own voice brisk and full of business geoffrey harrison im archie carpenter does this battestini speak english no preamble dominate from the start the way they taught them far back the metropolitan police drill on approaching an armed man he saw the half head on harrisons shoulder an unfinished ventriloquists dummy dumped on a perch lacking a body harrisons lips moved and then his tongue brushed against them the moisture glistening poor blighters at the limit he does still moving still hacking and cutting at the intervening space carpenter called giancarlo your name right ive come for the gun edging his way forward slower steps as the distance telescoped and the spots and the beard growth on giancarlos face were sharp and visible and the colour at his eyes was dark and haunted ten yards short and the scream from the boy stop no closer just the gun giancarlo just give it to me but carpenter obeyed and now stood his ground fair and square across the path saw the sweat on the boys forehead and the tangled skeins of his hair and the yellowed teeth you move aside you give us r o o m im not moving im here and i want the gun from you where did you get it from archie which silk hat out of the hallway of a flat out of the staircase of a high building out of a woman past her breakpoint ran once not again once was enough to turn the shoulder not ever again if you do not move i s h o o t empty threat i dont move you dont shoot whod know you archie the girls in the office in the typists pool the men in the pub off the evening train from the city the neighbour who borrowed the pushmower alternate saturday mornings whod know archie carpenter in a wood at bracciano i have the gun at his b a c k i dont care where youve put the bloody thing i dont move you dont shoot its easy a tenyearold knows that stretching the boy out into the risk area out into the storm watch the eyes archie watch the blinking and the uncertainty and the fidgefe traversing and hesitant and the fears building the bully when hes outnumbered when the other kids come back to the playground careful archie gone past that place off mums knee playing it the grownup way you do not believe that i will s h o o t right giancarlo i dont believe it i tell you why youre thinking what happens if you do ill help you ill tell you i strangle you boy with my hands i strangle you theres a hundred men out there behind me that want to do it they wont get near you youll be done by the time they reach you carpenter held him unswervingly never left the eyes of the boy always there when he turned back always present lowering over him heavy as a snowcloud absorbing the hatred ive no gun but if you fire on harrison im on you youve trussed yourself silly boy thats why ill get you i used to be a policeman ive seen people that have been strangled their eyes come half out of their head they shit themselves they wet their legs thats for you so give me the gun you never saw anyone strangled in your bloody life not ever steady it archie turn it over could be possible that the physical isnt the soft belly of the boy dont make him play the martyr dont put coal on that fire what else gets to a psychopath im going to start walking you cannot take him from m e giancarlo holding his defensive line the rout not accomplished get out of our way harrison gazing at carpenter like he doesnt know whats happening like hes out on his feet best bloody way whos going to tell geoffrey harrison whos that one down to archie carpenter going to do it well done geoffrey were very pleased youve come out of this s a f e l y excellent s h o w but theres been a bit of bother while youve been a w a y well the missus a c t u a l l y but you understand that geoffrey good lad thought you would throw in the big one archie go for broke all the chips on the green cloth into the centre of the table i saw your woman last night giancarlo raddled old bitch bit old for a boy wasnt she he saw the shortworn composure break on the boys face saw the anger lines form and then knit on his forehead i wouldnt have thought a boy would be interested in a workhorse like that the blood was running fast to the boys cheeks the flush dispersing under his skin the eyes slitted in loathing do you know what she called you when they interrogated her you want to know a little bedwetter franca tantardinis opinion on lover boy get out of my way the words came fast and weighted by the boys fury carpenter could see the nausea rising in geoffrey harrisons face the eroded selfcontrol wouldnt last much longer wouldnt sustain the supreme effort batter on archie belt the little bastard the sound of the voices carried easily among the trees carboni had eased his pistol from the jacket pocket and it hung from his fingers as a token of participation beside him francesco vellosi still stood eye at the gunsight tight in anticipation ignoring the fly that played at his nose why does he say these things vellosi never wavered from his aim quiet giuseppe quiet how many others have there been boy do you know i mean you werent the first were you get out of my way not much longer archie hold your ground and its disintegration time spitting collapse forgetting where he is and what hes here for like we want him to be dont run now archie just round the corner is shangrila that you came for almost at the fingertips almost there to touch theyd all been there boy every grubby finger every sweaty armpit in the movement did you know t h a t hes rising archie the slimed creature forced out of the deep water coming for you archie hold the line sunshine come on archie bloody carpenter from motspur bloody park dont let old harrison down now not when hes flaking not when violets on her back and cold watch him watch the struggle in the shirt the gun comes next youll see the barrel youll see the fist on it and the finger thats lost behind the trigger guard hold the bloody line archie i wouldnt have done what youve done not for a cow like that you know giancarlo you might even have got the scabs from her carpenter laughed out loud shaking in his merriment confronting his fear was laughing as he saw the pistol emerge from behind harrison and be raised at him as fast as a snake strikes he looked into the torture of giancarlos face sucked at the agony well done archie you made it sunshine first time in your bloody life across the finish line and in front ludicrous the look on the kids face the gun was coming something bright with menace from beneath a winter sea the pistol showing sharp and tooled and aiming the one shot the whiplash crack carpenter was on the ground thrown backwards the involuntary reflex cemented and imprinted high on his face was a splitting smile harrison staggered legs weak and resisting his efforts to withstand the weight of the smitten giancarlo dragging down the wire that wrapped their waists blood on harrisons face loose and dripping and a mess of brain matter and no hands free to clear the sheen of destruction from his eyes carboni recoiled from the explosion beside his ear he pivoted towards vellosi gazed at him and saw the grim pleasure spreading like an opening flower on his companions face and then the running men rising from their hidden places careering over fallen branches bullocking through undergrowth carboni joined the herd as if time now were at last special francesco vellosi dropped the rifle barrel with deliberation bent down and picked up the single brass cartridge case and pocketed it he turned and with an easy movement tossed the gun back to its owner the carabinieri sergeant revenge exacted he walked tall and erect towards the huddle that was gathering around geoffrey harrison with a knife a policeman sliced through the flex that held harrison to giancarlo battestini the body of the boy shorn of its support slumped to the ground one half of his face was intact unblemished and waxen the other was obliterated removed as if in tribute to the marksmanship and the brutal power of the high velocity bullet freed rubbing hard at his wrists harrison dived away from his helpers turned his back on them and vomited into the dried grass at the edge of the clearing they gave him room respected him archie carpenter pulled himself to his knees rose unsteadily to his feet and clamped his fingers together to hide the tumult and the shaking that gripped them he stood aside a stranger at a party when harrison came back to the group he spoke simply without idiocy what happened i dont know what happened vellosi pointed across the clearing to carpenter this man was prepared to offer his life for yours he spoke gruffly and then his hand slipped in support to harrisons armpit he gave himself to battestini that you should be saved their eyes met in a fleeting moment then carpenter turned his head from the deep puzzlement of harrisons gaze and seemed to those who watched him to shrug his shoulders as if an episode had ended a man had done his work and needed no praise nor thanks studiously carpenter began to wipe the clinging leaves and sticks from his back and his trousers they moved from the clearing vellosi and harrison setting the slow pace at the front carboni busy and bustling behind them carpenter trailing harrison did not look round for a final glimpse of giancarlos body stumbled away reliant on the help of the hand that helped him they moved at cortege speed and the route along the path was lined with the unsmiling faces of men in uniform who held rifles and submachineguns and did not flinch from the hurt daubed on harrisons face they masked their feelings those who stared because death was recent among the trees and the devastating speed of the violence had stripped from them the elation of victory i didnt understand what he was doing this man carpenter from behind harrisons shoulder carboni spoke he had to get the pistol from your back he had to produce the pistol against himself if your danger were to be taken that was why he taunted the boy he gave the opportunity to francesco francesco had a half face to shoot for that there was the chance was because of carpenter carboni still walking swung his head towards carpenter saw only a shaded half smile a tint of sadness my god god help us harrison walked with his eyes closed led as a blind man on a street pavement he struggled for his words confronting the shock and exhaustion why was another life why was another mans life less important than mine i dont know said carboni get me home please get me to my wife the quick light of warning flashed between the policeman and the head of the antiterrorist squad carboni stopped and grabbed surely for carpenters sleeve and drew him forward the procession had stopped the four men were in a group a huddle of shoulders and those in uniform faded back abandoning them you have something to tell your man archie carboni spoke in a whisper charlesworth can no archie for you it is your work not here archie wriggling sliding in the mud stream seeking to extricate himself and harrison peering into him unshaven face close bad breath reeking come on archie this is what you saved him for this is the moment you preserved him for cant slip the buck to charlesworth cant push it further away its now it has to be said and its you who have to say it its about violet geoffrey carboni and vellosi watched the shame driving up on carpenters face realized the bewilderment creeping again into the man whose arms they held what about her violet im sorry where is she the shriek coming from harrison the embarrassment flowing into vellosi and carboni a sudden coldness from carpenter as if from this came his protection as if his face could be hidden by chilled words shes dead harrison she piled into a lorry last night she was alone vellosi and carboni hurried forward half carrying half dragging the weight of harrison between them carpenter detached himself and hung back nothing more to be said nothing more to be done the speed of the group quickened past the man who stood with the broken shotgun and the small boy past the field hedgerows on down to the road they slid harrison into the back of carbonis car carboni followed him clapped his hands and the driver accelerated away his arm hanging from carpenters shoulder vellosi watched the car spin round the first curve you did well my friend thank you said carpenter
